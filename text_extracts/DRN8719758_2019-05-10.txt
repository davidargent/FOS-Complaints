K821x#15complaint
Miss D complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Miss D has been assisted in making  her complaint by her partner. But for ease I will refer in 
this decision to all communication as having been  with Miss D herself.
Miss D was given 18 loans by QuickQuid between  July 2011 and July 2013. Miss D topped 
up one of her loans by taking some additional  borrowing  shortly  after the original loan. The 
final loan that Miss D took was a FlexCredit loan that provided her with a revolving credit 
facility. All of Miss Ds loans have been fully repaid  and a summary of her borrowing from 
QuickQuid is shown  as an appendix  to this decision.
QuickQuid has said that Miss Ds complaint about the first four loans was made too late. But 
Miss D has since  confirmed  that she no longer wishes to complain about  these  loans. So 
I wont make  any findings in relation to those four loans in this decision. But I will take 
account of them when considering the extent of Miss Ds relationship with QuickQuid.
Miss Ds complaint has been  assessed by one of our adjudicators. He thought that 
QuickQuid shouldnt have  agreed  to lend to Miss D after,  and including,  the sixth loan. So he 
asked QuickQuid to pay Miss D some compensation.
QuickQuid didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Miss D accepts my decision it is legally binding  on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Miss D could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN87197582the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Miss D could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading guidance on Irresponsible Lending 
defines sustainable as being  without undue difficulties and in particular the customer  should  
be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well 
as without having to borrow to meet the repayments.  And it follows  that a lender should 
realise, or it ought  fairly  and reasonably  to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make 
their repayments sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ds complaint.
The first loan I am considering here (loan  5) was relatively modest  compared  to the income 
that Miss D declared to QuickQuid and was smaller than any loan shed taken before. So 
given what Miss D needed to repay on this loan, what  was apparent  about  her 
circumstances at the time, and her history  with the lender, I dont think  it wouldve been  
proportionate for QuickQuid to ask her for the amount of information that would be needed to 
show the lending  was unsustainable.   So I dont think  QuickQuid was wrong  to give this loan 
to Miss D.
But looking  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids  lending history with Miss D I think by loan 6 
the lender should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful. And so QuickQuid should  have realised that it shouldnt  provide any further loans. 
I say this because:
By the time Miss D asked for loan 6 shed been  borrowing  from QuickQuid for almost 
nine months and she wasnt making any inroads  to the amount she owed  the lender. 
The amount she asked to borrow on loan 6 was by far the most  to date. By that time 
Miss D had paid a considerable amount of interest to QuickQuid to effectively service 
a debt over an extended period.
Over  the next five months  Miss D was provided with a new loan typically  within  a few 
days of settling a previous  one. So QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more  
likely than not Miss D was having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying her 
previous loan was leaving  in her finances  and that Miss Ds indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably. 
Ref: DRN87197583Although there were  later some gaps  of up to two or three months  between  Miss D 
repaying a loan and asking to borrow again,  I dont  think it would have been 
reasonable for QuickQuid to conclude this was an indication  that Miss Ds finances 
had moved on from whatever situation  had required her previous loans. 
I think that Miss D lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ds indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Ds 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So I uphold the complaint  about loans 6 to 18 and QuickQuid should put things right.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Miss D after, and including, the loan 
that she took on 3 April 2012  (loan 6). So for each of those loans QuickQuid should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 18 should be removed from Miss Ds 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss D a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I largely uphold  Miss Ds complaint and direct CashEuroNet UK LLC 
to put things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 June 2019.
