The complaint
Mr A is unhappy Barclays Bank UK Plc will not refund the money he lost as the result of an 
authorised push payment (APP) scam. 
What happened
As both parties are familiar with the details of the scam, I will not repeat them here in full. In 
summary, Mr A transferred over £180,000 in multiple faster payments to an account he held 
at a cryptocurrency exchange as set out below.

From there he invested using a trading company (M) that he believed he had been 
introduced to by a well-known social media personality. When he later tried to withdraw his 
funds, but was told he would need to first pay taxes upfront, Mr A realised he had been 
scammed and contacted Barclays.
Mr A says Barclays ought to have protected him from this fraud. He was vulnerable at the 
time following a bereavement and a knee injury that left him housebound.
Barclays initially rejected Mr As claim for a refund saying the transactions were not covered 
by the Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM) as the payments were made to an account 
in Mr As own name. It subsequently refunded £81,835 which was 50% of all payments from 
1 August 2022, plus interest of £3,329. It accepted it should have done more from that date 
as the payments increased in value and frequency. But it thought that Mr A must share 
responsibility for those losses as he did little to check the legitimacy of the investment 
opportunity. 
Unhappy with that refund Mr A brought his complaint to this service.
Our investigator found Barclays response to be fair and reasonable. He agreed that 1 
August 2022 was the point at which Barclays should have intervened. However, he wasnt 
persuaded its intervention would have stopped Mr A from making the payments based on 
how Mr A responded to verification calls it later made. But, accepting Barclays had already 
taken responsibility in part, he felt it was fair for it to refund only 50% of the value as Mr A 
had done things, and omitted to do things, that had undoubtedly contributed to him falling 
victim to the scam. So he was asking Barclays to take no further action.
Mr A disagreed with this assessment and asked for an ombudsmans review. He said the 
bank should have done more to protect him. It should have asked him to come into a branch 
to see an anti-fraud banker, instead they were complacent. The transactions were out of 
character for him. When he reported the scam he felt the bank ought to have supported him 
to maintain contact with the scammer, and so track him down and bring him to justice. In 
addition, his lack of contact with the outside world prevented him from identifying the reality 
of the situation he was in - the bank should have asked if he was vulnerable.
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres no dispute that Mr A made and authorised the payments. Mr A knew who he was
paying, and the reason why. At the stage he was making these payments, he believed
he was transferring funds to his account at a cryptocurrency exchange to then invest via 
company M. I dont dispute Mr A was scammed and he wasnt making payments for the 
reason he thought he was, but I remain satisfied the transactions were authorised under the 
Payment Services Regulations 2017.Its also accepted that Barclays has an obligation to follow Mr As instructions. So in the
first instance Mr A is presumed liable for his losses. But there are other factors that must be
considered.
To reach my decision I have taken into account the law, regulators rules and guidance,
relevant codes of practice and what was good industry practice at the time. To note, as the
payments were to accounts in Mr As name the principles of the Contingent Reimbursement 
Model (CRM) code do not apply in this case.
This means I think that Barclays should have:
been monitoring accounts and payments made or received to counter various
risks, including fraud and scams, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that
might indicate that its customers were at risk of fraud (amongst other things). This is
particularly so given the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years,
which financial institutions are generally more familiar with than the average
customer.
in some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, taken
additional steps or made additional checks before processing a payment, or in some 
cases declined to make a payment altogether, to help protect its customers from the
possibility of financial harm.
In this case, I need to consider whether Barclays acted fairly and reasonably in its dealings 
with Mr A when he made the transfers, or whether it could and should have done more 
before processing them. And specifically for this investigation, given the refund that Barclays 
has already made, I need to decide if that considers all the payments it should - and is it fair 
that Mr A shares the liability.
I agree that payment 22 was the point at which Barclays ought to have intervened. I say this 
as payments 1 to 21 were not out of character for Mr As account. They were to an existing 
payee, not high value for the account, not made in quick succession, and nor did any of 
them drain the account. But when the payment value increased substantially to £8,000 on 1 
August 2022 I think Barclays ought to have intervened. This would not have to have been a 
branch meeting as Mr A suggests, direct contact on the phone could suffice. 
Typically, this finding would mean I need to decide whether or not an effective intervention 
by the bank would have prevented the accountholder from suffering financial harm. But here 
Barclays has already concluded it would have done and so it refunded 50% of the losses 
from that point. 
Therefore, I will focus on assessing whether that split of liability is fair. Ive considered 
carefully whether Mr A should hold some responsibility for his loss by way of contributory 
negligence. I think he should, there are a few reasons for this:
Mr A carried out minimal checks on the investment opportunity  he said he checked 
for online reviews but could not find any, however there are comments online that 
pre-date his payments suggesting company M may be a scam. He seems to have 
been willing to invest significant sums without an appropriate level of due diligence.
Mr A was willing to conceal facts from Barclays when it did call him about later 
payments. He said there was no third-party involved and that he had been 
researching this type of investment over a long period of time and had found 
company M through his own research.The scammer referenced a possible rate and speed of returns that was implausibly 
high and communications were via WhatsApp: these issues ought to have been red 
flags for Mr A.
So I think it is fair that Barclays refunded only 50% of the losses, with interest as we would 
award, from payment 22 onwards.
I have then looked at whether Barclays did what we would expect to try to recover the 
money when Mr A reported the scam. This was on 29 November 2022 so some time after it 
started and Mr A knew he had moved the money on from the beneficiary account Barclays 
had sent it to. I would therefore not reasonably expect Barclays to have successfully 
recovered the money, though I can see it returned the money that was remaining (£166.24) 
to Mr A.
Mr A is unhappy that Barclays didnt do more to track down the scammer when it had the 
opportunity to do so. But I would not see that as the role of the bank, rather a criminal matter 
that the police needed to lead, with the banks co-operation as required. I have seen no 
evidence Barclays failed to co-operate with any investigation into this scam. Finally, Mr A 
explained to this service why he was vulnerable to the time of the scam and says the bank 
did not take this into account. But I have seen no evidence that the bank was on notice of  
Mr As vulnerabilities at the time, nor of how they were impacting his money management, 
so this does not change my conclusion. 
In the round, this means I am not instructing Barclays to refund any more money to Mr A. 
This is a difficult decision to make, Im sorry Mr A lost a considerable amount of money 
which was very distressing for him. I can understand why he would like to be compensated 
for all his losses. And I do accept Mr A has fallen victim to a sophisticated scam. But I can 
only consider whether the bank, which had no involvement in the scam itself, should be held 
responsible, beyond the extent it has already accepted, for what happened.
And for the reasons set out above I find the refund Barclays has already paid Mr A to be a 
fair settlement.
My final decision
I am not upholding Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2024.
