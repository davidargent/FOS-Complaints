October 2015. Mr Ds borrowing history is as follows:

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ds complaint and thought  the loans from loan 2 onwards 
shouldnt have been given as Mr D had loans  from other short-term lenders. Peachy 
disagreed but offered to uphold Mr Ds complaint about loans 5 and 6. Mr D declined  
Peachys offer so, the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Peachy needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr D 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. In the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  
less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Peachy should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN99010972There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Peachy was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint. Having done  so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Peachy  needed to more when it approved  loan 1. Mr D didnt 
respond to the view.  As there is no dispute  with the adjudicators opinion  about  this loan, I 
wont be making further findings on it.
Peachy says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 2 to Mr D and the results of these 
checks didnt raise  any concerns. But as this loan was for a much  larger  amount than Mr Ds 
first loan with Peachy,  I think it should have been looking to build a clearer  picture about    
Mr Ds finances before lending him this loan. 
Had Peachy carried  out proportionate checks before lending loan 2, its likely to have found 
that Mr D was borrowing  from other short-term lenders and was in arrears on some  of those 
loans. The repayments for these loans  would have been increasing his monthly outgoings 
and given the amount Mr D was expected to repay  for loan 2 its likely Mr Ds indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably. 
Additionally, I think the fact Mr D repaid his first loan earlier than planned should have 
caused some concern  to Peachy. As that might be the sort of behaviour that would indicate  
someone was facing problems managing their money and needing to refinance loans on a 
regular basis. 
putting things right  what Peachy needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr D paid on loans 2 to 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Ds credit file in relation to loans 2 
to 6. 
Ref: DRN99010973                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Peachy to take off tax from this interest.  Peachy must  give Mr D 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ds complaint. Cash  On Go Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 March 2020.
