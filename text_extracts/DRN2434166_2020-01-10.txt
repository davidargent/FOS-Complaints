K821x#15complaint
Mr P complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) have restricted  his personal 
account with them and withheld his funds.
background
I issued a provisional decision in this case on 26 November 2019. Ive attached a copy  to 
this decision. It set out my provisional conclusions.  
PayPal accepted my decision. Mr P thought the provisional decision was disappointing  as it 
took a purely black and white legal stance whereas he was arguing PayPals laws were 
unjust, punitive  and an abuse of power. He thought the decision had looked beyond that or 
decided to ignore  it. He said he was giving up as he had no chance  against corporate law 
and the system as a whole.
The case  has come  back to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done  so, Ive reached  the same  
conclusions as I did in my provisional  decision.
Ive looked at everything in the case afresh before reaching an independent view. I want to 
confirm to Mr P Ive understood and looked into all of the points he raised in his submissions 
to this service nothing  has been  ignored or looked  beyond. But its important to point out 
the role of the Financial Ombudsman  Service is one of an informal dispute resolution  
service. Were here to resolve  individual  complaints  and to award redress  where appropriate 
if theres been a mistake  by the business. I do not perform the role of the industry  regulator  
and I do not have the power to make  rules for financial businesses or to punish them.
Neither party have  sent any new evidence or made any new points. So, although  Im sorry to 
learn of Mr Ps sentiments theres  nothing before me which changes my initial conclusions 
and I dont see any reason to alter my view.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 February  2020.

complaint
Mr P complains PayPal  Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) have restricted his personal account  with 
them and withheld  his funds.
background
Mr P brought  this complaint to us as he was unhappy with the response hed received  form PayPal  
when hed complained about the restrictions on both his business and personal accounts. 
On 14 May 2019 PayPal  placed a permanent  restriction  on Mr Ps business account saying  it was 
deemed to be in violation of their Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for the sale of illegal  drugs and 
paraphernalia namely  CBD vaporizers. PayPal said another account  was highly  linked to this 
business account,  which  was Mr Ps personal account. They told him this personal account would 
also be permanently  limited  due to the high level of risk posed to PayPal. And they told him they may 
hold funds in the personal account for up to 180 days. That period expired on 10 November  2019.
Mr P told us he accepted the closure of his business  account but he strongly  opposed and felt 
exploited by how PayPal  had treated his personal  account  and his funds  as a result of his business 
account. He thought PayPals actions were disproportionately punitive  considering the grey legal  area 
his business was working in.
Whilst accepting that within their terms PayPal could restrict or a close an account  if they wished  to 
our investigator went  on to consider whether  those  terms were clear  and if PayPals actions  are fair. 
And in this instance she found PayPal hadnt made their terms  clear to its customers. She found 
based on the information PayPal had provided  she didnt think theyd  given enough  evidence to 
support why Mr P has broken their terms. So she thought it was unfair  for his personal account  to be 
restricted. She recommended PayPal removed the restriction on Mr Ps personal  account and paid Mr 
P Â£100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused.
Mr P accepted the view but PayPal didnt. They felt it was contradictory to find it unfair  to penalize  Mr 
P with action on his personal account for something he wasnt aware  of (on his business  account) 
when hed openly admitted selling  products which  PayPal said were prohibited under their terms of 
use. They  said, although  CBD products may be legal  under  UK law, when  a user created a PayPal 
account they did so agreeing  to their terms. They said should  a user disagree  with the User 
Agreement they may terminate their account at any stage. And PayPal said whilst it is not possible to 
list ever individual product  prohibited by their service these were grouped  into general headings.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Im grateful  to Mr P for confirming that, although  he felt there were  
grounds to complain about his business  account,  this complaint was only about the unfair  treatment of 
his personal  account and the withholding of the funds in that account. And for confirming  hes now 
been able to access his funds.
Our investigator thought we should uphold  this complaint  as there was a lack of clarity in the terms of 
PayPals User  Agreement as to what constitutes a prohibited activity for the business  account. And 
she thought that had resulted in unfair action being taken on Mr Ps personal  account. Although Im 
not asked to look at the business account our investigators reasoning for upholding this complaint is 
a lack of clarity in the terms of PayPals User Agreement as to what constitutes  a prohibited activity. 
She couldnt  say the sale of CBD products fell in line with the Prohibited Activities based on the UK 
law. And she thought if PayPal were referring  to USA laws they should have been clearer. She 
pointed out that PayPal had referred to the sale of cigarettes  as a Prohibited  Activity, so, if there were  
any issues with the sale of vapes or CBD, PayPal shouldve added those to their terms to. I dont 
agree with that analysis. But even if I did, I dont think it would make any difference to the outcome of 
this compliant as I think Mr P was in breach of the AUP for other reasons. Ill explain why. 
Ref: DRN24341664Mr Ps business sells CBD products. But he says, as those products are legal in the UK and not 
considered a controlled substance,  he didnt appreciate their sale was prohibited by the User 
Agreement. I dont doubt that was a genuine mistake on his part. But Ive taken  a look at Mr Ps 
website and it seems clear  to me the products  hes selling are also e cigarettes   both the pens and 
the liquids. Although theyre not listed under  PayPals  AUP as Prohibited Activities  they are listed as 
Activities Requiring Approval within the AUP. So I think the need for Mr P to get approval from 
PayPal for selling these items is clearly set out in the AUP and something which he ought reasonably 
to have been  aware of.
Theres nothing in the information  before  me at the moment to show that Mr P had such approval  from 
PayPal. So, it seems  to me, that Mr Ps business account was in breach of the AUP - albeit for not 
seeking approval  for the sale of e cigarettes rather  than being involved in a restricted or prohibited  
activity. 
The information PayPal  have sent this service satisfies me theyre able to restrict an account  they 
consider to be linked to another one thats engaged in restricted  activities.  At Section 9.1 it states an 
account is deemed to be linked where PayPal has reason to believe they are controlled  by the same 
legal personality. including individuals. Theres  no dispute  here that both accounts were controlled 
by Mr P. So, I cant agree PayPal did anything wrong  when they suspended Mr Ps personal account.
On the evidence  presently  before me, I cant agree with the investigators reasoning or her findings 
about the terms not being  clear and her finding of unfairness about  the restriction of the personal 
account. At this stage, I cant say PayPal did anything wrong when they restricted either  of Mr Ps 
accounts and withheld  his funds. But Ill consider any further information  either  party  wish to send me 
before making a final decision.
my provisional  decision
My provisional  decision  is that, subject to anything further that Mr P or PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCA send me by 26 December 2019, Im planning not to uphold this complaint.
