The complaint
Mr T complains that American Express Services Europe Limited wont pay him the 
compensation that hes claimed for damage to his car that occurred when he was staying at 
a hotel. 
What happened
Mr T used a charge card provided by American Express to pay £302.36 in December 2019 
for a stay in a hotel. His car was damaged when he was staying at the hotel. He made a 
claim to American Express in June 2020 under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
It said that for a claim under section 75 to be considered, goods must be purchased (at least 
in part) using credit but Mr T had paid for the hotel using a charge card. It also considered 
whether a chargeback claim could be made but, as his claim was made over 120 days after 
the payment, its right to make a chargeback claim had expired (it also said that a 
chargeback cant be utilised for compensation in the manner sought by Mr T and that legal 
claims against a merchant fall outside the scope of the chargeback process).
Mr T wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He said that Mr Ts charge card wasnt a 
regulated consumer credit agreement which meant that section 75 doesnt apply so he didnt 
think that American Express had acted unfairly in not considering Mr Ts claim. He was 
satisfied that more than 120 days had passed from the date of the transaction and he didnt 
think that a longer time period for raising a chargeback applied (and he was satisfied that, 
even if the claim was within the time limits for making a chargeback, it was highly unlikely 
that a claim would have succeeded).
Mr T has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He has responded to 
our investigators recommendations in detail and has explained why he considers that his 
claim should be considered under section 75. He says, in summary and amongst other 
things, that his charge card is linked to his credit card, it was the hotels error that the charge 
was made to the wrong card and it has reversed the original charge to his charge card and 
debited it from his credit card, that it would be fair and reasonable to consider the intent in 
this case and that, on a balance of probabilities, its more likely than not that he wanted to 
pay using his credit card. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
American Express has provided the account statement for Mr Ts charge card which 
shows that he made the payment of £302.36 to the hotel in December 2019 using his 
charge card;
American Express has explained that the charge card isnt a credit card so doesnt 
benefit from the protections contained in section 75 and I agree that section 75 only 
applies to payments made using credit;
Im not persuaded that Mr Ts charge card and credit card are linked in any way that 
would cause the payments made on the charge card to be considered to be credit or 
to be covered by section 75;
Mr T has explained that he intended to make the payment using a credit card, he 
says that it was the hotels error that caused the payment to be charged to his charge 
card and that it has reversed the original charge to his charge card and debited it 
from his credit card  but Im satisfied that the payment was made using his charge 
card (even if the payment has since been applied to his credit card) and Im not 
persuaded that he made the payment to the hotel using credit or that it would be fair 
or reasonable in these circumstances to expect American Express to accept a claim 
under section 75 relating to the payment that he made to the hotel;
American Express also considered whether a chargeback claim could be made but 
said that it received his claim over 120 days after the payment was made so its right 
to make a chargeback claim had expired;
the payment to the hotel was made in December 2019 and Mr T didnt make a claim 
to American Express until June 2020  that was more than 120 days after the 
payment had been made and the services had been provided to him  Im not 
persuaded that a longer time period was applicable in these circumstances and I 
consider that the time period in which a chargeback claim had expired by the time 
that Mr T made a claim to American Express;
I consider that American Express has responded to Mr Ts claim correctly and Im not 
persuaded that he had a claim under section 75 or that it was able to make a 
chargeback claim; and
I sympathise with Mr T for the issues that hes been caused by the damage to his 
car, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require American Express to refund the payment of £302.36 to Mr Ts account, to pay 
him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2021.
