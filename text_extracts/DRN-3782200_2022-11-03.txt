The complaint
Ms O, through a representative complains that Morses Club PLC (Morses) didnt carry out
proportionate affordability checks before it granted her loans.
What happened
Morses, initially said it had only advanced three home collected loans between
December 2020 and June 2021. Ive included some of the information weve received about
these loans in the table below.

2 £300.00 04/05/2021 outstanding 34 £15
3 £500.00 01/06/2021 outstanding 35 £25
Ms O has had some problems repaying her final two loans, and as of June 2022, Morses
statement of account shows there is a total outstanding balance of £845.
The weekly repayment column in the table above is the cost per week per loan. Where
loans overlapped the cost per week was increased, for example when loans 1 and 2 were
running at the same time Ms Os weekly commitment to Morses was £30.
Following Ms Os complaint Morses wrote to her representative to explain that it wasnt going
to uphold her complaint. Ms Os representative then referred the complaint to the Financial
Ombudsman Service.
An adjudicator reviewed the complaint and she didnt uphold it. She concluded it was
reasonable for loans one and two to be provided. The adjudicator did conclude that perhaps
by loan three further checks may have been needed but she hadnt seen anything to make
her think the complaint should be upheld.
Ms Os representative responded to the assessment with the following;
Our client does not accept this decision and would like the Ombudsman to look and
this and give a final decision.
The case was then passed to an ombudsman to decide. However, after the complaint was
referred for a decision, further enquires were made with Morses, at which point further loans
were identified as being lent to Ms O.
I have put together a new loan table below which includes, as far as we are aware Ms Os
total lending history. Ive used the same loan numbers as Morses has done in the
spreadsheet it provided.

Given the loan numbers provided to the Financial Ombudsman by Morses there must have
been a further two loans before loan three. But as neither party has any further information
about those loans, I cant consider them as part of this decision.
Ms O has had some problems repaying loan 20 as well as loans 22 and 23. Morses has 
shown from its statement of account that the balance was sold to a third-party collection 
agency in November 2018.
In additional, loan seven in the table above, wasnt a home collected loan. It was a Morses
Club Card  which attached a variable rate of interest. My understanding of this product is
that it was in effect a flexible credit facility. However, looking at the statement of account,
while it seems that Ms O held the facility for nearly a year it seems there was only one
drawdown on 8 December 2011 and then this was repaid / refunded on 25 January 2012. 
After this date, there doesnt appear to be any further drawdowns on this facility.
Ive kept this in mind when thinking about the overall lending relationship.
There is a gap in lending of over two years between loans 20 being sold to a third party and
when loan 21 was advanced. In my view, this gap is significant enough to have broken the
chain of lending, meaning there are two chains. Ive therefore in this provisional decision
considered that there were two chains of lending, loans 1  20 and loans 21 - 23.
The complaint was then passed to me. I issued my provisional decision explaining the 
reasons why I was intending to partly uphold Ms Os complaint. A copy of the provisional 
findings follows this and form part of this final decision.
What I said in my provisional decisionIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about this type of lending - including all
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Morses had to assess the lending to check if Ms O could afford to pay back the amounts
shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was
proportionate to the circumstances. Morses checks couldve taken into account a number of
different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and
Ms Os income and expenditure.
With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks
might have been proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Morses should have done
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Ms O. These factors include:
Ms O having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Ms O having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms O coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid
(also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms O.
Morses was required to establish whether Ms O could sustainably repay the loans  not just
whether she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money
to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Ms O was able to repay her
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue
difficulties and in particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and
without having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further,
then it follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and
thought about what this means for Ms Os complaint.
Loans 3 -9
For these loans it is likely that Morses made enquires with Ms O to find out what her weekly
income and expenditure was. But Morses hasnt provided the details Ms O gave it. This
could be down to a number of reasons but the most likely, is due to the passage of time, as
these loans were approved up to 12 years. So, I dont consider it unreasonable or unusual
that this information may no longer be available. This means I dont know what it knew about
Ms Os income or expenditure details.
In addition, Ms O hasnt provided any details about her financial position at the time these
loans were approved. Given, the lack of information I cant fairly come to the conclusion that Morses 
did something wrong when it advanced these loans, so I cant uphold Ms Os complaint about them.
Loans 10  20
In addition to looking at the checks that Morses did Ive also looked at the overall pattern of
Morses lending history with Ms O, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Morsesshould reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.
And so Morses should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Ms Os case, I think that this point was reached by
loan 10. I say this because:
At this point Morses ought to have realised Ms O was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Ms O had taken out eight loans in this chain of lending in 18 months. So 
Morses ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms O was having to borrow 
further to cover a long-term short fall in her living costs.
By approving loan 10, Ms O now owed Morses £947 in capital and interest, this was the 
largest amount Ms O had owed Morses to date and at this point in time with loan 10 Ms O had 
three loans running concurrently  the most shed had to date.
From the first loan in this chain onwards, Ms O was generally provided with a new loan on the 
same day a previous loan was repaid and at times had a number of loans running at the same 
time. To me, this is a sign that Ms O was using these loans to fill a long-term gap in her income 
rather than as a short-term need.
Over the course of the lending relationship, there wasnt as far as I can see a 
sustained decrease in Ms Os indebtedness or weekly repayments.
Ms O wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Morses. Loan 20 was taken out 
nearly seven years after Ms Os first loan based information which has been provided. This 
loan was also twice as large as Ms Os first loan. Ms O had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service a debt to Morses over an extended period.
Ms O also has obvious repayment problems repaying some of these loans, for example it took 
Ms O more than twice as long to repay loans 13, 14 and 15 than she was contracted to. The 
fact she had problems repaying several loans indicates she couldnt afford them, and the 
loans werent sustainable.
I think that Ms O lost out when Morses provided loans 10 - 20 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Os indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Ms O borrowed was likely to
have had negative implications on Ms Os ability to access mainstream credit and so
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
Loans 21  23
As Ive said above, there is a significant gap between loan 20 being passed to a third-party
collection agency until when she returned for loan 21. I think, in those circumstances it is fair
for Morses to have treated loan 21 as the first loan in a new chain. This does have
implications for the type and level checks Morses may need to do, in order to have carried
out a proportionate check before it approved these loans.
For these loans, Morses has shown that it asked Ms O for details of her income and
expenditure. Her income for each loan was £356. With her declared weekly expenditure
around £230 per week for loan 21, around £200 per week for loan 22 and £275 for loan 23.
Based solely on her income and expenditure information Morses couldve been confident
Ms O would be able to comfortably afford the repayments she was committed to making of
no more than £40 per week.
Morses also carried out a credit check when loan 21 was approved, and a copy of those
results have been supplied to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Having reviewed the
results, I am concerned about the information Morses was provided with and I dont think it
reacted appropriately. A summary of what Ive seen can be found below.
£9,414 of existing debt.
Three defaults with one having been settled. The most recent default was recorded
some two years before loan 21 was advanced.
Five accounts in delinquency  this is the stage where payments had been missedbut not a sufficient number to lead to a default. The most recent account had entered
delinquency the month before loan 21.
Ms O had a history of taking out home credit loans, with 14 such loans being
advanced with the previous 12 months and 2 in the last 3 months.
The results are concerning because it shows, to me because it was showing a picture of
someone who was having current and immediate repayment problems with other credit
given how recently the last credit account had entered into delinquency. In addition, there
were also signs that Ms O had been a regular user of home credit (from other provider(s))
within the last year. I think that may have led Morses to question whether it really knew
enough about Ms Os financial circumstances.
Therefore, given what the credit results show, Im intending to conclude that the checks
Morses carried out before these loans were approved wasnt sufficient. Instead, I think it
needed to gain a full understanding of Ms Os actual financial position to ensure this loan
was affordable. This couldve been done in several ways, such as asking for evidence of her
outgoings, or looking at her bank statements.
The further checks mightve helped verify what Ms O had declared and provided and
revealed whether there was any other information that Morses mightve needed to consider
about Ms Os general financial position given the results of the credit check.
However, that isnt the end of the matter. For me to be able to uphold this loan, I have to be
satisfied that had Morses carried out a proportionate check it wouldve likely discovered that
Ms O couldnt afford these loans.
However, neither Ms O nor her representative has provided any details of her actual living
costs at the time either through bank statements or a full credit report. I therefore, cant fairly
conclude what further checks may have shown Morses about Ms Os finances. As this is the
case, I cant uphold Ms Os complaint about these loans.
Overall, Im intending to uphold Ms Os complaint about loans 10  20 only.
Response to the provisional decision
Both Morses and Ms O were asked to provide anything further for consideration as soon as 
possible, but no later than 1 November 2022. 
Ms Os representative emailed to confirm it accepted the provisional decision. 
Morses also emailed to confirm it was accepting the findings in the provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has anything further to add and both Morses and Ms Os representative 
accepted the findings in the provisional decision. I see no reason to depart from the findings 
I previously made.
I still dont think Morses ought to have approved loans 10  20 for Ms O because these loans 
werent sustainable for her. 
Ive outline below what Morses needs to do in order to put things right for Ms O. Putting things right
In deciding what redress Morses should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it not provided loans 10 - 20 to Ms O, as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms O may have simply left matters there, not
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere. If this wasnt a viable option, she may have
looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how she would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Ms O in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Ms O would more likely than not have taken up any one of these
options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Morses liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
Morses shouldnt have provided loans 10  20.
If Morses has sold the outstanding debt Morses should buy it back if Morses is able to do so
and then take the following steps. If Morses is not able to buy the debts back then Morses
should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A. Morses should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms O towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything Morses have already refunded.
B. Morses should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms 
O which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms O originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Morses should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Ms O as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Ms O 
having made overpayments then Morses should refund these overpayments with 8% 
simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments 
would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Morses should then refund 
the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D. If there is still an outstanding balance due for loans 20, 22 and 23, then the amounts 
calculated in A and B should be used to repay any balance remaining on 
outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus, then the surplus should be paid to Ms 
O. However, if there is still an outstanding balance then Morses should try to agree 
an affordable repayment plan with Ms O.
E. The overall pattern of Ms Os borrowing for loans 10  20 means any information 
recorded about it is adverse, so Morses should remove these loans entirely from 
Ms Os credit file. Morses do not have to remove loan 20 from Ms Os credit file until 
these have been repaid, but Morses should still remove any adverse information 
recorded about those loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to deduct tax from this interest. Morses should
give Ms O a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted if she asks for one.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in the provisional decision, Im upholding Ms Os 
complaint in part.
Morses Club PLC should put things right for Ms O as directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms O to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2022.
