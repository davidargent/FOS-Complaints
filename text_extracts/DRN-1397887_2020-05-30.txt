Mr H said his credit file showed a pattern of sustained borrowing and shouldve prompted 
MoneyBoat to make additional enquiries before lending to him. Mr H didn't feel that 
MoneyBoat did enough checks before lending to him.
When Mr H complained to MoneyBoat it didn't agree that it had done anything wrong but it 
made a goodwill offer to reduce the amount Mr H still owed.
Mr H didn't feel this offer went far enough and he brought his complaint to us.
Our adjudicator felt that MoneyBoat shouldnt have provided any of the loans to Mr H given 
that the checks MoneyBoat did showed that Mr H was repaying multiple loans with other 
short-term lenders at the time. So it wasnt likely that Mr H wouldve been able to sustainably 
repay loan 1  or any subsequent loans. 
And by the time he took out loan 5, our adjudicator felt that Mr Hs overall pattern of 
borrowing suggested hed become persistently reliant on short-term loans. 
Our adjudicator set out the steps he said MoneyBoat should take to put things right for Mr H 
 which went beyond what MoneyBoat had previously offered to do. MoneyBoat mainly said it did proportionate checks  and that whilst we might say it 
should've looked at all the information it had, MoneyBoat said it was impractical to review 
every line of a credit file for every loan. MoneyBoat told us that in the early stages of a 
lending relationship its processes are automated.
MoneyBoat has asked for a review so this complaint comes to me to make a final decision. 
What I've decided - and why 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income) 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
MoneyBoat was required to establish whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
MoneyBoat asked Mr H to provide details of his income and to tell MoneyBoat what he 
normally spent each month. Looking at what MoneyBoat knew about Mr Hs income and 
expenditure, Mr H appeared to have more than £600 of disposable income when he was 
applying for loan 1 and hed mentioned spending around £225 on other credit. 
But that information was clearly at odds with the information shown on its credit checks that 
MoneyBoat sent to us. I think its fair to say that MoneyBoat could see that Mr H had been 
relying significantly on short term loans, including payday loans, for some time. 
And MoneyBoat could see from the credit checks it did that Mr H had multiple other short 
term high cost loans outstanding when he asked to borrow loan 1 from MoneyBoat. 
This type of borrowing is intended to provide a short term fix in the event of temporary 
money problems. So I think the information MoneyBoat had gathered about Mr Hs credit 
history shouldve made MoneyBoat realise that it looked like Mr H was having problems 
managing his money. 
Ive carefully considered what MoneyBoat has said about this. But I think that as it had 
information that showed the extent of Mr Hs other short term borrowing this should 
reasonably have led MoneyBoat to the conclusion that the information Mr H had provided 
about his finances was highly inaccurate and that it was likely that Mr H was facing serious 
problems managing his money.
I dont think it was reasonable for MoneyBoat to conclude that it was likely that Mr H would 
be able to repay loan 1, or any subsequent loan, in a sustainable way. 
The fact that MoneyBoat did in fact decline a number of other loan applications made by 
Mr H doesn't mean that the loans it did provide were affordable and fairly loaned to him. For 
the reasons I've explained, I dont think MoneyBoat shouldve granted any of Mr Hs loan 
applications.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of MoneyBoats lending history with Mr H, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which MoneyBoat should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable or otherwise harmful. 
Like our adjudicator, by loan 5, I think MoneyBoat shouldve realised that it was clear from 
looking at Mr Hs borrowing history that he was likely becoming over-reliant on this sort of 
borrowing. 
I say this because:
Mr H wasnt managing to repay his loans sustainably  hed first borrowed from 
MoneyBoat around 21 months earlier and he was now asking to borrow again. 
 
the loan amounts went up and down  but this record of borrowing doesnt suggest 
that Mr H was asking to borrow because of a new need for a short term loan. Rather, I think this indicated that overall his financial circumstances hadnt improved and the 
signs were that he was struggling with debt
 
loan 5 was the biggest loan Mr H had taken out  and he arranged it to start on the 
same day that he paid the previous loan  
 
MoneyBoat shouldve realised this pattern of lending indicated that Mr H had become 
dependent on taking out short term high cost loans and that his borrowing had now 
become unsustainable   
 
I think that Mr H lost out when MoneyBoat provided loan 5 because:
this loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time 
 
by now, the length of time Mr H had been borrowing was likely to impact adversely 
on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept Mr H in the market for high-
cost loans. By loan 5 this borrowing was likely to be detrimental to Mr Hs credit 
rating. 
 
Putting things right  what MoneyBoat should do
If MoneyBoat has sold the outstanding debts it should buy these back before doing what I 
have outlined below. If MoneyBoat isnt able to buy the debts back then it should liaise with 
the new debt owner to achieve the following:
 
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr H towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything it 
has already refunded.
 
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr H which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr H originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
 
C. Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding 
loans and treat any repayments made by Mr H as though they had been repayments 
of the principal. If this results in Mr H having made overpayments then these should 
be refunded with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. MoneyBoat 
should then refund the amounts calculated in "A" and "B" and move to step "E".
 
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in "A" and "B" 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans and any 
principal already written-off. If this results in a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Mr H. However if there is still an outstanding balance then MoneyBoat should try to 
agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr H. 
 
E. Remove all adverse entries from Mr Hs credit file for loans 1- 4. The length of time 
Mr H had been borrowing when he took out loan 5 means any information recorded 
about this loan is adverse. So all entries about loan 5 should be removed from Mr Hs 
credit file.
 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part and direct Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as 
MoneyBoat) to take the steps set out above to put things right for Mr H.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 June 2020.
