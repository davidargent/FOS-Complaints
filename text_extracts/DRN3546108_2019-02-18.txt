K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that Barclays  Bank  UK PLC has wrongly charged a higher rate of interest  
than agreed on a loan and has extended the term of another loan without his consent.
background
In 2007 Mr C took out a commercial loan for £300,000 to be repaid over 15 years. The 
interest rate was fixed  for the first ten years. At the same time he took out a variable rate 
loan for £100,000 to be repaid over five years.
In 2017 Mr C complained  to Barclays  that hed been  charged interest on the £300,000 loan 
at 8.55% and not 7.6% as stated in the facility letter. In response, the bank  said there had 
been a facility letter in March 2007  which offered the loan at 7.6% but Mr C didnt take up the 
loan within  the 30-day  period in which it was valid. A second  facility letter  was issued four 
months later, by which  time interest rates had risen, and on 7 July 2007 Mr C signed the 
agreement for a loan with a fixed rate of 8.55%. The bank provided copies of the letters.
Mr C didnt agree with the bank and referred his complaint to us. He said he had no record 
or recollection of the second facility  letter.
Mr C also said he had never  been sent a formal offer for the £100,000 loan and hed 
originally assumed it was to be repaid  over 15 years, until Barclays recently  produced 
documentation showing  it was for five years. However, Mr C said that if it was for five years, 
then it should  have been paid off by now.
Barclays said that in 2008, Mr C had asked for the five-year term of the £100,000 loan to be 
extended to match the term of the £300,000 loan. A letter of variation was issued extending 
the term of the loan and reducing the monthly  payments,  and Mr C signed it in February 
2008. The bank  provided a copy of the signed letter.
Mr C said he fully believes and suspects that the letters produced  in evidence by the bank 
have only existed since he started looking into the matter in 2017.
Our adjudicator investigated the case. He didnt recommend  that the complaint should be 
upheld. He gave  these reasons, in summary:
In his view, the evidence  provided  by the bank clearly shows  why the interest rate on 
the £300,000 loan increased to the new rate of 8.55% from the original rate of 7.6% 
that was discussed in March 2007.
In order for the £300,000 loan to proceed  after the first facility letter  expired,  Mr C 
would have had to sign a new facility letter.
The evidence provided by Barclays also shows the term of the £100,000 loan was 
agreed as five years at the outset but was extended in 2008 to match the other loan.
Having looked  at the signatures on the letters,  he was of the view that theres a 
reasonable similarity between them all. He was unable to conclude that the 
signatures werent provided by Mr C.
Mr C didnt agree with the adjudicators  conclusions. He made these points, in summary:
Ref: DRN35461082He maintains a file with all Barclays  communications in it. The document  with the 
revised interest rate for the £300,000 loan is simply not there,  but the original facility 
letter is.
The bank  found the revised document in deep archive after a drawn  out period. 
Surely the current document should  easily be to hand and any superseded document 
would be more  likely to be archived.
Talking totally hypothetically, if a person or organisation  was to conveniently produce 
a document to fit a particular circumstance, say a document  that should  have  existed 
but due to some error never did, would that person or organisation use a copy of a 
signature that was on file and readily available, or just any random one or an X?
Mr Cs own correspondence file reveals  the original facility  letter  for the £100,000 
loan, but no notice of variation  it is the very existence of this document  that is at 
issue. To his mind,  the fact that the signature is similar to his is totally  irrelevant 
unless witnessed  by an independent  third party.
Both issues have a common theme.  Its difficult to accept  that his memory of the 
events and his files of Barclays documents are both in error.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done that, Im sorry  to tell Mr C 
that Ive come to the same conclusions as the adjudicator and largely for the same reasons.
Barclays has provided copies of documents, signed by Mr C, showing the following:
Mr C was offered a £300,000 loan in March  2007. The facility letter, signed by Mr C, 
said the interest rate would initially be fixed at 7.6% provided the loan was taken up 
within 30 days of the letter.  It also said that the bank  would  advise Mr C of the 
revised rate if the loan wasnt taken up in that period. (Mr C accepts the authenticity 
of this letter and there  was a copy in his correspondence file.)
The £300,000  loan wasnt drawn down  within  30 days and Mr C was offered revised 
terms in July 2007. The revised  facility  letter, signed by Mr C, said the interest  rate 
would initially be fixed at 8.55%. (Mr C disputes  the authenticity of this letter.)
Mr C was offered a variable rate loan of £100,000 in July 2007, to be repaid in ten 
years. He signed the facility letter at the time. (Mr C originally told us he totally 
unaware of this letter but now says there  was a copy in his correspondence file.)
In 2008 the bank  offered to extend the repayment term of the £100,000 loan. It 
issued a letter of variation  which extended  the loan to 2022 and reduced the monthly  
repayment. Mr C signed the letter in agreement. (Mr C disputes the authenticity of 
this letter.)
Mr C says he doesnt recall the second facility letter for the £300,000 loan or the letter  of 
variation extending the £100,000  loan,  and he has no copies in his files. He believes  the 
bank has manufactured  these, after his recent enquiries, to cover  up its failings. 
Ref: DRN35461083I dont doubt the sincerity  of Mr Cs recollections,  or the general  efficiency  of his filing. But I 
do think that he is mistaken and that somehow, a decade after the events in question, some 
papers have been mislaid or lost from his file of Barclays documents.  Ill explain why Ive 
reached those conclusions.
Im not a handwriting expert, but it seems to me that the signatures  on the letters  contested 
by Mr C match those on the letters that he agrees are genuine, and I have  no reason  other 
than Mr Cs doubts  to believe they were  forged by bank staff. 
But in any event, the evidence from the letters that Mr C accepts as genuine supports the 
banks version of events:
The original facility  letter for the £300,000 loan said that the bank would set a new 
interest rate if the loan wasnt taken up within 30 days. The original letter was signed 
by Mr C in March  2007, but the loan wasnt taken up until July (this is confirmed in 
the loan account statement). As this was more than 30 days  later, the offer of the first 
interest rate would have lapsed,  under the terms of the letter that Mr C accepts as 
genuine. So I would expect the bank  to have issued a second  facility letter  with a new 
interest rate. I note the Bank of England base rate had risen twice  between March 
and July 2007, so it isnt surprising that Barclays set a higher rate in July. 
The facility letter for the £100,000 loan (which Mr C accepts as genuine)  said the 
monthly repayments were  to be £2,029.33.  And Mr Cs actual monthly  repayments  
were initially  £2,029.33. But in March 2008,  the actual repayments suddenly  dropped  
to £924.93. I would expect the repayments to have continued in line with the facility 
letter, unless there was a letter of variation. The date of the letter of variation now 
supplied by the bank (whose authenticity  Mr C disputes)  was 15 February 2008, 
which was just over two weeks before the monthly repayment was reduced. Without 
the letter of variation,  there would be no explanation  for the reduction.
Having looked  at all the evidence and arguments, I believe that Mr C and Barclays  agreed 
the fixed rate for the £300,000 loan in July 2007 at 8.55%, and agreed in February  2008  to 
extend the term of the £100,000 loan by letter of variation.
I realise that Mr C will be disappointed by my decision. He strongly believes that the bank 
changed things  without his consent. But I dont agree. For all the reasons Ive given, Im 
satisfied that the banks  version of events  fits with the available  evidence.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 March  2019.
