The complaint
Mrs B complains that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont refund to her the money that she paid 
for a holiday club membership. Shes being represented in her complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mrs B signed a purchase agreement in April 2016 to buy some holiday club membership 
points. The purchase price of the points was £5,940 and Mrs B also entered into a fixed sum 
loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank for a loan of that amount. She agreed to make 120 
monthly repayments of £94.39 to Shawbrook Bank.
Mrs B complained to Shawbrook Bank in December 2019 about the way that the loan was 
sold to her as shes a vulnerable person and she didnt receive a care call. It responded in 
detail to her complaint and said that it was unable to conclude that her complaint should be 
upheld. It said that all appropriate checks were undertaken to ensure that the loan was 
suitable and affordable for Mrs B and that a care call was attempted but she was 
unattainable.
Mrs Bs representative made a detailed complaint to this service, on behalf of Mrs B, in June 
2020 in which it said, in summary and amongst other things, that:
there had been misrepresentations by the holiday company;
Mrs B wasnt asked for her recollections as part of Shawbrook Banks investigations 
into her complaint;
no checks seemed to have been undertaken by Shawbrook Bank to determine if the 
loan was right or appropriate for Mrs B, she didnt need the loan and shed paid for 
other memberships without needing a loan;
no assessment of her credit worthiness was made;
a care call was an underwriting condition of the loan but no details of the care call 
that was attempted were provided and, given Mrs Bs age, there were serious failings 
by Shawbrook Bank which created an unfair relationship; and 
Mrs B was asked to sign the partner checklist and customer compliance checklist 
during a lengthy and pressurised sales meeting.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Bs complaint should be upheld. She didnt think 
that there had been a breach of contract by the holiday company or that the relationship 
between Mrs B and Shawbrook Bank was unfair. She said that she hadnt seen anything 
persuasive to suggest that Shawbrook Banks lending to Mrs B was unaffordable for her.
Mrs Bs representative has asked, on her behalf, for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has provided information about Mrs Bs age, personal circumstances and 
medical issues and says that she had limited financial literacy. It says that fraudulent 
misrepresentations were made to Mrs B by the holiday company, including that the loan was 
interest free for five years, the membership was an investment and could be passed to her 
children without significant fees and she could easily book holidays to any of the destinations 
- and that reviewing the documents wouldnt have satisfactorily addressed any of the 
misrepresentations. It also says that exclusion of liability for misrepresentation is legally 
ineffective and that our investigator hasnt considered the false statements by the holiday 
company, the unsuitability of the product for Mrs B and the unconscionable conduct by the 
holiday company. It says that the failure to make the care call was a breach of contract and 
that Shawbrook Banks relationship with Mrs B was unfair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mrs Bs complaint to Shawbrook Bank in December 2019 was about the way that the 
loan was sold to her as shes a vulnerable person and that she didnt receive a care 
call;
the holiday company and Shawbrook Bank would have been aware of Mrs Bs age 
but Ive seen no evidence to show that they were made aware (or ought reasonably 
to have been aware) of her medical issues or other personal circumstances before 
she entered into the purchase agreement and loan agreement;
Mrs B was 74 years old when the loan was made to her and the duration of the loan 
was ten years  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
Shawbrook Bank shouldnt have made the loan to Mrs B because of her age;
Shawbrook Banks partner checklist shows that it was an underwriting requirement of 
the loan that a care call was made to Mrs B  it says that a care call was attempted 
but that she was unattainable  although I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect Shawbrook Bank to have done more to contact Mrs B about the care call, Im 
not persuaded that the absence of a care call was a breach of contract by 
Shawbrook Bank or that its enough to justify any further action being required by it;
Mrs B signed the loan agreement which showed the amount of credit being provided 
to her, the duration of the loan, the amount of the monthly repayments and the 
number of payments to be made and the interest rate (annually, monthly and as an 
APR);
immediately above Mrs Bs signature on the loan agreement it says: The terms and 
conditions overleaf are part of this Agreement, please read them carefully. This is a 
Credit Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you 
want to be legally bound by its terms;
Mrs B also signed Shawbrook Banks partner checklist in which she confirmed that 
shed read the loan agreement, it had been explained to her and that she could afford 
the repayments;
Mrs Bs representative says that Mrs B was asked to sign the partner checklist and 
the holiday companys customer compliance checklist during a lengthy and 
pressurised sales meeting  but the evidence shows that Mrs B left the meeting 
without signing the loan agreement and that she then signed it and sent it to the 
holiday company four days later  I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
her to have read it before signing it and that her actions show that its more likely 
than not that she wanted to enter into the loan agreement;
the loan agreement also clearly set out Mrs Bs right to withdraw from the loan agreement without giving any reason within 14 days  but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mrs B tried to withdraw from the loan agreement during the withdrawal 
period; 
Mrs Bs representatives complaint to this service on behalf of Mrs B also says that 
no checks or credit assessment were carried out by Shawbrook Bank before the loan 
was made to Mrs B  but Shawbrook Bank has provided evidence to show that the 
affordability of the loan for Mrs B was assessed and that information was obtained 
which showed that she was retired and a property owner and her annual income was 
specified  and I consider that it was reasonable for it to conclude on the basis of that 
information that a monthly payment of £94.39 was affordable for her;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mrs B and her 
representative says that she didnt need the loan to pay for the membership points;
Mrs Bs representative has described the way that the membership was sold to Mrs B 
and it has referred to a lengthy and pressurised sales meeting - but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs B was unduly pressured 
into entering into the purchase agreement or the loan agreement in April 2016, that 
the holiday company used unacceptable commercial practices against her or that its 
conduct was unconscionable;
the customer compliance statement that Mrs B signed said: We confirm that we 
have been treated courteously during the sales presentation, that we have been 
given plenty of time to consider if the product is right for us and we have not been put 
under any pressure to purchase our points  I consider that it would be reasonable 
to expect Mrs B to have read the compliance statement before signing it and not to 
have signed it if she felt that shed been unduly pressured into entering into the 
agreements or if she had any issues with the sales process that the holiday company 
had used;
Mrs B had complained to Shawbrook Bank and I dont consider that it was required to 
ask her for more information about her recollections as part of its investigation into 
her complaint;
the information that it obtained from the holiday company showed that Mrs B had 
made three holiday club reservations (one of which she then cancelled) since she 
entered into the purchase agreement and that she stopped paying the management 
fees in 2018 so had not been able to make any reservations since then;
neither Mrs Bs complaint to Shawbrook Bank nor its response to her had referred to 
misrepresentations made by the holiday company or an unfair relationship between 
Mrs B and Shawbrook Bank but the complaint that her representative made, on her 
behalf, to this service referred to misrepresentations and an unfair relationship;
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1975 gives a consumer an equal right to claim 
against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria 
set out in that section are met) and section 140A of that Act gives a court the power, 
amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under 
a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the 
debtor and the creditor;
Mrs B signed the purchase agreement and the holiday companys terms and 
conditions in April 2016 - she also signed a separate standard withdrawal form to 
acknowledge receipt of information about her right to withdraw from the purchase 
agreement, a key information document and a compliance statement and 
declaration;Mrs Bs representative says that the membership was misrepresented to Mrs B and 
the latest time that any misrepresentations could have been made to her was in April 
2016 as that was when she entered into the purchase agreement and the loan 
agreement - but Mrs B didnt complain to Shawbrook Bank until December 2019 and 
she didnt refer at that time to any misrepresentations by the holiday company  the 
first claim about the alleged misrepresentations was in her representatives complaint 
to this service in June 2020, more than four years after shed entered into the 
agreements, and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have 
complained about any misrepresentations before then and to have referred to them 
in her complaint to Shawbrook Bank in December 2019;
the terms and conditions that Mrs B signed say, if you have relied on verbal 
promises please ask for these to be put in writing and the compliance statement that 
she signed says: We understand that this document, the Purchase Agreement and 
the documents referred to in it form the entire agreement between the parties. We 
confirm that no oral or written representations have been made to us upon which we 
have relied and which are either not contained in the documentation presented to us 
today or noted by us below in the comments box;
I dont consider that the holiday company has attempted to exclude its liability for 
misrepresentation but it has obtained from Mrs B a declaration that she hadnt relied 
on verbal representations and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs B asked for 
any information on which shed relied to be confirmed in writing;
the terms and conditions that Mrs B signed say: You should not purchase your 
Points as an investment; and the customer compliance statement and declaration 
that Mrs B also signed says: We understand that the purchase of our points  
should not be regarded as a property or financial investment and that any 
subsequent resale will depend on market conditions; and: We understand that there 
is currently no resale or buyback programme for our Points;
Mrs B was able to use her membership points to reserve holidays in 2016 and 2017 
and Ive seen no evidence to show that she complained about any 
misrepresentations by the holiday company at those times and I consider that her 
liability for the management fees was described and accepted in the documents that 
she signed;
Im not persuaded that Mrs B has provided enough evidence to show that the 
membership was misrepresented to her by the holiday company before she entered 
into the purchase agreement;
Mrs B signed a separate standard withdrawal form which set out her right to withdraw 
from the purchase agreement and said: The consumer has the right to withdraw 
from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason - but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that she tried to withdraw from that agreement within the 
withdrawal period;
Im not persuaded that Mrs B has provided enough evidence to show that her 
relationship with Shawbrook Bank was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs B and 
Shawbrook Bank in these circumstances;
I consider that it was fair and reasonable for Shawbrook Bank to say that it didnt 
uphold Mrs Bs complaint; and
I sympathise with Mrs B for the issues that shes had with her membership and for 
the medical issues and other difficulties that shes experienced, but I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Shawbrook Bank to refund to her any 
of the money that shes paid under the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 February 2023.
