The complaint
Mr M complains about a request for a statement from PSI-Pay Ltd (PSI).
What happened
On 16 September 2022, Mr M emailed PSI and asked for a statement starting 31 days 
agoasap. PSI sent him a statement which started on 15 August 2022. The last transaction 
showing on the statement was 9 September 2022. Mr Ms solicitors then asked Mr M to ask 
PSI for a further statement covering the period from 9 September 2022 to 16 September 
2022. PSI sent this on 21 September 2022.
Mr M complained. He said that PSI had made a mistake  as the statement only went up to 
9 September 2022. He said PSI had wasted his time and caused him stress and 
inconvenience  because he had been contacted by his solicitors and had to ask for another 
statement.
PSI said that on 16 September 2022, Mr M asked for a statement which began 31 days ago. 
But - werent any transactions after 9 September 2022, so there wasnt anything showing 
after that time. They had then sent Mr M a further statement covering the period from 9 
September 2022. They didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint, but apologised for any distress and 
inconvenience caused.
Mr M brought his complaint to us and our investigator said PSI acted reasonably. He said 
PSI had sent a statement covering the period from 15 August 2022 to 16 September 2022  
but as there werent any transactions showing after 9 September 2022, there was nothing 
shown between then and 16 September 2022. PSI had provided a further statement 
covering the latter period within 24 hours of Mr Ms further contact. So, he didnt uphold Mr 
Ms complaint.
Mr M asked that an ombudsman looks at his complaint  and so it has come to me to make 
a final decision. (continued)
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that Mr M emailed PSI on 16 September 2022 and asked (for a) bank statement 
starting 31 days ago (pl)ease asap. PSI sent to Mr M a statement covering the period from 
15 August 2022 up to 16 September 2022. So  I consider that was exactly what Mr M had 
asked for.
But I can then appreciate that Mr Ms solicitors felt that the statement only went up to 9 
September 2022  because there werent any transactions made by Mr M between 10 
September 2022 and 16 September 2022. So  nothing was showing. Mr Ms solicitors 
asked Mr M to get another statement between 9 September 2022 and 16 September 2022. 
And PSI did that within 24 hours of Mr M asking. But in actual fact, I think that wasnt 
necessary  as the statement sent already went up to 16 September 2022. 
So  I dont think PSI made any errors here  as they did what Mr M asked them to do.
I can see that what may have caused the confusion was that the statement didnt show a 
produced on date or similar  so it wasnt clear that it went up to 16 September 2022. If it 
had a date, then the confusion wouldve been avoided. But  this service cant make PSI 
change the design of their statements. Thats not our role.
So  what we have here is a situation where PSI did what they were asked to do; and Mr Ms 
complaint was a result of a simple misunderstanding. And PSI apologised for any distress 
and inconvenience caused. And  I consider that was enough to settle Mr Ms complaint.
Therefore, I wont be asking PSI to do anything here.  
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 March 2023.
