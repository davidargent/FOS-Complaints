The complaint
Miss D complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (trading as Barclaycard) recorded missed 
payments on her credit file after she thought the outstanding balance had been repaid.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons: 
Barclaycard correctly applied interest to Miss D's credit card after she made a
purchase. Miss D didn't clear the outstanding balance in full when she made a
payment on 19 September 2019.
Barclaycard sent Miss D statements in the months that followed asking for payments
to be made. I'm satisfied Barclaycard did contact Miss D about the arrears on her
account.
When Miss D called to make a payment on 19 September 2019 Barclaycard should
have made it clear that payments could still impact her account balance. And I'm
satisfied the missed payments were caused by a genuine misunderstanding rather
than any intention not to repay the outstanding balance.
I'm pleased Barclaycard has removed the adverse credit information from Miss D's
credit file. I've considered everything Miss D has told us about the impact of
Barclaycard's errors and the distress and inconvenience caused. Having done so, I'm
satisfied £300 is fair in all the circumstances, so I'm going to endorse the
investigator's recommendation.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct Barclays Bank UK PLC to pay Miss D a 
total of £300 (less any compensation already paid).
DRN-1807364Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 August 2020.
