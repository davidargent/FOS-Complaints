K820x#14complaint
Mrs S complains about an excess mileage charge charged by PSA Finance UK Limited.
background
In 2015 Mrs S hired a car under a hire purchase  agreement financed  by PSA,  trading  as 
Citroen Financial Services. The agreement was to last for three years, and the mileage limit 
was 6,000 miles a year. Mrs S says she thought  it was 10,000 a year. She says she didnt 
realise it was only 6,000 because  the second  page  of the hire purchase agreement  was 
missing, and this is the page the mileage  limit is on. She says the first and third pages were 
given to her stapled  together,  and she didnt notice the second page  was missing at the time.
Mrs S also says that she had previously  had two hire purchase  agreements  for two previous  
cars, and although  she no longer has these documents she insists  that the annual  mileage  
limit on both agreements  was 10,000 miles.  She says that when she took out her third and 
latest agreement, it was verbally agreed  between her and the salesman that the annual limit 
would be 10,000 miles again.
When the agreement  came to an end in 2018,  Mrs S returned the car, having  driven  it 
25,598 miles. She complains about  the excess mileage charge, which  she had not expected 
to pay. PSA did not agree that it had done anything wrong, but as a gesture  of good will it 
reduced the charge to about  £190. Since she did not think she should  be charged anything  
for mileage, she brought this complaint to our Service.
Our adjudicator did not uphold this complaint. She thought that the excess mileage limit had 
been brought to Mrs Ss attention, because she had signed the third page of the agreement 
(which includes a declaration that she has received a complete copy of the agreement),  and 
because the previous hire purchase agreement  in 2012 had had the same  mileage limit.
Mrs S asked for an ombudsmans decision.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I do not uphold it. I will explain why.
It is for slightly  different  reasons to the adjudicators. Although  Mrs S signed a declaration  
that she had been given  the complete agreement, she may just not have  noticed  that a page 
was missing, so I dont think that her signature really proves that the page  wasnt missing. 
I am prepared to accept,  on the balance of probabilities,  that the page was missing  
although I am sure that this was only an oversight, and not done  in bad faith.
Nevertheless, it is true that the previous  agreement  in 2012, which I have seen, gave the 
same mileage limit  6,000  miles a year for three years, or 18,000 in total. (It also sets out 
the same  charges.)
In Mrs Ss original complaint email to us she said that both of her previous cars had been 
returned with mileage  over 16,000. So I think it is likely that, in 2015,  a total limit of 18,000 
miles would have seemed  to be suitable for her needs. On balance,  I dont accept that a total 
of 30,000 miles, or 10,000 a year, was agreed  to.
Ref: DRN95557302So I find that the total mileage limit agreed to in 2015 was 18,000  miles, and that Mrs S 
exceeded that limit by 7,598 miles. I cannot  fault PSA for charging her. In fact, the only error 
PSA has made is under-charging her.
Under both the 2012 and 2015 agreements,  the excess mileage  charge  was 6p for every 
mile above the total limit, up to 30 per cent of that limit. 30% of 18,000 miles is 5,400 miles. 
Above that second threshold  of 18,000  + 5,400 = 23,400 miles, the charge doubles to 12p. 
So PSA was entitled to charge her £324 for the first 5,400 miles above the maximum, and 
another £263.76 for the rest  a total of £587.76.
Instead, for reasons which I do not know, PSA only charged her a flat rate of 5p a mile. It 
has since reduced the charge to £191.52. So Mrs S is nearly  £400  better  off. I would  
respectfully encourage her to take that as a win.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 August 2019. But if we dont hear from her, then we will 
presume that she rejects it, in which case she will not be bound  by it.
