The complaint
Mr T complains about his account with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal).
What happened
Mr T made 14 payments of £500 over a four-hour period from his bank account to a betting 
company, via his PayPal account. 
After losing the money, Mr T didnt have the funds to cover the losses, so his bank blocked 
the payments. This meant instead of his bank account being in a negative balance (and an 
unauthorised overdraft) it took his PayPal account in a negative balance instead. 
Mr T complained to PayPal, as he said the payments shouldnt have been authorised by 
PayPal when the funds werent available. Mr T has also said PayPal shouldve had 
safeguarding protection in place to stop him from using such a high amount of money in a 
short space of time and it has given him a credit facility he didnt ask for.
PayPal looked into the complaint but didnt agree it had acted unfairly. So, Mr T brought his 
complaint to our service.
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt uphold it. Our investigator found that   
Mr T accepted PayPals terms and conditions when he opened his account, and one of 
those terms was that he gave PayPal continuous permission to charge his funding source  
in this case his bank account. She went on to say that as Mr T had initiated the payments, 
the onus was on him to make sure there were funds available in his bank account to cover 
the transactions.
Mr T didnt agree with the investigators view. So, the complaints been passed to me for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear from Mr Ts comments to our service that he feels very strongly about his 
complaint. And Ive read all the information he has sent carefully. Having done so, Ive 
decided not to uphold this complaint. Ill explain why.
When Mr T signed up to his PayPal account, he agreed to a set of terms and conditions, 
these are also referred to as a User Agreement. One of those terms and conditions which I 
have seen, was to allow PayPal to make payments from Mr Ts nominated banking account 
when he initiates them - as it has done with the transactions in this complaint. So, I dont find 
PayPal have breached any terms or conditions when they have made the payments, or that 
it has acted unfairly by doing so.
The user agreement goes on to say. 
We may charge the funding source again if the previous attempt failed. If you cancel any 
continuous permission from your funding source, you will reimburse us for the value of any 
electronic money weve already issued for which a charge from that funding source remains 
outstanding.
So, based on the above, even though Mr Ts bank blocked the payments from his nominated 
bank account, and he didnt delete the funding source  he is still liable to pay the amount 
PayPal sent to the betting company.
Mr T has said that PayPal shouldve realised what the transactions were for and stopped 
them from being paid. But I dont agree. PayPal may prevent a payment if the user is in 
breach of their User Agreement, but I cant see that this happened here. It worth noting that 
PayPal also wouldnt have known what the payments in this transaction were for, just the 
name of the business they were going to. So, I dont find PayPal have acted outside of its 
terms and conditions or acted unfairly by not stopping the payments. At the point the 
payments were made, PayPal also wouldnt have been aware that the money was being 
lost through gambling, and this is also not something they needed to be aware of.
Ive also not seen anything to evidence that Mr T made PayPal aware of his gambling issue 
before the payments in this complaint were made. I have considered the impact it may have 
had on the payments had he done this, and Im still not convinced PayPal wouldve needed 
to take any action. It would need to be Mr Ts bank that prevented the payments from being 
made, as this is where they originated from.
I understand Mr T has said PayPal have given him credit facilities that he didnt want by 
allowing the transactions to go through. But PayPal havent lent Mr T any money or given 
him any credit. Mr Ts PayPal account is in a negative balance as his bank blocked the 
transactions.
 
Mr T has raised concerns about the fact no checks were done to make sure the money was 
available. Ive thought about this point carefully, but it doesnt change my outcome. PayPal 
wouldnt have access to see what funds were available in Mr Ts account, due to it being a 
payment service provider rather than Mr Ts own bank. 
Although I havent found PayPal have done anything wrong in the circumstances of this 
complaint, I have still gone on to think about what I think most likely wouldve happened if 
PayPal had flagged the payments and called Mr T to intervene. Given Mr T was sending 
money to his own account with the gambling website, and this wasnt part of a fraud or 
scam, I expect Mr T wouldve been able to answer any questions PayPal may have had and 
convinced the advisor he wasnt at risk of financial harm.
I say this as Mr T had made a considerable number of transactions to and from this same 
website over a long period of time. During that period, Mr T hadnt raised any concerns 
about how he was spending the money or that he was at risk of harm. 
In summary, Mr T instructed PayPal to make the payments from his bank account to the 
betting company and Im satisfied he was aware he didnt have the funds available that he 
was spending. And I havent found PayPal have done anything wrong when they have 
allowed the payments to go through.
PayPal have offered Mr T £550 which he is free to accept. My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 November 2023.
