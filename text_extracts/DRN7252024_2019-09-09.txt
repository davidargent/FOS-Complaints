K820x#14complaint
Ms L says Financial Insurance Company Limited  (FICL) mis-sold  her a payment protection  
insurance (PPI)  policy.  
background
Ms L bought  the policy over the phone in 1996 sometime after she took out a credit card.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Ms L disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion,  
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Ms Ls case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Ms Ls complaint because:
 Ms L took out the PPI over the phone  about  seven months after taking  out the card in 
store  when  she didnt select PPI on the credit  card application form. So I think  Ms L 
was aware that she had a choice about  buying the PPI, and that she chose to take it. I 
appreciate she doesnt  remember this, but thats understandable  given how long ago it 
was. 
 FICL  didnt recommend the PPI to Ms L so it didnt have to check if it was right for her. 
 Its possible the information FICL gave Ms L about the PPI wasnt  as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Ms L doesnt  appear to have been affected  by any of the main 
things the policy  didnt cover  and based on what I know about  her circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been  useful to her. So I dont  think  better information 
wouldve stopped  her buying  it. 
Ive taken into account Ms Ls comments. But these points dont change  my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Ms Ls complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 October  2019.
