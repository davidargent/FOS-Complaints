The complaint
Mr W and Mrs K complain National Westminster Bank Plc told them funds had cleared into 
their account but, on the same day, the cheque bounced. 
What happened
Mr W sold a watch and a cheque for £2,700 was paid into a joint savings account he holds 
with Mrs K. On 19 December 2019 Mr W called NatWest and asked if the money that had 
been paid in had cleared. NatWest confirmed that the funds had cleared. 
On 19 December 2019 NatWest also wrote to Mr W to inform him the cheque that had been 
paid in had bounced. Mr W complained and NatWest responded on 10 January 2020. 
NatWest said Mr W hadn't told the call handler he was calling to check if a cheque had 
cleared. NatWest says that, if he had, the call handler would've told him cheques can be 
subject to recall for six working days following deposit. NatWest paid Mr W £100 but didn't 
agree an error had been made. 
Mr W referred his complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. The 
investigator didn't uphold Mr W's complaint and noted he told NatWest that he had already 
handed over the watch when he called on 19 December 2019.
Mr W asked to appeal and said the bank should have told him that the cheque had bounced 
because it was drawn on an account that was closed when he called. Mr W said NatWest 
should've been able to tell him whether the funds were cleared or not. As Mr W asked to 
appeal, his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Mr W is upset and why he feels NatWest should have been able to 
confirm whether the cheque he paid in had cleared. Mr W has lost a lot of money and I don't 
doubt his strength of feeling. But I need to be fair to both parties and, whilst I sympathise 
with Mr W's position, I haven't been persuaded to uphold his complaint. I'll explain why. 
I've listened to the call on 19 December 2019 and Mr W didn't say he wanted to check 
whether funds paid in via a cheque had clearer. He told NatWest's call handler that someone 
had paid some money into his account and that he wanted to check everything was ok. I 
appreciate that Mr W was checking whether the cheque had cleared but that isn't what he 
told the call handler. No mention of the payment method was made. 
NatWest says that the method of payment wasn't known to the call handler and that he only 
knew a credit had been paid into Mr W and Mrs K's account via a cash deposit machine. 
Had the call handler known, NatWest says they would've told Mr W about how long cheques 
take to clear and noted the risk of the funds being reclaimed. I'm sorry to disappoint Mr W but I'm satisfied the call handler wasn't aware a cheque had 
been paid into their account when he said the funds had cleared. As a result, I haven't been 
persuaded that NatWest made an error when Mr W called on 19 December 2019. 
I note Mr W received a letter dated 19 December 2019 advising the cheque funds had been 
returned as it was drawn from a closed account. But NatWest has confirmed that was sent 
after Mr W called which meant the funds were still showing in the account. 
Whilst NatWest didn't uphold Mr W's complaint, it did pay him and Mrs K £100. As I haven't 
found NatWest made a mistake or treated Mr W and Mrs K unfairly, I'm not telling it to take 
any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K and Mr W to 
accept or reject my decision before 24 July 2020.
