The complaint
Mr D complained to NewDay Ltd that theyd recorded a default on his credit file as a result of 
his financial problems due to the global pandemic.
What happened
Mr D has an Aqua credit card account with NewDay. In July 2020, he contacted them to 
explain that his financial circumstances had been impacted by the global pandemic. He 
asked NewDay to agree a payment deferral on his account with them. NewDay agreed to his 
request and said the payment freeze would operate immediately until early October 2020. 
They wrote to Mr D to confirm this.
Mr D contacted NewDay again at the beginning of October as his financial situation hadnt 
improved. NewDay agree to extend a payment holiday on his account until January 2021. 
Again, they wrote to Mr D to confirm this.
Mr D contacted a debt management company about his financial problems. They reviewed 
his financial circumstances and agreed to contact NewDay on his behalf. 
The debt management company wrote to NewDay in December 2020 providing a 
breakdown of Mr Ds income and expenditure. They offered monthly payments of £1 towards 
the amount Mr D owed to NewDay. NewDay replied confirming theyd set up a repayment 
plan for £1 per month and wouldnt charge any interest on the debt owed. NewDay also said 
theyd let credit reference agencies know that your client has missed payments.
The debt management company complained to NewDay in January 2021. They thought the 
negative impact on Mr Ds credit file was unfair. They said hed had no previous missed 
payments reported and said Mr D had requested that NewDay issue a notice of correction 
on his credit file.
NewDay sent a default notice to Mr D in March 2021. They said his account was in arrears 
and they required a payment of £8.30 by 13 April 2021. NewDay did acknowledge the 
repayment plan. Mr D didnt pay the arrears amount requested by NewDay.
In April 2021, NewDay responded to Mr Ds complaint. They didnt agree theyd done 
anything wrong. They said payments theyd received from Mr D were for less than the 
contractual minimum. Because of this, arrears had accumulated, and adverse data had been 
recorded correctly.
Mr D wasnt happy with NewDay response to his complaint. So, he referred matters to this 
service so that we could investigate the circumstances.
Our adjudicator didnt think NewDay had done anything wrong. She thought theyd correctly 
reported the situation on Mr Ds account to the credit reference agencies. So, she didnt think 
NewDay needed to do anything more.
Mr D didnt agree with our adjudicators findings. He said thered been a lack of government 
help and there was a broader problem with the Financial Conduct Authoritys regulations. 
So, he asked for his complaint to be passed to an ombudsman to issue a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued guidance to lenders on 2 April 2020 which 
explained what it expected from businesses during the exceptional circumstances arising out 
of the global pandemic. It provided guidance asking businesses to consider payment 
deferrals of up to three months under regulated credit agreements. 
The FCA said their guidance applied where consumers were already experiencing or 
reasonably expect to experience temporary payment difficulties as a result of the pandemic. 
The FCA also said that firms should ensure that there is no negative impact on the 
consumers credit file because of the payment deferral.  
Further guidance issued by the FCA on 1 July 2020 extended these measures, and where 
consumers were still struggling due to the global pandemic, businesses were advised to 
freeze or reduce their payments for a further three months.
NewDays letter of 9 July confirms their original agreement to a payment freeze for three 
months. They said it wouldnt be treated as a missed payment by credit reference agencies 
meaning there would be no negative impact. So, NewDay appeared to have complied with 
the FCAs guidelines here.
Following Mr Ds request for a further payment holiday, NewDay wrote to him on 1 October 
2020 with the terms of the payment holiday. They said Mr D would need to start making at 
least the minimum monthly contractual payments once the payment holiday ended. So, this 
also appears to have complied with the FCAs guidance.,
The key point here is that the FCAs guidance applies in the circumstances of temporary 
payment difficulties. In Mr Ds case, it appears his financial problems were longer term. This 
was confirmed to NewDay when the debt management company wrote to them in December 
2020. They said Mr D could only afford to pay £1 per month going forward. As NewDay had 
already applied the FCAs guidance, they needed to consider Mr Ds offer within the context 
of the accounts terms and conditions. Mr Ds offer suggested that he couldnt comply with 
them.
NewDay accepted the payment offer under a payment arrangement in a letter they sent 
dated 9 December 2020. But they did make it clear that they would let the credit reference 
agencies know that Mr D had missed payments. And I think they were entitled to do that 
here.  
The Information Commissioners Office (ICO) were involved in drawing up the Principles for 
the Reporting of Arrears, Arrangements and Defaults at Credit Reference Agencies. They 
explain whats required from a lender in these circumstances. Section three of the principles 
says If your lender does not agree a reduced or revised payment with you because the 
amount you offer to the lender is not acceptable, for example, a very low or token payment, 
the account will not be reported as an arrangement or a debt management programme 
negotiated by a third party. Any payments you make will be reflected in the current balance, 
arrears will continue to accrue, and a default may be recorded. 
NewDay have explained that because Mr Ds monthly payment offer was for less than 1% of 
the amount owed, arrears continued to build. So, the arrangement wasnt considered 
acceptable as a longer-term solution. As a result, NewDay say they were required to report 
the situation to the credit reference agencies. I agree with NewDay on that point as its 
important that the information recorded is an accurate reflection of Mr Ds account with them. 
So, I cant reasonably say that NewDay did anything wrong here.
NewDay issued a default notice as the terms of the card agreement hadnt been complied 
with. And I think they were within their rights to do that. Ultimately, the agreement was 
terminated and NewDay offered to provide support to assist Mr D in finding a solution. Again, I think this was the right approach in these circumstances as it would ensure that Mr Ds 
situation didnt get any worse. 
I appreciate that Mr Ds financial circumstances were as a direct consequence of the impact 
of the global pandemic. Mr D has expressed concern about ongoing government support 
and the regulations and guidance issued by the FCA. This service is not able to instruct 
either the UK Government or the FCA on matters regarding their support or guidance. But it 
is this services role, as an Alternative Dispute Resolution Service (ADR), to provide 
mediation in the event of a dispute. So, Im only able to consider Mr Ds complaint to 
NewDay within the context of the guidance and rules at the time.
Having done so, I cant reasonably say that NewDay have done anything wrong or acted 
unfairly in Mr Ds circumstances. I appreciate Mr D will be disappointed, but it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable for me to ask NewDay to do anything more here.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 February 2022.
