The complaint
Miss J complains that her mortgage offer from National Westminster Bank Plc was 
withdrawn when NatWest decided the ground rent on the property she was buying was 
excessive. Miss J said NatWest knew this from the start, so shouldnt have made an offer.
What happened
Miss J wanted to purchase a leasehold property. She told NatWest about the property she 
wanted to buy as part of her application, including that the ground rent was £90 per month. 
NatWest made a mortgage offer to Miss J in late 2020. But in mid-2021 it said it could no 
longer offer the mortgage as the ground rent was too high  despite being aware of this 
since November 2020. 
Miss J said shed incurred significant costs because NatWest told her it would give her a 
mortgage, then changed its mind. And she said that this had all been extremely stressful. 
She wanted NatWest to cover her costs, and pay her compensation. 
NatWest said once its solicitors alerted it to the level of the ground rent, it instructed its 
surveyors to review. And the surveyors decided the ground rent was excessive, so it was 
likely to limit the marketability of the property. NatWest said that meant it could no longer 
lend.
NatWest refunded the valuation fee that Miss J had paid, but it said it wouldnt cover any of 
her other costs, as they were solely issues between the third parties and Miss J.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. He said NatWest was aware of the 
cost of ground rent in late November. But it continued with the mortgage offer. So our 
investigator thought NatWest already knew everything it needed to, before the offer was 
made. Miss J paid her broker, because an offer was made, and she instructed a solicitor. 
Our investigator was clear that he could see nothing to suggest Miss J had acted in an 
unethical manner during her mortgage application process. And he said he couldnt see 
anything in the offer which allowed NatWest to withdraw it in these circumstances. 
Our investigator thought that what happened was unfair. He said Miss J only incurred costs 
for a solicitor and broker because of this offer. So he thought NatWest should pay £572.16 
for solicitors costs and £300 for a broker fee, which he said Miss J had evidenced. Our 
investigator didnt think NatWest should cover Miss Js rent, because Miss J would always 
have had to pay either rent or a mortgage. And he didnt think NatWest should pay Miss Js 
storage costs, because he hadnt been able to determine that the storage unit was only for 
her belongings. But he did think NatWest should pay Miss J compensation, of £350.
Miss J accepted that. NatWest didnt. It said that the issue of the ground rent being too high 
could only be determined by a professional surveyor. As soon as the surveyor made it aware 
of this issue it had no choice but to withdraw the offer. And NatWest said that as all offers 
are subject to completion of a suitable valuation, it didnt think it could be held liable for the 
costs our investigator asked it to reimburse.
NatWest also sent our service a mortgage offer dated 6 January 2021. The first page of that 
offer includes the following  
An assessment for lending purposes will have been undertaken to provide the 
property valuation  assumed in the Mortgage Illustration. This has been undertaken 
solely for our purposes 
Because NatWest didnt agree, this case was passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
Miss J has shown our service evidence that NatWest was aware of the annual cost of 
ground rent on the property that she wanted to buy, certainly by the end of November 2020. 
And the offer NatWest made in January 2021 says that the property has been valued. 
NatWest later rescinded this offer, on the basis that the cost of the ground rent severely 
limited the marketability of the property. But, like our investigator, I think NatWest had all the 
information it needed to reach that conclusion much earlier than it did. And NatWest does 
appear to have checked that the property provided adequate security for the lending before it 
issued a mortgage offer. 
An offer was made to Miss J, so I think it was reasonable for her to start making preparations 
for a purchase, which included costs. And I cant see anything in NatWests offer conditions 
which allows it to withdraw its offer in these circumstances. So I dont think NatWest acted 
fairly when it withdrew Miss Js mortgage offer. And for those reasons, I do think NatWest 
should pay the costs and compensation that our investigator first suggested. I think that 
provides a fair and reasonable outcome to this complaint.My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Miss J £572.16 for 
solicitors costs, £300 for a broker fee, and £350 in compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 January 2023.
