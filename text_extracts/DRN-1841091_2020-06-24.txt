Miss M said that Sunny should have realised that she had become dependent on the loans 
and that she had to borrow more to make her repayments. She said that the loans caused 
her to get further into debt and financial hardship.
Sunny said Miss M had loans outstanding with it for less than 12 months. It said that before 
all loans were provided it carried out eligibility, creditworthiness and affordability checks to 
ensure the amount borrowed could be repaid without undue difficulties. 
Our adjudicator upheld this complaint in regard to loans 7 to 14. He thought that by loan 7, 
Sunny should have realised that Miss M was struggling to repay some of her loans and there 
was a significant risk that she wouldve been unable to sustainably meet her monthly 
repayments for this loan  and any subsequent loans. By loan 11 he thought that Miss Ms 
overall pattern of borrowing suggested she had become persistently reliant on short-term 
loans. Sunny didnt agree with our adjudicators view but instead offered to uphold Miss Ms 
complaint from loan 11. Miss M didnt accept Sunnys offer.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We've set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Miss M 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumer's income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having 
to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly 
and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments 
sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ms complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold loans 1 to 6. I have looked at the information gathered before 
these loans were provided and while I think further checks should have taken place from 
loan 5 onwards, I do not have further evidence to suggest these loans shouldnt have been 
provided. Some of the loans were taken out while previous loans were outstanding and in 
such cases I have considered the total amount repayable under the loans. Having done this 
the loans did appear affordable and without further evidence to suggest otherwise, I do not find it unreasonable that these loans were provided.
By loan 7, I agree with our adjudicator that Sunny should have been concerned that Miss M 
was having difficulty managing her money. This was Miss Ms seventh loan in less than four 
months and she was taking out new loans in close succession and while previous loans 
were outstanding. I think this should have raised concerns about Miss Ms ability to 
sustainably manage the repayments on her debt and so I do not think that this loan, and 
subsequent loans, should have been provided.
By loan 11, Miss M had been borrowing for six months and had taken out a number of 
concurrent loans. She was also taking out new loans shortly after repaying previous loans 
suggesting she needed to borrow more to fill the gap left by the repayments. Given this I 
agree with our adjudicator that by this time Miss Ms pattern of borrowing suggested she was 
persistently reliant on these loans. I note that Sunny has offered to uphold these loans.
Given the above, I am upholding this complaint from loan 7 onwards.
Putting things right
I uphold this complaint in regard to loans 7 to 14 and require Sunny to take the following 
action: 
Refund any interest and charges Miss M paid on loans 7 to 14 along with simple 
interest at a rate of 8% per annum from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*.
 
If any loans are still outstanding then all interest and charges on these loans should 
be waived and all payments made towards these loans should be treated as 
payments towards the capital amount. Any over payments should be refunded along 
with simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum from the date they arose to the date of 
settlement.
 
Any adverse information recorded about loans 7 to 10 should be removed from 
Miss Ms credit file.
 
The overall pattern of Miss Ms borrowing from loan 11 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so all entries about loans 11 to 14 should be 
removed from Miss M's credit file.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
 
 
 
 
 
My final decisionFor the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Miss M compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 July 2020.
