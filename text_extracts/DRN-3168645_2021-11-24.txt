The complaint
Mrs D complains that a car that was supplied to her under a conditional sale agreement with 
Moneybarn No. 1 Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mrs D under a conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn that 
she electronically signed in May 2019. She complained to Moneybarn about issues with the 
car in July 2019, including that there had been previous repairs to the car, the brakes, back 
window wiper and air conditioning were faulty and that coolant was leaking into the head 
gasket. 
Moneybarn said that the dealer had agreed to repair the car and that it had been collected 
from Mrs D for repairs. It also offered her £150 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience that shed been caused which it said would be paid into her bank account. It 
said that the repair by the dealer was a fair and reasonable response to the issues with the 
car so it was closing her complaint.
Mrs D complained again to Moneybarn in September 2020 about a head gasket failure. It 
arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert in October 2020 and then 
said that there was no evidence to suggest that the previous repair to the head gasket had 
failed so it was unable to support her complaint. Mrs D wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He believed that the 
original issues with the car were resolved in 2019 and he was satisfied that Moneybarn 
acted fairly and reasonably when it said it that it couldnt assist her with the issue with the 
head gasket about which shed complained in September 2020. He said that hed seen no 
evidence to suggest that the car had any other issues which were present or developing at 
the point of supply when Mrs D raised her concerns with Moneybarn in September 2020. 
Mrs D has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that 
issues with the CO 2 sensor plugs and air conditioning have been ignored and her complaint 
wasnt solely about the head gasket. She says that the cars falling to pieces and shes had 
to pay to have it fixed as she needs to use the car.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
Moneybarn, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mrs D - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mrs D was about six years old, had been driven for 
84,780 miles and had a price of £4,954;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number factors;
there were clearly some issues with the car soon after it was supplied to Mrs D  she 
complained to Moneybarn about those issues and the dealer agreed to repair the car 
and Moneybarn said that it would pay her £150 compensation and that it was closing 
her complaint;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs D complained to Moneybarn about on-going 
issues with the car or the dealers failure to repair the car until she complained to it in 
September 2020  more than a year later  and, if there had been any on-going 
issues, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have contacted 
Moneybarn about those issues before September 2020; 
Moneybarn says that her September 2020 complaint was that the head gasket had 
failed and it arranged for an independent expert to inspect the car;
its clear from the inspection report that the expert was instructed to investigate 
issues with the head gasket and not any other issues and Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mrs D had told Moneybarn that her complaint at that time wasnt just about 
the head gasket;
the inspection took place in October 2020 and the experts report recorded the cars 
mileage as 98,809 and said:
We would conclude based upon the visible evidence that there is an evident 
fault with the vehicle which we believe is a failed head gasket. However, 
based upon the considerable time and mileage elapsed since original finance 
inception and last repair, we cannot conclude or determine based upon the 
available evidence that this is conclusively a fault which would have been 
developing at finance inception or as a consequence of the last repair carried 
out;
the independent expert didnt consider that the failed head gasket would have been 
developing when the car was supplied to Mrs D or that it had failed as a result of the 
repair by the dealer  so I consider that it was fair and reasonable for Moneybarn to 
say that it couldnt support her complaint;
the cars mileage when it was supplied to Mrs D in May 2019 was about 84,780 and 
when it was inspected in October 2020 it was 98,809  so in about 17 months shed 
been able to use the car to drive more than 14,000 miles  I dont consider that shed 
have been able to do so if the issue with the head gasket hadnt been adequately 
repaired by the dealer after her complaint to Moneybarn in July 2019;
Mrs D had complained to Moneybarn in July 2019 about the cars air-conditioning but 
Ive seen no evidence that she raised further concerns about that until after shed 
complained to this service  and, if the cars air-conditioning hadnt been adequately 
repaired by the dealer after her complaint to Moneybarn in July 2019, I consider that 
it would be reasonable to expect her to have contacted Moneybarn about that before 
September 2020;
she says that theres a fault with the cars CO 2 sensor plugs but that fault wasnt 
included in her July 2019 complaint to Moneybarn and Ive seen no evidence to show 
that she referred to issues with those plugs until after shed complained to this 
service  which was more than 18 months after the car was supplied to her;the car passed an MOT test in November 2020 when its mileage was recorded as 
98,960 and, although there were advisories, none of them related to issues with the 
cars engine or CO 2 emissions;
Mrs D says that shes paid for the car to be repaired and has continued to use it  but 
shes not provided invoices for those repairs to this service and Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that any of the issues about which shes now 
complaining were present when the car was supplied to her or caused it not to have 
been of satisfactory quality at that time; and
I sympathise with Mrs D for the issues that shes had with the car, the repair costs 
that shes incurred and the other difficulties that shes described, but I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Moneybarn to 
reimburse Mrs D for any of those repair costs, to pay for any further repairs, to pay 
her any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 December 2021.
