The complaint
Miss D and Miss H are unhappy that Inter Partner Assistance SA declined a claim they 
made on their travel insurance policy. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here 
again. Instead, Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
IPA has a responsibility to handle claims promptly and fairly. And, they shouldnt reject a 
claim unreasonably. 
Im not upholding Miss D and Miss Hs complaint because: 
Miss D and Miss Hs holiday wasnt cancelled for any of the specified reasons set out 
in the policy terms relating to cancellation. 
There is no cover for cancellation arising from a reason not listed in the 'what is 
covered' section.
I dont think theres cover under other sections of the policy either, for example 
missed departure. 
Travel insurance policies dont cover every eventuality and I dont think it would be 
fair and reasonable to conclude that Miss D and Miss Hs claim should be covered 
outside the policy terms. Miss D and Miss H may wish to look into making a 
complaint about their airline or travel provider via the relevant dispute resolution 
schemes that apply. 
IPA acknowledges that Miss D and Miss H didnt receive a good service at times. 
They apologised for this and offered Â£50 compensation. They also said theyd given 
feedback to the relevant departments. I think thats reasonable in the circumstances 
and fairly reflects the impact on Miss D and Miss H. 
My final decision
Im not upholding Miss D and Miss Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D and Miss H 
to accept or reject my decision before 11 January 2024.
