The complaint
Ms H is unhappy with The Co-operative Bank Plcs security procedures.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusion reached by the investigator that Co-op Bank 
havent done anything wrong. I do so for the following reasons:
Co-op Bank is entitled to put in place security procedures in order to prevent fraud. It 
is not the role of this service to interfere in its day to day business arrangements.
It required Ms H to speak to it on the telephone to resolve matters with her card and 
concerns about a large transaction that had been placed. I appreciate Ms H found it 
inconvenient to do so and wait times were very long. However, I dont think this was 
an unreasonable request for Co-op Bank to make.
I think Co-op Bank were correct not to release the funds purely based on the 
message it received from Ms H. Criminals can use quite sophisticated techniques, 
and there was no way for it to verify the transaction was truly authorised by Ms H 
without any outside interference  it needed to speak to her to confirm this.
My final decision
My final decision is that I reject Ms Hs complaint against The Co-operative Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 February 2022.
