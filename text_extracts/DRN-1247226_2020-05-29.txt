The complaint
Mr A complains that TSB Bank plc passed his loan to a third party to collect after he missed 
some payments.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
TSB contacted Mr A about the arrears on his account and wrote to him at the 
address it had on file. I note the address TSB wrote to is the same as the one Mr A 
has given our service. 
TSB defaulted the loan after Mr A missed around five payments over an eight month 
period. I'm satisfied Mr A's loan account had been in arrears for several months 
before TSB took the decision to close it and pass the debt to a third party. 
I understand Mr A was unwell during the period in question, but TSB's contact notes 
don't indicate that he told them about the difficulties he was experiencing. 
The terms and conditions say that if payments aren't made TSB will close the loan 
and pass the debt to a third party to collect.
As I'm satisfied TSB has dealt with Mr A's complaint fairly, I'm not telling it to take any 
further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 June 2020.
