K821x#15complaint
Mr F says Evergreen Finance London Limited,  trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk (MoneyBoat), 
irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about six short-term loans MoneyBoat  provided  to Mr F between  
March 2016 and November 2017.  Mr Fs borrowing history  is as follows  (I have rounded the 
figures):
LoanDate 
TakenDate 
RepaidInstalments Amount Repayment
1 16/03/2016 28/04/2016 2 £200.00 £117.00
2 12/07/2016 28/09/2016 3 £200.00   £89.00
3 02/12/2016 28/03/2017 4 £300.00   £90.00
4 05/07/2017 25/08/2017 2 £300.00 £190.00
5 30/08/2017 28/11/2017 3 £300.00 £144.00
 6 29/11/2017 08/02/2018 2 £400.00 £123.00
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Fs complaint and thought loans five and six shouldnt  
have been given. MoneyBoat disagreed  so the complaint  was passed to me for decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr F 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN97094752But certain factors might  point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MoneyBoat was required to establish  
whether Mr F could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Neither party has made any comments about loans  one to four not being uphold.  And 
because there doesnt  appear to be an outstanding dispute about  these loans,  I wont  be 
making a finding  on these  loans in this decision.  But I have thought about these loans in the 
overall context of Mr Fs lending relationship. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, Mr F took loan five only five days  after loan four had been paid 
off. Prior to that there had been much longer breaks   up to three months  - between loans 
being taken so this speedy refinancing  should have flagged up to MoneyBoat that Mr F was 
potentially having  problems managing his money  and consequently, sustainably  making  his 
repayments.
Loan six was only taken one day after loan five had been paid off which  was a further 
indication Mr F was starting to struggle. And Mr F has subsequently told us he was addicted 
to gambling. Also, loan six was the largest loan taken and was double the amount of loan 
one which  could question  whether the repayments had become, or were becoming,  
unsustainable.
Ref: DRN97094753A more meaningful  check for loans five and six would most likely have made clear that Mr F 
was borrowing from other short-term lenders. He was also using on line gambling sites on 
which he was betting often, and which totalled not insignificant amounts. Such financial 
behaviour should have  caused MoneyBoat to question whether  Mr F making loan 
repayments was sustainable and whether it should  have  continued  to lend to him. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans five and six and MoneyBoat should put things 
right.
putting things right  what MoneyBoat needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr F paid on loans  five and six;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans five and six from Mr Fs credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat must give Mr F a 
certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Fs complaint. 
Evergreen Finance  London Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2020.
