The complaint
Miss M complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money lent irresponsibly 
when it approved her credit card application and later increased the credit limit.
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. I said: 
In February 2021 Miss M applied for a credit card with 118 118 Money. In the application, 
Miss M said she was employed with an income of £1,690 a month. Miss M also said she was 
a council tenant in the application. No other regular outgoings were noted in the application. 
118 118 Money says it carried out a credit check and found Miss M owed around £4,200 to 
other lenders, had some defaults that were over two years old and a County Court 
Judgement (CCJ) that was around two years old as well.
118 118 Money says it applied its lending criteria to Miss Ms application and approved a 
credit card with a limit of £1,200.
118 118 Money went on to increase the credit limit to £2,000 in September 2021, £3,000 in 
March 2022 and £3,500 in December 2022.
Earlier this year, Miss M complained that 118 118 Money had lent irresponsibly and it sent 
her a final response on 14 March 2023. 118 118 Money said it had carried out reasonable 
checks when Miss M applied and before increasing the credit limit. 118 118 Money didnt 
uphold Miss Ms complaint.
Miss M referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
thought 118 118 Money shouldve carried out better checks, like reviewing Miss Ms current 
account statements to get a picture of her finances before approving the credit card or 
increasing the credit limit. The investigator reviewed Miss Ms bank statements and said they 
showed her income was sufficient to meet the increased borrowing costs and didnt uphold 
her complaint. 
Miss M asked to appeal and said that whilst the card was manageable when it was first 
approved, the increases to her credit limit had caused financial difficulties. Miss M added 
that she was using buy now pay later credit each month to make ends meet. As Miss M 
asked to appeal, her complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to considering complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending is set 
out on our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before providing credit, lenders need to complete reasonable and proportionate affordability 
checks. There isnt a set list of checks a lender is required to carry out, but it needs to 
ensure the checks are proportionate when considering things like: the type and amount of 
credit being provided, the size of the regular repayments, the total cost of the credit and the 
consumers circumstances.
I agree with the investigator that the information provided in the application Miss M made 
didnt include any figures to show her regular outgoings. And I can see that 118 118 Money 
found some defaults and a CCJ that were over two years old at the point of application. In 
the circumstances, I think 118 118 Money shouldve done more to check Miss M could 
sustainably afford repayments to a new credit card and requested some further information 
from her.
Miss M has supplied bank statements from around the time her application was approved. I 
can see Miss Ms income was made up wages she received and benefits. But the total 
income figure is somewhat higher than the one provided in the application. And Ive looked 
at Miss Ms regular outgoings for living expenses plus the cost of her existing credit. In my 
view, the statements show Miss M was in a position to manage repayments to a credit card 
as there were funds left once her living costs were paid. I havent been persuaded 118 118 
Money lent irresponsibly when it approved the credit card.
As Ive set out above, the credit limit was increased from £1,200 to £3,500 in stages 
between September 2021 and December 2022. 118 118 Money says that each time it 
increased Miss Ms credit limit it looked at her credit file and applied its lending criteria. 
Again, I think 118 118 Money shouldve carried out more comprehensive checks, like 
verifying Miss Ms income or reviewing her bank statements.
Ive looked at Miss Ms bank statements for the periods surrounding each credit limit 
increase. Whilst I can see Miss Ms income did vary over time, I didnt find evidence to show 
118 118 Money had acted unreasonably by approving the credit limit increase to £2,000 in 
September 2021. In my view, Miss Ms statements show she was in a position to maintain 
repayments at that level.
Ive reached a different conclusion to the investigator concerning the subsequent credit limit 
increases. In response to the investigator, Miss M pointed out she was using Buy Now Pay 
Later credit for day to day shopping to help make ends meet. Essentially, Miss M was using 
short term credit to cover her living expenses each month. Ive looked at Miss Ms statement 
for the month before 118 118 Money increased her credit limit to £3,000 in March 2022. I 
found Miss M had Buy Now Pay Later repayments that totalled over £1,100 in the preceding 
month. Had 118 118 Money looked at Miss Ms bank statements, I think it wouldve found 
shed become reliant on credit to make ends meet and wouldnt have increased the credit 
limit to £3,000.
In much the same way, Miss Ms bank statements from the period before the credit limit was 
increased to £3,500 show around 20 Buy Now Pay Later payments, totalling around £450. 
Again, I think this shows Miss M had become reliant on credit to manage normal living costs.
If 118 118 Money had seen Miss Ms statements, I think it wouldve found Miss M had 
become reliant on credit and declined to offer further lending.
Based on the information Ive seen so far, I intend to uphold Miss Ms complaint and direct 
118 118 Money to refund all interest, fees and charges applied to her credit card from March 
2022 onwards on balances over £2,000.I invited both parties to respond with any additional information or comments they wanted 
me to consider before I made my final decision. Miss M responded to say she is willing to 
proceed in line with the provisional decision. 118 118 Money responded and said it wasnt 
looking to challenge the outcome I reached. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has provided new information and both have confirmed theyre willing to 
proceed, I see no reason to change the conclusions I reached. I still think Miss Ms complaint 
should be upheld, for the same reasons. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss Ms complaint and direct Madison CF UK Limited trading as 
118 118 Money to settle as follows:
- Rework Miss Ms credit card balance to ensure all interest, fees and charges applied 
on balances over £2,000 from March 2022 onwards are refunded
- If the rework leaves Miss Ms balance over £2,000, 118 118 Money should administer 
the account so interest is only charged on the first £2,000. 118 118 Money should 
also contact Miss M to discuss affordable payment plans to bring the balance below 
£2,000
- Any adverse information recorded about balance over £2,000 from March 2022 
should be removed from Miss Ms credit file once the balance is reduced to that level
- If the effect of all adjustments results in there no longer being an outstanding 
balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments and returned to Miss M 
with 8% simple interest* from the date the overpayments were made until settlement
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to deduct tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Miss M a certificate showing how much tax its deducted if she asks for 
one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 December 2023.
