The complaint
 Mr K complained because PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA refused to refund him for a 
transaction he said he didnt make.
What happened
 On 31 October 2019, Mr K received an alert from PayPal saying that a payment of £714.99 
was about to be debited to his account. Mr K said he rang PayPal and told them he hadnt 
authorised this, and was reassured they would reject the payment. But the payment was 
debited from his PayPal account. 
So Mr K rang PayPal again and raised a dispute. But the next day, PayPal told him he had 
no case and the payment would be made.
Mr K got in touch with his bank. His bank refunded him, which resulted in a negative balance 
of £714.99 on Mr Ks PayPal account. Mr K received calls from PayPal asking him to pay. 
PayPal told him it would investigate, but didnt do so.  Mr K complained to this service on 4 
January 2020.
On 23 March, PayPal issued a final response to Mr K. It said the payment wasnt 
unauthorised. It said it believed Mr Ks account was secure, and said Mr K should ask 
members of his household if theyd used the PayPal account to make purchases.
The investigator upheld Mr Ks complaint and said PayPal should refund Mr K and bring his 
account back to a zero balance. He wasnt convinced that Mr K had made the payment 
himself, because hed contacted PayPal straightaway when he received the alert that the 
payment was about to be made, and Mr K had chased this up several times. The 
investigator also didnt think Mr Ks wife or children had made the transaction. He considered 
it was most likely that a third party had carried out the transaction and had diverted the 
shipping address from Mr K to another address. So the investigator thought PayPal should 
refund Mr K.
PayPal didnt agree. It said the investigator had made assumptions based on Mr Ks actions, 
and hadnt produced any evidence to back up these assumptions.
My provisional findings 
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. Before doing so, I considered all the 
available evidence and arguments to decide what would be fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision, I explained that the starting point here was that PayPal should be 
able to show that the disputed transaction was authorised by Mr K. PayPal had sent us 
computer evidence that showed someone had logged in to Mr Ks account that day using a 
mobile. But thats not the same as the authorisation of the particular payment. 
So I asked PayPal to provide further evidence of authentication and authorisation of the 
disputed transaction. It replied saying that the IP address used to log on on 31 October was 
the same as that which had been used for previous, undisputed, transactions on Mr Ks 
account. It also said Mr Ks account was found to be secure and has not been accessed by 
any third parties. It hasnt provided this service with anything to prove what its saying in this 
comment. But in any case, what matters here is the particular transaction. Information about 
the IP address used to log in that day, doesnt satisfy the requirement for evidence about the 
disputed transaction. It seems quite easy to imagine that there could be a time when, for 
example, a customer was logging into the account as normal, but a party gained access to 
an account later the same day.
I said that ultimately here, PayPal hadnt provided evidence that the £714.99 disputed 
transaction on 31 October 2019 was authorised by Mr K, or provided any evidence to show 
any authentication steps that were taken. With that in mind I looked at the other side of the 
dispute here in terms of the evidence and testimony provided by Mr K.
Mr Ks evidence had been clear and consistent that he didnt authorise the disputed 
payment. That was borne out by the fact that he contacted PayPal straightaway to dispute 
the transaction and to say it shouldnt be paid. He rang them again when, despite this, the 
payment did leave his bank, and he also contacted his bank. So he acted straightaway and 
followed it up. If he had indeed ordered the goods, which were trainers, I saw no reason why 
he couldnt have returned them for a refund with less hassle. 
I also bore in mind that the transaction wasnt typical of Mr Ks usual spend. I looked at his 
statements and these show much smaller amounts, typically under £50, and most apparently 
connected to Mr Ks work.
I recognised that the order was taken out with a delivery address which was Mr Ks. But he 
said he never received the goods, and I considered it would have been possible for a 
fraudster ordering the goods to have diverted the package to another address. In any event, 
everything here suggests that he didnt authorise the transaction. So without clear evidence 
to the contrary from PayPal, that meant I thought it would be fair that PayPal should refund 
the transaction.
Distress and inconvenience
Mr K told us that hed reported the fraudulent transaction straightaway, asking PayPal not to 
pay it, and had been assured theyd reject the transaction. This didnt happen and instead, 
Mr K didnt get answers from PayPal when he rang, despite assurances it would look into it. 
PayPal then started to make calls demanding payment, with what Mr K described as 
increasing forcefulness. By the time he complained to this service, PayPal was threatening 
court action. So I found that Mr K suffered considerable upset and distress as a result of this. 
Mr K was also worried that a marker might have been placed against his credit file, which he 
would have no means of removing. I didnt have access to credit file records so I didnt know 
whether PayPal did or didnt. So I explained that as part of this decision, I intended to order 
PayPal to remove any markers it might have placed against Mr Ks name as a result of the 
disputed transaction.
Taking into account Mr Ks difficulties in getting PayPal to give him answers and the 
increasingly worrying phone calls, I said that I intended to order PayPal to pay Mr K £250 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Responses to my provisional decisionMr K said he was happy to accept the provisional decision, and that it was a relief.
PayPal didnt accept the provisional decision. It sent a long letter.  The main points included:
- Not all information about the transaction had been recorded. So it said it couldnt be 
held liable, if it wasnt in a position to provide supporting documents on details not 
available. This included not being able to confirm what device had been used for the 
transaction;
- It didnt agree that a customer could have logged into the account one day, but 
someone could have gained access later in the day. It said it wanted to know how I 
believed a third party accessed Mr Ks account, with evidence to support this;
- It didnt agree that a fraudster ordering the goods could have diverted the package to 
another address. PayPal wanted me to provide supporting evidence from the 
merchant that the item had been delivered elsewhere.
- PayPal confirmed that it hadnt reported anything negative on Mr Ks credit file;
- It said it didnt threaten court action to recover money owed. Its Collections teams 
role was to inform people that the PayPal account would be limited until the money 
was recovered, or to pass accounts to outside collection agencies.
- PayPal said the compensation I intended to award was unfair and unreasonable for a 
process carried out on a daily basis.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Ill deal specifically with PayPals arguments below before explaining my final decision
PayPal didnt have the transaction evidence
There are regulations which govern disputed transactions. For disputed transactions taking 
place in October 2019, the relevant regulations are the Payment Services Regulations 2017. 
These say that the payment service provider (here, PayPal) must show the transaction was 
authenticated. And the regulations also say that its necessary to look at whether the card 
holder authorised the payments. In general terms, the bank is liable if the customer didnt 
authorise the payments, and the customer is liable if he did authorise them. 
The fact that PayPal hasnt provided evidence to show either authentication or authorisation 
is its own choice. Any organisation is entitled to decide what information it will and wont 
collect. But I have to consider any case impartially and here PayPal hasnt provided clear 
evidence to show that the payment was authenticated in the circumstances. That means I 
have to bear that in mind when considering whether its fair that PayPal is holding Mr K 
liable, given what the regulations say. And without evidence of authentication, the starting 
point here is that its unlikely that itll be fair and reasonable for PayPal to do that. But I have 
considered all the evidence and circumstances here  its not just this point that means I 
think its fair for PayPal to refund Mr K.
Account access and address for the order 
In my provisional decision, I said that providing evidence about the IP address which had 
been used to log in on the day of the disputed transaction didnt satisfy the requirement for 
evidence about the actual transaction. I still consider that genuinely logging in at some point 
during the day, doesnt prevent someone else from gaining access later.  PayPal says it wants me to provide evidence that a third party later accessed Mr Ks account 
 and also evidence from the merchant that the item had been delivered elsewhere. 
But the role of this service is to consider evidence put forward by both sides, and where that 
evidence may not be available  or is inconsistent or contradictory, to make an impartial 
decision about whats more likely than not to have happened, in the light of that evidence 
and all the circumstances of the case. Having done so, and taking particular account of the 
fact that PayPal hasnt provided authentication or authorisation evidence for the disputed 
transaction along with what Mr K has told us here, I still consider that its most likely than not 
that he didnt authorise the transaction for the reasons I gave in my provisional decision. And 
Im satisfied I have enough evidence here to reach that decision - so I find that PayPal 
should refund Mr K.
PayPal has also objected to the compensation proposed. But its in line with our approach to 
similar cases. I accept that PayPal was following an established process here but that 
doesnt mean that was fair in these circumstances. Ultimately here, I consider that Mr K 
suffered distress and inconvenience. He didnt get answers when he rang PayPal, despite 
assurances he would. He also clearly received calls from PayPal and agents it appointed 
which would have caused him worry, frustration and inconvenience over a period of time. 
Although PayPal has said it didnt place a marker against Mr Ks name, I can see why Mr K 
might have been worried about the impact of this situation on his wider financial position. Mr 
K would have had this worry and had to check his file which would have caused 
inconvenience. And he didnt receive any reassurance about this at the time. So I find that 
£250 compensation is fair and reasonable.
  
My final decision
  My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA 
to:
- remove the disputed £714.99, with any associated interest and charges, from Mr Ks 
account; and 
- pay Mr K £250 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
-
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 July 2021.
