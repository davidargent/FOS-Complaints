The complaint
Miss G complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) wrongly advised her that a 0% balance 
transfer would apply to a proposed purchase. She would like either the 0% honoured for 
three months or interest on her account refunded until the balance is cleared.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
I have listened to the two phone calls Miss G had with NewDay. The first adviser told 
Miss G if she took out  the 0% balance transfer offer, she would be able to make a 
purchase that would also be interest free. This  was incorrect.
Miss G then had a further phone call with a second adviser who advised her, if she 
went ahead with the transfer, purchases on the card  would incur interest.  So, I think 
Miss G knew she would incur interest on the £900 purchase she wanted to make. 
And she was  made aware of this prior to making the balance transfer. 
NewDay accepts it misled Miss G in its first phone call. It has refunded the balance 
transfer fee Miss G incurred  and  paid £25 compensation for the inconvenience 
caused. I think this reasonable in the circumstances.
I cant  reasonably ask NewDay to honour the 0% balance transfer as Miss G  
requested since  the second call made it clear the 0% balance wouldnt apply to 
purchases. Neither  can I reasonably ask NewDay to refund interest on Miss Gs 
account since I believe it has been correctly applied.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint
.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 March 2022.
