The complaint
Ms S complains that TransUnion International UK Limited (TransUnion) disclosed 
confidential data to her husband. Ms S wants TransUnion to pay her substantial 
compensation. 
What happened
In early 2021, Ms Ss husband appears to have tried to view his credit file using a third-party
business that I will refer to as C. But instead, ended up seeing information from his wifes
credit file.
Ms S says that due to the mix-up her husband was able to see information she wouldve
preferred to keep private.
Ms S complained to C in January 2021. She explained that after it sent her husband an
email, it allowed him to open Ms Ss credit report rather than his.
C investigated and said that it appeared Ms S and her husbands credit files had been
merged. C said the main reason this can happen is due to the quality of the data supplied to
TransUnion which meant it couldnt differentiate between Ms S and her husbands data. C
recommended that Ms S ask TransUnion to remove the incorrect data.
In April 2021, TransUnion apologised for the delay dealing with Ms Ss complaint. It said the
database had now been corrected. TransUnion said that it would consider compensating
Ms S for any direct financial loss subject to her giving evidence of this.
Ms S asked TransUnion to pay her at £2,000 for the distress caused a result of her husband 
seeing information she wanted to keep private. As Ms S wasnt happy with TransUnions
response to her complaint, she came to this service.
The investigator didnt recommend that Ms Ss complaint be upheld. He said that after 
TransUnion investigated the problem again, it didnt think it had merged the credit files. This
was because it didnt have any record of de-merging the credit files or of fixing the problem.
The investigator said it seemed unlikely that Ms Ss entire credit file had merged with her 
husbands. He thought it more likely that Ms Ss husband had mistakenly logged on to the
account that Ms S held with C.
When the investigator explained this to Ms S, she remained very unhappy with the way in 
which TransUnion had handled her complaint. The investigator explained that this service
cant investigate complaints handling in isolation if we dont think TransUnion had done 
anything wrong when providing credit references.
Ms S wasnt happy with the investigators view, so the complaint was passed to me.
My provisional findings
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Ms S 
and TransUnion on 6 January 2022. I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would first like to thank Ms S for her patience. I am very sorry to hear about the distress
that shes suffered because of her husband being able to access her personal data. I have
decided to issue a provisional decision because I do intend upholding Ms Ss complaint in
part. And because I want to give her and TransUnion the chance to respond to what Im
saying.
In cases like this, where the evidence is inconclusive, I reach my decision on the balance of
probabilities. That means Ill look at all the available evidence and decide what I think is most
likely to have happened. I should also say that this service cant punish or fine a business 
thats the role of the regulator.
From what Ms S told the investigator, it appears that her husband was able to access all or
at least much of her credit file. As the investigator explained to Ms S, its unusual for
everything on one credit file to be merged with another. The more common problem would
be that one or two pieces of data belonging to a third-party might appear. Im not saying that
what Ms S describes couldnt have happened  just that its unlikely.
It seems to me that the more likely scenario is that Ms Ss husband somehow accessed her
credit report when he clicked on the link that C sent. This may have been down to a problem
with C rather than TransUnion.
TransUnion says that as it has no record of fixing the problem it doesnt think it made a data
matching mistake which then led C to include information about Ms S on her husbands
credit report.
Although I appreciate Ms S says they dont share log-on details or store passwords on their 
devices, I dont have any credit reports or screenshots which show what data appeared on
her husbands credit report. This makes it difficult to say that TransUnion was at fault. The
only credit report that I have seen is one in Ms Ss name from TransUnion dated mid-April
2021. The only mention of Ms Ss husband relates to electoral roll entries. I cant see any
merging of financial data or other information. And theres nothing to suggest that 
TransUnion made any amendments to the data.
The suggestion of a data-matching problem appears to have started with C. TransUnion
then accepted this as the likely explanation when it sent Ms S its final response. Its for this
reason why I consider it reasonable to require TransUnion to pay Ms S compensation as the
investigation process was part and parcel of the service she received from TransUnion.
TransUnion had the opportunity to investigate the problem thoroughly before responding but
it doesnt seem to have done so. Ms S was then led to believe that TransUnion had made a
mistake with her data. I dont think that this was the case so I cant reasonably require
TransUnion to compensate Ms S for the distress that she felt when her husband was able to 
see her credit information. But I can require TransUnion to compensate Ms S for the poor
experience she encountered when trying to resolve the data problem. I think its reasonable
to distinguish this from a standalone complaint about complaints handling  which  as the
investigator said  isnt a regulated activity and therefore something this service doesnt
usually have the power to consider.
I understand that Ms S wants TransUnion to her pay substantial compensation and refers toother awards that this service has made but we decide each complaint on its individual
merits.
Ms S has already said she doesnt have evidence of direct financial loss, but shes given this
service compelling evidence of the upset she felt after her husband was able to see her
credit information. As Ms S says, this was made even worse by the pressures of lockdown
during the pandemic.
I dont wish to appear dismissive of what Ms S has told us. But as I dont consider her
husband was able to view her data due to a mistake that TransUnion made, my 
consideration of Ms Ss upset is limited to the impact caused by TransUnions failure to
properly investigate rather than the initial distress she felt when her husband viewed her
information.
Ms S may be disappointed, but I consider that the sum of £150 is reasonable compensation.
I just dont find any reason to award Ms S the level of compensation she has previously
mentioned to this service. I hope that she will understand.
My provisional decision only deals with the alleged data breach in early 2021 and
TransUnions investigation into that breach. If, as I understand to be the case, Ms Ss
husband is still able to view her data after receiving credit report updates from 
C/TransUnion, I recommend they raise this first with C. If after doing this, C says the
problem still lies with TransUnion, Ms S and/or her husband could complain again.
Putting things right
TransUnion International UK Limited should pay Ms S £150.
Further submissions
Ms S accepted my provisional decision, but TransUnion wanted clarity as to why I expected 
it to pay compensation when Ms S had logged on to another partys credit report as this was 
beyond the control of TransUnion.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I want to clarify that it wasnt Ms S who logged on to another partys credit report  it was her 
husband who appears to have logged on to Ms Ss TransUnion report using the service 
provided by C.
As I said in my provisional decision, TransUnion told Ms S that there had been a data-
matching problem when this probably wasnt the case. The award in my provisional decision 
recognised the impact TransUnions failure to properly investigate the alleged data breach 
had on Ms S. By giving her the wrong answer about what had happened, Ms S was caused 
further distress and felt it necessary to bring her complaint to this service. So, my view 
remains that TransUnion should put things right by doing as I set out in my provisional 
decision.  
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I require TransUnion International UK 
Limited to put things right by doing what Ive set out under the heading Putting things right above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 April 2022.
