K821x#15complaint
Mr N says Uncle Buck Finance LLP irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about six loans Uncle Buck provided to Mr N between March  2015 and 
August 2017.   Mr Ns borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Repayment
1 20/03/2015 27/03/2015 1 £250.00 £286.00
2 27/03/2015 28/04/2015 3 £125.00 £63.50
3 19/03/2016 28/04/2016 3 £100.00 £53.09
4 28/06/2016 28/07/2016 3 £125.00 £63.13
5 28/09/2016 28/10/2016 3 £100.00 £50.73
6 02/08/2017 25/08/2017 3 £175.00 £86.06
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ns complaint and thought  the loans from loan 1 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the information Uncle  Buck had gathered  about  him 
showed he was having problems managing his money because he had a number of 
outstanding short-term loans when Mr N was given  the first loan. 
Uncle Buck  disagreed and said Mr Ns credit file didnt show any outstanding  loans.  It also 
said the pattern  of Mr Ns borrowing  with the significant gaps between some  of the loans  
indicated he wasnt borrowing unsustainably.  Uncle Buck requested  an ombudsmans  review  
of the complaint and it was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr N 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN45412092the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  was required to establish 
whether Mr N could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
There were two significant breaks in Mr Ns borrowing from Uncle Buck.  There was a gap of 
around 11 months between loans  2 and 3. And another gap of around nine months between 
loans 5 and 6. I think it would be reasonable for Uncle Buck to view these gaps as an 
indication that Mr Ns finances had stabilised after whatever circumstances had caused  him 
to take out his previous  loans. So, I will look at Mr Ns borrowing in three separate lending 
chains. 
The first chain was made up of loans 1 and 2. The second chain  was loans 3 to 5. The final 
chain was loan 6. 
Ref: DRN45412093Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ns complaint. Having done  this, Im upholding Mr Ns 
complaint from loan 1. 
I think Uncle Buck ought to have realised that Mr N wouldnt have been  able to make his 
repayments for his loan sustainably without taking out more lending. I can see Uncle Buck 
did income/expenditure and credit checks on Mr N before it lent him loan 1. And I can see 
that Uncle Buck has provided its findings from those  checks,  including  the reports from the 
credit checks, to us. 
Having reviewed all of this, I dont think Mr N was able to repay any of his loans in a 
sustainable manner.   The credit check reports show that Mr N already  had several 
outstanding debts including other short-term loans as well as longer term loans. This 
information was apparent  each time Uncle Buck did a credit  check.  So, although there  were  
breaks in the lending,  it was aware  from the information it has provided, that Mr N would be 
unable sustainable  repay not just loan 1 but all the loans. 
I think this was a clear indication that Mr N was in a debt cycle and relying upon borrowing to 
repay borrowing. So, Im also upholding the complaint  about  loans 1 to 6 and Uncle  Buck 
should put things right.
putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr N paid on loans 1 to 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 1 to 6 from Mr Ns credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Uncle  Buck  to take off tax from this interest.  Uncle Buck  must 
give Mr N a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Ns complaint.  Uncle Buck Finance LLP 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 February  2020.
