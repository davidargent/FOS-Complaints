The complaint
Mrs H believes PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA acted irresponsibly by agreeing a revolving 
credit agreement shed applied for.
What happened
In January 2021, Mrs H was provided with a revolving credit account with PayPal. This 
account had a credit limit of £2,000.
Mrs H has complained that PayPal didnt act responsibly when approving the credit. Shes 
said she didnt think PayPal carried out appropriate affordability checks at the time her 
application was approved, as she was in financial difficulties at the time, wasnt working due 
to ill health, and was continually in her overdraft. So, she thought PayPal had made her 
financial situation worse.
PayPal considered this complaint, but they thought theyd done adequate checks, which 
showed that Mrs H could sustainably afford payments. And they didnt uphold her complaint.
Mrs H wasnt happy with this, so she brought her complaint to us for investigation.
When Mrs H made the application to PayPal, she declared a monthly income in the range of 
£2,001 to £2,500; and monthly committed expenditure of between £1 and £500. PayPal 
used the mid-point of these ranges and said that Mrs H had sufficient monthly disposable 
income to support the payments. PayPal also said that Mrs Hs credit file didnt show any 
defaults in the previous 12-months, and that they wouldnt automatically decline an applicant 
who wasnt working, but they would consider this as part of their overall lending decision. 
Our investigator said that, while Mrs H mayve shared finances with another person, PayPal 
shouldve assessed her affordability alone, as she was personally liable for the debt. And, as 
Mrs Hs credit search showed other credit commitments, they shouldve got a more thorough 
understanding of Mrs Hs day-to-day living costs.
The investigator considered Mrs Hs financial circumstances at the time of her application, 
and said her income was lower than shed declared, and that she was reliant upon payments 
from her ex-partner to maintain payments to her credit commitments. The investigator also 
thought that Mrs Hs bank statements showed a pattern of compulsive spending, which 
indicated she was unlikely to be able to sustain payments to PayPal without causing her 
significant financial difficulties.
Because of this, the investigator said that PayPal shouldnt have approved the application. 
And they said that, while Mrs H should be responsible for what she spent on the account, 
PayPal should refund any interest and charges, plus statutory interest, and apply this off any 
outstanding debt.
PayPal didnt agree with the investigator, and they asked for an ombudsman to make a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When someone complains about irresponsible and/or unaffordable lending, there are two 
overarching questions I need to consider in order to decide whats fair and reasonable in all 
of the circumstances of the complaint. These are:
1. Did PayPal complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mrs H 
would be able to repay the credit in a sustainable way?
a. if so, did PayPal make a fair lending decision?
b. if not, would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown that Mrs H 
could sustainably repay the borrowing?
2. Did PayPal act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
And, if I determine that PayPal didnt act fairly and reasonably when considering Mrs Hs 
application, Ill also consider what I think is a fair way to put things right.
Did PayPal complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mrs H would 
be able to repay the credit in a sustainable way?
Theres no set list for what reasonable and proportionate checks are, but Id expect lenders 
to consider things such as the amount, duration, and payments of the credit being applied 
for; as well as the borrowers personal circumstances at the time of each application. 
PayPal have explained they checked Mrs Hs credit file and considered this alongside the 
information Mrs H had provided in her application. And theyve provided a summary of this.
The information Mrs H provided shows she declared her employment as homemaker with 
an income range of £2,001 to £2,500 a month. She also declared that she had a mortgage 
and her monthly living expenses were between £1 and £500 a month. PayPals credit card 
summary shows that Mrs H had unsecured credit totalling £17,910, and that she didnt have 
any defaults or delinquent accounts within the previous two years.
I wouldnt have expected PayPal to decline this application just because Mrs H had declared 
herself to be a homemaker. However, I would expect PayPal to take this into consideration 
when making their lending decision. And, while they say they did this, Im not satisfied that 
the checks PayPal did were reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances. 
While Mrs H declared an income in excess of £2,000 a month, this doesnt match with her 
declared employment. Whats more, declared total monthly expenses of £500 seems low for 
someone who says they have a mortgage. And, while PayPals summary says Mrs H owed 
almost £18,000, theres nothing to show what her committed payments to this debt were.
As such, Id expect PayPal to have done further checks to verify Mrs Hs actual income and 
expenditure, so they could assess whether the agreement was sustainably affordable.
Would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown that Mrs H would be able to repay 
the credit in a sustainable way?Mrs H has provided copies of her bank statements for the period 1 November to 31 
December 2020. While I wouldnt necessarily have expected PayPal to have asked Mrs H 
for copies of these, Im satisfied that the statements would give a good indication of what 
PayPal would likely have taken into consideration had they asked Mrs H to prove her income 
and committed expenditure during that specific period.
The bank statements show that Mrs Hs sole source of income was from benefits, which 
averaged £1,627 a month. However, she also received an average of £1,228 a month from 
her ex-partner. Mrs H has explained that her partner would help her out as and when she 
needed it. Mrs H also received ad-hoc payments from winnings from lottery and raffle 
syndicates.
The statements show that Mrs H was paying an average of £605 a month for her council tax, 
energy, insurances, and telephone; and a further £432 a month to her existing credit 
commitments. There is no mortgage showing on these statements, although they do show 
Mrs H was spending around £223 a month on food. And they show that Mrs H had a £500 
overdraft which she used occasionally during each month.
However, the bank statements show multiple online shopping transactions, mainly to two 
companies, but with multiple purchases each day. And these purchases averaged £1,969 a 
month. In addition to the purchases with these two companies, there were other online 
shopping transactions, and Mrs H regularly made direct payments to people, with the 
references indicating purchases had been made through an online marketplace.
Allowing for these payments, even given the support Mrs H was receiving from her ex-
partner, Mrs H was spending more each month than she was regularly receiving. Shes 
explained that her physical and mental health problems had resulted in a compulsive 
spending habit at the time of the application to PayPal. And, had PayPal done reasonable 
and proportionate checks to verify her income and outgoings, this wouldve become obvious 
to them.
As such, Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks wouldve shown that Mrs H 
was unable to sustainably repay the credit. And, given this, PayPal shouldnt have approved 
the application. So, I think they should now do something to put things right.
Did PayPal act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
I havent seen anything to make me think PayPal acted unfairly or unreasonably in some 
other way.
Putting things right
Mrs H made use of the credit facility PayPal provided, and she purchased goods and/or 
services with this. As such, its only fair that she pays for these. However, as PayPal 
shouldnt have approved her application, I dont think its fair that she should pay any interest 
and charges. So, PayPal should refund these, along with statutory interest.
Therefore, if they havent already done so, PayPal should:
end the agreement; and
refund all interest and charges (including any Buy Now Pay Later interest) applied to 
Mrs Hs account
PayPal should calculate how much Mrs H wouldve owed, after the adjustments above. They 
should then deduct any repayments Mrs H has paid since the account was opened. If Mrs H has paid more than the adjusted balance, then PayPal should:
refund any surplus balance to Mrs H; 
apply 8% simple yearly interest on the refund, calculated from the date Mrs H made 
the overpayments to the date of the refund; and
remove all adverse entries relating to this agreement from Mrs Hs credit file.
However, if any outstanding balance remains, then PayPal should:
if applicable, recover any debt back from any third-party to whom it mayve been sold 
to OR liaise with the debt owner to ensure that all steps are undertaken;
arrange an affordable repayment plan with Mrs H, while taking into consideration the 
FCA requirements to treat customers in financial difficulties with forbearance and due 
consideration; and
when the debt has been fully repaid, remove all adverse entries relating to this 
agreement from Mrs Hs credit file.
HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal to take off tax from this interest. PayPal must give 
Mrs H a certificate showing how much tax theyve taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons explained, I uphold Mrs Hs complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA. And they are to follow my directions above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 October 2023.
