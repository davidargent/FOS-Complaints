The complaint
Mr M complains that MBNA Limited (MBNA) lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr M opened his MBNA credit card account in May 2021. In May 2022, he had a limit of 
£7,400 and on the May 2022 statement the balance was £3,545 debit.
In May 2022, MBNA offered to increase Mr Ms limit to £12,400. He accepted the offer and 
the limit was increased.
Between September 2022 and November 2022, Mr M made ATM cash withdrawals totalling 
£3,220 in 12 withdrawals. I have summarised the account here:
Statement date Balance (debit) Limit Paid in Cash withdrawn
June 2022 £0 £12,400 £3,653 0
July 2022 £457 £12,400 £5,849 0
August 2022 £1,462 £12,400 £1,000 0
September 2022 £1,926 £12,400 £110 0
October 2022 £2,868 £12,400 £610 £1,220 (6 withdrawals)
November 2022 £8,647 £12,400 £1.810 £2,000 (6 withdrawals)
December 2022 £8,453 £12,400 £263 0
Mr M complained. He said:
- He was overindebted at the time of the increase and MBNA couldnt have done 
sufficient checks.
- Because of the increase, he then withdrew cash and paid cash withdrawal fees  
which were unfair.
- He now had a large debt to MBNA.
- He was vulnerable at the time.
- He says the cash withdrawal fees should be refunded and the debt partially written 
off.
MBNA didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint and said:
- They only offer an increase in limit to cardholders when its responsible to do so. Mr 
Ms account conduct was good at the time of the offer.
- Mr M could call MBNA at any time to ask for a reduction in credit limit, or to request 
there are no increases offered.
- Mr M was free to use his card as he wished, including the withdrawing of cash. Cash 
withdrawal fees are shown on each of the monthly statements.
- There was no indication of any vulnerabilities in Mr Ms records at the time of the 
increase in limit.
Mr M brought his complaint to us. Our investigator didnt uphold it. He said:
- When the limit increase was offered, there was nothing to suggest Mr M was in 
financial difficulty.
- He made regular payments to the account  some of them large.
- Between May 2022 and November 2022, Mr M paid the account up to date and 
usually exceeded the minimum payment needed.
- Mr M provided a copy of his credit report  and this showed he was up to date with all 
of his credit commitments at the time of the limit increase.
Mr M asked that an ombudsman looks at his complaint, and so it has come to me to make a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
All lenders have an obligation to lend money responsibly. We have to check whether MBNA 
acted in line within the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules on creditworthiness 
assessment as set out in its handbook, (CONC) section 5.2. These say that a firm must 
undertake a reasonable assessment of creditworthiness, considering both the risk to it of the 
customer not making the repayments, as well as the risk to the customer of not being able to 
make repayments. We look at:
Whether the lender completed reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that the borrower would be able to repay any credit in a sustainable way?
If reasonable and proportionate checks were completed, did the lender make a fair 
lending decision bearing in mind the information gathered and what the lender knew 
about the borrowers circumstances?
And a reasonable and proportionate check would usually need to be more thorough:
othe lower a customers income, and the higher amount to be repaid. 
othe greater the number of loans and frequency of loans.
othe longer the term of the loans
I looked at the limit increase with this guidance in mind.MBNA said Mr M passed their credit checks when they offered the increase. They told us 
this showed he had loan debts of £27,207, and revolving debts of £9,770. We asked Mr M 
for his credit report  as this would show his financial position at the time, and what MBNA 
could see. So  this is an important document. Mr M showed this to us and it showed that as 
at May 2022:
- There were total debts of £47,500 on four credit cards/ bank current account and a 
loan agreement. While this may look high  I could see they were all paid to date.
- A payday loan was paid off in October 2022  it ran for one month.
- There were no County Court Judgements (CCJs), defaults or arrears on any of Mr 
Ms credit agreements.
So, what this means is  it appeared that Mr M was managing his finances well, and could 
afford the payments to all his lenders. MBNA wouldve seen this  and therefore, Im 
satisfied they made reasonable and proportionate checks.
Added to this, it can be seen that he was managing his MBNA account well  he was making 
payments to it, and sometimes paid it off completely.
I know Mr M has argued he did that by drawing on his other credit cards  but if this was on 
balance transfers, its more likely than not that these were at preferential (or zero) rates of 
interest  and so benefitted him in terms of lower interest paid.
Turning to the cash withdrawals  Mr M argues these were signs he was in financial difficulty 
and shouldve been a warning sign to MBNA. But here  they took place after the event of 
the limit increase: we cant expect MBNA to have known he was going to make the cash 
withdrawals when he agreed to the increase. And  I agree that the fees for the cash 
withdrawals are set out on Mr Ms monthly statements (fees are shown as 5%), as is the 
interest rate. I think its reasonable to say that Mr M was free to use his credit limit as he 
wished.
Mr M has argued that he was vulnerable at the time. So we asked MBNA about that. They 
confirmed Mr M called them in December 2022  to say he was in financial difficulty and was 
therefore vulnerable, and MBNA noted that. But here  this was after the limit increase in 
May 2022  and we cant reasonably expect MBNA to have considered Mr M as vulnerable 
at that time if he hadnt advised them as such.
Mr M has recently said he made further cash withdrawals in February 2023. But  as these 
were after MBNAs final response (dated November 2022), this is not something we can look 
at. If Mr M wishes to bring a further complaint about those, he should contact MBNA in the 
first instance.
I appreciate Mr M feels strongly about his complaint and therefore will be disappointed by my 
decision, but Im not asking MBNA to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 January 2024.
