The complaint
Mr C complains that the refinance of his Buy to Let (BTL) mortgage with Hampshire Trust
Bank Plc (HTB) took too long and as a result cost him money. 
What happened
 Mr C had a BTL mortgage with HTB. It was drawn down in February 2019  the balance 
was £270,300. It was agreed that interest at 7.8% was rolled up for nine months. So, by 
February 2020, the balance was £292,143. The loan was due to be repaid in February 2020 
 after 12 months.
In December 2019, Mr C asked his brokers to look for refinance in time for the expiry. He 
agreed to ask for refinance from HTB. A decision in principle (DIP) was issued to Mr C on 8 
January 2020  for an interest-only loan of £300,000 at a fixed interest rate of 4.39% for five 
years. The fee quoted was £6,000.
On 12 February 2020, HTB asked Mr C to sign a three-month extension to the previous loan
 through to 13 May 2020. Interest of £1,886.37 a month was to be paid by Mr C, with a 
fee of £295.
On 20 March 2020, HTB issued a mortgage offer to refinance the original loan  for
£290,700 for ten years, at a fixed interest rate of 4.59% (for five years). The loan was 
interest - only with monthly payments of £1,119. The arrangement fee was £5,700. The 
loan of £290,700 was drawn-down on 11 August 2020.
Mr C complained. He said that the time taken to complete the loan was far too long. His 
brokers had told him it would be quicker to stay with HTB rather than go to another lender. 
Hed had a DIP in January 2020  and it had taken from then until August 2020 to arrange 
the loan. As a result, he had to sign an extension agreement - and he had paid a lot more 
interest and fees to HTB than he should have. He couldnt see how he saved £8,444 that 
HTB claimed he had.
In September 2020, HTB said the minimum time for a loan to be arranged was 12 weeks. 
They apologised if Mr C hadnt been made aware of that at the time. There had been delays 
with documents being supplied by Mr Cs solicitor  which had to be chased by HTBs 
solicitor. The administration fee for the extension agreement was £295. Normally, they would 
also charge a 0.5% arrangement fee - £1,460.71- but this had been waived. Under the terms 
of the extension, Mr C had to pay monthly interest of £1,886.47. So, HTB said that between 
March 2020 and redemption in August 2020, he shouldve paid £11,318.82. But hed only 
paid £4,335.19  so hed benefitted from £6,983.63 in unpaid interest. Added to the fee 
waiver of £1461.71, Mr C had saved £8,444.34. So  HTB said that compensated for any 
delays hed experienced.
Mr C brought his complaint to us. Our investigator considered that HTB had acted fairly. He 
could see there had been some delays in HTB receiving information from Mr Cs solicitors 
and brokers. HTB had admitted the service Mr C received was below what it would 
normally expect. If Mr C had been misled by his broker about the probable timescale, he 
should approach them  they were separate to HTB. Mr C had signed the extension 
agreement and so was bound by it  and this included the payment of monthly interest of 
£1,886.47. And Mr C hadnt paid that during the period between March 2020 and August 
2020. Our investigator said that Mr C had benefitted by £8,444.34 in unpaid interest and 
fees  so he didnt think HTB need do anything further.
Mr C asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
 I reached a provisional decision where I said:
The crux of Mr Cs complaint is:
His brokers said it would be a quick process if he remortgaged with HTB  as 
his existing mortgage was with them.
HTB took too long to compete the work needed to put his remortgage in place.
He was forced to sign the extension agreement  he couldnt afford to pay 
the monthly interest instalments of £1,886. If the work for the new loan had 
been completed on time, this wouldnt have been needed.
Because of the delays, he had to pay more interest and fees to HTB.
He cannot see how hes saved interest and fees of £8,444 that HTB claim he has.
Ive considered all the points that Mr C has made. Looking at the first one  we cant 
expect HTB to be responsible for something that Mr Cs brokers said to him  so he should 
speak to them about that  if he feels they misled him.
Ive then looked at the processes that took place to put Mr Cs remortgage in place. The DIP 
was issued on 8 January 2020. But its important to note that  this was only a decision in 
principle, not a formal loan offer. The DIP does say that several matters need to be dealt 
with before a loan offer could be made  including production of tax documents, an 
application form, a valuation of the property, and details of Mr Cs property portfolio. Until 
HTB could make a formal offer of a mortgage, they couldnt start work on the processes. And 
as HTB were being asked to agree a new mortgage for a ten-year period, on an interest-only 
basis  I think it was reasonable that they completed their underwriting checks before they 
could agree to the new loan  and these would take some time. Following completion of the 
work included in the DIP, the formal offer was made on 20 March 2020. And - the work on 
the processes started at HTB when the offer was made  on 20 March 2020. I can see that 
HTB instructed their solicitors to start work on 23 March 2020. This was reasonable  and 
the work couldnt have started with the DIP in January 2020.
Ive looked at the details of what took place between HTBs solicitors, HTB, Mr Cs solicitors 
and Mr Cs brokers. I can see that HTBs solicitors appeared to be vigilant and chased the 
other parties on a frequent basis. They had to chase Mr Cs solicitors or his brokers for 
information ten times during the period, which wouldnt have been helpful to the overall 
timescales. Therefore, I cant say with any certainty that the time taken was unreasonable.
Mr C signed the extension agreement dated 12 February 2020 on 16 March 2020. This 
said that HTB would extend the original loan to 13 May 2020  rather then it being repaid 
on 13 February 2020. It said the terms of the old mortgage continued  so the interest rate 
remained the same. Mr C said to us that he couldnt afford to pay the monthly interest of
£1,886  and he had no choice but to sign the agreement. Ive thought about this. The 
existing loan agreement was at an interest rate of 7.8% - and interest was being rolled up 
into the balance for nine months. It was drawn down in February 2019  so after 
November 2019, Mr C was going to have to pay interest on the balance - which was £286,484 in November 2019. This wouldve been around £1,862 a month. This was 
included in the original loan offer dated August 2018. So  the extension agreement dated 
February 2020  was only putting in place what was included as part of the original loan 
anyway. So  I think it was reasonable for HTB to ask Mr C to pay the monthly interest of 
£1,886.
There was an additional cost to Mr C because of the extension agreement. This was - the 
difference between the monthly interest on the extension loan of £1,886  and the monthly 
interest on the new loan  which was £1,119 a month. The difference was because the new 
mortgage was at a much lower interest rate (4.59%) than the old mortgage (7.8%). For the 
reasons Ive outlined, I think its reasonable that he had to pay this.
HTB said in their final response that Mr C had saved £8,444 because he hadnt paid the 
interest of £1,886 a month between March 2020 and August 2020, and theyd not charged 
him the arrangement fee of £1,460 for the extension loan in February 2020. Mr C didnt 
understand this  and neither do I. I dont agree that there was such a saving. Mr C was 
required to pay £1,886 a month  by paying into the mortgage account. HTB intended that 
Mr C do this to cover the interest on the loan  so the balance didnt go up. I can see from 
the mortgage statements that he actually paid £2,781 between March 2020 and August 
2020. If hed paid in £1,886 a month  he wouldve paid £11,316. But  that doesnt mean 
he saved the difference of £8,535  it was simply that he didnt have to pay the cash. But 
- the interest of £1,886 a month was still debited to the mortgage account and was shown 
in the debit balance. The debit balance on the loan went up from £292,143 in March 2020 
to £300,983 in August 2020  this was due to the interest not being covered by Mr C. And 
 Mr C will eventually have to pay this off. So - its not fair for HTB to argue that he saved 
money. Theyve also said that they didnt ask him to pay an arrangement fee of 0.5% for 
the extension loan  but this wasnt quoted in the facility letter, nor does it appear in HTBs 
price list  so again, I dont think they can say that they waived this fee.
We asked HTB twice about the apparent saving that they quoted  and they repeated their 
calculations and argument. I can see that HTBs comments that they saved Mr C this 
money has caused a lot of confusion on the part of Mr C  and so I think HTB should pay 
some compensation for this error. And  given that they quoted this in their final response, 
and then repeated it a further two times  I think an award of £250 is right. I appreciate that 
this doesnt uphold Mr Cs main complaint  but I hope it will go some way to putting things
right for him.
Responses to the provisional decision:
HTB accepted what I said. Mr C agreed with what Id said about the fact that interest hadnt 
been waived in the way that HTB claimed. But also:
He didnt understand my comment about interest still being payable on the old loan.
But he wanted to make his case again  that HTB were slow in completing the 
security processes. He showed us 46 pieces of correspondence between HTB 
solicitors and his solicitors. He said that these dealt with simple matters and 
shouldve been completed much earlier than they had. And so  he should receive a 
refund of interest of £2,829  being half the interest charged by HTB after 13 May 
2020 up to completion. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered Mr Cs further points. On the matter of the interest on the loan  I said The 
debit balance on the loan went up from £292,143 in March 2020 to £300,983 in August 2020 
 this was due to the interest not being covered by Mr C. And  Mr C will eventually have to 
pay this off. To clarify  I wasnt saying that there was outstanding interest on the old loan 
was somehow remaining, unaccounted for. I was just explaining that the unpaid interest on 
the old loan was reflected in the final balance when it was replaced by the new refinanced 
loan in August 2020. And so  as the amount of the new loan was increased by that amount 
 and eventually, it will have to be repaid by Mr C as he makes repayments to the new loan. 
I hope that explains things.
On Mr Cs further arguments  Ive reviewed the correspondence he sent to us. They relate 
to many processes needed to complete HTBs security checks  such as insurance details, 
ID documents, tenancy information, settlement figures on the old loan. I have to say that its 
not possible for me to challenge HTBs security processes  thats for them to determine as 
part of their commercial model. But from what Ive seen, the checks look reasonable and 
necessary. And as I said in the provisional decision, I did see several requests from HTBs 
solicitors chasing missing information  so there are arguments on both sides here.
And so, on balance, I am not going to change my provisional decision and for the reasons 
Ive set out.
My final decision
My final decision is to uphold this complaint. And Hampshire Trust Bank Plc must:
Pay Mr C an award of compensation of £250 for distress and inconvenience. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 January 2022.
