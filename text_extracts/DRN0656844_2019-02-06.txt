K821x#15complaint
Mr D complains that CURO TRANSATLANTIC  LIMITED (trading as WageDayAdvance) was 
irresponsible to continue  to lend to him. He further complains that WageDayAdvance 
addressed him incorrectly in its correspondence.
background
Mr D had six loans from WageDayAdvance  between December 2013 and October 2015 as 
follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Scheduled Repayment Repaid
1 9 Dec 2013 £200 11d £259 20 Dec 2013 27 Dec 2013,  late
2 14 Jan 2014 £350 14d £453.25 28 Jan 2014 On time
3 21 Feb 2014 £215 1m £278.43 28 Mar 2014 On time
4 21 Dec 2014 £415 17m £99.38 27 May 2016 10 Jun 2015, early
5 20 Jul 2015 £510 1m £757.56 28 Aug 2015 15 Sep 2015, late
6 28 Oct 2015 £400 1m £496 27 Nov 2015 4 May 2016,  2 deferrals
Mr D says the loans  trapped him into a debt spiral and that WageDayAdvance should have 
realised his debt problems were getting  worse due to the rollovers and missed  payments. He 
says his credit report would have shown late payments and defaults and he was on a debt 
management plan for some of his accounts. Mr D says he also had a gambling  habit which  
WageDayAdvance would have seen if it had carried out further checks.
WageDayAdvance upheld Mr Ds complaint  in part and offered to refund  interest  and 
charges on loans 4 to 6. WageDayAdvance  says it asked Mr D about his income and 
expenditure and found  loans 1 to 3 to be affordable. However, it now believes it should have 
conducted further checks before approving loans 4 to 6.
WageDayAdvance has now also apologised to Mr D for the mistake in its correspondence  
and has amended its systems accordingly.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He accepted  
WageDayAdvance had already upheld Mr Ds complaint about loans 4 to 6, but he also 
considered it should  have  done better checks before  approving loans 2 and 3. He found that, 
had it done so, WageDayAdvance  is likely  to have discovered that Mr D owed over £1,000  to 
other short-term loan companies. So our adjudicator didnt consider loans 2 and 3 were  
affordable and recommended WageDayAdvance should refund  interest  and charges on the 
loans (plus 8% statutory interest) and remove any associated negative  information from his 
credit file.
WageDayAdvance responded to say, in summary,  that it did not agree with the adjudicators  
assessment of loans  2 and 3. It said it did not consider the second loan application  to be 
significantly higher  than the first and the repayment  was only just over 30% of the declared 
income. It said the repayment was affordable based  on Mr Ds declared disposable income.  
It added that it didnt consider Mr D had established  a pattern of lending  and, as loan 3 was 
smaller than loan 2, it could indicate  an improvement in Mr Ds circumstances.
Ref: DRN06568442my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
WageDayAdvance was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make 
sure Mr D could  afford to repay the loans  before  it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr D was borrowing, and his lending  history.  But 
there was no set list of checks WageDayAdvance had to do.
As WageDayAdvance  has already agreed to uphold Mr Ds complaint about loans 4 to 6, I 
wont consider those further here.
Loan 1
When Mr D applied for his first loan from WageDayAdvance, he told it his income  was 
£1,400 and his regular  expenditure was £650.  As this was Mr Ds first loan, and the 
scheduled repayment was a small proportion  of his income, Im satisfied WageDayAdvance 
didnt need to carry out any further  checks before deciding  loan 1 was affordable.
Loan 2
WageDayAdvance used the same information  about  Mr Ds income and expenditure when it 
considered his second loan application. However,  I dont  think  the checks went  far enough 
this time. I say that because Mr Ds first repayment  was late, hed almost doubled his loan 
application and the scheduled repayment  was almost one-third of Mr Ds monthly income. I 
cant agree  with WageDayAdvance when it says this increase was not significant, especially 
in relation to Mr Ds income. I accept that WageDayAdvance says the repayment was 
affordable out of his £750 disposable income, but I consider it should have asked Mr D 
whether he had any other outstanding short-term  loans at the time.
Had it done so, I think  its likely WageDayAdvance would have found that Mr D needed to 
repay over £2,200  to four other  short-term  loan companies out of the same monthly income  
with which  he was making the loan 2 repayment. So I cant  conclude that loan 2 was 
affordable to him.
Loan 3
Again, WageDayAdvance  had the same  information  about Mr Ds income and expenditure 
when he applied for loan 3. As this was Mr Ds third loan in as many months, I still dont think  
WageDayAdvances checks  went far enough, even though the loan amount had reduced.  
Proportionate checks should have  included considering Mr Ds other short-term loans and, 
although much lower than the previous month, his outstanding payments still totalled  almost 
£700, making loan 3 unaffordable.
In summary,  I find WageDayAdvance should  refund the interest Mr D paid on loans 2 and 3, 
as well as loans 4 to 6 for which it has already made  an offer.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. CURO TRANSATLANTIC LIMITED (trading as 
WageDayAdvance) should:
Ref: DRN06568443Refund all interest  and charges that Mr D paid on loans 2 to 6;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loans 2 to 6 from Mr Ds credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires WageDayAdvance to take off tax from this interest. 
WageDayAdvance must give Mr D a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he 
asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 March 2019.
