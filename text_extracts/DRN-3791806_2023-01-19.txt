The complaint
Mr R complains that MBNA Limited wont refund to him the money that he paid for some 
migration services. His wife is also involved with his complaint.
 
What happened
Mr R used his MBNA credit card in February 2022 to make two payments of £2,700 each to 
a migration company for some advice about migrating. Mr B tried to cancel his contract with 
the migration company within 14 days but it had already started providing advice to him. 
He contacted MBNA in March 2022 and it credited the two payments back to his account 
and made a chargeback claim to the migration company. That claim was defended by the 
migration company so MBNA debited the credits from Mr Rs account in May 2022 and it 
considered a claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that it didnt 
consider that there was evidence that a breach of contract had occurred or that the contract 
was induced by misrepresentation. Mr R wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to 
this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He said that the 
contract shows that the service purchased was immigration advice - which was provided - 
and he said that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that there had been a clear 
misrepresentation. He also said that the cancellation period ended when the migration 
company started providing the migration services to Mr R.
Mr R has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary 
and amongst other things, that:
hes still unclear why he wasnt allowed to cancel the contract within 14 days and 
receive a full refund;
the migration company said that it would cancel his contract and refund his 
payments; and
it said that the total fee was £4,500 plus VAT and that he wouldnt have to pay any 
more than that.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
if a consumer disputes a card payment, the card issuer may be able to make a 
chargeback claim to the merchant under the relevant card scheme to try to settle the 
dispute - Mr R made the payments to the migration company using his credit card 
and when he contacted MBNA in March 2022 it made a chargeback claim for the 
payments;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made but, if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
MBNA credited the two payments back to Mr Rs account but the chargeback claim 
was defended by the migration company and MBNA decided that it couldnt pursue a 
chargeback any further  it then debited the credits from Mr Rs account in May 2022;
MBNA had made a chargeback claim which had been defended by the migration 
company and I dont consider that there was a reasonable prospect of the 
chargeback claim being successful at that time so I consider that it was fair and 
reasonable for MBNA to decide not to pursue the chargeback claim any further;
MBNA then considered a claim under section 75 - section 75 gives a consumer an 
equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit 
if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
MBNA didnt uphold his claim because it didnt consider that there was evidence that 
a breach of contract had occurred or that the contract was induced by 
misrepresentation  and Mr R then complained to this service;
to be able to uphold his complaint about MBNAs response to his section 75 claim, I 
must be satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
migration company and that MBNAs response to his claim under section 75 wasnt 
fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Rs claim under 
section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
the contract that was signed by Mr R in February 2022 says: Our fees for providing 
expert information and advice during your detailed consultation are [£]4,500 
excluding VAT;
Mr R paid a total of £5,400 to the migration company (which is £4,500 plus VAT) and 
its clear that he wasnt expecting to have to pay the level of further charges that were 
required following the consultation meeting;
but the fee was for the consultation and when Mr R asked the migration company to 
provide further services beyond that consultation further charges would be payable;
I consider that the contract could have been clearer about what Mr R was paying for 
and the charges that would be payable for further services, but he received the 
consultation that hed paid for and Im not persuaded that the consultation included 
the further services that he required; 
after Mr R had received some services from the migration company, and when he 
became aware of the further charges that would be payable, he said that he wanted 
to cancel the contract;
the migration companys representative said that she would send the cancellation 
request to the accounts team to process the cancellation and asked him to send an 
e-mail to initiate the refund process  but as Mr R had received some services from 
the migration company he was no longer entitled to cancel the contract;
the contract says:  you have the right to cancel the contract. You have a cooling 
off period of 14 days but this must be done prior to the provision of immigration 
advice;
as Mr R had received some migration advice under the contract before he asked to 
cancel the contract, he no longer had the right to cancel the contract and Im not 
persuaded that the migration company acted incorrectly when it said that he couldnt 
cancel the contract at that time;the migration company had said that the total fee would be £4,500 plus VAT and that 
Mr R didnt owe anything else even if the contract stated otherwise  but I consider 
that that statement related to the charges for the consultation and not the further 
services that Mr R then asked the migration company to provide;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract or misrepresentation by the migration company in these circumstances 
and I consider that MBNAs response to Mr R was fair and reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mr R for the issues that hes experienced but I find that it wouldnt 
be fair or reasonable for me to require MBNA to refund to him any of the money that 
he paid to the migration company, to pay him any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2023.
