The complaint
Mr R is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal), didnt reimburse him for 
funds he lost after he fell victim to a scam. Mr R is also unhappy with the service he received 
from PayPal.
What happened
In October 2019, Mr R was looking to purchase a tractor. After being in contact with the 
seller, Mr R received an invoice request on 27 October 2019 for £10,000 for the tractor he 
wished to buy. 
Mr R says prior to making the payment he spoke with PayPal via its chat function on 
28 October 2019 and it confirmed to him the account was genuine. Hed also been in touch 
with PayPal about how to pay an invoice and instructions were sent to him. Following this, 
Mr R says he went ahead and made the payment. 
The next day Mr R contacted PayPal in relation to the payment hed made on 28 October 
2019, to say it was not showing on his history. He received a reply to say the payment of 
£10,000 had been successfully paid. 
 
When the seller stopped communicating with Mr R and the tractor didnt arrive, Mr R 
contacted PayPal about the matter.
Mr R came to our service in December 2019 and the complaint was raised with PayPal 
through our service. PayPal sent its final response letter to Mr R on 9 January 2020. It would 
not cover the £10,000 as the payment hadnt been made through PayPal. PayPal said 
instructions were sent to Mr R on how to pay an invoice through a PayPal account but that 
this was not completed.  Mr R had made the payment for the tractor directly from his bank 
account. 
However, PayPal did acknowledge Mr R contacted its customer service team after hed sent 
the payment and an email was sent to him to confirm hed paid. PayPal say this as on the 
basis the invoice had been marked as paid. But no payment had been completed. 
It also recognised Mr R had requested a call back but did not receive it. PayPal said it 
appreciated the email its customer service team sent after the payment had been made may 
have led him to believe hed paid through PayPal when he had not. It apologised for this and 
it offered to credit £150 towards the customer service issues after Mr R made the payment. 
Mr R remained unhappy with PayPals response. He maintained PayPal should arrange to 
reimburse him for the funds hed lost and, given the stress and worry caused there should be 
a significant offer of compensation. 
One of our investigators looked into things. Having considered the information provided to 
him by both parties he found the payment had been made directly from Mr Rs bank account 
and not through his PayPal account. He said because it hadnt been made through the 
PayPal account, he was unable to hold PayPal liable for the transaction made. 
However, our investigator thought PayPals offer to credit £150 for the confusion its email 
caused in relation to the invoice was fair. He explained to Mr R this was still open to him if he 
wished to accept. 
Mr R didnt accept our investigators view. In his response he reiterated that if PayPal had 
confirmed the payment had not gone via the PayPal account at the point of him asking, he 
would have been able to arrange for his bank to recall the funds. Mr R feels PayPals 
mistake has cost him £10,000 and its offer to credit £150 is derisory. As the matter remained 
unresolved, its been passed to me for a final decision. 
Whilst the case has been awaiting a final decision Mr R has informed our service that hes 
received a refund of the funds he lost as part of the scam through his bank. So, this aspect 
of Mr Rs case no longer form part of this decision. Mr R asked that the case still be 
reviewed by an ombudsman as he was unhappy with PayPals response and when 
considering PayPals offer of £150, he said this didnt cover the stress and anxiety of what 
happened and its handling of things. 
So for clarity, within this final decision I have considered whether PayPals offer of £150 is 
fair and reasonable in all of the circumstances. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont think PayPal need to do anything more to resolve this complaint. Ill
explain why.
As explained above, the issue that remains for me to decide relates to PayPals offer to 
credit £150 compensation in recognition of the customer service issues Mr R encountered 
after the payment had been made. 
Mr R, when considering PayPals offer of £150 said, this doesnt reflect the stress and 
anxiety of what happened and how PayPal handled things. I do recognise Mr Rs strength of 
feeling and Id like to assure him that I understand the whole experience will have been 
frustrating and upsetting for him. It is very unfortunate Mr R was the victim of a cruel scam.   
PayPal has acknowledged that the level of customer service it provided wasnt to the 
standard it would have liked, in particular, that Mr R didnt receive a call back after he 
requested one. It also recognised the email its customer service team sent to Mr R after the 
payment had been made may have led him to believe hed paid through PayPal when he 
had not. It apologised for this and offered compensation to reflect this. 
I accept the email Mr R received from PayPal stating the payment of £10,000 had been 
successfully paid may have led him to believe the payment had been made through PayPal. 
PayPal have acknowledged this was as a result of the invoice being marked as paid. Errors 
can and do happen and PayPal should have been aware of how the payment had been 
made. I also have to keep in mind that Mr R had sent the payment directly from his bank 
account and not through PayPal and those funds have since been returned to Mr R through 
his bank. 
Im also mindful that the overall impact of the scam flows directly from the actions of the 
scammer. So when considering everything Ive seen and been told, I find PayPals offer to credit £150 to be fair and reasonable in this particular case in recognition of the things it 
could have done better. 
I appreciate this wont be the outcome Mr R was hoping for. I hope Mr R can understand, 
considering all that I have explained above, why I wont be upholding this complaint or 
asking PayPal to make any further award other than what its already offered. But I am 
pleased to see he has been able to recover the money he lost as part of the scam through 
his bank.
My final decision
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has already made an offer to credit £150 to settle the 
complaint and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
So my decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should credit £150 if it hasnt done so 
already.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2021.
