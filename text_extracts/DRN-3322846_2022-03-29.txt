The complaint
Miss Y is unhappy that NewDay Ltd rejected her chargeback request.
What happened
In July 2021 Miss Y purchased an item online and paid using her NewDay credit card. The 
item cost £140. When Miss Y received the item it was damaged, so she contacted the seller 
and asked for a refund. The seller agreed that the item could be returned.
Miss Y returned the item via tracked mail. A couple of days later Miss Y chased the seller for 
a refund. The seller said the refund had been sent and provided a screenshot to confirm this. 
Because Miss Y had used her partners online account to make the purchase, the refund had 
been sent to her partner.
Miss Y raised a chargeback claim with NewDay. NewDay rejected the claim on the grounds 
that there wasnt enough evidence.
Miss Y wasnt happy with the response and complained to this service.
Our investigator upheld the complaint. She said that if NewDay had asked Miss Y to provide 
the correct information at the outset, it was likely that she would have provided enough 
information for her chargeback claim to be successful. The investigator said that NewDay 
should pay £140 to Miss Y to reflect the error in not advising her of the information required.
NewDay didnt agree. It said that Miss Y hadnt contacted them to ask what evidence would 
be required and said that the evidence she had provided wasnt sufficient to support her 
claim. NewDay said the screenshot showed that the refund had been made to Miss Ys 
partner and that there had been no error on its part. NewDay also said that the seller had 
advised that it hadnt received the goods back, and that Miss Y hadnt provided evidence of 
the return.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
A chargeback is a transaction reversal made to dispute a transaction and secure a refund for 
the purchase. When a chargeback happens, the disputed funds are held from the seller until 
the card issuer decides what to do, based on information provided by both the seller and the 
buyer.
In this case, I can see that a  chargeback was raised within the relevant 120 day timescale. 
The available information shows that Miss Y contacted NewDay on 21 July 2021 to raise a 
despite, because despite returning the goods, she hadnt received a refund from the seller. 
NewDay advised Miss Y to wait for 15 days before raising the dispute online and uploading 
evidence.
I havent been able to listen to this call because NewDay didnt provide it. Miss Y says that 
she was advised that the only evidence she needed to provide was proof of purchase. 
NewDay has said that there was no contact from Miss Y to ask what evidence would be 
required, and has said that its clear from the online form what evidence is required. 
Ultimately, NewDay rejected the chargeback because it said Miss Y hadnt provided enough 
evidence.
Ive thought about whether NewDay did enough to make Miss Y aware of the evidence she 
needed to provide. Im satisfied that Miss Y spoke to NewDay on 21 July 2021, and I dont 
agree with NewDay when it says that there was no contact from Miss Y about what evidence 
would be needed.  I think NewDay shouldve been clearer with Miss Y about the evidence 
that was needed to support her claim. Im inclined to prefer Miss Ys testimony about what 
was said to her regarding the evidence she needed to provide. Based on what Ive seen, Im 
satisfied that Miss Y was in possession of evidence over and above a proof of purchase, and 
I think she wouldve provided all of this evidence had NewDay been clearer about the 
evidence which was required. 
I appreciate that the online form advises a consumer to provide evidence to support the 
claim, but in the circumstances of this case, Im satisfied that  Miss Y had already spoken to 
NewDay and had been advised to provide proof of purchase only. As a result, Miss Y didnt 
provide anything beyond this, even though she had other information in her possession 
which wouldve supported the claim and in all likelihood, would have resulted in a  successful 
claim.
Taking everything into account, Im of the view that NewDay could have done more here. It 
should have asked Miss Y to provide the correct information in support of her claim when 
she first spoke to them.
Putting things right
To put things right, NewDay must pay £140 to Miss Y for its failure to ask her to provide the 
correct information to support the claim.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. NewDay Ltd must pay £140 to Miss Y.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss Y to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 April 2022.
