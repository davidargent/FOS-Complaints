This complaint is about 10 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr F between  December  
2017 and August 2018. Mr Fs borrowing history is as follows:

*Please note that this figure represents the highest contractual  repayment when these
loans were opened alongside a previous  outstanding  loan. These amounts have been 
rounded up/down
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Fs complaint in part and thought loans 4 to 10 should  not have 
been given. Sunny disagreed so the complaint has now been passed  to me to decide.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr F could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN75763252the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr F could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments.
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint.
Mr F hasnt  disagreed with our adjudicators opinion on loans 1 to 3 so I wont be looking at 
these any further  as there is no ongoing  disagreement about  them.  But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Mr Fs other lending. 
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 4 would most likely  have shown  
that Mr F was having some trouble in managing his money. By the time loan 4 was taken,  
Mr F was paying for three other loans (loans  1 to 3) with Sunny at the same time. Loan 4 
was taken in very quick succession and only a month after loan 1 was taken. While the 
amounts fluctuated, Sunny should have been concerned with Mr Fs borrowing pattern by 
the time loan 4 was taken and should  have realised that he was having problems managing 
money. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr F, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Fs case,  I think that this point was reached  by   
loan 9. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr F was not managing to repay their 
loans sustainably. Mr Fs overall  pattern of borrowing suggested that he had become 
persistently reliant on short-term loans. Mr F had borrowed on nine occasions  in eight 
Ref: DRN75763253months and whilst the amounts fluctuated, they didnt significantly decrease over this 
period and for the rest of the borrowing relationship  with Sunny. Sunny ought  to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr F was having  to borrow further to cover  the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Fs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr F wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  10 was 
taken out eight months after Mr Fs first. Mr F had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr F lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 9 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr F borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Fs ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 to 8 and loans 9 and 10 and Sunny 
should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr F paid on 4 to 10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 to 8 from Mr Fs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 9 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 9 and 10 should be removed from 
Mr Fs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Fs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 April 2020.
