Mr C says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny.co.uk  (ECI)  irresponsibly 
lent to him.
background 
This complaint is about 11 instalment loans whjch ECI provided to Mr C between October 
2015 and October  2017. Mr Cs borrowing  history  is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Repayment
1 21/10/2015 05/03/2016 24 £150 £54.15
2 12/05/2016 31/10/2016 24 £250 £90.90
3 28/05/2016 01/06/2016 24 £100 £126.75
4 19/06/2016 28/10/2016 24 £100 £126.50
5 16/07/2016 17/07/2016 24 £50 £144.30
6 26/01/2017 06/04/2017 24 £100 £36.35
7 21/02/2017 21/04/2017 24 £350 £165.40
8 19/06/2017 30/06/2017 24 £50
9 29/07/2017 19/10/2017 24 £100
10 10/09/2017 01/12/2017 24 £50
11 18/10/2017 01/12/2017 24 £150
Mr C said ECI did not make enough  affordability checks to assess if he could reasonably  
afford the loans. He added he struggled to meet  normal household bills and he had to get 
other loans  to pay off the loans with ECI.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Cs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 7 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. ECI disagreed with our adjudicators view and made  an offer on 
loan 11 only to be upheld.  Mr C refused ECIs offer and the complaint was passed to me.
Neither party made any comments on loans 1 to 6 being rejected, so in this decision, I will 
only be looking at loans  7 to 11.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
ECI needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that ECI should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN09950742the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that ECI was required to establish whether 
Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  affordable  
on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of ECIs lending history with Mr C, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which ECI should  reasonably  have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so ECI should have  realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point ECI ought to have realised Mr C was not managing  to repay  the loans 
sustainably. Mr C had taken out 7 loans within around 16 months. So ECI ought  to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr C was having  to borrow  further to cover 
the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Cs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Cs first loan was for £150 and loan 7 was for £350. At this point ECI ought to 
have known that Mr C was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in their 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From  loan 7 onwards,  Mr C was provided  with a new loan within  days/weeks of 
settling a previous  one. 
Ref: DRN09950743Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed ECI. Loan 11 was taken 
out around 2 years  after Mr Cs first. And although it was for the same  amount, Mr C 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a continuing debt to ECI over 
an extended period.
I think that Mr C lost out because ECI continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Cs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 7 onwards and ECI should  put things right.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 7 to 11 (inclusive);
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 11 (inclusive)  should  be 
removed from Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires ECI to take off tax from this interest. ECI must give Mr C 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, this is a fair way to settle this complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right for Mr C as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 March 2020
