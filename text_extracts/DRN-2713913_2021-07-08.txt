The complaint
Mr and Mrs I are unhappy with the failure of National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) to 
stop a cheque being cashed which they issued from their current account.
What happened
In January 2021, Mr and Mrs I say they appointed workmen to do some work in their garden. 
Mr I says the workmen asked for £6,800, so he wrote them a cheque for this amount on 25 
January 2021. 
On 27 January 2021, Mr I called NatWest and asked them to cancel the cheque because he 
said the work wasnt completed correctly. Mr I says he was told by the advisor they would do 
this. But he was then later told the cheque had already cleared the account. Mr I says 
NatWest also told him that they would let him know if the cheque had been cashed, but this 
never happened. Mr and Mrs I want NatWest to reimburse them with £6,800.
NatWest say the cheque had already debited Mr and Mrs Is account by the time Mr I 
contacted them. NatWest explained that once a cheque has been cleared, the funds cannot 
be taken from the payee account. So, they werent able to reimburse Mr and Mrs I with the 
amount they asked for. However, they acknowledged Mr I was told the incorrect information 
on two occasions. So, NatWest offered Mr and Mrs I £200 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience caused. Mr and Mrs I didnt accept this and brought their complaint to our 
service.
One of our investigators looked into Mr and Mrs Is concerns. In summary, he said as the 
cheque had been cashed by the time Mr I contacted NatWest, he didnt think they could do 
anything further about this. However, our investigator acknowledged there was 
inconvenience caused to Mr and Mrs I when they were given the incorrect information by 
NatWest. And he thought their offer of £200 compensation fairly reflected the distress 
caused. 
Mr and Mrs I didnt agree. They said NatWest should be held liable for the total amount of 
the cheque. So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest have told us the latest they can stop a cheque in these circumstances is the same 
day the cheque is presented to the recipients bank. In this case, having seen NatWests 
internal records, Im satisfied the recipient paid the cheque into their bank on 26 January 
2021  the day before Mr and Mrs I made the request to stop the cheque.
NatWest have confirmed that they arent able to retrieve funds from a payees account once 
a cheque has been cleared. And I dont find this to be unreasonable. So, whilst I can 
appreciate Mr and Mrs Is frustrations, Im satisfied NatWest werent able to do anything to 
stop the cheque at the point Mr I made the request. So, I cant fairly ask NatWest to 
reimburse Mr and Mrs I with the value of the cheque.
Mr I says he was told incorrect information by NatWest when he contacted them on 27 
January 2021. Ive listened to the call that took place on the 27 January 2021 and can hear 
that Mr I was told the cheque had been stopped. NatWest have acknowledged they made an 
error in the information that was relayed to Mr I and have apologised for the distress and 
inconvenience this caused.
I can understand the disappointment and inconvenience this wouldve caused Mr and Mrs I, 
especially as they were left with the impression that the cheque had been stopped. And I 
also understand Mr and Mrs Is upset at having to pay workmen a large amount of money for 
work that was incomplete. But thats an issue between Mr and Mrs I, and the workmen. I can 
only award compensation for any errors NatWest made. And I think they made an error in 
telling Mr I the incorrect information on two occasions. 
Having thought about everything carefully, I think the £200 compensation NatWest have 
offered is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Whilst I appreciate this 
will likely come as a disappointment to Mr and Mrs I, I wont be recommending NatWest 
award anything more.
My final decision
National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) have already made an offer to pay £200 to settle 
the complaint and I think this offer is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of Mr and 
Mrs Is complaint.
So, my final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) should pay Mr and 
Mrs I £200, if they havent done so already. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I and Mrs I to 
accept or reject my decision before 5 August 2021.
