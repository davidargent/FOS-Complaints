Mr R says the loans  were unaffordable and caused  him significant financial difficulty  and 
emotional distress. He has told us he was left short for bills and had to borrow  further to pay 
for basic living expenses.  Mr R thinks that Sunny  should have recognised he was taking out 
other short-term loans with other lenders.
In its final response,  Sunny said it had carried out creditworthiness  checks and it considered  
it was responsible to advance  credit  to Mr R. However, it also said that there  were  certain  
indications that at certain points the product might  not have been suitable for Mr Rs needs. 
It upheld loan 1 which was a running credit account and offered to put Mr R in the position 
Ref: DRN36836032he would  have been in if the loan hadnt been granted;  with a refund of all the interest  and 
charges hed paid as well as adding  interest of 8% as it was required to do. The total amount 
it offered Mr R was £25. To be clear as Sunny upheld Mr Rs complaint  about this loan 1, I 
havent considered it here. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Rs complaint. In addition  to loan 1 that had already been upheld  
he thought the loans  from 6-12 shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed with this view.  It 
said that as well as loan 1 it would also uphold  loans 9-12. Mr R didnt accept this offer and 
as the parties  dont  agree the complaint has been  passed to me to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
Ref: DRN36836033to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
In relation to the loans 2-5 provided to Mr R following the flex credit account  loan 1, Sunny 
told us it had carried out robust checks and it thought it responsible  to give the credit. There 
was a gap in lending between the flex account credit and loan 2, so I think  Mr R was in the 
early stages of his relationship when he took out loans 2-5 after the flex account  credit.  And I 
cant safely say that Sunny did anything wrong to lend Mr R loans 2-5.
But by the time Mr R asked for loan 6 I have  decided to uphold  his complaint. I will explain 
why.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr R, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr R was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr R had taken out his 5th loan within 3 months  and Mr R had been 
indebted to Sunny  all that time.  Hed also had an overall lending  relationship  with 
Sunny for over six months,  albeit  with a break in between loans 1 and 2. So Sunny  
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr R was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that Mr 
Rs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Rs first loan was for £150. He took £300  for loan 2 and then borrowed around 
£100 for much of the remaining lending. And although loan 6 was for £50 Mr R 
needed to borrow  this sum the day before the first instalment of £45.35  was due for 
loan 5. So, it doesnt seem likely that Mr As need for cash  was reducing  which  also 
points to him having a longer term need  for funds. At this point Sunny ought to have  
known that Mr R was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall  in their 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
There was very little gap between the time Mr R paid off a loan and the time he took 
out his next loan.  And on five occasions  when Mr R took out further  borrowing, he still 
had at least one outstanding loan with Sunny. For example, when Mr R took out loan 
6 he still had loans  4 and 5 outstanding. 
Mr R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  12 was 
taken out over 12 months after Mr Rs first. Mr R had paid large  amounts of interest  
to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
Sunny disagreed that it should  not have continued to lend from loan 6 to 12. It said that all 
these loans were repaid  and so did not put undue pressure on Mr Rs financial situation, and 
it didnt agree that its pattern of borrowing had caused Mr R to be reliant on short term loans.  
Mr R continued to meet eligibility criteria and in respect of all loan applications,  Sunny 
Ref: DRN36836034determined whether the loan was affordable. It said that its robust and proportionate checks 
could be relied  upon to give further loans to Mr R and at no time did Mr R contact it to inform  
them of financial difficulty. It also said the highest  amount of credit was £300 and often it was 
lower  Mr R didnt  have  to use more than 1.96%  of his income to repay any one loan. It did 
offer to uphold loans  9-12 as well as the first loan.  
But as Ive explained above  that although a loan may appear  affordable  on a pounds and 
pence basis it doesnt necessarily mean that a consumer  can afford to repay the loan in a 
sustainable manner.
The regulations in place at the time provided guidance about what  sustainable meant - the 
payments could be made without undue difficulties, on time, while meeting other  reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to meet the repayments, over the life of the 
agreement, and out of income  or savings. As Ive said when Mr R took out loan 6, he still 
had two other previous loans outstanding and the fact that he had repaid some  of the loans 
does not mean he did so from sustainable  sources.
Im not persuaded Sunny acted responsibly  when it provided loan 6 to Mr R and I think  that 
Mr R lost out because  Sunny  continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr R borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Rs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him/her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 6- 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loan 6 should be removed  from Mr Rs 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr R a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN36836035my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr R compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 March 2020
