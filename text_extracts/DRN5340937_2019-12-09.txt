Mr D complains about the poor service and incorrect information he received from Standard  
Life Assurance Limited. Mr D says that he has lost out financially as a result of Standard  
Lifes poor service. 
background
Mr D held a personal  pension with Standard Life. 
In early October 2018 he phoned it to discuss switching funds and transferring  his pension 
pot to another provider. It appears  that Mr D wanted  to switch part of his pension  pot to a 
less volatile fund and then transfer  his pension pot to another  provider.
Due to errors on Standard  Lifes part Mr D was given incorrect information about the timings 
involved in its fund switching process. He was also not provided with the information  he 
wanted about lower  risk funds.
The transfer went ahead very quickly. The funds were encashed  on 10 October 2018, and a 
total of £46,601.42 was sent to Mr Ds new provider by CHAPS on 11 October 2018.
Mr D complained to Standard Life as he said he had lost out financially. In particular he said 
the fund switch he had requested had not been carried  out and he had lost £334.85 as a 
result.
Standard Life accepted  that it had given Mr D incorrect information  about how quickly  the 
fund switch would be carried out. It said that as the transfer to new provider had been 
processed so quickly  it hadnt  carried out the fund switch before Mr Ds pension  pot was 
transferred.
It explained that if it had received Mr Ds fund switch request by 5pm on 8 October 2018, 
Mr D would have got the unit price  that was published on 10 October  2018.  That is the unit 
price at close of business on 9 October  2018   159.380530p. The value of his Indian  Equity  
Midcap Opportunities fund would then have been £28,091.70.  This is the value  of this fund 
that was transferred to Mr Ds new pension provider.
But, based on the incorrect information Mr D was given on 8 October  2018,  he expected to 
get the unit price  published on 9 October  2018 (which is the unit price at close  of business 
on 8 October 2018)  of 160.486750p. This would have given a value of £28,283.29. 
In view of this Standard Life said it felt that the value Mr D was entitled to was £191.59  more  
than he and received.
It explained that the amount Mr D had referred  to, of £334.85, was based  on a comparison 
between the unit prices on 8 and 9 October 2018. But it said that these unit prices  would 
never have  applied to Mr Ds switch because switch  instructions are forward  priced. 
However, it offered  to pay Mr D a total of £334.85  to compensate  him for the poor service  
and incorrect information he had received from it.
Mr D spoke to Standard Life again  in late October 2018. He queried  the amount  transferred 
to his new provider.  Standard Life said that if Mr Ds pension  pot had been cashed  in on 11 
October, using the unit prices at close of business on 10 October 2018, his pension  pot 
would have been valued at £47,501.70. But Mr Ds pension pot had been  encashed  on 10 
Ref: DRN53409372October 2018, using  the unit prices at close of business on 9 October 2018. A total of 
£46,601.42 was sent to Mr Ds new provider by CHAPS on 11 October  2018.
Mr D said that as his pension pot was not sent to his new provider until 11 October he felt he 
should have received the value of his funds based on the unit prices  at close of business on 
the previous day on 10 October 2018,  as he felt  the CHAPS  payment would need to 
have properly reflected  the actual fund value at the payment  date, as Standard  Life were 
aware in advance of the actual payment date affecting the fund value.
Standard Life said it wasnt willing to pay Mr D the difference between  the value  of his 
pension pot when it was cashed  in on 10 October 2018 and the value the pot would have 
achieved if it had been cashed in on 11 October 2018, the date the pot was transferred to his 
new provider.
Mr D was unhappy with Standard Lifes response  and brought  his complaint to this service. 
Our adjudicator said she the payment Standard  Life had made  of £334.85 was fair. She said 
she didnt think it needed to do more to resolve Mr Ds complaint. She said that, in her view,  
even if the business had given Mr D correct  information in relation to the fund switch  and 
transfer timescales, events would  have proceeded as did. 
As such,  she thought the amount the business had offered Mr D as a gesture of goodwill 
was fair in the circumstances  of this complaint. 
Mr D didnt accept our adjudicators view.  He said that Standard Life should  honour the fund 
value as at 11 October  2018 as this was the date his pension  pot was transferred to his new 
provider. 
Our adjudicator considered Mr Ds comments, but said she wasnt  persuaded to change  her 
mind. She reiterated that there was a difference in how fund switches and transfers were 
processed.
She explained that because Mr Ds transfer request was received  on 9 October 2018, this 
secured the fund value at the close of business that day, and superseded his fund switch  
request. She said she thought a timescale  of one working day between closure and transfer 
to Mr Ds new provider was reasonable. 
She also said that she was of the view that even  if Standard Life had given Mr D the correct  
information events  would  have unfolded  as they had done, and Mr D would be in the same 
position he is now. 
Mr D remained  unhappy with our adjudicators  view.  In particular  he said; 
In the first instance,  SL failed to switch funds  on unit price  published  at 11/10/2018 for close 
of business price on 10/10/2018. Instead, they claim to have made CHAPS transfer payment 
to [name  of new provider]  on 10/10/2018, to satisfy the Origo  Options transfer  request of 
09/10/2018, but this was discovered to be false, since  they actually made the CHAPS  
payment on 11/10/2018.
In maintaining their false claim that CHAPS payment was made on 10/10/2018 published 
unit prices at close of business  the previous day on 09/10/2018, SL calculated  (after Market 
Value Reduction) a Total Fund Value of £46,601.42.
Ref: DRN53409373However, it has now been unequivocally established from SL themselves admitting the 
CHAPS payment was paid on 11/10/2018, and in so doing,  the published price of units  on 
11/10/2018 are the unit prices at close of business the previous day on 10/10/2018,  
whereupon, SL have calculated (after  Market Value Reduction) a Total Fund  Value  of 
£47,501.70.
In order to make amends,  SL paid compensation by reference to a hypothetical fund switch, 
at unit price published on 09/10/2018 for close of business price  on 08/10/2018,  and 
calculated the difference  in value (amounting to £191.59) to the previously mentioned failed 
fund switch on 11/10/2018  and increased  that amount by £143.26  to pay total compensation 
of £334.85.
However, the literal  difference between the Total Fund Value due on 11/10/2018  of 
£47,501.70 and the actual CHAPS payment on 11/10/2018  for £46,601.42  means that, the 
shortfall amount  without  any compensation is the difference  of £900.28.  The £334.85 
compensation was in respect of incorrect and inconsistent  information only.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It is not in dispute  that Standard Life gave Mr D incorrect information  when  he phoned it in 
early October 2018. What  is in dispute  is whether Standard Life should pay Mr D more as his 
pension pot was not transferred to his new provider on the same day it was encashed.
Where a business makes  an error, this service  usually  looks to put the customer  back in the 
position they would have  been in, but for the error.  
In addition to the redress  it had already paid, Mr D says he wants Standard Life to pay him 
the difference between the value  of his pension pot on the day it was encashed, 10 October  
2019 and the day it was transferred to his new provider, 11 October  2019. 
Standard Life received  Mr Ds instruction to transfer his pension  pot to a new provider on 9 
October 2018. It completed the closure  of his pension plan, and cashed in his pension pot on 
10 October 2018. However the money  was not transferred to Mr Ds new pension  provider 
until the following  day, 11 October  2018.  
I have very carefully considered all that Mr D has said and provided in relation  to the cut off 
times for CHAPS payments. However  I am also mindful that there  was no requirement on 
Standard Life to send the money to Mr Ds new pension provider by CHAPS.  It has 
explained that it usually sends money by BACS, which  can take up to three  working days. 
It is more usual for pension providers to make transfers by BACS  due to the additional costs 
involved in a CHAPS  transfer. 
Standard Life has explained that it used CHAPS to send the money to Mr Ds new pension 
provider as it was aware  that Mr D wanted the transfer to be processed  quickly. It is 
unfortunate that, by the time Mr Ds pension pot had been encashed on 10 October  2018,  it 
had missed Standard  Lifes  cut off time for CHAPS transfers.
Ref: DRN53409374But, having  carefully considered this matter, I dont  think Standard Life treated Mr D unfairly 
in this matter. Nor do I think  it should  pay Mr D the difference between the fund values had 
Mr Ds pot been  encashed on 11 October 2018  and the actual value achieved when the 
funds were cashed in on 10 October  2018.
Standard Life received  Mr Ds instruction to transfer his pension  to a new provider on 9 
October 2018. It enchased  his pension funds the next day and as in order to ensure the 
transfer was carried  out promptly it sent the money to Mr Ds new pension provider by 
CHAPS. Its CHAPS  cut off time was missed on 10 October 2018, but Mr D still received his 
money more quickly that if Standard Life had used BACS  it usual method.
I appreciate that Mr D feels Standard Life should not have  encashed his pension funds until 
11 October, but there  was no requirement on Standard Life to delay cashing in his funds. 
As I explained above, where a business  has made  an error this service usually looks  to put 
the customer back in the position they would have  been, but for the error. In relation to the 
transfer of Mr Ds pension  pot I dont think Standard Life made an error. The transfer was 
carried out very promptly and the money  was sent by CHAPS at the first available  
opportunity after the funds  had been cashed in.
I do appreciate that this is not the decision Mr D was hoping for, and I do understand that he 
would like to have received the unit prices on 11 October 2018. But there was no 
requirement on Standard Life to delay encashing his pension  pot in the hope of achieving  a 
higher value.
I note that Standard Life has compensated Mr D the incorrect information it gave him about  
the timescales for fund switches. I think this is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of 
this complaint. My decision  is that I dont think it needs to do any more to resolve this matter.
my final decision
My decision  is that, for the reasons I have set out above I dont think Standard Life 
Assurance Limited needs to do any more that it already has to resolve  this matter.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 January 2020.
