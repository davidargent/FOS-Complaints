K820x#14complaint
Mrs G complains about the information  relating  to her hire purchase agreement that N.I.I.B.  
Group Limited, trading as Northridge Finance, has recorded on her credit file. Her husband 
is also involved in her complaint.
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
its clear from the evidence that Mrs G wanted to change  the date of the monthly  
payment under her hire purchase agreement to a specified date in the middle of each  
month;
she says that she sent Northridge Finance a completed direct debit mandate  to 
change the payment  date and her direct  debit was cancelled in August 2018 so the 
monthly payment  of £129.92 wasnt collected  in August or September  2018;
Ive listened  to a recording  of the call that Mrs Gs husband made to Northridge 
Finance after the payment was missed  in September 2018  it was agreed that a 
manual payment would be made  in mid-September and the direct debit mandate  
would begin in October 2018;
no manual payment  was made  in mid-September so Northridge Finance contacted  
Mrs G at the end of that month and a payment of £150 was made  towards the 
arrears on the account (and the remaining arrears were  cleared by a payment in 
February 2019);
Northridge Finance  has recorded information about the missed  payments on Mrs Gs 
credit file  but I consider that information to be a true and accurate record of her 
payment history and Ive not been  provided with enough evidence to show that its 
provided incorrect information to the credit reference  agencies;
I consider that Mrs G intended to make her payments on time but that there was 
confusion about the direct debit which led to the August and September  2018 
payments not being made   but the manual payment that had been  agreed for mid-
September 2018 then wasnt made;
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that Northridge Finance has 
acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mrs G and her husband; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Northridge Finance  to change any of the information that its recorded on Mrs Gs 
credit file, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to her 
complaint.
Ref: DRN62636332my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Gs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 June 2020.
