The complaint
Mr C has complained about a number of loans he took from MYJAR Limited. Mr C says 
MYJAR lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision about this complaint in August 2020 that I summarise below.
There is very limited information about this matter. MYJAR says that due to the time that has 
passed, it no longer holds information about its lending to Mr C. 
Mr C was able to send us statements from one of his bank accounts dated from August 2013 
to December 2014. The statements provide the following information about funds received 
from MYJAR and payments made to MYJAR:

Card payment to www.myjar.com on 02.04.2014 483.33

(10.04.14)300.00
Looking at the actual transaction in the bank statements narrative, rather than the posting 
date to the account, it seems likely that Mr C was given 5 loans by MYJAR in 2013 and 
2014. MYJAR has told us that the loans would have been single instalment loans.
So a summary of Mr Cs borrowing appears to be as follows:
Loan payment from Myjar amount received payment to Myjar  amount paid
1 ? ? 23/09/2013 267.22
2 27/09/2013 200 23/10/2013 282.78
3 24/10/2013 200 27/10/2013 240
4 28/10/2013 200 02/04/2014 483.33
5 10/04/2014 300 ? ?
The bank statements that Mr C provided show that he was transferring monies to and from 
another bank account. Mr C says he did have another bank account at the time. He thinks 
he paid the final loan from this other account but given the time that has passed, he no 
longer has access to statements from that account.
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, in particular the checks that 
MYJAR needed to do such as the amount being lent, and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, I thought less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate in the early stages of the lending relationship.
I said that MYJAR was required to establish whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans 
- not just whether the loan payments were technically affordable on a strict pounds and 
pence calculation.
I understood that MYJAR no longer holds information about its lending to Mr C. And whilst 
Mr C has been able to provide some documentary evidence, this too is inevitably limited. So 
its difficult to know exactly what happened at the time. But I carefully considered all the 
arguments, evidence and information that is available, in order to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the particular circumstances of this complaint.
I noted that there appears to have been a six-month gap between Mr C taking his fourth and 
fifth loans. But he took loan 5 only a few days after repaying what I thought was the fourth 
loan. I thought about whether this gap was such that MYJAR might reasonably have 
considered that any problems that had led Mr C to take the previous loans had now been 
resolved, and so could constitute a clean break in lending. But in the circumstances of this 
case and given that Mr C took loan 5 only a few days after repaying a previous loan from 
MYJAR, I didnt think I could fairly say there was a clean break in the lending. So I treated Mr 
Cs 5 loans as one chain of lending.
MYJAR says it would have carried out some checks before it gave each of the loans to Mr C. 
This included asking Mr C for information about his income and expenditure and carrying out 
some credit checks. There is very little evidence about the information that MYJAR gathered 
about Mr Cs financial circumstances, at the time he applied for the lending. But from what 
Id seen, I think the checks MYJAR would have carried out before agreeing to the first three 
loans were likely to be reasonable and proportionate - given the amount it was lending to Mr 
C each time, his income at the time and the number of loans agreed. I didnt think it wouldve 
been proportionate in this, the early stages of the lending relationship, for MYJAR to ask Mr 
C for the amount of information that would be needed to show the lending was unsustainable
before agreeing the first three loans. So I said I was not intending to uphold Mr Cs complaint 
about these loans.But when Mr C applied for the fourth loan, I thought MYJAR ought reasonably to have 
carried out better checks. It seems that Mr C took the second loan a few days after repaying 
the first loan. Loan 2 then appears to have been repaid a month later and Mr C borrowed 
again a day later (loan 3). He seems to have repaid this after three days and then 
immediately borrowed again a day later (loan 4). Although loan 4 was relatively early in the 
lending relationship, I thought on balance MYJAR ought reasonably to have realised from Mr 
Cs rapid borrowing and repayment behaviour that he might be having difficulties managing 
his money and that it couldnt rely on the information that he was providing. I thought at that 
point MYJAR should have taken steps to independently verify at least some of the 
information that Mr C was providing to it about his financial position.
Mr C provided us with evidence of his financial circumstances around the time he applied for 
the fourth loan with MYJAR. Of course, different checks might show different things. But I 
thought if MYJAR had carried out what I consider to be proportionate checks, I thought its 
likely it would have discovered the extent of Mr Cs financial problems. Mr C was regularly 
borrowing from a number of other short-term lenders (and he continued to do so). I thought 
MYJAR ought reasonably to have been alerted that this consumer was having difficulty 
managing his finances and that he would most likely need to borrow elsewhere to repay his 
loan from MYJAR. I thought MYJAR ought reasonably to have realised that it was unlikely 
that Mr C wouldve been able to sustainably repay this loan or any subsequent lending. 
Overall, I didnt think MYJAR was right to provide loans 4 or 5 to Mr C. So MYJAR needed to 
put things right.
I invited both parties to send me any further comments or evidence. MYJAR has told us that 
it accepts my provisional decision. Mr C has acknowledged my provisional decision but Ive 
not seen any further information from him.  The deadline for comments has now passed.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to thank both parties for all the information that has been provided about this matter 
and for responding to my provisional decision. Given that Ive not received any further 
evidence or comment that changes my mind about this complaint, I confirm the conclusions I 
reached in my provisional decision:
I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint about loans 1 to 3.
But I dont think that MYJAR should have provided loans 4 or 5 to Mr C. So MYJAR should 
put things right.
Putting things right
Ive thought about what would constitute fair and reasonable compensation in the 
circumstances of this case. Given the limited information about what happened at the time, I 
think it would be fair and reasonable for MYJAR to do the following in respect of the loans 
taken on 28 October 2013 (loan 4 for £200) and 10 April 2014 (loan 5 for £300):
Calculate the interest and charges that Mr C is likely to have paid for loan 4;
Calculate the interest and charges that Mr C is likely to have paid for loan 5 on the 
assumption that he repaid this loan one month later;Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement. HM Revenue & Customs requires 
MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must give Mr C a certificate showing 
how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Remove any adverse information about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Cs credit file.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I partly uphold this complaint and direct MYJAR Limited to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 November 2020.
