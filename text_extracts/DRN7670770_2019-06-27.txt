K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Using the information provided by QuickQuid I prepared a loan table of approved loans.  The 
last loan may still be outstanding. The table appears at the end of this Final  Decision.
I attach my provisional decision dated 18 June 2019, which  forms part of this final decision 
and should be read in conjunction with it. In my provisional decision I explained why 
I intended to uphold Mr Hs complaint  in part. I invited both parties to provide any further  
comments they may have  by 18 July 2019 before I reached a further decision.
Mr H has agreed  with my provisional decision and has nothing  further  to add. 
QuickQuid has replied  with additional  points which are summarised here:
1.it does not accept my provisional decision to treat loans  1 to 17 as one loan chain;
2.it says that its affordability  assessments from Loan 12 (post-2015) onwards were  
more robust than those carried out earlier;
3.it disagrees with the basis of my provisional  decision  for loans 12 to 17. Its reason is 
that basing the pattern of borrowing rationale  solely on the number of loans  and 
length of Mr Hs lending  history  is wrong;
4.it makes a point about expenditure recording when applicants apply;
5.it disputes that part of my provisional decision that Mr H could not afford the second  
top-up of Loan 20 and Loans  21 to 22. 
As I have received  responses from both parties I think  that proceeding with the Final  
Decision is fair even though it is before the 18 July 2019 response date. 
my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
I am content  that Mr H has accepted my provisional decision. 
I respond to QuickQuids points using the same numbered paragraphs above to correspond  
with my further and final findings here.
1.after a short period of lending I may have considered that a gap in lending  of less 
than six months would break the chain in the lending. But here Mr H had already 
been indebted to QuickQuid for 14 months.  And so my decision is that a 5.5 month 
break after 14 months of indebtedness does not constitute a long enough gap to 
break the chain  of lending. 
Ref: DRN767077022.this affordability review post-2015 argument has been  run many times before  and 
QuickQuid knows this services response  to that generic argument. So I say no more  
about it. Save that I do point out that QuickQuid raised this earlier during the 
investigation of Mr Hs complaint (September 2018) and so this is not a new point for 
this case but a repeat of the same and would have been considered by me before my 
provisional decision: raising it again  simply delays  the resolution for Mr H.
3.the pattern  of borrowing  rationale  has been addressed at length with leading 
decisions published on our websites and to which  I referred  in my provisional 
decision. I am aware that QuickQuid is conversant with this rationale and I refer it to 
the leading decisions  and earlier decisions from this service on this subject. 
And to underline  this point I refer QuickQuid  to the Financial Conduct authority letters 
addressed to CEOs of providers of high-cost lending. The first dated October 2018 
was to address  the issues surrounding the increase in complaints about unaffordable  
lending (including  complaints about a chain of loans  over an extended period) in 
which the FCA said 
We note that the Ombudsman has recently published four examples of 
determinations of individual  complaints about payday loans to illustrate its 
approach to the issues raised in those  complaints  (see: https://www.financial-
ombudsman.org.uk/publications/technical.htm). If relevant,  firms should take 
these examples of determinations into account as part of establishing their 
own effective procedures  for complaints handling (see DISP  1.3.1R).
In March 2019 the FCA addressed the issue again in a further  letter to CEOs in 
which it said: 
Following our analysis, we see two key ways that consumers may be harmed 
across the High Cost Lenders portfolio:  
 a high volume of relending, which may be symptomatic of unsustainable  
lending patterns 
 firms  affordability checks may be insufficient, leading to loans  that 
customers may not be able to afford  
I refer QuickQuid to those letters for the full text in order  to place these quotes in 
context of the overall message the FCA was delivering in both.
Further, QuickQuids own concession in the final response letter to Mr H makes 
reference to a pattern of dependency  demonstrating  that for Mr Hs case  it has 
recognised the situation and has used the rationale and terminology itself. 
Ref: DRN767077034.the records provided by QuickQuid for Mr Hs application history  suggest that the 
expenditure figures have remained the same  for three applications  in 2014 and it 
says now that therefore Mr Hs Loan 18 application expenditure figure must be the 
same. And QuickQuid  says that it is not unreasonable for a consumer to have 
expenses that are the same or similar for a period of time.  
That may be the situation in some cases but for Mr H it was recorded  as £825 in 
September 2014 and when he applied for Loan 18 after a significant  gap it was 
March 2017. This was 3.5 years later and I repeat what I said in my provisional 
decision: no record of expenditure  had been recorded from Mr H since 
September 2014. So I do not think that reliance on that 2014 figure, especially after a 
significant gap, is fair. I do not think that QuickQuid  had adequate, up-to-date  details 
of his expenditure.
And another  relevant point is this. I have decided that there was a long enough 
period of time before Loan 18 during which Mr H was not a customer  of QuickQuid to 
lead me to think that when Mr H applied for Loan 18 QuickQuid was reasonable to 
approach that application  as if it was a new lending chain. QuickQuid appears to 
agree with me on that. So it makes no logical  sense for QuickQuid to propose  an 
argument whereby  the application details taken  3.5 years before, and which  were  in 
the previous lending chain  was relevant to the new lending  chain application.  I do not 
accept QuickQuids resistance on my point about  the expenditure. 
5.The basis of the complaint is whether Mr H could afford or sustainably repay the 
loans approved by QuickQuid.  It thinks Mr H could afford  them. Mr H has complained 
he could not. I have considered these loans and my provisional decision as that he 
could not. And my view has not altered. 
Taking all these points  into account,  again,  I see no reason to alter the conclusions  I reached 
in my provisional decision on 18 June 2019.
I uphold Mr Hs complaint  in relation to Loans 4 to 17 and from the second top-up of 
Loan 20 to Loan 22.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
QuickQuid needs  to: 
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 4 to 17 and from  the second top-
up of Loan 20 to Loan 22; and
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*; and
remove any negative payment information about Loans 4 to 11 (ones  conceded upon 
by QuickQuid) from Mr Hs credit file; and
remove any negative payment information about Loans 20 (in part) to 22 from Mr Hs 
credit file; and  
the number  of loans taken from Loan 12 to 17 means any information recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  Loans  12 to 17 should be removed from Mr Hs 
credit file. 
Ref: DRN76707704If theres an outstanding  balance,  QuickQuid  is able to off-set  one against  the other but to be 
clear this should only be in respect of the principal sum borrowed on Loan 22. Any unpaid  
charges and interest would need to be removed first and any payments made to Loan 22 
treated as if Mr H had paid down  the principal. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one. Any set-off  is to be 
done after tax has been removed.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision  dated 18 June 2019, I uphold  
Mr Hs complaint in part. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, should  put things right for Mr H in the way 
I have set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  on or before 27 July 2019.

Offers on Loans 4 to 11
* = late payment  fee recorded
Ref: DRN76707706main part of the provisional decision dated 18 June 2019
background
Mr H says I feel the company should  have  seen I was constantly  getting  more frequent and larger 
loans and should have  stopped it or helped. It is also clear to see I was struggling to pay on time 
some months  and accruing more  late fees.
In its final response letter to Mr H, QuickQuid said I can see that a pattern of dependency emerged  
with loan **989 [Loan 6 in the table]. I can also see that there was detriment in your lending history in 
loan number  **696 [Loan 4 in the table]. QuickQuid offered Mr H a refund on interest and charges  for 
these two loans (plus additional elements, not set out here) with that sum to be off-set against the 
outstanding balance on Loan 22. 
Mr H did not accept this and brought his complaint to this service.
When QuickQuid submitted its file to this service it made a new offer: we  can agree that additional  
checks should  have been completed prior to approving  loans 4-7.
One of our adjudicators  looked  at this complaint and thought  that QuickQuid should  put things right for 
Mr H in relation to Loans 4 to 22. 
QuickQuid did not agree and made a new offer for Loans 4 to 11. 
Mr H did not disagree with our adjudicators  view and so I take it from that he is content with the non-
uphold opinions for Loans 1 to 3. And QuickQuids latest  offer shows its concession  for Loans 4 to 11. 
So the disputed loans are Loans 12 to 22 which  are what I will review  here and within  the context of 
the lending history  as a whole.
 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr Hs case. QuickQuid  is well 
aware of these earlier decisions and is invited  to read them again. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Hs complaint in part and have explained why below.
the gaps in lending
There is a gap in the relationship in late 2014 to early 2015 between  Loans 11 and 12. I can see that 
this was under  six months but only just under, and I have thought  about it carefully.  In view of the 
number of loans preceding Loan 12  eleven in 14 months  I think that all of the loans from Loan 1 to 
Loan 17 are part of the same loan chain and I plan to treat it as such. In other words I am not treating 
that period as a gap in lending. 
I have come to a different view in relation to the gap in the lending between  May 2016 and March 
2017. I do think  that this was a long enough period of time during which Mr H was not a customer of 
QuickQuid to lead me to think that when  Mr H applied for Loan 18 QuickQuid was reasonable to 
approach that application as if it was a new lending  chain. So this does make a difference  to the 
outcome for those later loans.
Ref: DRN76707707the offers
I find it odd that QuickQuid have chosen to make offers and then incrementally increase the offers to 
Mr H over time. The offers are not accompanied by much explanation other than a phrase or two to 
explain why it has chosen to make offers on the ones it has, which  does not assist  a complainant in 
understanding the rationale  behind  them. 
An example is that in the final response letter  to Mr H, QuickQuid used the phrase  pattern of 
dependency (as outlined above). This suggested that a number of loans were being considered  to 
make up that pattern. But then QuickQuid made an offer in relation to Loan 6 only and then added  
Loan 4 using  a different  rationale  detriment.  
It does not fit with the basis  of QuickQuids  brief explanations for the offer  pattern of dependency  
and detriment  when two loans only are conceded  and the loan approved by QuickQuid  in the middle 
of those two is not referred to. Loan 5 (in between Loans 4 and 6) was for £850 which amounted to a 
very large proportion of Mr Hs declared  income  at the time and applied for two days  after repaying  
Loan 4. QuickQuid  had referred  to Loan 4 with this phrase: I can also see that there was detriment in 
your lending  history... Yet when making  the offer to Mr H it seemed  not to take into account Loan  5 
which was approved  immediately after that Loan 4. 
This is academic now as QuickQuid has conceded in relation to Loans 4 to 11. 
first loan chain
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr H could repay his loans 
in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and Mr Hs income and expenditure.  With this in mind, in the early stages  of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion of their 
income 
the amount, or amounts,  due to be repaid are higher  
there is a larger number  and/or frequency of loans 
the period of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
As the very early loans are not disputed and as Loans 4 to 11 have been conceded by QuickQuid, Im 
considering the situation  from Loan 12 onwards. And as they are part of a longer loan chain then my 
decision is that Im planning to uphold  Mr Hs complaint from Loan 12 to 17 in conjunction with 
QuickQuids existing offer. 
Ref: DRN76707708Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at which QuickQuid  
should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, and 
QuickQuid ought to have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further lending. Given the 
particular circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think that this point was reached by Loan 12 (likely  to have 
been earlier save for QuickQuids concessions) and I say this because:
the amounts  Mr H was borrowing were generally  increasing, and QuickQuid ought  to have 
realised it was likely his indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably
Mr H applied  for top-ups many times and often increased his overall repayment  sums to large 
proportions of his salary  which ought to have alerted QuickQuid  to an issue  on affordability
Mr H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed, and was in effect paying  large  
amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended  period.
I think  that Mr H lost out because QuickQuid  continued  to provide borrowing from Loan 12 onwards 
(taking into account the Loans 4 to 11 concessions by QuickQuid) because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  over an extended period of time
the sheer number of loans  was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Hs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost  loans
So Im upholding Mr Hs  complaint about Loans  12 to 17 (in addition to the ones  already conceded  by 
QuickQuid in this loan chain) because the overall pattern of lending  increased his indebtedness in a 
way that was unsustainable  or otherwise  harmful and he lost out as a result.
second loan chain from Loan 18
As Loan 18 was applied for after a significant gap then I would have expected QuickQuid to have 
carried out checks  proportionate  to the loan being applied for in March 2017. The loan was for £150 
followed by a £75 top-up. So I would have expected QuickQuid to know about Mr Hs income and his 
regular monthly expenditure and regular  financial  commitments. Mr H had declared  to QuickQuid that 
his net monthly  income was £1,500.
No record of expenditure had been recorded from Mr H since  September  2014.  So I do not think  that 
reliance on that 2014 figure, especially after a significant gap, is fair. I do not think that QuickQuid had 
details of his expenditure.
So I have looked at Mr Hs bank  statements to discover his regular spending plus regular financial 
commitments at that time. I do not see that Mr Hs expenditure  was particularly high such that this 
loan plus his declared  income couldnt cover it. So I do not plan to uphold  Mr Hs complaint for Loan  
18. 
Loan 19 was for £200 and for the reasons  I have  given  above  I am not planning to uphold that first 
part of this application for this loan. 
However, Mr H quickly  applied for more.  So I think that by the first top-up for Loan 19 QuickQuid 
ought to have  known about Mr Hs income, regular expenditure and financial commitments  and any 
other short  term loans (STL) he may have had. 
Having reviewed  Mr Hs bank statements for this period and his credit  file sent to us by Mr H then I 
cannot see that he had any other STL at that time. And therefore its likely  that he was able to afford 
it. So I am not planning to uphold that second top-up.
From the third top up of Loan 19 and for the rest of the lending given by QuickQuid to Mr H I think that 
a full review  ought to have been carried  out which would have included knowing Mr Hs income  
(verified) , his regular expenditure, regular  financial commitments,  any other STL he had and knowing  
his finances in some detail.
Ref: DRN76707709I dont think QuickQuid  did this and so I have looked at his bank  statements and his credit  file. I think  
that Mr H was likely able to afford  Loan  19 after all of the top-ups culminating in a total repayment of 
£665 and I say this because he had no other STL, and the bank statements I have do not reveal  a 
great deal of expenditure. I can see from those statements that his actual net income  was greater 
than the declared of £1,500. So on balance  I think that Loan 19 may have been just affordable.
Loan 20 was initially for £450 and so likely affordable based on what  I have  seen and explained 
above. But by the time he had applied  for the second top-up of Loan 20 his scheduled repayment was 
due to have been over £800  and as such  a very large  proportion of his net monthly  income. So I do 
not think  that this was affordable or responsible  of QuickQuid  to have  approved that top-up. I am 
planning to uphold Loan 20 from the second top-up. And for the same reasons  and due to the same  
circumstances surrounding Loans 21 and 22  I am planning to uphold them as well.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  everything provided. Having  done  so, Ive not seen anything  here that 
leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards  Mr H in some other way.  
putting things  right  what QuickQuid  needs  to do
I am planning  to direct  that QuickQuid: 
refunds all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans  4 to 17 and from  the second top-up of 
Loan 20 to 22; and
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;  and
remove any negative payment information about  Loans  4 to 11 (ones conceded upon by 
QuickQuid) from Mr Hs credit file; and
remove any negative payment information about  Loans  20 (in part) to 22 from Mr Hs credit 
file; and  
the number of loans taken from Loan  12 to 17 means any information  recorded  about  them is 
adverse. So all entries about Loans 12 to 17 should be removed from Mr Hs credit file. 
If theres an outstanding balance, QuickQuid is able to off-set one against the other but to be clear 
this should only be in respect  of the principal sum borrowed on Loan 22. Any unpaid charges  and 
interest would  need to be removed first and any payments  made to Loan 22 treated as if Mr H had 
paid down the principal. 
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  It must give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one. Any set-off is to be done after tax 
has been removed.
