K820x#14complaint
Miss B has complained  about  the amount NewDay Ltd say she owes  on her credit card.
background
Miss B has a credit  card with NewDay. Up to February 2019 she paid the full outstanding 
balance shown on her statement  every month.
At the end of November 2018  there was an outstanding balance on Miss Bs card of £39.67.  
In December 2018 two payments of £39.67 were made to the account. Miss B contacted 
NewDay and asked  it to refund  one of the above payments. It agreed to do this but the 
payment wasnt refunded  until February  2019.
A payment of £36.75  was made  to the account  in February 2019 but no payments were  
made after that. NewDay added late payment fees and interest to the account and in April 
2019 it said the outstanding balance was £53.64.
Miss B complained to NewDay. She said shed paid the full outstanding balance each month 
so there  shouldnt be anything left owing.  NewDay said it would refund a late payment fee of 
£12 and interest of £1.97. This left a balance of £39.67  which it asked Miss B to pay.
Miss B wasnt happy with NewDays  response and referred her complaint to this service.
our initial conclusions
Our investigator didnt  recommend the complaint should be upheld. He thought  the 
outstanding balance was correct. Miss B didnt  accept our investigators  recommendation.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As a result of the double payment made in December 2018,  Miss Bs account showed a 
credit of £2.97 at the end of that month even though shed made a purchase of £36 70 
during the month. Because of this no payment  was made to the account  in January 2019.
Miss B made another purchase of £39.72  in January  2019 and her account  then showed  an 
outstanding balance of £36.75. This was paid to the account in February  2019.  But the 
second payment  of £39.67 that had been made  in December 2018 was also refunded in 
February 2019. This meant the balance on the account  actually increased  by £2.92 during 
February 2019 even  though Miss B didnt use the card.
The total amount  Miss B spent on her credit card between November 2018 and January 
2019 was £116.09. The payments made to the account in December 2018  and February  
2019 amounted  to £76.42  once  the second  payment  of £39.67 had been refunded. This left 
an outstanding  balance of £39.67.
Given the above, Im satisfied the balance of £39.67  that NewDay said was outstanding after 
it had refunded the late payment fees and interest was correct.
