K821x#15Complaint
Mrs M has complained that Elevate Credit  International  Limited  (trading as Sunny) did not 
carry out proper  affordability checks when lending  to her. She says she was in a debt spiral  
to the extent that loans were not affordable.
Background
Mrs M took 19 loans with Sunny between November 2014  and January  2018. The first loan 
was a line of running  credit. Each of the remaining  loans was due to be repaid over a period 
of six months  but in most cases Mrs M repaid  the loans early.  Some of Mrs Ms loans 
overlapped with one another.  Mrs M never  repaid anything towards the final loan and Sunny 
has now written  off this debt. A summary  of Mrs Ms borrowing is shown at the end of this 
decision.
Our adjudicator considered the complaint and recommended  Sunny refund the interest  and 
charges on loans 5 to 19 as well as making  amendments to Mrs Ms credit file. He said if 
Sunny had done proportionate checks it would have  realised  from loan 5 that Mrs M was 
having problems  managing money  and from loan 7 onwards the overall pattern of Mrs Ms 
borrowing suggested she had become  persistently reliant on short-term loans. 
Sunny didnt accept  the adjudicators view but made  an offer on loans 11-19. Mrs M did not 
accept Sunnys offer. Neither she nor her representatives provided any further arguments or 
comments on the adjudicators view. 
I issued my provisional decision on 22 October  2019 explaining why I was thinking of 
reaching the same conclusion as the adjudicator but the award I was making differed 
slightly. 
Sunny did not respond. Mrs M has accepted  my provisional decision.  
My findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
As neither party has provided any further evidence  or arguments  for consideration, I see no 
reason to depart from the conclusions set out in my provisional decision. For completeness,  I 
have set this out below.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mrs Ms case. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when  Sunny  lent to Mrs M. The 
FCAs Consumer Credit  sourcebook (CONC) is the specialist sourcebook for credit-related 
regulated activities. It sets out the rules and guidance specific to consumer credit providers, 
such as Sunny.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs M could 
repay her loans in a sustainable manner. 
Ref: DRN50280832These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mrs Ms income and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include, but are not limited to:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So Sunny was required to establish  whether  Mrs M could sustainably  repay  her loans   not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable as being without 
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, 
while meeting  other reasonable  commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet 
the repayments. 
It follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  had done  anything wrong when  it lent loans 1 - 4. Sunny 
has agreed to make  an offer on loans 11 - 19. As there isnt a dispute about these loans, I 
have focused  my decision on loans 5  10; the loans still in dispute by Sunny.
Sunny told us it undertakes eligibility, creditworthiness  and affordability checks  before 
making a decision  as to whether to provide a loan.  I can see it asked Mrs M for her income 
and expenses as well as carrying  out a credit  search.
Mrs M applied for loan 5 a week after loan 4 was taken out. This was Mrs Ms fifth loan in 
five months. I think at this point Sunny ought  to have been fully reviewing and verifying Mrs 
Ms full financial circumstances including checking whether she had any other short  term 
lending. If Sunny had done so, it would have discovered Mrs M had at least three other 
outstanding short term loans (including her fourth  loan with Sunny which was still 
outstanding).
Ref: DRN50280833This doesnt necessarily  mean Sunny couldnt  lend to Mrs M, but taking in to account  what it 
knew about Mrs Ms borrowing pattern and looking  at how Mrs M was borrowing from Sunny 
and other  short term lenders,  I think it ought to have  realised by loan 5 that Mrs M was 
having problems  managing money.  
In my view its unlikely  this situation arose simply because Mrs M had a short-term cash flow 
problem and instead its more likely that there was a more fundamental underlying financial 
issue. As a responsible  lender, I think  Sunny  would  have realised this and not agreed to lend
Mrs Ms circumstances  were very similar  when she took loan 6. In these circumstances, 
there remained a significant  risk that Mrs M wouldnt have been  able to meet  her existing 
commitments without  having to borrow again.  So, I think  Sunny ought to have realised that it 
was unlikely Mrs M would have been able to sustainably meet her monthly repayments for 
this loan and not agreed  this loan as well as loan 5.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ms case,  I think  that this point was reached  by 
loan 7. I say this because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 1 and 6 of Mrs M taking new loans 
shortly after repaying  previous ones and sometimes overlapping  with one another. I 
think that by loan 7, Sunny ought fairly  and reasonably to have regarded  that pattern 
as established.
So Sunny  ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mrs M was having  to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loans were leaving  in her 
finances and that Mrs Ms indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mrs M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. 
Loan 7 was taken out 6 months  after the running line of credit. It was the largest  
instalment loan to date and was two times the amount Mrs M borrowed on her first 
instalment loan. 
Mrs M had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny  over 
an extended period.
I think that Mrs M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 7 
onwards. These loans  had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ms indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time. 
The sheer number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mrs Ms ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
I appreciate there was a gap of around  four and a half months between loans 8 and 9. But, 
given that Mrs M had already borrowed eight loans with Sunny over a period of nine months 
and she had been indebted  to Sunny  for the majority  of these months, I think  its unlikely her 
financial circumstances wouldve recovered  in this time. Indeed loan 9 was her largest loan 
at that point in time. So I dont think this gap should be considered  a break in lending.
Ref: DRN50280834So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 7-19 as well as loans 5 and 6 and Sunny should  
put things right as set out below.
Putting things  right
Sunny shouldnt have given Mrs M loans 5 - 19. To put things right it should
A.Add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs M towards interest, fees and 
charges on these loans,  but not including anything Sunny  has already refunded. 
B.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mrs M which  were  
considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Mrs M originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C.Use the total of A plus B to repay  the principal amount which Sunny has written  off 
on loan 19
D.Pay any remaining refund to Mrs M. If there is no refund left and still a balance 
outstanding made up of written-off  principal, it would not be fair for Sunny to now 
pursue this further. 
E.Remove any adverse  information Sunny has recorded on Mrs Ms credit  file in 
relation to loans  5 and 6. The overall pattern  of Mrs Ms borrowing for 7 to 19 means  
any information recorded about  them is adverse, so Sunny should  remove these 
loans entirely from Mrs Ms credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mrs M a certificate showing how much tax youve  deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold  Mrs Ms complaint as Ive explained above  and in 
my provisional decision. I require Elevate  Credit  International Limited  (trading as Sunny)  to 
put things right for Mrs M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 December  2019.
