The complaint
Ms D complains National Westminster Bank Plc discriminated against her when she tried to 
change her mobile phone number, and when it said it couldnt stop some departments from 
calling her.
What happened
Ms D has a credit card issued by NatWest. Ms D is deaf, has a mobile phone (which she 
uses, for example, to receive one-time passcodes) and is happy to communicate by email.
In November 2022 Ms D phoned NatWest using BTs Relay UK service to change her 
mobile phone number. She says a call that would have taken anyone else between 5 to 10 
minutes ended up taking her 50 minutes  and, because of the stress involved  caused her 
to effectively have a panic attack.
Ms D says she subsequently received calls from NatWest on her mobile phone  despite 
having made it clear that she was deaf and shouldnt be receiving calls.
Ms D complained to NatWest. NatWest looked into her complaints and said that it accepted 
its agents had made several mistakes when she tried to change her mobile phone number. 
NatWest apologised and initially offered £20 in compensation, and then offered an additional 
£150. NatWest also said that it had updated its records about Ms Ds telephone preferences, 
but that it was up to individual departments to decide how they contact customers  a block 
couldnt be placed on all calls. Ms D was very unhappy with NatWests response and 
complained to us saying that the compensation she should be awarded should be in line with 
the Vento guidelines. She said that her complaint involved multiple acts of discrimination and 
that the County Courts award around £1,600 for the smallest amounts of discrimination.
Following the involvement of one of our investigators, NatWest offered an additional £150 in 
compensation. Our investigator thought £320 in compensation  the amount NatWest had by 
then offered  was fair and reasonable. So, thats what they recommended NatWest pay. 
Our investigator said that NatWest had processes in place that its staff were meant to follow 
when Relay UK calls were received. NatWest accepted our investigators recommendation. 
Ms D didnt. She said that the fact that NatWests staff had made errors didnt mean she 
hadnt been discriminated against as NatWest was required to make sure its staff are also 
properly trained. And she also said she was worried that there was no system to track issues 
across banking services. She said she was working on the belief that we should be able to 
insist on NatWest updating its training and considering alternatives for disabled customers. 
Ms D asked for her complaint to be referred to an ombudsman. So, it was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms D has complained that NatWest has failed to make reasonable adjustments and has 
discriminated against her. In other words, has failed their duty to make reasonable 
adjustments under the Equality Act 2010, amongst other things. Ive taken the Equality Act 
2010 into account when deciding this complaint  given that its relevant law  but Ive 
ultimately decided this complaint based on whats fair and reasonable. If Ms D wants a 
decision that NatWest has breached the Equality Act 2010, then shed need to go to Court. 
Because Ive decided this complaint based on whats fair and reasonable  and not what a 
Court would likely decide if Ms D was to make a claim under the Equality Act 2020  Ive not 
thought about what award would likely be made under the Vento guidelines. Ive thought 
about our services approach to awards, details of which are published on our website.
In this case, everyone agrees that the call Ms D made to NatWest in November 2022 didnt 
go as well as it should have done. I also accept that Ms D spent almost an hour updating her 
mobile phone number when it would have taken a customer who didnt have a disability 
more like 5 to 10 minutes as a result. And I accept that the call caused Ms D considerable 
frustration and distress. And although NatWest made changes to Ms Ds profile to stop her 
receiving certain calls  for example, marketing  I accept that it must be very frustrating for 
Ms D that NatWest said it couldnt stop them entirely. 
Putting things right
I agree with our investigator, given everything Ive just said, that £320 in compensation for 
the distress and inconvenience that Ms D has been caused is a fair outcome. So thats the 
award Im going to make.
This decision will be published, and we do gather insight from the complaints we see and 
feed that back to businesses and other stakeholders, including the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). I hope that 
answers some of Ms Ds other questions about wider issues shes raised.
My final decision
My final decision is that Im upholding this complaint and requiring National Westminster 
Bank Plc to pay Ms D £320 in compensation in full and final settlement.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2023.
