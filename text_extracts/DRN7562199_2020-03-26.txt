Mrs M says Elevate Credit International Limited irresponsibly lent to her. Mrs M says the 
loans were unaffordable for her and she wasnt able to meet essential outgoings.

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mrs Ms complaint and thought the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been  given and that all information about Mrs Ms borrowing from 
loan six was adverse  and so should be removed from her credit file. 
A second adjudicator reviewed the complaint and agreed it should be upheld from loan four 
but thought any information about  loan ten was adverse   not from loan six.
Sunny disagreed and as the complaint  remains unresolved it has been  passed to me for 
decision in my role as ombudsman. The complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN75621992the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mrs M didnt  comment  on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to three shouldnt be 
upheld. Because  of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision  about this lending.  But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mrs M had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ms complaint.
Like our adjudicator I think Mrs M was showing signs of difficulty in managing  her money  at 
the application four loan four. So, I dont think any further lending should have been  given  
from loan four onwards.
I say this because  when Mrs M applied for loan four, loans one to three  were  still 
outstanding. Sunny has said its product  offers flexibility for a consumer in that more than one 
loan can be taken at once. But by this time, Mrs M had borrowed twice in March and once 
more in April so I think the high frequency in the borrowing could be an indication that Mrs M 
was struggling to manage her finances.
And I also notice that Mrs M repaid  loans  one to three early.  And while I appreciate  this can 
save interest costs, it could equally have been  a sign that Mrs M may have been juggling  her 
finances by borrowing further to re-pay current borrowing. 
And I would question why someone would repay a loan early  only to take out more  
borrowing. Mrs M was re-borrowing again shortly after repaying earlier borrowing  loan five 
Ref: DRN75621993was taken the same day that loan one was repaid,  loan six was taken four days  after loan 
two was repaid  and loan seven was taken the same day that loan three was repaid. And it 
was for three times the amount  taken at loan three. Such a quick  update  in re-borrowing can 
be a strong  indication of having problems with money management.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ms case,  and like the second  adjudicator  I think  
that this point was reached by loan ten. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs M was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Mrs M had taken out ten loans within  seven months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mrs M was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that 
Mrs Ms indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mrs Ms first loan was for £100 and loan ten was for £300.  Sunny ought  to have 
known that Mrs M was not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary  shortfall in her 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
Mrs M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Mrs M had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mrs M lost out because Sunny provided  borrowing at loan ten because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mrs Ms indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans which Mrs M borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mrs Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loan four onwards and Sunny should put things right.
Ref: DRN75621994putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs M paid on loans  four to ten;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans four to nine from Mrs Ms credit file;
the information recorded  about  loan ten is adverse. So, the entries  about loan ten 
should be removed  from Mrs Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mrs M a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 April 2020..
