The complaint
Mr M complains about how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA dealt with his dispute.
What happened
Mr M says he sold a pair of trainers online in November 2020 for about £500. He says there 
was a problem with the delivery and so he met the buyer in person to deliver the item. Mr M 
says the buyer then raised a complaint with PayPal that he hadnt received the item despite 
the buyer telling him that he had sold the trainers on for a profit. He says PayPal found 
against him and debited his account by over £500 which he cant afford. Mr M would like that 
amount removed and the buyer dealt with for what took place.
PayPal says it resolved this dispute in favour of the buyer as Mr M couldnt provide evidence 
of delivery and that the text messages between the parties didnt provide evidence of 
delivery. It says Mr M acted outside the Seller Protection policy by delivering the items 
himself. PayPal says it hasnt made a mistake by charging Mr M the money.
Mr M brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator thought PayPals Seller Protection didnt cover Mr M in circumstances where he 
delivered the item himself and that PayPal had correctly followed its process.
Mr M doesnt accept that view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr M will be disappointed by my decision.
I have looked carefully at PayPals Seller Protection policy and can see that in order to be 
covered by it, that Mr M needed to provide evidence of delivery. I appreciate Mr M says he 
delivered the item himself, but Im satisfied that in those circumstances PayPal was entitled 
to conclude that he wasnt entitled to the Seller Protection. I also think that PayPal was 
reasonably entitled to insist on independent delivery information to resolve these sorts of 
disputes and that the e-mail exchange between Mr M and the buyer doesnt provide suitable 
evidence of delivery.
I appreciate that Mr M may well be the victim of fraud but that doesnt mean PayPal was 
responsible for that or could assist him in these circumstances when he acted outside of the 
agreement. For those reasons I cant fairly order that PayPal remove the debit from Mr Ms 
account.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 November 2021.
