Mr M said that he was in a spiral of continuing loans and this caused problems for him.
Our adjudicator partly upheld the complaint. She didnt feel she had seen enough to say it 
was unfair  for Uncle Buck to provide  loans  1, 2, 3 and 15 to Mr M. But she said loans  4 -14 
shouldnt have been lent and she recommended steps that Uncle  Buck should take to put 
things right for Mr M. 
After seeing our adjudicators view, Uncle Buck made an offer to refund interest and 
charges on loans 4, 5, 9, 11 and 13. Uncle Buck  said that Mr Ms declared  income  and 
expenditure and his repayment history, plus the checks it did, supported its view that all the 
other loans  were suitably  provided. 
As Uncle Bucks offer falls short of everything that our adjudicator has recommended, Mr M 
would like me to make  a final decision.
Ref: DRN94499932my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Uncle Buck  was required to establish whether Mr M could  sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication that a borrower could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Uncle Buck  has already  offered to put things  right broadly along the lines Id recommend for 
loans 4, 5, 9, 11 and 13. So I havent considered these further save  to include them in the 
redress and when thinking about Mr Ms overall borrowing pattern. 
Ref: DRN94499933Uncle Buck  has told us about  the checks it did before lending to Mr M. It asked him for 
details of his income  and normal expenditure,  and carried out checks on his credit  file. It also 
told us Uncle  Buck adjusted the figures to allow a safety margin when thinking  about  what 
Mr M could  afford to repay. 
I agree  with the adjudicator that it wasnt wrong  for Uncle  Buck to give Mr M loans 1, 2, 3 
and 15 on the basis of the information  it relied  on to assess  those loan applications. Loans 1, 
2 and 3 were early  in the lending relationship and so, looking at the repayment amounts, 
I think the checks were enough for Uncle Buck to agree to lend. 
And like the adjudicator, I think  the gap in lending between  loan 14 and loan 15 was long 
enough for Uncle Buck reasonably to think that Mr M had put his finances in order  as it 
would seem that he hadnt  been dependent on high cost short term loans during this period. 
This meant that when his borrowing started  again, and Mr M applied  for loan 15 in February  
2019, almost a year after hed paid loan 14, he was effectively starting over.  So I think it was 
fair for Uncle  Buck to treat this as a new chain of borrowing and assess  his lending  
requests accordingly.  
Looking at the repayment amount and what  was apparent about Mr Ms circumstances at 
that time with Uncle Buck, I dont  think  it wouldve  been proportionate for Uncle Buck  to ask 
Mr M for the amount of information that would  be needed to show  loan 15 was unsustainable 
before agreeing this loan.
And as Mr M hasnt raised  any objection to the adjudicators recommendation in relation to 
loans 1, 2, 3 and 15, I dont  think  that I need  to say more about them.
Im going  to focus in my decision  on the loans that are still in dispute  loans 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 
and 14.
By the time he applied for loan 6, Mr M had been repeatedly repaying and borrowing new 
loans for five months or so  with only limited gaps  between  loans.   
Mr M took out loan 2 just over two weeks  after paying loan 1, and loan 3 just a week after 
paying loan 2. Loan 4 started five days after he had paid loan 3, and Mr M took out loan 5 
just four days after paying loan 4. Mr M asked for loan 6 just four days  after paying  loan 5. 
And he extended the borrowing term  he agreed to repay loan 6 over three  instalments, 
perhaps to keep down the cost of the monthly  repayments he was signing up to make. 
Uncle Buck  says Mr M said he was awaiting a 6 monthly bonus from work, and it looks  like 
that was paid to him in June 2015.
But although  Uncle Buck  says the loans looked  affordable on the figures,  it seems  clear that 
Mr Ms track  record  of borrowing is at odds with this. He had an established record of 
borrowing either the same amount as the loan hed just repaid  or otherwise, more money 
on his next loan. Uncle Buck could see that Mr M was steadily  increasing  the amounts he 
borrowed. By loan 6, he was taking out a loan for two and a half times the amount hed first 
borrowed. 
This would suggest  that he was having problems managing his money and couldnt afford to 
pay back what he had borrowed without borrowing again. And I dont think  the extra money  
he got in June 2015 was enough to make  a significant difference  to his position  overall   
especially as it seems  to have been  a one off payment. 
Ref: DRN94499934Although Uncle Buck  has provided some credit information it doesnt  help explain  Mr Ms 
borrowing history. So I think  Uncle Buck shouldve enquired further to obtain a proper 
understanding of his financial  situation.  Uncle Buck hasnt  shown  me it did this  and if it had 
done proportionate checks before providing  loan 6, it shouldve  seen that Mr M already had 
a record of outstanding and defaulted loans with other short term lenders.  
So I dont  think it was reasonable  for Uncle Buck to think  that it was likely Mr M would be 
able sustainably to repay loan 6, or any further loans - and it shouldnt have provided this 
loan, or any further  loans  to him. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Uncle Bucks lending  history with Mr M, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Uncle Buck should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Uncle  Buck should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think that this point was reached  by 
loan 8. Here are my reasons for saying this:
Mr M had by now been borrowing from Uncle Buck for 11 months already  without 
any significant breaks in lending (Uncle  Buck has mentioned  that there were gaps 
between loans 8  9, loans 9  10 and loans 11-12. But I dont think that any of those 
gaps were long enough for Uncle Buck reasonably to think that Mr M mightve put his 
finances in order) 
the borrowed again soon after repaying  a loan pattern continued (Mr M arranged  to 
start loan 7 within a couple of weeks of paying loan 6 and loan 8 was arranged within 
three days of him settling  loan 7) - indicating that he had to keep borrowing each time 
to cover the hole in his finances  left by repaying  earlier loans. This suggests that 
Mr M couldnt sustainably afford  to repay  what he had borrowed without borrowing 
again 
whilst  the loan amounts were  variable,  by loan 8 it was evident  that Mr M wasnt  
making any real inroads  into the amount he owed.  Only loan 6 had been for more  
money  and loan 8 was for twice  as much as hed borrowed when he took out loan 
1. So a pattern  of dependency was apparent in respect of his borrowing
at this point, Uncle  Buck  ought to have  known that Mr M was not likely  borrowing to 
meet a temporary  shortfall in income  but to meet an ongoing need  for credit 
Mr Ms indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably
I think that Mr M lost out when Uncle Buck provided loan 8 because:
this loan had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short term use over an extended period of time. 
the length of time over which Mr M had been borrowing from Uncle Buck  was likely  to 
have negative implications on his ability to access mainstream  credit  and kept him in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans. 
Ref: DRN94499935In coming to my decision Ive taken into account  that Uncle Buck  says it reviewed Mr Ms 
bank statements which indicate he incurred  a lot of leisure spend. But this doesnt mean 
that it wasnt irresponsible for Uncle Buck to provide Mr M with loans that he couldnt  afford  
to repay  in a sustainable way  or to keep providing him with high cost loans when all the 
indications were that he wasnt using this sort of credit for its intended purpose.  
So this means  that, like our adjudicator, Im upholding the complaint about loans 4  14 and 
Uncle Buck  should  put things right. 
putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
A.Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 4 - 14, not including anything it has already  refunded.
B.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr M which  were  
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr M originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C.Pay Mr M the amounts calculated  in "A" and "B".
D.Remove any adverse  information Uncle Buck has recorded on Mr Ms credit  file for 
loans 4 -7.
E.Remove all entries for loans 8 - 14 from Mr Ms credit file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I uphold Mr Ms complaint about loans 4 - 14. Uncle  Buck 
Finance LLP should pay Mr M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2020.
