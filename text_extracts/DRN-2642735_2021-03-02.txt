The complaint
Mr M complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) irresponsibly lent to him across several credit
cards which has caused him financial hardship and debts he cannot repay.
What happened
The background to this complaint is well known to both parties and has been detailed by our
investigator previously. So, Ive just focused on the key events within my decision.
Mr M took out four credit cards with NewDay, each under different brand names. Ill 
refer to these as Cards 1  4. Mr M says NewDay shouldnt have granted these cards 
or credit limits to him in light of his financial difficulties.
Card 1 was taken out some time ago and bought by NewDay in 2014, it has said it 
has no details of the card or sale so hasnt been able to investigate this. 
NewDay said it had acted fairly by granting Card 2 with a limit of £100 initially. But it 
shouldnt have increased the card limit in September 2017.
NewDay said it also shouldnt have granted Cards 3 or 4 at all in light of Mr Ms 
financial difficulties.
To put things right, NewDay said it would remove late and over limit fees, as well as 
proportionate interest for these cards (Card 2 from the time of limit increase only). 
NewDay also apologised Card 4 was still on his credit profile despite it being sold on, 
so it credited him £25 in compensation.
Mr M complained to our service asking for his remaining debt to be written off, and 
any adverse credit information to be removed from any credit reference agencies.
Our investigator agreed NewDay reasonably was unable to comment on Card 1 
given the time that had passed and evidence available. And overall he felt NewDays 
steps to put things right was sufficient, so he didnt ask it to do anything further.
Mr M disagreed, saying NewDays actions had led him to run up further debt and charges
elsewhere and it should write off the remaining balance debt. So, the complaint was passed 
to me for an ombudsmans decision. 
I issued a provisional decision on 17 February 2021 outlining my thoughts. Ive included part 
of this below.
Lenders dont have set checks that they have to undertake when considering an 
application for credit. But they do have a responsibility to carry out appropriate and 
proportionate checks to ensure that the consumer can afford the lending.
Card 1  given the card was taken many years ago NewDay has no details of the 
sale. I agree its offer to reconsider the matter if Mr M can provide information of the 
account is fair.
Im satisfied Card 2 was fairly given to Mr M, following proportionate checks, in line 
with NewDays lending criteria, the small card limit, and his circumstances at the 
time.
NewDay has accepted it shouldnt have extended credit on Card 2 or lent Cards 3 or 
4 at all. So what remains in dispute is how NewDay should put things right.
Im not persuaded NewDay should write off the balances that Mr M owes as hes had 
the benefit of the money but I do consider its actions have caused distress and 
inconvenience to him. And Im not persuaded NewDays steps to put things right 
addresses this personal impact. So Im intending to award him £300 in compensation 
to account for this.
As NewDay agreed Cards 3 and 4 shouldnt have been granted, Im also minded to 
say it should remove any previous details of this lending from Mr Ms credit file.
Im satisfied NewDays apology and credit of £25 for the inaccurate reporting of Card 
4 is sufficient as it has since corrected this information. I say this as it seems the 
impact of this would be limited in light of Mr Ms wider financial difficulties.
Mr M responded to say he accepted this decision, but NewDay disagreed, saying:
It felt compensation shouldnt be awarded in light of the steps it had already taken by 
removing interest and charges.
The increased limit of Card 2, and lending of Cards 3 and 4 were in line with its 
lending policy, but it had upheld the complaints because of Mr Ms circumstances.
As Card 3 and 4 were sold to a third party, there would be administrative challenges 
in it removing the credit file entries.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im still upholding this complaint.  
NewDay feels compensation isnt necessary in this case, but Ive considered its 
reasons for saying this previously and I still disagree.
Whether or not the lending was in line with NewDays criteria, it has agreed that it 
shouldnt have provided it in light of Mr Ms circumstances. So, this doesnt change 
my mind.
Ive carefully considered the points and reasons NewDay has given about challenges 
in removing the details of the credit file. But this doesnt change my thinking as Im 
satisfied the lending shouldnt have been granted at all for the reasons outlined 
above.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to do the following.
Remove all data relating to the Card 3 and 4 that NewDay has recorded on Mr Ms 
credit file.
Pay Mr M £300 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 March 2021.
