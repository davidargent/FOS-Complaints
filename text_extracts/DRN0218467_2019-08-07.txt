K820x#14complaint
Mrs R says Financial  Insurance  Company Limited (FICL) mis-sold her a payment protection  
insurance (PPI)  policy.  
background
Mrs R bought the policy in 2001 at the same  time as taking out a credit card. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mrs R disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Rs case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs Rs complaint because:
 I think FICL made Mrs R aware  that she had a choice about buying  the PPI, and that 
she chose to take it. 
 FICL  didnt recommend the PPI to Mrs R so it didnt have to check if it was right for her. 
 Its possible the information FICL gave Mrs R about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Mrs R doesnt appear  to have been affected by any of the main 
things the policy  didnt cover  and based on what I know about  her circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been  useful to her. So I dont  think  better information 
wouldve stopped  her buying  it. 
Ive taken into account Mrs Rs comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Rs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask MRs R to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 September 2019.
