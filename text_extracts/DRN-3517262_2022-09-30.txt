The complaint
Mrs T complains that OakNorth Bank plc did not assist her in finding the interest rates for her 
maturing fixed rate Individual Savings Account (ISA) and they were aware she was disabled.
What happened
Mrs T had a fixed rate ISA with OakNorth which was due to mature. Mrs T says that 
OakNorth emailed her that the fixed rate was about to mature and she could get a new 
bonus by rolling it over into a new ISA. Mrs T has a disability, so after clicking through four 
screens from the link in the email OakNorth sent her, she emailed them and she asked them 
to tell her the interest rates. 
Mrs T says that OakNorth responded by telling her that the interest rates were on their 
website. Mrs T made a complaint to OakNorth. She said she already had told them that she 
couldnt find the interest rates after clicking on the link in their email, so there was no point in 
sending her the same link that did not take her to the interest rates on offer. She said this 
was bad service and laziness on OakNorths part.
OakNorth did not uphold Mrs Ts complaint. They apologised in a response on 4 March 
2022, for the inconvenience caused to her. They said that they sent her an email on 2 March 
2022, informing her that her 24 month fixed rate ISA was due to mature on 1 April 2022 and 
they provided her with her maturity options. OakNorth said that her first option was to receive 
a loyalty rate with one of their ISAs. OakNorth said that the link on their email would have 
showed her the interest rates and products for her maturing account once she had logged 
into her online banking.
OakNorth said that for Mrs T to receive a loyalty rate, this could be done either through 
online banking or through their mobile application. OakNorth said that if Mrs T needed 
assistance in locating the rates she could either ring or email their business desk (and they 
provided the contact details for this department). Mrs T brought her complaint to our service. 
Our investigator did not uphold Mrs Ts complaint. He thanked her for providing us with 
detailed information about her disability and how this impacts her. He said that having 
reviewed OakNorths terms and conditions, they do not provide any commitment that they 
would email their customers with reinvestment interest rates. He said that they werent 
aware of Mrs Ts health condition at the time she complained to them. But they have now 
registered this on Mrs Ts account which should hopefully ensure she receives additional 
support with any accounts she may have with them in the future. 
Our investigator also said that OakNorth had sent Mrs T an email on 7 March 2022 which 
specifically offered to call her on a particular date and time to help her locate her 
reinvestment rates, if she let OakNorth know when this would be suitable for her.
Mrs T asked for an Ombudsman to review her complaint. She made a number of points. In 
summary, she said OakNorth would have been told about her disability when she first 
opened an account with them in 2019. She also said that OakNorth had lied about offering to 
phone her about the interest rates. Mrs T said OakNorth did not comply with the Equality Act 
code of practice and section 20 of the Equality Act 2010.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs T has made a number of points to this service and Ive considered and read everything 
shes said and sent us. But, in line with this services role as a quick and informal body, Ill be 
focusing on the crux of her complaint in deciding whats fair and reasonable here. 
Mrs T has complained that OakNorth are not following the Equality Act 2010, section 20. In 
other words, they have breached the Equality Act 2010. Ive taken the Equality Act 2010 
(and the Equality Act code of practice) into account when deciding this complaint  given 
that its relevant law  but Ive ultimately decided this complaint based on whats fair and 
reasonable. If Mrs T wants a decision that OakNorth has breached the Equality Act 2010, 
then shed need to go to Court.
For ease of reading Ill detail my decision in two parts  the maturing account and OakNorth 
registering Mrs Ts disability.
Maturing Account
Mrs T has complained that OakNorths approach isnt helpful to someone with a disability 
like hers  and their website links that are included in their emails in particular. Shes said, 
that OakNorth ought to have emailed her the interest rates that were available for her 
maturing account. 
Weve asked OakNorth what they can and cannot do, and how they operate. I cant say, 
taking everything both sides have said into account, that OakNorth has been unfair or 
unreasonable here. I agree with Mrs T, for example, that it would be helpful if OakNorth 
could email customers directly with the interest rates that are available for them on the 
maturity of their account. But I can see that even though OakNorth say they werent aware of 
Mrs Ts disability (which I will move onto later), they did offer a reasonable adjustment by 
offering to call and assist Mrs T if she let them know when she was available. Im satisfied 
they were right to do so here. 
Ive looked at the correspondence between OakNorth and Mrs T. After the email informing 
Mrs T that her account is maturing, Mrs T emails OakNorth and she tells them that the issue 
is that they have not told her the interest rates. She then suggests OakNorth review their 
policy and send the interest rates with the email in the future instead of expecting their 
customers to look for them. Im persuaded that OakNorth view this as a feedback email as 
opposed to a direct instruction from Mrs T. I say this as OakNorths response thanks her for 
her feedback and they would pass it to the relevant team. They then told Mrs T that the 
reinvestment rates for her account can be found in her Online Banking.
Im satisfied that the next email that Mrs T sends OakNorth though is clear that she wants 
the interest rates to be emailed to her when she instructed OakNorth to send them to me. 
OakNorth raised a complaint on behalf of Mrs T and they said they would do all they could 
do to resolve her complaint within three working days. Mrs T sends OakNorth two more 
emails before OakNorth respond on 7 March where they offered to give her a phone call to 
assist her. 
I know Mrs T strongly disputes that OakNorth have offered to call her, so I looked at the email they sent her on 7 March 2022 at 9:52am. While some of the wording in the email was 
similar to what OakNorth had told Mrs T previously when they said should you require 
assistance in locating the reinvestment rates in Online Banking or the Mobile App, please 
contact our Business Desk, OakNorth then say alternatively, please provide a suitable time 
and day for a member of our team to call and assist you. So I am satisfied that they did 
attempt to make a reasonable adjustment for Mrs T here by offering her a call if she let them 
know a suitable time and day for a member of their team to give Mrs T a call. 
I also asked OakNorth why they couldnt have just emailed Mrs T the interest rates available 
for her. OakNorth told me that all customers do not receive the same maturity reinvestment 
interest rates. Instead the rates offered to customers are automatically calculated and 
presented to customers through either their online banking or mobile banking, based on their 
account maturity date. They said their internet portal calculates the highest interest rate 
available for each product within the 30 days before the account maturity date and this would 
be the interest rate that would be visible to Mrs T. So this is in line with their terms and 
conditions You will need to submit your maturity instructions by logging into your Account 
online or via our mobile app. OakNorth calculate the interest rates via their systems for all of 
the multiple products available. 
Im persuaded that OakNorth could have explained this to Mrs T in the correspondence they 
sent her, especially as Mrs T felt they were being lazy by not directly emailing her the 
interest rates. But as they did offer to call Mrs T at a time convenient to herself, and several 
weeks before her account was due to mature, I cant say that they hadnt made reasonable 
adjustments for her.
OakNorth registering Mrs Ts disability
Ive also considered what Mrs T has said about letting OakNorth know about her disability 
when she first opened her account with them in 2019. OakNorth have said they have no 
record of this. Ive looked at screenshots of their application form and they dont have a 
section regarding disabilities/reasonable adjustments. But that does not mean that Mrs T did 
not inform them at any point of her disability. This could have been done via a different 
method, for example, over the phone or via email. OakNorth have confirmed that they do not 
keep call recordings, so unfortunately Im unable to rely on these here to listen to any calls 
where Mrs T may have told them about her disability.
OakNorth have said that as part of their standard operating procedure, when customers 
make calls to them about their accounts, the details of the calls are logged on the customers 
account(s). If a customer were to inform them of a vulnerability during a call, or the OakNorth 
representative speaking with the customer identified that the customer may require 
additional assistance, they would mark this on the customers profile. OakNorth confirmed to 
our service that they have checked their systems including call notes and can confirm that 
they were not made aware of Mrs Ts disability (by any means) prior to receiving our 
services email on 14th March 2022.
Ive looked at the evidence OakNorth have provided regarding when Mrs Ts disability was 
registered by them. This was on 14 March 2022. Im satisfied this was the date the system 
was updated as the information is shown as added and date stamped. OakNorth have also 
shown an example record if they would have already known about a disability and tried to 
amend this field. But this would show on their system as changed as opposed to added. 
So Ive seen no evidence that Mrs T had informed OakNorth of her disability at any stage 
prior to her bringing her complaint to our service. Thats not to say she definitely didnt do 
this, its just I cant hold OakNorth responsible for this when the evidence suggests they 
werent aware of her disability. The emails to OakNorth about the maturing account make no reference to her disability either, so I cant reasonably say OakNorth should have been 
aware of this.
But even if OakNorth would have been aware of Mrs Ts disability and it was registered on 
their systems, Im not persuaded that it would have changed the outcome here. I say this as 
OakNorth still wouldnt have been able to email her the interest rates for the reasons Ive 
already given. And they could have given her a better explanation of why this was regardless 
of if she had a disability or not. But ultimately they did offer to give her a call. There was still 
24 days from when OakNorth sent Mrs T the email with the offer of the call in which she 
could have made an informed decision about what she wanted to do with her maturing 
account, before it matured. And its likely that if OakNorth had registered Mrs Ts disability at 
any earlier point, that the same outcome would have happened in that they would have 
emailed Mrs T to arrange a suitable time/date to assist her into logging into her account and 
directing her to the maturity option and reinvestment interest rates. So it follows, I dont 
require OakNorth to do anything further.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2022.
