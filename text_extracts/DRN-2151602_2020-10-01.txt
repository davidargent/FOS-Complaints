The complaint
Mr and Mrs C complain that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) misplaced their 
documents. Theyre concerned their data may have been breached.
What happened
Mrs C went into a NatWest branch to arrange for her late mothers bank account to be 
closed. She provided various documents, including the details of her and Mr Cs joint bank 
account with NatWest. The documents were photocopied to be sent to NatWests 
bereavement team.
Six days later Mrs C phoned the bereavement team and was told they hadnt received the 
documents. The NatWest representative said she would request them again from the 
branch. Mrs C phoned the bereavement team again two days later. She was told the branch 
manager had sent them an email the day before, saying that the documents had been sent 
across the day shed gone into the branch and he would send another copy. Mr C spoke to 
the NatWest representative in the same call and said he wished to complain about the loss 
of documents under the data protection act.
In response to their complaint, NatWest said it wasnt sure what had happened. It was 
possible that the paperwork was scanned incorrectly on receipt at the processing centre. 
Alternatively, it might be that the branch failed to forward it correctly, causing the paperwork 
to be destroyed in the confidential waste. NatWest offered Mr and Mrs C £150 for the poor 
service theyd received. But they said they didnt want to accept it. 
Mr and Mrs C werent satisfied with NatWests response to their complaint, so they brought it 
to our service. They felt that NatWest didnt seem to be bothered about the loss of 
documentation and they wanted reassurance their data hadnt been breached. 
Our investigator told Mr and Mrs C that NatWest had reinvestigated their concerns and 
found that their documents did reach the bereavements team. Due to a systems issue at the 
time, they were incorrectly told the documents werent received. Our investigator didnt think 
Mr and Mrs Cs personal data had been breached. He also thought the £150 NatWest had 
offered to resolve their complaint was fair. 
Mr and Mrs C didnt agree with our investigators view. They said they had never asked for 
compensation. They thought it was strange that NatWest had found the documents when it 
had told them on four occasions that it didnt know where theyd gone. Mr and Mrs C didnt 
think NatWest had done a thorough investigation over the matter. Theyd only ever asked for 
proof that the documents had never left the hands of NatWest. Mr and Mrs C said theyd 
been told the documents were sent externally. They believed there had been a serious data 
breach and loss of data. 
As Mr and Mrs C disagreed with our investigators view, their complaint has been passed to 
me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mr and Mrs Cs complaint. Ill explain why.
Mr and Mrs C have made it clear that they arent seeking compensation from NatWest. They 
have only ever wanted proof that their documents were safe. 
NatWest says it can see that the documents were scanned on its system on 17 June, 25 
June and 29 June 2020. Its unsure why the bereavement team didnt spot this when Mr and 
Mrs C spoke to them and why the member of staff who responded to their complaint didnt 
either. NatWest says it can only assume this was human error or a systems error. 
I understand Mr and Mrs C want assurance that their data wasnt lost. NatWest has provided 
screenshots to show documents were scanned on its systems on the three dates mentioned. 
While I appreciate Mr and Mrs Cs concerns that their data might have been breached, I 
havent seen any evidence that it has been.
On balance, I dont think NatWest is likely to have lost Mr and Mrs Cs data. But it was no 
doubt worrying for Mr and Mrs C to be told on more than one occasion that NatWest couldnt 
locate the documents. I think NatWests customer service could have been better. This has 
been a particularly difficult time for Mr and Mrs C who have recently lost a close family 
member. And I think NatWests delays and miscommunication are likely to have had a 
bigger impact on them because of this. 
I appreciate Mr and Mrs C arent seeking compensation. But its not within this services 
remit to fine or punish a business. Our role is to determine whether or not a business has 
done something wrong and to direct it to put things right if we feel it has. As I believe 
NatWest has located Mr and Mrs Cs documentation, the only thing left for me to do is to 
award compensation for any trouble and upset theyve experienced. 
Having considered this, I think the £150 NatWest offered Mr and Mrs C before they brought 
their complaint to our service is fair and reasonable. Its up to Mr and Mrs C to decide if they 
want to accept this. 
My final decision
National Westminster Bank Plc has already made an offer to pay £150 to settle the 
complaint and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
So, my decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr and Mrs C £150.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision before 29 October 2020.
