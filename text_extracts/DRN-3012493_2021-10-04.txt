DRN-3012493
The complaint
Miss M complains that Home Retail Group Card Services Limited trading as Argos Financial 
Services (Argos) wont repair or replace a faulty laptop.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again here 
instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons: -
I appreciate Miss M cant get her laptop to connect to a TV. Unfortunately, Miss Ms 
laptop came with a one-year warranty. As she bought the laptop on 5 May 2020 the 
warranty expired by 5 May 2021. There is some dispute over when Miss M raised the 
issue with Argos. Argos say Miss M contacted them on 1 July 2021, but Miss M has 
sent video evidence she says shows she returned the laptop on 31 May 2021.  
However, the main issue is that both dates fall outside of the warranty period.
Argos has asked Miss M for some evidence of the fault, for example an independent 
inspection report. I appreciate Miss M has had a challenging time personally, but I 
dont think Argos request is unreasonable. We usually say if issues arise more than 
six months after having an item or , as is the case here, after  the warranty has 
expired the consumer needs to show there is a fault that was present or developing 
at the point of sale. But Miss M hasnt done this so I cant reasonably ask Argos to 
repair or replace the laptop without evidence of a fault and when this fault occurred. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 November 2021.
