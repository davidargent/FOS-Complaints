The complaint
Mr H and Mr H say that after Mr H made a claim on their motor insurance policy, 
Admiral Insurance Company Limited disposed of their car in error.
What happened
Mr H and Mr Hs car was damaged in an accident, and Mr H called Admiral about 
retaining it. An advisor put a note on the file to say the car shouldnt be disposed of. Mr H 
was due to call again within the deadline Admiral had given him, but another advisor 
released the car to salvage in error two days later. Admiral paid £200 compensation, but 
Mr H said it wasnt enough, as the car was gifted by his grandparents and had great 
sentimental value. One of our investigators thought £500 compensation would be 
reasonable. Admiral offered £300, but Mr H and Mr H werent happy with that, so the 
complaint was passed to me for review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Admiral accepts that the car was disposed of in error, thereby taking away Mr H and Mr 
Hs option to keep it and forcing them to look elsewhere for a replacement. So they were 
upset and inconvenienced. I think £300 compensation may be reasonable in some 
cases, but we look at the impact on each particular consumer. In this case, as the car 
was of great sentimental value, I think the effect of its loss was greater than usual. In my 
opinion, £500 is a fair and reasonable sum to reflect the impact of Admirals error.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I require Admiral Insurance Company 
Limited to pay Mr H and Mr H £500 compensation for distress and inconvenience. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H and Mr 
H to accept or reject my decision before 21 September 2022.
