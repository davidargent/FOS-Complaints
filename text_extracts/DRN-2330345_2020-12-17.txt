The complaint
 L complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) caused delays in transferring 
money from its business euro account to its business sterling account. It says it lost money 
due to a drop in the exchange rate. L is represented by its director  Mr L.
What happened
 Mr L wanted to transfer €99,991.93 from Ls NatWest business euro account to its sterling 
account. He was requesting the transfer as he was concerned about a potential drop in the 
euro value, given the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Mr L tried to complete the transfer over the phone, online and in branch. For one reason or 
another it didnt complete until about a week after Mr Ls first attempt, by which time the 
exchange rate had changed to Ls detriment.  Mr L complained.
In response to Mr Ls complaint, NatWest apologised for the service it provided and paid L 
£300 compensation. But Mr L said Ls exchange rate loss was much more than this, so he 
brought the complaint to our service. 
An investigator considered the complaint. He thought NatWest should compensate L for part 
of the exchange rate loss L said it had suffered.
NatWest accepted the investigators findings. But Mr L didnt accept them as he didnt think 
the compensation was enough. The complaint has now come to me to decide. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr L first called NatWest on Wednesday 25 March 2020 and couldnt get through. But this 
call lasted just 13 minutes, and I cant see that he attempted to call again. So I dont think 
NatWest had a reasonable opportunity to complete the transfer on this day.
Mr L attempted the transaction online the next day, but his online banking doesnt allow 
access to foreign exchange accounts, so he visited a branch. The branch wouldnt complete 
the transfer as it said Ls transfer wasnt essential. 
Around the time of the transfer request, many banks were restricting access because of the 
Covid-19 pandemic  I think this was reasonable. Given the size of the transaction, I 
understand why L would have wanted this processed in branch. But it wasnt essential for it 
to be done in branch because it could be arranged over the phone. So, while understandably 
frustrating for Mr L, I dont think NatWest was wrong in refusing the request in branch.
Following his visit, Mr L called NatWest four times. However, the calls were short, with the 
longest one lasting about four minutes. I dont think NatWest had a reasonable opportunity to 
complete the transfer on this day either.
The next day (Friday) Mr L called and was on hold for almost two hours (113 minutes). He 
then spoke to someone but the call was dropped. He called back and waited for almost 
another two hours (114 minutes) before NatWest answered. NatWest apologised and 
assured him if his call was dropped again, he would be called back. But the call was 
dropped, and no call back was made. I think NatWest had a reasonable opportunity to 
complete the transfer on this day but failed to do so.
Mr L called NatWest again the following Wednesday. It was another lengthy call (126 
minutes). The transfer was completed on this day. As the transfer was completed on the 
Wednesday, I think its more likely than not the transfer could have been completed on the 
Monday or Tuesday, had Mr L called. 
Mr L has explained that he didnt call NatWest on the Monday as he was still awaiting a call 
back. I can understand why Mr L might have been reluctant to call NatWest given how long 
hed spent on the phone the previous Friday. But given his concerns about exchange rate 
changes and the size of the transfer he planned, I think Mr L would have recognised that 
relying on a call back was a risk. In my view he ought reasonably to have called NatWest on 
the Monday. And as set out above, had he done so, I think its more likely than not the 
transfer would have been completed. It follows that I dont think I can fairly conclude NatWest 
is responsible for the transfer completing on the Wednesday rather than the Monday.
 
In summary, I think NatWest is responsible for the transfer not completing on the Friday. So I 
think it should compensate L for the exchange rate loss it incurred between Friday 27 March 
2020, and Monday 30 March 2020, when I think the transfer would have been completed 
had Mr L called.
NatWest has paid L £300 compensation. I think this sum fairly reflects the inconvenience this 
matter has caused L. I therefore make no further award regarding non-financial losses.
Putting things right
I think NatWest should:
pay L the difference as set out above, which has been calculated as £499.96;
pay L simple interest* at 8% a year on £499.96 from the date of the loss (Friday 27 
March 2020) to the date of settlement; and 
pay L the £300 compensation NatWest offered it (unless it has already been paid). 
*If National Westminster Bank Plc considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to 
withhold tax from that interest, it should tell L how much its taken off. It should also give L a 
tax deduction certificate if it asks for one, so it can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold Ls complaint, and National Westminster Bank Plc should 
put things right for L as set out above. 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask L to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 January 2021.
