* Total monthly repayment,  including overlapping loans
Ms S says she had a poor credit  rating  and short-term loans with multiple lenders at the 
same time. She says she took loans  in consecutive months and the repayments were 
unaffordable to her.
Lending Stream says it asked Ms S about her income and expenditure at the time of each 
loan application,  and also checked  her credit file. It says there  was nothing to indicate the 
loans were unaffordable with the exception of loan 2. It offered to refund interest and 
charges on this loan.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He considered  proportionate  
checks would have  shown  loans 3, 4 and 5 were unaffordable and that the prolonged 
lending itself showed loans 6 and 7 were unsustainable. He also thought proportionate 
checks would have  shown  Ms S was again having problems managing her money by loans 
10 and 11. Our adjudicator recommended that Lending Stream  should refund interest and 
charges on the seven  loans (plus 8% statutory  interest), remove loans 6 and 7 from Ms Ss 
credit file, and also remove negative information  about loans  3, 4, 5, 10 and 11.
Lending Stream agreed to uphold the complaints about loans 6, 7, 10 and 11.
Ms S did not accept  this offer.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN58887572Lending Stream needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure 
Ms S could repay the loans in a sustainable manner.  These  checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether  Ms S could sustainably repay  her loans   not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ss complaint.
Loans 1 to 7
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 3 to 5 would most likely have 
shown that Ms S was having  difficulty managing her money. She:
ohad overlapping Lending  Stream loans meaning  she had to make multiple 
repayments in a single month;
owas having  to repay a significant  proportion of her income each month;
oneeded to also make repayments  on short-term  loans with other lenders.
Ref: DRN58887573Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Lending Streams  lending history with Ms S, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream  should  reasonably  have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so Lending Stream  should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ss case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
By the time Ms S applied for loan 6 shed been provided with multiple  new loans 
every few days/weeks in little over two months. So Lending  Stream ought to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Ms S was having to borrow  further to cover the 
hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Ms Ss 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
Ms S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Lending Stream.  Loan 
7 was taken out five months after Ms Ss first. And it was for three times the amount. 
Ms S had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Lending 
Stream over an extended period.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 3 to 7 of Ms Ss first loan chain with Lending  
Stream.
Loans 8 to 11
As there was well over a year between Ms S repaying loan 7 and applying  for loan 8, I think 
its reasonable for Lending Stream to have considered  it likely  that Ms Ss financial 
circumstances had improved.
So Im satisfied that Lending Stream did enough  checks for loans 8 and 9 and that nothing  in 
the available  information would have  indicated Ms S was unlikely to be able to afford the 
repayments.
But when Ms S applied  for loan 10, loans 8 and 9 were  still outstanding and the total 
repayment due was over £300. I find that proportionate checks for loans 10 and 11 would 
have again shown Ms S was using other short-term lenders  and that there was a significant 
risk that she couldnt afford to repay the loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 10 and 11 and Lending  Stream should put 
things right.
I think that Ms S lost out because Lending  Stream continued to provide borrowing from loans 
3 to 7 and from loans 10 to 11 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ss indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans, often concurrent,  was likely to have had negative  
implications on Ms Ss ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN58887574my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) 
should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Ms S paid on loans 3 to 7 and 10 to 11;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loan 11, apply  the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Ms S; 
Remove any negative  information about loans 3 to 5 and 10 to 11 from Ms Ss credit  
file.
The number of loans  taken by the time Ms S applied for her 6th and 7th loans means 
any information recorded about  them is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 and 7 
should be removed  from Ms Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Ms S a certificate  showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one. 
If Lending Stream intends to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it 
must do so after deducting  the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 October  2019.
