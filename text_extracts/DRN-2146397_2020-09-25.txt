The complaint
Mr K complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly closed and defaulted 
his credit card. 
What happened
Mr K had a credit card with NatWest. In September 2019 Mr K left the UK to care for a family 
member who was unwell. Mr K returned to the UK in February 2020. 
On Mr Ks return, he found that his credit card had been closed and defaulted as no 
payments were made whilst he was abroad. Mr K complained and NatWest responded on 
15 April 2020. NatWest said it had followed the correct collections process and tried to 
contact Mr K after it stopped receiving payments. NatWest advised that its decision to close 
his account and default it remained unchanged. 
Mr K referred his complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. They thought 
NatWests decision to withdraw the credit card and default it was reasonable and that it had 
dealt with Mr Ks complaint fairly. Mr K asked to appeal, so his complaint has been passed to 
me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Mr K needed to leave the country to look after a family member. Mr K has 
pointed out that he made a substantial repayment on his return to the UK and hoped it would 
show willingness to bring the credit card back up to date. I can see that Mr K didnt want to 
lost his credit card facility or receive a default on his credit file. But, after he stopped making 
payments and didnt contact NatWest to explain why, I think the decision to close the 
account was reasonable. 
Mr Ks final payment was received by NatWest on 27 September 2019. NatWest continued 
to send Mr K statements and its contact notes show it also tried to call about the arrears. 
After no further payments were received and no contact was made, NatWest took the 
decision to close the credit card. In January 2020 NatWest sent Mr K a default notice and 
asked him to pay Â£291.29 within 21 days. As no payment was received, NatWest withdrew 
the credit card and defaulted the account. 
Whilst I understand Mr K had genuine reasons to be out of the country for an extended 
period, NatWest wasnt aware of the situation and wasnt receiving payments. Im sorry to 
disappoint Mr K but Im satisfied NatWest acted fairly when it took the decision to close his 
account and default it.
Mr K has also raised concerns that his debt has been passed to a third party to collect. But 
the credit cards terms and conditions allow NatWest to appoint third parties to collect a debt. 
And I havent seen anything to show Mr K has been treated unfairly as a result of the third 
partys involvement. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr K but I havent been persuaded to uphold his complaint. As Im 
satisfied NatWest has dealt with Mr Ks complaint fairly, Im not telling it to take any further 
action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 October 2020.
