The complaint
Mr L complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wont refund to him the money that he 
paid for some land in 2010 and 2011. His representative is also involved with his complaint.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr L used his NatWest credit card in 2010 and 2011 to make payments to buy three 
plots of land;
he claimed a refund of the money that hed paid for the land from NatWest under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 because he said that the land had been 
misrepresented to him  but it declined his claim in 2014;
he made another claim for a refund of that money to NatWest in 2019 but it said that 
that claim was brought outside of the six year time frame for making such a claim - so 
he complained to this service;
our investigator was satisfied that Mr Ls complaint was about an event that falls 
within this services jurisdiction but he said NatWest could take into account whether 
a claim against the supplier had expired under the Limitation Act when considering 
the like claim against it  and he said that it would be for the courts to decide 
whether or not any claim that he might have against the supplier or NatWest had 
expired;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances - although we do take account of applicable law and 
regulations we also consider the overall situation so its possible that a court would 
reach a different outcome to the decision that Ive made;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
but the purchases of the land were made in 2010 and 2011 and Mr Ls current claim 
wasnt made to NatWest until 2019 and it says that the claim was made outside of 
the six year period for such a claim set out in the Limitation Act;
to be able to uphold Mr Ls complaint about NatWest, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that NatWests 
response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not 
determining the outcome of Mr Ls claim under section 75 as only a court would be 
able to do that;
Ive considered the additional evidence that Mr L and his representative have 
provided but, in the circumstances of Mr Ls complaint, Im not persuaded that 
NatWests response to his claim has been unfair or unreasonable and I consider that 
it would be more appropriate for a court to determine whether the Limitation Act 
prevents Mr Ls claim from proceeding; 
I sympathise with Mr Mr L for the issues with which hes had to deal and for the 
financial loss that hes incurred, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require NatWest to refund to him any of the money 
that he paid for the land, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint; and
NatWest has also said that the relationship between the debtor, creditor and supplier 
thats required for a successful claim under section 75 may not have been present in 
these circumstances  but as Im not upholding Mr Ls claim for other reasons, I 
havent considered whether the required relationship was present.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 October 2020.
