K821x#15complaint
Miss W complains that National Westminster Bank Plc has reported adverse information 
about her not making loan repayments and does not think she should be in arrears.
background
Miss W took a personal loan from NatWest in March 2017 with monthly payments of 
£319.49. In October  2017 Miss W said she was in financial difficulty  and NatWest agreed to 
a plan with payments of £1 for two months. She caught up with those two monthly payments 
in December 2017. But the regular  payment  was not re-established. In January 2018 Nat 
West said this was a mistake and that it would remove adverse credit information.  It paid 
Miss W £100  in compensation and adjusted interest. 
NatWest offered to re-establish payments but Miss W said she would do this in a branch. 
This did not happen and four more payments were missed. In June 2018 NatWest  agreed to 
a payment arrangement for six months with reduced  payments of £281.44. After this no 
further arrangement  was reached. And in February 2019 NatWest  told Miss W shed  need  to 
make monthly payments of £484.30 over the remaining  18 month term of the loan.
Our investigator did not recommend that the complaint be upheld. He noticed that the figure 
NatWest had provided for the arrears  in February 2019 of £2,676.04  did not include one of 
£1 payments Miss W made in 2017  and NatWest has since confirmed it had adjusted  for 
this. But he did not think NatWest had made a mistake in reporting missed  payments or in 
saying Miss W had arrears.
Miss W did not agree and wanted her complaint  to be reviewed.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked closely  at the loan statement for Miss Ws account. As set out above  she made 
token payments in October and November 2017. And she caught  up with those missed  
payments in December  2017. But she did not make the December 2017 payment itself or 
any other payments  until June 2018.
NatWest accepts that it should have restarted regular payments again from December 2017. 
This came to light when  Miss W spoke with a member of its staff by telephone on 25 January 
2018. NatWest said it would set up a standing  order but Miss W instead  wanted to go into a 
branch to discuss this. I can see evidence that NatWest did not report  any missed payments  
up to January 2018. But the payments did not resume  so there  were  four months of further 
missed payments. NatWests case file notes state  that it spoke to Miss W on 30 April 2018 
when she said she could  not afford  payments at that time.
It then reviewed her income and expenditure in June 2018 and established she could afford 
to pay £281.44  a month. A standing order was set up and all six agreed payments were  
made. As these were below the contractual payment  arrears  still built up.
In December 2018 NatWest discussed with Miss W consolidating this loan and her overdraft 
into a new loan over 63 months. This would be with a similar level of repayments to those 
Ref: DRN81014602she was making at that time. It says she did not want to take this up. In February 2019 
NatWest reviewed Miss Ws financial position and decided she could afford  to make 
payments over the remaining  term of the existing  loan to cover  the payments  and arrears.  It 
set up a standing  order to take these  payments.
Miss W has not made all the loan payments in line with her loan agreement.  Im afraid that 
this was apparent  to her in January 2018 and she did not make  any further payments until 
June 2018. At that time her repayments were  still below the contractual level. Although  
NatWest discussed  refinancing  the loan with her, this did not happen. So NatWest still 
records that there are arrears. NatWests mistake was in not setting up payments for 
December 2017  and January 2018.  I consider it has compensated Miss W for that. But I 
dont find on the evidence that NatWest  has made  a mistake in what  it has reported  about 
missed payments after that  or in what it now confirms is the level of her arrears. I know  
Miss W will be disappointed with my assessment.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 September 2019.
