The complaint
Ms G complains about a lack of transparency after a chargeback claim had gone against
her. She feels unfairly penalised, and that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should have done
more to defend her case in the dispute with the buyer.
What happened
On 27 April 2019, Ms G sold a phone to a buyer on a website for around £170. In early May
2019, the buyer contacted her to say theyd received the package but without the phone.
Before she could help the buyer opened a case with PayPal under a different reason, now
saying the item was not as described.
PayPal considered the dispute and agreed with Ms G. But in June 2019, PayPal informed
Ms G that the buyer had requested their bank reverse the payment in what is called a
chargeback. PayPal applied a £14 chargeback fee and debited the amounts in dispute from
Ms Gs account. PayPal said it would help Ms G to defend the chargeback.
Ms G felt she was being penalised despite PayPal having previously decided in her favour.
She asked PayPal to credit her account immediately and asked to be involved in the new
investigation including being updated on a regular basis.
On 11 July 2019, PayPal told Ms G that the credit card issuer had decided in the buyers
favour, as the buyer had met their requirements for a successful chargeback. As a result,
PayPal wouldnt help in the dispute any further. Ms G complained to PayPal about this as
she didnt feel that she had received protection as a seller. She pointed to the
inconsistencies in the buyers actions and arguments.
PayPal explained the chargeback was outside of its process but said it would refund the
chargeback fee of £14 as a goodwill gesture. Ms G was unhappy with this and referred the
matter to our service.
Our investigator initially felt that PayPal had passed all the evidence they had from Ms G to
the credit card issuer  and it was for that party to decide who won the chargeback. He didnt
think PayPal had made an error because they had acted in line with the terms and
conditions and user agreement.
Following a further review, our investigator changed his view. He then upheld the case. He
felt that PayPal had given a commitment on its website to help sellers build a case. While
PayPal had passed Ms Gs information to the card issuer, he didnt think this amounted to an
effective defence.
PayPal didnt agree with the investigator. It said it had followed the same process it does on
every case in similar situations. It said it had attached the relevant supporting information Ms
G had provided them to the card issuer. PayPal asked that an ombudsman look at the
complaint again and reach a final decision.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision in November 2020 explaining why I had reached a different 
outcome from our investigator. In it I said: 
 Did PayPal follow the correct chargeback process?
I can understand why Ms G feels shes been treated unfairly in this situation. Ms G feels she
followed good selling practices in this transaction. She also points to inconsistencies in the
buyers version of events. However, its not for me to decide on the dispute between buyer
and seller. I can only consider whether PayPal has treated her fairly and reasonably in its
handling of the chargeback. In doing so, its worth referring to its actions before and after the
chargeback was raised.
When the dispute initially occurred, PayPal acted quickly to find in Ms Gs favour in May
2019. I think this demonstrates that where it had the deciding say, PayPal was persuaded by
the argument Ms G had presented. However, when the buyers bank initiated a chargeback
in June 2019, it wasnt for PayPal to decide who wins. This was in line with the terms and
conditions that Ms G would have agreed to.
The terms also explain the conditions where PayPals Seller Protection doesnt apply. One of
these is when the buyer alleges that the goods were significantly not as described. And as
the chargeback was raised by the buyers bank under the reason goods were significantly
not as described, in line with the rules, the PayPals Seller Protection wouldnt have applied.
Initially, Ms G questioned the chargeback itself and she was unhappy PayPal had allowed it
to happen. This includes PayPal debiting the money from her account, including the fees it
applied. However, I find this wasnt unfair, as PayPals actions were in line with the terms
and conditions.
Did PayPal do enough to support Ms G?
Ms G has said PayPal didnt do enough to defend her position.
Ive seen the form that PayPal was required to complete, and which included the following
statement: If you wish to refute this chargeback, please explain why. I cant see that
PayPal directly responded to the statement. But the form also invited PayPal to provide any
relevant information or documentation. Here, PayPal sent attachments Ms G had provided to
them when she disputed the buyers version of events. And on the form, PayPal included
important information to show proof of postage and delivery.
Ms G has also pointed to PayPals website where, under chargebacks, it says the following:
Our team of chargeback specialists can help you build a case to take to the credit card
company  assuming you have good reason to dispute it.
Other than the actions noted above on the form, Ms G didnt feel PayPal had provided an
effective defence.
Ive considered the information on the website further as a whole. It goes on to list additional
steps required for logging a dispute. The statement says:
If you've been notified of a chargeback, we'll help you sort it out. Our team of chargeback
specialists can help you build a case to take to the credit card company  assuming you
have good reason to dispute it. We'll provide you with all the relevant transaction details and
walk you through the steps for submitting information to the credit card company.
I can see why the lack of an explanation or additional commentary by PayPal to the
statement on the chargeback form, together with the information on the website, might implythat PayPal didnt help Ms G build a case to support her in the dispute. However, it did
attach documents that Ms G had provided to it, and it confirmed important information to
show the items were delivered. I think that PayPal did help Ms G submit information to the
credit card company for consideration.
I appreciate Ms G might not have been made aware of the exact reason for the chargeback.
And she may have had some problems submitting information later  although its unclear
whose fault this was due to conflicting evidence provided by both parties. But I dont think
this would have made a difference.
I say this because Ms Gs version of events has remained consistent. For instance, she
provided a detailed timeline and supporting information to PayPal on 7 May 2019. Its such
evidence that had led PayPal to initially agree with her  and it did submit this evidence to
the credit card company following the chargeback. Ms Gs arguments were persuasive. Im
not persuaded that additional commentary from PayPal  or further evidence from Ms G 
would have strengthened what Ms G had previously and consistently said. Or that PayPal
could have added anything further to change the outcome of the chargeback.
Overall, Im satisfied PayPal did enough to dispute the chargeback. Ultimately, it was for the
credit card company to consider the arguments, including those from the buyer, before
reaching its decision.
Lack of transparency and poor service
Ms G has complained that PayPal wasnt transparent. PayPal informed Ms G in June 2019
that a chargeback had been raised, and that it would be disputing this with the financial
institution. In response, Ms G responded to say shed sought legal advice. She raised a
complaint and requested greater involvement in the process  including any information
exchanged between parties to be shared with her. She also requested her account balance
be restored. She expected a reasonable answer within 10 days. Ms G continued to
challenge PayPals responses as she didnt think it was doing what shed requested.
While the chargeback came as a surprise to Ms G, I dont think it would have been
reasonable for PayPal to provide the solutions she expected. The process was outside of
PayPals control, and governed by terms and conditions agreed to by Ms G. The chargeback
process itself can be very time sensitive, which PayPal explained. Im satisfied that PayPal
acted reasonably by providing the information to support Ms Gs dispute and it could then
only wait for the outcome. Ive seen the correspondence Ms G was having with PayPal and I
dont agree that there was a lack of transparency.
Ms G has pointed to instances where she didnt think PayPal was always helpful. This
includes being provided with conflicting information about what would happen if the
chargeback went against her. However, PayPal did apologise for the inconvenience and
frustration Ms G had experienced in these dealings. It also reimbursed Ms G the chargeback
fee it had applied as a matter of courtesy. I think this was the fair way to settle this aspect of 
her complaint.
Responses to my provisional decision
Ms G replied saying she didnt agree with my provisional findings. In summary, Ms G said 
wed only been concerned with whether there had been a breach of the terms and 
conditions, which she considers were one sided. Ms G also felt the chargeback process 
wasnt fair as she couldnt challenge the decision made by the credit card company. 
Ms G commented that: 1. PayPal only provided evidence to show she had posted the item. But, the buyers 
reasons changed to significantly not as described when the chargeback was 
initiated. She hadnt been able to provide evidence to support the additional reasons 
provided  which may have made a difference to her challenge. 
2. PayPal didnt complete the right section of the chargeback form. She feels this shows 
PayPal hadnt shown interest in supporting her. 
3. She has evidence that shows she was locked out of PayPals Resolution Centre and 
that she feels PayPal has been dishonest in what it has said about this. 
4. She still considers that PayPal made a commitment on its website that it hasnt lived 
up to. 
PayPal responded to say they didnt have any additional information to add. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought about the further arguments and evidence given by Ms G. 
Its the nature of the chargeback process that one party will most likely be left disappointed 
and I can see why Ms G is frustrated in this case. 
Ultimately Ms G is unhappy about the disagreement with the buyer, and a subsequent 
decision made by the credit card company (a third party in this dispute) that found in that 
buyers favour. Ive previously said that I am unable to change the outcome of that dispute. 
This decision deals with a complaint against PayPal, and whether I think PayPal treated Ms 
G fairly and reasonably in its part of the chargeback process.
Ms G says PayPal didnt notify her that the buyer was claiming the item was not significantly 
as described. And because of this, she wasnt able to tailor her evidence to present the 
appropriate defence. 
Ms G has queried why PayPal didnt make it clear soon enough what the reason for the 
chargeback was.  But she had written to PayPal and described the various reasons the 
buyer had provided. Ms G had also said in an earlier email that the buyer had stated the 
item was defective or not as described. This was a detailed email that also included 
supporting attachments she wanted PayPal to consider. Ms G also noted that she was 
providing the response with all the evidence that I have which I believe would still be 
sufficient to prove that I have completed my part of the transaction duly. 
The above exchanges all formed part of the submissions that PayPal provided to the credit 
card company to dispute the chargeback. I think it shows Ms G was reasonably aware of the 
reason, or reasons, the buyer had provided when raising the chargeback. Overall, Im 
satisfied that Ms G had the time and opportunity to form a defence accordingly. PayPal 
provided these exchanges to the credit card company, and in doing so I think it met its 
obligations to support her. I dont think Ms G was disadvantaged by PayPal not populating 
one section on the chargeback form. I consider it was clear within her submissions why the 
chargeback was being refuted.
Ms G has provided a screenshot she says demonstrates she was locked out of the 
Resolution Centre. PayPal have disputed this. The screenshot shows Ms G had technical problems and this was dated 23 June 2019. But even with these technical difficulties, I dont 
think Ms G was disadvantaged overall.  PayPal did include her previous thorough 
submissions in response to the chargeback. And as I said in my provisional decision, her 
arguments were persuasive and consistent. So I dont think there was more she or PayPal 
could reasonably have added to change the outcome of the chargeback. 
I agree with Ms G that PayPals website gives an impression that it will take a more 
extensive role in making her defence. For instance, in the link provided by Ms G, PayPal 
says its specially trained chargeback team will help you build a powerful case. Even so, I 
dont think it was unreasonable for PayPal to have relied on Ms Gs evidence and her own 
robust defence which it passed to the credit card company for their consideration. 
Overall, Im satisfied PayPal did enough in the particular circumstances of this case to 
support Ms G in her chargeback defence. Its unfortunate for her that she didnt receive the 
outcome shed hoped for. I appreciate there were instances where Ms G was left frustrated 
by the service she received from PayPal. But I think PayPals apology later and 
reimbursement of the chargeback fee was appropriate to resolve any failing in customer 
service. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 February 2021.
