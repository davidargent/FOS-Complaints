K820x#14complaint
Mr L says Bank of Scotland plc (BOS)  mis-sold him an Ultimate Reward Current Account 
(URCA) packaged bank  account. Shes used a Claims  Management Company (CMC) to 
complain.
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr Ls complaint and didnt think that BOS had mis-sold the 
URCA. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Ls complaint. 
Having looked  through everything provided and thought about what both parties have said, I 
think Mr L chose to take the URCA.  His contact with the travel  insurance provider appears to 
suggest that he was relying on this cover and he couldve used some of the other  benefits  
such as the breakdown cover and mobile phone insurance. 
And while Im open to the possibility Mr L wasnt told everything  he needed to know about all 
of the benefits,  I havent seen anything in his circumstances  to suggest that he wouldve 
been affected by any of the main limitations  or exclusions. So I dont  think clearer 
information wouldve  changed Mr Ls decision and he received enough  to know and 
understand what it was he was agreeing  to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Ls complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 March  2019.
