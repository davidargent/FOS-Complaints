The complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA restricted and closed his account. 
And hed like compensation for the impact on him
What happened
Mr Ms account with PayPal was restricted on 30 December 2017. 
The e-money provider asked Mr M to supply a bank statement with his name, address and 
full card number. Mr M provided a document to PayPal however this wasnt sufficient, and 
PayPal reiterated what they needed. Mr M provided more documents  but this still didnt 
show his card number as requested. 
On 3 September 2020 Mr M provided further documentation, but this didnt satisfy PayPal 
and they decided to close his account. Mr Ms account was later restored on 4 March 2021 
after he provided evidence showing his name and card number used to top up his account. 
Mr M also said he was a due a refund from a third party, Ill call V, which hadnt been 
released to him by PayPal. 
Mr M complained to PayPal that theyd restricted his account. However, the e-money 
provider explained they were entitled to review and restrict accounts. 
Mr M didnt agree, so brought his complaint to our service. One of our investigators looked 
into his complaint  overall they thought that PayPal had acted fairly, and Mr M didnt initially 
provide the documents required. Therefore the restriction and review was fair. 
Mr M didnt accept our investigators opinion  in summary he said hed like Â£200 in 
compensation as he sent the same documents in September 2020 and March 2021, 
therefore PayPal should have unrestricted his account on the earlier date. He added that he 
shouldnt have to provide full card details to a financial institution because this puts 
consumers in a position where they may suffer fraud. And argued PayPal should have 
contacted the third-party institution themselves to gather the information. 
As Mr M didnt agree its been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive firstly considered whether PayPal are entitled to review and restrict accounts. And Im 
satisfied they are  I say this as theyve followed their terms and conditions and the e-money 
provider has certain legal and regulatory obligations which they need to comply with. This 
means they can place restrictions without providing any explanation during the period the 
restrictions are in place, or after theyre removed. It follows that theyre also not obliged to 
give customers prior notice of any restrictions. 
Ive moved on to look at the length of time Mr Ms account was restricted for. And the 
evidence he supplied. Ive looked at the evidence Mr M supplied in September 2020 and 
March 2021. Mr M did provide a bank statement in September 2020, but this didnt show his 
name and full card details, as PayPal requested, but did in March 2021. Therefore, I cant 
say PayPal acted unfairly in choosing to close Mr Ms account, and not reopen his account 
until the documents requested were provided in March 2021. 
Mr Ms argued that he shouldnt be asked to provide documents containing his full card 
details to PayPal, as it might put him at risk of fraud. And PayPal should instead go directly 
to any third-party organisation that they need information from. Im afraid I cant agree with 
Mr M here  Ive not seen any evidence that Mr Ms documentation would be at risk if 
provided to PayPal. And I dont think its unreasonable for them to go directly to their 
customer, rather than a third party, for documents theyll be able to provide.  
Ive asked Mr M about whether the refund from V was paid into his PayPal account, however 
I havent received a reply. From what Ive seen so far, Ive not seen any evidence that 
Mr Ms refund from V was credited into his PayPal account. And Id recommend that he 
speaks to V directly to try to obtain his funds.  
For the reasons Ive outlined above I wont be asking PayPal to do anything further here. 
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 September 2022.
