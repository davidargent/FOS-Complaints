K820x#14Complaint
Ms L complains that HSBC UK Bank plc wont refund a number of debit card transactions 
which she says she didnt  make or authorise.
Background
The following  transactions were made from Ms Ls account:
Date of transaction Date debited account Amount
14/05/18 29/05/18 £101.40
08/06/18 11/06/18 £91.75
08/06/18 12/06/18 £160.00
08/06/18 11/06/18 £130.50
08/06/18 11/06/18 £135.00
08/06/18 11/06/18 £119.95
08/06/18 11/06/18 £120.00
09/06/18 12/06/18 £150.00
Total £1008.60
These were  all online transactions  with various retailers.  Ms L says she didnt make  any of 
the transactions and that she left the UK on 25 May,  so she wasnt  in the country when the 
majority of the transactions  took place. 
She says she noticed the transactions when she tried to use her debit card but didnt have 
enough money in her account so she logged into online  banking.  She then reported  it to 
HSBC.
Ms L says she had her card, phone  and laptop  in her possession  and she hadnt given her 
details to anyone  or authorised anyone to make the transactions. She says she thinks  her 
details could have  been compromised when  she used her phone  at the airport.
HSBC wouldnt refund Ms L. It said the pattern of transactions wasnt  typical  of those of a 
fraudster; that Ms L had used some of the retailers for genuine  transactions; and that the 
device used matches that used for genuine transactions.
Ms L referred the matter to this service and one of our investigators considered  it. She didnt 
recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She couldnt see how anyone else would 
have been able to carry out the transactions using  Ms Ls device and details without her 
consent.
Ms L couldnt explain how her device  could have been used for these transactions  and she 
asked for her complaint to be reviewed  by an ombudsman.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN61260812Where the evidence is incomplete,  inconclusive, or contradictory (as some of it is here),  
I have to reach my decision on the balance of probabilities   in other words, what I consider 
is most  likely  to have happened in light of the available evidence  and the wider  
circumstances.
There are several possible explanations  for what happened here.  And in reaching my 
decision, Ive considered  the likelihood of each  of them. These  are:
Ms L carried out the transactions herself.
A third party carried out the transactions with Ms Ls consent.
A third party  known or unknown to Ms L  acquired her card details and used them for 
the online transactions without  her consent.
For me to decide that HSBC needs to refund the transactions to Ms L, I need  to conclude 
that she didnt  authorise  them.
Im satisfied that the transactions  were made using Ms Ls genuine card details. Ms L says 
she had her card with her at all times which would lead me to conclude  that the transactions 
were carried  out by her, or someone who had acquired her card details  either with or 
without her consent.
The bank has provided evidence to show that the device  a mobile  phone  - which  was used 
for the disputed transactions was the same  device used for other, genuine, transactions.  And 
Ms L has confirmed that she had her phone with her at all times and that it was password 
protected. So theres no reasonable explanation  for how the transactions could have been 
carried out by an unauthorised third party using Ms Ls phone, when shes  confirmed no-one 
else had access to it.
HSBC has also argued that the transactions dont seem to be consistent with those of a 
typical fraudster. And I agree. There were a number of transactions  over a short  period of 
time on the night and morning of the 8th and 9th June and a final attempted  transaction  for 
£180 which was stopped  by the bank because  there  wasnt  enough money in Ms Ls 
account. These transactions could potentially  look suspicious.  But there was also a 
transaction on 14 May. Weve given Ms L the opportunity  to think about  this transaction  
again, but shes confirmed that she does still dispute it. It would seem most unusual  to me 
that somebody was able to obtain Ms Ls phone and bank card details  on 14 May,  but only 
carried out one transaction.  And then waited until 8 June to carry out further transactions.
Im mindful that Ms L has been consistent  in her testimony. And in her belief that her details 
must have  been  compromised at the airport. And when she phoned HSBC to report  the 
transactions she was clearly distressed.  Weve  also found out from one of the retailers  that 
for three transactions  a billing address and delivery address were provided  which  were  not 
Ms Ls. 
But, like our investigator, Ive not seen any evidence to show how Ms Ls bank card details 
could have been compromised. And crucially  how her device could have been used without 
her knowledge  or consent.
In the circumstances, I cant conclude that she didnt authorise the transactions.  It follows  
that I cant order HSBC  to refund them to her account.
Ref: DRN61260813My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 May 2020.
