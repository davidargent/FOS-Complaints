K820x#14complaint
Mrs G says Barclays Bank Plc (Barclays) mis-sold her a Tech pack from its feature store  
in 2013. Shes used  a Claims Management  Company  (CMC)  to make her complaint.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mrs Gs complaint and didnt think  the feature store pack 
had been mis-sold. The CMC disagreed  and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mrs Gs complaint. 
Ive looked at everything thats been provided  on this complaint. And having done  so, I 
havent seen anything to suggest Mrs G was mis-sold her Tech  pack. 
I think that Mrs G freely  chose to take the Tech pack, used some of the benefits  and couldve 
used others  too. So while  Im open  to the possibility Mrs G wasnt provided with everything 
she shouldve been, I havent seen anything  to suggest clearer information wouldve 
changed her decision.  And, in these circumstances,  Im not upholding the complaint.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mrs Gs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs G to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 March 2019.
