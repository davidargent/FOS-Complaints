The complaint
Ms T complains about the service she received from Barclays Bank UK Plc when requesting 
information about her travel insurance cover. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Its not in dispute that Ms T didnt receive a good service from Barclays. She had to 
call Barclays several times and had calls cut off. Ms T also says she was promised 
phone calls which didnt happen. I also understand that Ms T raised a complaint with 
Barclays via its app, but she wasnt contacted about this. 
Ms T has raised concerns about the conduct of a particular staff member during 
some phone calls. She says the staff member was dishonest and unprofessional. 
Our investigator advised Ms T that we hadnt been sent those calls by Barclays. Ive 
checked with Barclays, and it does not have recordings of those calls, so I cant 
comment on Ms Ts particular concerns here. 
Whilst its apparent that Ms T was caused inconvenience by Barclays handling of the 
matter, Im satisfied that the compensation of Â£245 paid was appropriate in the 
circumstances. 
I therefore dont require Barclays to take any further action. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint as Im satisfied that Barclays Bank UK 
Plc has paid Ms T reasonable compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms T to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 August 2023.
