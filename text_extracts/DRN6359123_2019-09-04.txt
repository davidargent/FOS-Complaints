K820x#14complaint
Mrs I says Lloyds Bank PLC, trading as TSB, mis-sold her a payment protection insurance 
(PPI) policy.  
background
Mrs I bought the policy in 1996 to cover her credit card repayments. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mrs I disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Is case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs Is complaint because:
 The credit  card application forms Lloyds used in branch at the time required the 
customer to tick a box to show they wanted  PPI. So I think  Lloyds made Mrs I aware 
that she had a choice about  buying the PPI, and that she chose to take it. 
 Lloyds recommended the PPI to Mrs I, and it seems to have been right for her based 
on what Ive seen  of her circumstances at the time. While she had some sick pay the 
PPI wouldve paid out on top of this for up to 12 months. This wouldve  left her sick pay 
available for other things. 
 Its possible the information Lloyds gave Mrs I about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Mrs I doesnt appear  to have been affected by any of the main 
things the policy  didnt cover  and based on what I know about  her circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been  useful to her. So I dont  think  better information 
wouldve stopped  her buying  it. 
Ive taken into account Mrs Is comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Is complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs I to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 October  2019.
