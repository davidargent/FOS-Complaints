The complaint
Miss L complains that CarCashPoint Limited (CarCashPoint) lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
Miss L took out two separate fixed sum loans with CarCashPoint, in November 2021 and 
April 2022. The first loan was for £860, repayable by way of 36 monthly payments of 
£109.89 with the total amount repayable under the agreement being £3,956.04. The 
second loan was for £1,560 and was repayable by way of 36 monthly payments of 
£168.14 with the total amount repayable under the agreement being £6,053.04. 
Miss L says the two loans were made irresponsibly as she was already struggling 
financially and had a poor credit record.  
CarCashPoint didnt agree. It said it had carried out a credit check and reviewed her 
income and expenditure when she made each application. Based on that each loan was 
affordable.
Our adjudicator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. He thought CarCashPoint 
didnt act unfairly or unreasonably by approving the two loans. 
But Miss L didnt agree and so the complaint has been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
CarCashPoint will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we 
consider when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. So, 
I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about our 
approach to these complaints is set out on our website. 
Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my comments on what I think is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on 
board and think about it but because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach 
what I think is the right outcome.
Before granting each of these loans, I think CarCashPoint gathered a reasonable amount of 
evidence and information from Miss L about her ability to repay. I say this having noted the 
credit checks it carried out each time. This included verifying Miss Ls employment and 
income from checking several bank statements shed provided. Miss L also provided details 
about the income and state benefits she was receiving as well as details about her regular 
committed expenditure. Ive seen that the checks didnt reveal any significant adverse 
information about Miss Ls recent financial history, although shed had a default against 
credit shed taken out in February 2018. Miss L had also previously taken out several short 
term loans which look to have been settled by the time she took out the first of these two 
loans. However, just because I think CarCashPoint carried out proportionate checks for each 
of these loans, it doesnt automatically mean it made a fair lending decision on each 
occasion. So, Ive thought about what the evidence and information showed. 
Ive reviewed the information and evidence CarCashPoint gathered, as well as the 
information Miss L provided at the time she made her application for each of these loans. 
Having done so I agree that the checks that were completed showed that each agreement 
was likely to be affordable to Miss L. But Ive also looked at bank statement information so 
as to get some indication of what CarCashPoint may have seen at the time, although its 
been unable to provide us with copies 
From the bank statements Miss L has given us, I broadly agree that Miss L had an average 
net monthly earned income of around £1,500 at the time of the first agreement that had 
increased to around £1,650 by the time of the second agreement. I see that CarCashPoint 
was using the bank statement information to verify Miss Ls regular living expenses and 
monthly expenditure  and that the figures it reached were higher than those provided by 
Miss L. 
Car Cashpoint estimated that Miss L would have been left with around £350 in disposable 
income each month at the time she entered into the first agreement and £300 by the time 
she started the second agreement.  Our adjudicator generally agreed with these figures. I 
can see that Miss Ls level of income and committed expenditure was in line with the 
information set out in the affordability assessments that CarCashPoint relied on. I therefore 
agree that each of these loans was likely to have been affordable as she had sufficient 
disposable income to meet the monthly payments. For these reasons, I dont think 
CarCashPoint acted unfairly when approving each of the loans.
Ive also seen that Miss L says she wasnt told about the repayment terms for each 
agreement. For both loans she signed a pre-contract document confirming she was aware of 
the main terms and agreement costs. In the absence of any evidence suggesting why she 
might not have been aware of the repayment terms, I think its more likely than not that 
Miss L was aware of the main details for each agreement at the time she signed it. 
Whilst I realise this wont be the outcome Miss L was hoping for, I dont consider Ive 
seen enough evidence or information to show that either of these two loans was been 
made irresponsibly. I therefore dont think CarCashPoint needs to take any further 
action.
My final decision
Your text here For the reasons Ive given above I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 June 2023.
