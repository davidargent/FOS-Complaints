K821x#15complaint
Miss Y says CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid  and Pounds  to Pocket) (CEN) lent 
to her irresponsibly because she couldnt afford these  loans.    
background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision I sent in April 2019. 
An extract  from this is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I will not repeat that 
information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to fully uphold  all the loans I was able 
to consider. I invited  both parties to let me have  any further comments  and evidence.  And 
CEN had some additional comments  for me to consider. 
Ive carefully considered  everything CEN has told us. In summary it said;
Miss Y had some small breaks before loan 6, which didnt suggest she was 
struggling to repay her loans.
The loan amounts for loans 1  4 didnt rapidly  increase  and Miss Y repaid loan 5 in 
full, before the contractual due date. By doing so she saved £107.56  in interest  that 
was due. 
She also repaid  loan 6, in full and early, which again saved her some interest that 
she was due to repay.  
Not all of Miss Ys later loans were for increasing values, for example her borrowing 
dropped £150  between loans 8 and 9. 
Miss Y has never been charged  a late fee.  
When CEN was made aware  of Miss Ys financial hardship it froze interest  and 
charges and set her up with a repayment plan. And once her loans were settled in full 
it didnt relend to her. 
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Miss Y has withdrawn her complaint  about the first five loans, so in my provisional  decision I 
made no finding on whether CEN  was right or wrong to have provided these loans. However, 
CEN has suggested that Miss Ys pattern  of lending for loans 1  5 didnt suggest that she 
was having financial  problems and therefore it wasnt wrong to have provided the later loans.   
What I would say is that, by the time Miss Y had taken loan 6 (the first loan I could consider), 
she had already been borrowing for around 20 months and there was no sign that Miss Y 
was reducing the amounts she was borrowing or was reducing her need  to take short  term 
loans. For example, her first loan of £200,  was the smallest loan to date. In addition, each 
subsequent loan was taken out fairly quickly  after the previous loan had been repaid, for 
example there is a gap of only 1 day between  loans 2 and 3. 
But, again, I want to reiterate I make no findings  on the suitability of these loans. Im merely 
commenting on what CEN has said about Miss Ys previous borrowing relationship up to the 
point that I was able to consider the case. 
Ref: DRN36628252So contrary  to what CEN says, I think the lending pattern suggests there were  enough signs,  
such as time she had spent in debt to CEN, no significant gaps in lending,  and the lending  
wasnt generally decreasing was an indication  that Miss Y may have  been  having some 
difficulties. And it is for these reasons that I think by the time CEN approved loan 6 its 
checks shouldve gone further. And for the reasons outlined in my provisional decision,  had 
CENs checks gone further it wouldve likely seen Miss Y wasnt in a position to repay the 
loan. 
Generally, if a consumer  is able to successfully repay a loan either on time or earlier than set 
out in the loan agreement, I dont think  this automatically means they have managed  to 
repay the loan without  undue difficulty.  For example, they may have had to borrow from 
elsewhere in order  to meet their loan repayments  or they may have had to go without some  
day to day essentials.  
And a consumer may also have been left in the situation where  they have to borrow  again 
from the same lender  because repaying the previous loan left a gap in their available  funds. 
So it therefore follows that I wouldnt automatically  reject Miss Ys complaint about loan 6 
because it was repaid  early. Indeed,  CEN wouldnt have been aware of her intention to 
repay this loan earlier when it was given.  It was CEN intention  that the loan would run to 
term, as outlined in the credit  agreement.  
Ive also reviewed Miss Ys loan history in light of CENs comments  that not all principal 
sums from loan 6 increased  in value. For example, there is a drop of £150 in principal 
between loans 8 and 9. However,  what I would point out is that Miss Y topped up loan 8, and 
the starting value of loan 9 was the same amount as the initial  principal amount of loan 8. 
So while maybe  each  initial  drawdown  didnt always increase in principal, what Miss Y was 
demonstrating was that there was no significant  or sustained decrease  in her borrowing or 
evidence that she was trying to wean herself  off of payday lending.  Indeed,  it seems  to me 
that Miss Y continued to be indebted to CEN, meaning she was either borrowing from or 
repaying CEN almost  every month  for almost 3 years. 
Equally, Ive considered CENs comment about the Miss Y not being  charged any late fees. 
But this on its own wouldnt automatically lead me to conclude that CENs checks were  
proportionate or that the loans must  have been affordable for her. And for the reasons I 
outlined in the provisional decision, had CEN carried out further checks I think it wouldve 
likely seen that Miss Y wasnt  in a position  to repay  the loans that I was able to consider. 
 
So taking the above into account, this led me to conclude that CEN shouldve carried  out 
further checks before it approved the remaining loans  I was considering. And for the reasons 
Ive already explained in my provisional  decisions, further checks  wouldve likely highlighted 
that Miss Y wasnt in a position  to take on further  loans.    
Ive also taken a look at the statement of account,  as well as the emails provided  to me by 
CEN. Based on what Ive seen, it would appear  CEN did freeze interest and charges on the 
final loan and assisted  Miss Y with the setting  up of a repayment  plan. However,  the actions 
of CEN at this point,  which  potentially were positive and sympathetic, had no bearing on 
whether I think proportionate  checks  were carried out, and if not,  then whether further 
checks wouldve likely shown CEN  that the loan was affordable  for Miss Y. 
Ref: DRN36628253So having  considered the additional information CEN has given us, and everything I saw 
before making  my provisional decision, I still think CEN was wrong to have given Miss Y 
loans 6  14.
what CEN  should do to put things  right
To put things right for Miss Y, CEN should, in addition  to what it has already agreed;
refund  the interest and charges paid by Miss Y for loans 6  10 and 12  14
add interest at 8% per year simple on the above interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement ; 
remove all adverse  information recorded  on Miss Ys credit file as a result  of these 
loans. Given the number of loans and my reasons for upholding the complaint about 
them, I think that the sheer number of loans is in itself adverse. So, in this instance,  
all reference to loans  6  14 should be removed from her credit file.
For loan 11 (which includes 11a, 11b and 11c) CEN should remove  all the interest  and 
charges applied to the outstanding  balance.  CEN  should then re-work  the account as if all 
payments made by Miss Y went towards  the principal sum. But importantly, CEN needs to 
make sure that Miss Y doesnt  repay  more  than the principal amount she borrowed.  
If, after the account rework Miss Y has already  paid enough to fully repay  the principal sum 
then any overpayment should be refunded to her with 8% simple interest from the date of the 
overpayment to the date of settlement
If however after the above rework  Miss Y still has an outstanding principal balance due, then 
CEN can use the refund from loans 6  10 and 12 - 14 to offset this amount. 
HM Revenue & Customs requires CEN to take off tax from this interest. CEN must give 
Miss Y a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, and in my provisional  decision, I partly uphold Miss Ys 
complaint. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right for Miss Y as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss Y to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 June 2019.

complaint
Miss Y says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid and Pounds  to Pocket) (CEN) lent to her 
irresponsibly because  she couldnt afford these loans.    
background
A summary  of Miss Ys borrowing based on the information provided by CEN can be found  in the 
appendix at the end of this decision.
CEN didnt think that we were able to investigate loans 1  5 as Miss Y had made her complaint too 
late. But, Miss Y has withdrawn her complaint about  these loans. So I wont be making a finding  as to 
whether CEN  was right or wrong to grant these loans. But I have thought  about  these loans in the 
overall context  of Miss Ys lending relationship. 
Loans 5, 6 and 11 were  issued by Pounds to Pocket.  These were instalment  loans which  were due to 
be repaid over a longer  period of time,  normally around a year. 
Most of the other  loans were payday loans  issued by CEN. These differed from the instalment loan as 
these typically had to be repaid by the next payday. 
Finally, loan 14, was a flex credit facility.  This again differed from the other loans  CEN had provided. 
This facility  provided Miss Y with a credit limit (£750) that she could draw up to, with the repayments 
spread again over a longer  period of time, typically  around 10 months.   
Miss Y complained  to CEN about her loans and it accepted that QuickQuid loans 5 and 6 (loans 7 and 
8 in the loan table) shouldnt have been given. It then offered to refund the interest and charges on 
these, pay 8% simple interest and then use this refund to offset the outstanding  balance Miss Y had 
with CEN.  But it didnt  agree  that the other loans were  given irresponsibly.  Miss Y was unhappy with 
CENs response so she brought her complaint  to us. 
Our adjudicator reviewed  Miss Ys complaint  and she didnt think that CEN  had carried  out 
proportionate checks for any of the loans we were  looking  at. And the adjudicator  concluded that, had 
CEN carried out further checks for loans 7  14 (as per the loan table), it wouldve  seen that Miss Y 
wasnt in a position to take on these loans.  
CEN didnt fully agree  with the recommendations made by the adjudicator. In response it made  a 
number of points;
CEN agreed with the adjudicators recommendation  in relation to loan 9
loan 10 was taken out and repaid  on the same day  so no interest refund is due to Miss Y
CEN agreed to refund  the further advances  on loan 11 (so loans  11a, 11b and 11c)
there were breaks in lending of 71 days between loans 9 and 10 and 41 days between  loans 
12 and 13. 
Following further emails  between the adjudicator and CEN, it also agreed to uphold  loan 14 (the flex 
credit account). 
So CENs  final offer was a refund of interest and charges (as well as 8% simple interest) and removal 
of adverse credit file information for loans (taken from the table in the appendix)  7  9, loans 11a, 11b 
and 11c and the flex credit  facility (loan 14). 
Ref: DRN36628255Miss Y didnt accept the offer so the complaint has been passed to me for consideration. As Ive 
already mentioned, CEN has already accepted that loans  7  9, 11a  11c and loan 14 shouldnt have 
been given. So as these  loans are no longer  in dispute my decision  will instead focus on loans  6, 10, 
11, 12 and 13. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive carefully  thought about everything Ive been given and having 
done so, Im intending to uphold  Miss Ys complaint  and Ill explain  why below. 
CEN had to gather  enough  information to be able to make an informed  decision as to whether  it was 
going to lend.  The guidance and rules dont set out what checks must  be done before lending is 
approved. However,  CEN  needed to take reasonable  steps to check  that Miss Y could  repay her 
loans in a suitable  manner.  And these checks needed to be proportionate to a number of things, such  
as the size of the loans and when  they were due to be repaid. 
CEN says it carried out an affordability assessment for each loan. For some of the loans  it also 
carried out a credit  check. We havent been provided  with the results  for all of the credit checks 
carried out, and all that we can see from these reports is that Miss Y wasnt subject to any County 
Court Judgements (CCJs) or Individual  Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs).  CEN went  on to say its credit 
checks didnt show it anything to give it cause for concern, so it thought  it was reasonable to lend.  
For each  loan CEN took details of Miss Ys income   and she declared  she earned between  £1,200 
and £1,800 per month during the time of her lending. CEN didnt  gather any information  from Miss Y 
about her monthly  expenditure.   
So CEN says that based on the information it gathered about Miss Y, it was reasonable to lend to her. 
But Ive thought about what CEN says in the context of Miss Ys circumstances at the time each loan 
was approved  and having done so, I dont think the checks CEN carried out were proportionate for all 
of the lending Im looking at. I also think, based on what Ive seen,  that Miss Y has lost out as a result 
of CENs actions. 
The first loan Im considering is loan 6. By this point in Miss Ys lending relationship she had been 
taking loans from CEN for around  20 months and generally Miss Ys borrowing had increased  over 
this time.  Miss Ys sixth loan was also her second consecutive  instalment loan for £1,000 and it was 
also taken on the same day as her previous instalment  loan (loan  5) had been repaid. And at the time 
of this loan,  CEN  was aware that Miss Ys declared  income was £1,400 per month.  So with the 
highest monthly repayment of £168.81, CEN may have believed this loan to be affordable for Miss Y.  
But by now, I think CEN ought to have had some  concerns that Miss Y was becoming  dependent on 
this type of borrowing,  taking  into account the increasing amounts being lent and the frequency  of the 
borrowing. And this shouldve prompted CEN to carry out further, more in-depth,  checks before 
agreeing to lend. And these  checks shouldve  extended to having a thorough understanding  of Miss 
Ys actual financial position.  
CEN couldve verified the information a number of ways.  For example, it couldve asked to see 
evidence of Miss Ys income via a payslip and outgoings via copies of bill statements. Or, as Ive done 
here, it couldve  asked to see Miss Ys bank statements. The bank statements  are the best indication 
of her ability to afford  the loan at the time it was approved, so I dont think its unreasonable to rely on 
them.
At the time this loan was approved, it seems that Miss Ys reported income was broadly accurate  - 
around £1,500 a month. But I also think proportionate checks wouldve likely  shown CEN  that Miss Y 
was already committed to repaying other short term lenders nearly  £1,200 each month.  So with the 
monthly repayment to CEN of £168.81, Miss Y was already committing to spending around £1,361 of 
her £1,500 income to repaying repay day loan companies. This left her with only around £139 to 
Ref: DRN36628256cover her living costs,  and I can see from her bank statements that she had a rent payment of £300,  
along with other living costs such as food,  travel  as well as other financial commitments.   
So had CEN carried out proportionate checks, it wouldve seen that Miss Y didnt have any disposable  
income to be able to afford the repayments  she was committed to making, and I dont think CEN 
shouldve given her loan six. 
For all remaining loans, I also dont think CENs checks went far enough. CEN continued to frequently  
lend to Miss Y. she was steadily becoming further and further indebted to CEN as generally each  new 
loan was for more than the previous one and by the end of Miss Ys lending she ended with her 
largest instalment loan to day £1,175. And CEN  had also moved Miss Y on to its flex credit product  
with a credit  limit of £750.  Although this didnt  need to be repaid in one monthly  repayment, the effect 
of moving her on to this product wouldve been to extend the period of time Miss Y was indebted  to 
CEN. 
So I think for all remaining loans, CEN needed  to do the same sort of checks  as I think  it ought to 
have done before agreeing  to loan 6. 
As above, Miss Y has provided her bank statements  and Ive reviewed these for the remaining 
borrowing period. And having done so, I can see Miss Ys financial  situation doesnt  change  from 
when the sixth loan was granted, in fact, from what I can see it appears Miss Ys financial  position  
deteriorated over the remaining of her borrowing from CEN.
Miss Ys income appears to fluctuate during this period of time  she was earning between £1,500 
and £1,800 per month. And this may have given  CEN the impression that Miss Y would be able to 
afford these loans. However, this wasnt the case, even when using Miss Ys largest income the 
additional borrowing was not affordable for her. 
I say this because she continued to take loans  from a number of different short term payday lenders  
throughout the time she took loans  from CEN,  and Miss Y was frequently  required to make 
repayments of around £1,000 per month. And she also appears to have taken out new longer term 
credit commitments such as personal  loans and this added at least £360 a month to regular  monthly 
expenditure. On top of this, Miss Y had rent of at least £400 per month as well as costs  for food, 
travel, phone bill and a couple of credit card repayments. 
For example in the weeks before loan 10 was approved,  she had outstanding  payday loans of just 
under a £1,000. And she had recently taken out a new longer term loan with repayments of nearly  
£200 per month.   So even  without  thinking about and including Miss Ys monthly  living  costs she 
couldnt afford  to take on this loan. Some of those living costs included  rent payments of around £400 
per month,  phone bill of around £40, catalogue shopping accounts of £100,  travel of £50 plus parking 
and petrol  costs and credit  card repayments of around £40. 
I appreciate that this loan appears to have been repaid on the same day, but at the point the loan was 
approved CEN  wouldnt  have been aware  of Miss Ys intentions.  
As a further example in the weeks  before  loan 13 was approved,  she had outstanding payday and 
instalment loans with a number of different lenders. Miss Y also had an outstanding  instalment  loan 
with CEN,  with payments  of £180 a month needing  to be made on top of the payments she was due 
to make for loan 13. She also had her regular  living  costs which by now included repayments to a 
third credit card provider of around  £30 per month. And by now Miss Y was also having  to pay 
additional bank charges which  had started to be applied  due to unplanned  overdraft fees,  that werent 
previously charged  by her bank. So taking all of this together, CEN shouldve  realised that Miss Y 
wasnt in a position to repay what she was lent. 
So taking everything in to account, I think proportionate checks  wouldve likely  shown CEN that these 
loans werent sustainably  affordable for Miss Y. She was spending a significant  portion  of her income 
each month  servicing  both payday loans  and other longer  forms of credit. And on top of this she still 
Ref: DRN36628257had her regular monthly living costs.  And as a responsible  lender CEN wouldve  likely seen this and 
not approved  the loans. 
breaks in lending
But before thinking about what CEN  needs to do to put things right,  I want  to address the points that it 
has raised in response to the adjudicators findings. CEN  says that weve not considered the breaks in 
lending between some  of the loans. Ive thought very carefully about the gaps CEN has highlighted. 
However, one of the gaps CEN mentions  (between loans 12 and 13) appears to ignore the fact that at 
this time Miss Y had an outstanding Pounds  to Pocket loan  so she was in fact indebted to CEN 
throughout the entire period  of this gap.
In any event, taking into account Miss Ys overall  lending  pattern (total borrowing  period of nearly four 
years) I dont  consider  any of the gaps highlighted  by CEN to be sufficient to suggest that Miss Y 
wasnt dependent on these  loans  or that CEN  could reasonably believe that it could treat any new 
application afresh.   
Having considered  all CENs submissions,  I am currently planning to uphold this complaint in full. This 
means Ive had to think about  what  amendments  CEB needs to make to Miss Ys credit file. 
credit file
Ive thought very carefully about what should happen  to Mrs Ys credit file. The reason  being  is that 
the greater the presence of short-term loans  on Mrs Ys credit file this could make it more difficult  to 
rehabilitate her financial position and regain access  to mainstream lenders. 
I recognise the importance of preserving  the accuracy of Mrs Ys credit history and creditworthiness,  
so other lenders can make informed decisions  as to whether to lend. But I also think that the mere 
presence of this many  loans on Mrs Ys credit file, in itself, constitute adverse information, which in 
turn is likely to continue to adversely affect her going forwards. 
So in the circumstances I think that it is fair and reasonable for CEN  to remove all reference to loans 6 
 14 from Miss Ys credit file.
