The complaint
Mr B complains about interest charges showing on his agreement with Close Brothers 
Limited trading as Close Brothers Motor Finance.
What happened
In September 2018 Mr B was supplied with a car and entered into a conditional sale 
agreement with CB.
In April 2021 Mr B contacted CB to query the amount of interest he was being charged. He 
asked CB to explain how the total amount of interest had been calculated.
In response, CB said the interest had been correctly calculated. But Mr B didnt agree with 
the calculation and brought his complaint to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She said she thought the amount of interest 
charged and the rate of interest was set out clearly in the agreement and said she couldnt 
see that CB had applied an incorrect interest rate to the agreement.
Mr B didnt agree. He didnt think the amount on which interest was charged should include 
the associated fees. He queried how the APR had been worked out and said he thought it 
should be calculated by applying the interest rate to the loan amount and then adding any 
associated fees.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at Mr Bs agreement with CB. This says that the total cash price of the car was 
£9,594.00. the amount of credit was £6,594.00.
The total charge for credit is shown as £2,867.40. This is comprised of interest charges of 
£2517.40, an acceptance fee of £340 and a title transfer fee of £10. The interest rate is 
7.25% per annum fixed and the term of the agreement is 60 months. The total amount 
payable under the agreement is £12,461.40 (£9,594.00 plus £2,867.40).
Mr B doesnt agree with how CB has calculated the interest. He thinks the interest should be 
applied to the amount of credit (£6,594.00, and has calculated interest over the term at 
£2390.32, as opposed to the £2517.40 calculated by CB. Mr B thinks he has been 
overcharged interest amounting to around £127.00.
The issue is whether interest should be calculated on the amount of credit (£6594.00) or on 
the total amount of lending (£6,594.00 plus £340 acceptance fee plus £10 title transfer fee)
Ive checked the calculation and Im satisfied that CB has calculated interest correctly based 
on a total amount of lending of £6,944.00.
I appreciate that Mr B doesnt think that the acceptance fee and title transfer fee should be 
added to the amount of credit before interest is calculated. Based on what Ive seen, I dont 
think CB has done anything wrong with its calculation. The interest rate has been applied to 
the amount of credit plus associated fees, which together comprise the total amount of 
lending. All of the relevant information including the interest rate, the amount of credit and 
the associated fees are shown on the agreement. I havent seen anything in the agreement 
to suggest that the associated fees should be excluded from the interest calculation.
Mr B has also queried how the APR has been worked out. The APR is calculated by adding 
together the interest amount and the administrative fees, dividing this by the loan amount, 
dividing by the total number of days in the term, multiplying by 365 and multiplying by 100 to 
come to a percentage.
Taking all of the available information into account, Im satisfied that CB have calculated 
interest correctly under the agreement.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given Im unable to uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 February 2022.
