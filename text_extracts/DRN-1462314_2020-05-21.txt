The complaint
Mr S complains that loans he had from Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as 
Sunny) were unaffordable. 
What happened
Mr S had six loans from Sunny between August 2016 and January 2019 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Max Monthly 
Repayment*Due Repaid
1 31 Aug 2016 £1,000 14m £140.28 31 Oct 2017 31 Aug 2017
2 14 Jul 2017 £500 14m £207.53 31 Aug 2018 16 Dec 2017

4 12 Sep 2017 £300 7m £184.37 29 Mar 2018 16 Dec 2017
5 14 Sep 2017 £400 7m £286.95 29 Mar 2018 16 Dec 2017
6 15 Jan 2019 £300 7m £76.27 31 Jul 2019 31 Jan 2019
* Including overlapping loans
Mr S says Sunny didnt carry out proper affordability checks and that the loans were 
unaffordable to him. He says this led to repeated borrowing, including with other lenders, 
which left him in a debt spiral.
Sunny says it asked Mr S about his income and expenditure and checked his credit file. It 
says it was satisfied its checks were proportionate and that the loans were affordable based 
upon the available information. Sunny adds that Mr S never fell into arrears and all loans 
were repaid early.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld in part. He said that, by loan 
5,  Mr S already had three outstanding short-term loans and so Sunny should have realised 
it was unlikely Mr S would have been able to sustainably repay the loan. Our adjudicator 
recommended Sunny should refund interest and charges on loan 5 (plus 8% statutory 
interest) and remove any associated negative information from his credit file.
Sunny responded to say, in summary, that its product allowed customers to hold four 
concurrent loans subject to a notional maximum credit limit. It said it was satisfied Mr S could 
afford the total required repayment as its checks showed sufficient disposable income. It 
adds there was nothing to indicate Mr S was struggling financially and his repayment history had been good. Nevertheless, it offered to refund the interest charged on loan 5, without the 
additional 8% added on.
Mr S did not respond to Sunnys offer. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks to make sure Mr S 
could afford to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr S was borrowing, and his lending history. But 
there was no set list of checks Sunny had to do.
Loan 1
Im satisfied Sunny did enough checks before it approved Mr Ss first loan. I say that 
because this was Mr Ss first loan with Sunny and the required repayments were a relatively 
small proportion of his declared income. There is nothing in the available information to 
indicate Sunny needed to carry out further checks or that the repayments were unaffordable 
to him.
Loans 2 to 3
Given the long term of these loans and the fact that previous loans were outstanding at the 
time of the applications, I dont think Sunnys checks went far enough when it was assessing 
their affordability. But as I cant see there was anything in the available information to 
indicate the repayments were unaffordable, I cant conclude Sunny was wrong to approve 
these loans.
Loan 4
Mr S had repaid loan 1 by the time Mr S applied for loan 4, and the monthly loan repayment 
had decreased. So, although I dont consider Sunnys checks went far enough, I cant see 
the information it had showed the new loan was unaffordable.
Loan 5
When Mr S applied for loan 5 I think his pattern of borrowing was enough to indicate Mr S 
may be struggling financially. I say that because:
This was his fifth loan with no break in borrowing;
He already had three outstanding Sunny loans;
This loan application was just two days after the previous one;
The loan amount was higher than the previous two loans;
Mr Ss scheduled repayments were the highest theyd been;
 
So, although I consider Sunny should have carried out a full financial review before 
approving this loan, I find it already had enough information, based on Mr Ss borrowing 
record, to have concerns about the sustainability of future loans. So, I find it was irresponsible for Sunny to have approved loan 5.
Loan 6
As there was a break in lending for over a year before Mr S applied for loan 6, Im satisfied it 
was reasonable for Sunny to consider loan 6 as a new lending chain. On that basis, I 
consider Sunnys checks for this loan were proportionate and that there was nothing to 
indicate the loan was unaffordable.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ss complaint in part. Elevate Credit International Limited 
(trading as Sunny) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr S paid on loan 5;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative information about loan 5 from Mr Ss credit file.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 June 2020.
