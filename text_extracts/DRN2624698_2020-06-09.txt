K821x#15Complaint
Mr G complains S.D. Taylor Limited  (trading as LoansAtHome4u) lent to him irresponsibly.
Background
Mr G took 12 home credit  loans between  July 2014 and December 2017. Ive included  some 
of the information weve  received about these loans in the table below.

*It appears loan 7 was set up in error and I understand Mr G didnt make any payments of 
interest towards it. Loan 8 is the actual  agreement started on this date which Mr G made  
payments towards  and repaid on 27 April 2017. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think there  was enough evidence to say LoansAtHome4u  was wrong 
to have granted the first five home  credit  loans. But she thought  the remaining home credit 
loans (loans 6 to 12) shouldnt have been given. 
Mr G appears  to agree with the adjudicators view. LoansAtHome4u hasnt responded. As no 
agreement has been reached,  the case has been  passed to me for a final decision.
 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr G doesnt appear to disagree  with our adjudicators findings that LoansAtHome4u wasnt 
wrong to lend the first five loans. It seems therefore  that this lending  isnt in dispute and so I 
no longer think that I need to make a finding  about  it. Equally, LoansAtHome4U hasnt 
responded, so I dont  know  what it thinks  the adjudicator may have got wrong when she 
reviewed the complaint.   
Ref: DRN26246982So instead,  this decision will focus on whether LoansAtHome4u did anything  wrong  when it 
lent loans 6 to 12. But Ive kept loans  1 - 5 in mind when thinking  about the overall  lending  
relationship between LoansAtHome4u  and Mr G. Whilst Mr G doesnt  appear to have paid 
any interest towards loan 7, information  about  it may still appear on his credit file so Ive 
included it in my findings.  
For the lending  that remains in dispute, LoansAtHome4u had to assess it to check  if Mr G 
could afford  to pay back the amounts  hed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do 
this in a way which was proportionate  to the circumstances.  LoansAtHome4us checks could 
have taken into account a number of different things, such  as how much was being lent, the 
size of the repayments and Mr Gs income and expenditure. With this in mind, I think  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might  have been proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  LoansAtHome4u  should have done more to establish that 
any lending  was sustainable for Mr G. These factors include:
Mr G having a low income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr G having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long 
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr G coming  back for loans shortly  after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr G.
LoansAtHome4u was required  to establish  whether Mr G could sustainably repay his home 
credit loans  not just whether he technically had enough money to make his repayments. 
Having enough  money to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mr G 
was able to repay his loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the 
case. The Financial  Conduct Authoritys (the industry regulatory) says in the Consumer 
Credit Sourcebook  (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if they are made without 
undue difficulties and in particular, made on time,  while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to make them. If a lender realises, or ought 
reasonably to have  realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude  those  repayments  are 
unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Gs complaint.
Having looked  at the overall pattern of LoansAtHome4us lending history with Mr G, I agree  
with our adjudicator  that LoansAtHome4u  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided loan 6. I say this because:
By loan 6 it was 13 months into the lending  relationship with no significant breaks 
between loans. And some  of the loans overlapped. In my view,  Mr Gs loan history  up 
Ref: DRN26246983until this point was a clear  indication that his underlying financial situation didnt seem  
to be improving; 
Mr G took some  loans shortly after having  repaid  previous lending. For example, 
loans 4 and 5 were  taken  out the same day that loan 2 had been repaid. 
So LoansAtHome4u ought to have realised  it was more likely than not Mr G, on this 
occasion, was having to borrow further  to cover  the hole the repayment of the 
previous loan had left in his finances  and that this was indicative of his indebtedness  
not being sustainable;
Mr G seemed to be encountering difficulty in maintaining regular payments. And loan 
1 and loans 3 to 5 were all paid after their repayment dates  loans 4 and 5 being 
repaid around  17 weeks late;
The home credit loans show a broadly similar pattern of borrowing. Mr G had taken 
five loans for £200 each followed by loan 6 for £300. I think its most likely  this 
consistent pattern  of borrowing  over the period showed that Mr G didnt just have a 
short-term cash-flow  problem but was probably  supporting regular living  expenses  or 
other financial commitments;
Mr Gs lending history was prolonged with most  of the subsequent  loans  showing a 
similar level of indebtedness. And when Mr G took loans 11 and 12, the level of 
lending was at its highest and over twice as much as it had been earlier in the 
relationship. The amount  of time that Mr G spent indebted to LoansAtHome4u meant 
that he was servicing a debt to LoansAtHome4u  over an extended period.
I think that Mr G lost out when LoansAtHome4u provided loans 6 to 12 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period and;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Gs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Gs complaint about  loans  6 to 12. And Ive set out what  
LoansAtHome4u should do to put things right as detailed below.
Putting things  right
In order to put things  right LoansAtHome4u  should:
refund  all interest, fees and charges Mr G paid on loans 6 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
for loan 12, LoansAtHome4u should  remove all unpaid interest, fees and charges 
from the current outstanding balance, meaning Mr G only has to repay the principal;  
Ref: DRN26246984LoansAtHome4u must then apply any repayments already made towards this loan as 
if they were made towards the principal sum.  If after doing this, Mr G has already 
paid enough  for this loan, then any overpayment needs to be refunded, from the date 
the over payment became  due to the date of settlement. 8% simple interest per year 
should also be added to any overpayment*;
If after doing this, an outstanding balance  remains  then LoansAtHome4u can use the 
refund from loans 6 to 11 to offset  this outstanding principal sum;
remove loans 6 to 12 from Mr Gs credit file entirely, this is because  the period of 
time Mr G owed LoansAtHome4u money  means  that any information still recorded 
about these  loans  is adverse.  
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LoansAtHome4u to take off tax from this interest. 
LoansAtHome4u must give Mr G a certificate  showing how much  tax it has taken off if he 
asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Gs complaint.  
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things  right for Mr G as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 July 2020.
