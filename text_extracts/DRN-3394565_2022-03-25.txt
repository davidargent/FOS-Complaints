The complaint
Mr C has complained NewDay Ltd, trading as Amazon Classic, didnt refund fraudulent 
transactions and managed his fraud claim poorly.
What happened
In 2020 Mr C was in hospital for a prolonged period and his home was burgled. He noted 
two transactions made with his Amazon credit card for £449 and £584.99 which hed not 
made. He complained to NewDay.
NewDay made chargeback claims. In error NewDay initially credited Mr Cs credit card twice: 
in both September and October 2020. Mr C took the opportunity to transfer nearly £700 to 
his current account and also continued to use his credit card. 
NewDay then corrected Mr Cs credit card account by re-debiting the disputed amounts. 
They also re-debited £584.99 as the chargeback request proved unsuccessful.
Mr C was unhappy with the impact this had on his account as he was now in debt and felt 
this was NewDays fault. Subsequently the retailer (who Ill call A) confirmed all the items 
purchased in September 2020 should be refunded and refunded £89.99 as part of the 
£584.99. This left £495 outstanding.
Mr C had complained to NewDay as his account had been suspended and then brought his 
complaint to our service. NewDay offered Mr C £85 for the inconvenience caused. He didnt 
believe that was sufficient and wanted as a minimum the debt on his credit card to be written 
off.
In discussion with our service, NewDay increased their offer of compensation to £150. They 
also agreed to facilitate the further £495 refund from A and remove adverse data from Mr Cs 
credit record. Our investigator felt this offer was fair and reasonable but Mr C disagreed.
He felt NewDays actions had contributed to the problems hed had with his health, as well 
as his need to move house after the burglary, and wanted them to do more.
Mr Cs complaint has been referred to an ombudsman for decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator. Ill explain why.
I can confirm Mr C has subsequently raised a number of other fraud claims with NewDay. 
These arent the subject of this complaint but we have shared NewDays findings on this 
issue with Mr C. If he disagrees, he can arrange for a further complaint to be set up to review 
those claims.
Ive asked Mr C to provide us with evidence of his stay in hospital and the current state of his 
health. Ive not received this.
I also note A has agreed that refunds should apply to the two transactions Mr C originally 
disputed from September 2020 because they received the original goods back. This doesnt 
suggest to me, as Mr C has claimed, that he was necessarily a victim of fraud.
That said theres no doubt that NewDays actions in applying credits twice to Mr C didnt help 
matters. Its certainly made Mr Cs statements extremely confusing so I appreciate why hes 
unwilling to accept NewDay has now sorted things out. I have reviewed the transactions in 
detail and believe  apart from £495  there are no outstanding issues on Mr Cs account. 
Mr C hasnt been able to show that NewDay hasnt now got things right.
Mr C has questioned the transaction of just under £700. NewDay has been able to show this 
credited Mr Cs current account so I dont agree with his argument that he ended up out of 
pocket. I appreciate hes told us he wouldnt have spent as much if hed known the money in 
his account wasnt his and Ive taken this into account.
Overall I agree NewDay did do something wrong and caused problems to Mr C.
Putting things right
NewDay has offered to pay Mr C £150 in compensation, as well as ensure any adverse 
information on his credit record is removed. Theyve also stated they will ensure the error 
has no impact on the interest and fees he was charged. They will also arrange to get the 
further refund of £495 A has offered to Mr C.
Like our investigator I believe this offer is fair and reasonable. I think the compensation is 
right for what happened here. I did ask Mr C if he could provide us with some evidence of his 
hospital stay and his current health but he didnt provide us with anything I could consider 
further.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is to instruct NewDay Ltd, trading as Amazon 
Classic, to:
Arrange the refund of £495 from A;
Refund any interest and fees applied to the account for the relevant period;
Remove any adverse information added to Mr Cs credit record; and
Pay Mr C £150 for the inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 April 2022.
