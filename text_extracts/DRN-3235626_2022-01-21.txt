The complaint
Mr L is unhappy with a change National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has made to their 
banking services.
 
NatWest is no longer offering customers a non-contactless debit card. And the only way to 
deactivate the contactless function on a contactless debit card is through the banking app. 
Mr L says NatWest has offered no real explanation for why theyve made this decision. Hes 
said NatWest is out-of-step with high-street banking peers and they are behaving in a 
discriminatory manner against customers (like himself) that do not have access to the 
banking app.
 
To resolve things Mr L would like for NatWest to either offer customers a non-contactless 
debit card, or offer customers the ability to deactivate the contactless facility over the phone 
or in a branch. 
What happened
Mr L said on 16 October 2021 he received a letter from NatWest explaining that from 1 
December 2021 the card service provider would change on all their debit cards and any 
debit cards for new customers, or customers who had lost or stolen cards would receive new 
contactless cards. For other customers, they would start to receive the new cards between 
February 2022 and June 2023. 
Mr L called NatWest to discuss the contents of the letter and discovered it would not be easy 
for him to remove the contactless facility from a new debit card. Mr L then raised a complaint 
with NatWest. 
On 21 October 2021 NatWest wrote to Mr L not upholding his complaint. NatWest explained 
to Mr L they are unable to stop the change from happening and that Mr L would be notified 
when his card was due to be replaced. NatWest confirmed Mr L could continue using his 
existing debit card until it expires, is lost or is changed to the new card services provider. 
NatWest also confirmed that the UK contactless limit had increased to £100, which was an 
industry-wide change. But offered Mr L reassurance that contactless cards included 
additional security inbuilt to help manage and limit potential fraud, and would still have the 
same fraud guarantees for contactless customers as for non-contactless customers should 
anything happen. NatWest also let Mr L know it was possible to turn off the contactless 
function using the banking app and included instructions on how to do this.
 
As Mr L remained unhappy he brought his concerns to our service and our investigator 
considered his complaint. 
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Ls complaint. They explained while they understood Mr Ls 
position, NatWest had not acted unfairly in the circumstances and had not treated Mr L 
differently to any other NatWest customer- so they didnt think any discrimination had taken 
place. The investigator did say that Mr L could approach a court on this point. The 
investigator said it was not possible for this service to dictate what NatWests processes or 
commercial decisions should be  that was for the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) to consider. And they also confirmed that having made their own enquiries with 
NatWest, there was no other way for Mr L to remove the contactless function without using 
the app. 
Mr L didnt accept the investigators findings. They said NatWest had not offered sufficient 
explanation for the decision to only offer contactless cards and only offer one way of 
removing the contactless function. Mr L noted the banking app offered the option to turn this 
function on and off, and that offering other channels to customers to do the same thing could 
be costly; however, Mr L felt a one-off option to irrevocably turn off the contactless function 
(even for a proportionate fee) seemed reasonable. Mr L also felt that while NatWest may not 
have the back-office ability to turn the function off, the front-end app must communicate to 
the back-office in some way. 
While recognising that not having access to a banking app is in itself not a protected 
characteristic under the Equality Act 2010, Mr L felt that simply concluding he was being 
treated the same as other customers didnt mean that discrimination had not taken place  
those without access to smart phones or tablets were being disadvantaged. And his 
conclusions were that NatWest is being discriminatory towards those customers. 
Mr L also felt NatWest were being unhelpful by not providing their customers with more 
options. And he noted this was not in keeping with several peers on the high-street who 
continue to offer their customers the option of non-contactless debit cards or easier ways to 
manage how their debit cards work. 
As our investigator and Mr L were unable to reach an agreement, the complaint has come to 
me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, and for broadly the same reasons as the investigator Ive decided not to 
uphold Mr Ls complaint. 
I can see Mr L has some understanding that having no access to a smart phone or tablet is 
not one of the listed protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010. And it may help 
Mr L if I further explain that as an informal dispute resolution service, the Financial 
Ombudsman Service does not have the power to decide if a law has been breached  that is 
for the courts to decide. So while as part of my considerations I must take into account the 
relevant law, the role of this service is to consider what is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of the individual complaint.
 
This means that Im left to consider whether NatWest has treated Mr L fairly in their dealings 
with him in this matter. And based on the submissions available to me, Im unable to say 
NatWest has done anything wrong here. 
I note Mr Ls concerns largely relate to the commercial decisions taken by NatWest about 
the banking services they provide to their customers. While I can review how Mr L has been 
treated by NatWest as an individual, I do not have the power to tell NatWest what they 
should do in terms of the services they provide or how they should provide those services. I 
can see from the submissions that Mr L has already approached the FCA about his wider 
concerns. Im aware the changes NatWest are bringing in are not to Mr Ls liking and Ive noted Mr Ls 
suggestions above to illustrate his preparedness to engage with NatWest and offer solutions 
to his concerns. However, Im in agreement with our investigator that there is little we can do 
here. As Ive explained, it is for NatWest to decide the services they offer their customers 
and commercial decision making is not something I can interfere with. NatWest has told our 
service the only way their services are able to disable the contactless function on a 
contactless card is by processing this through the app using either a smartphone or a tablet 
 neither of which Mr L has. 
NatWest has offered Mr L reassurance around the security of the card  as I realise Mr L is 
more concerned since the contactless limit has been increased to £100. I note Mr L accepts 
this is an industry-wide change, but he feels other high-street banks are offering their 
customers more flexibility in terms of managing such a change. 
I acknowledge Mr L is unhappy with the changes to NatWests services. But at this time it 
appears NatWest does not have the capability to offer any other option to turn off the 
contactless function other than through the app. 
 
I realise it seems strange that given NatWest are an established bank they are unable to 
accommodate Mr Ls suggestions; however, our service is not able to tell NatWest to change 
their systems and controls. Im also mindful that NatWest have offered Mr L reassurances 
that a contactless debit card will have the same level of protection from NatWest as a non-
contactless debit card and they have given Mr L reasonable notice of their intended changes 
for him to consider his options. 
Mr L has noted in his submissions to us that different high-street banks are providing 
different services  as is their choice. So at this time it seems to me the choice is with Mr L 
to decide whether the services NatWest are providing are still meeting his needs as a 
customer. I would only add that should Mr L choose to arrange access to NatWests banking 
app that NatWest would treat him fairly in supporting him with how to use it if needed.
My final decision
I recognise that this is not the outcome Mr L will have hoped for, but for the reasons above 
my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or reject my decision before 
18 February 2022.
