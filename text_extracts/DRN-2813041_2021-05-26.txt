The complaint
Mr D is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, approved him for a credit account which 
he feels was unaffordable for him at that time. Mr D is also unhappy that NewDay Ltd, 
trading as Aqua, subsequently increased the credit limit on the account, which he also 
considers was unaffordable for him at that time.  
What happened
In September 2017, Mr D applied for a credit account with NewDay. Mr Ds application was 
approved, and NewDay issued Mr D with a credit account with an initial credit limit of £300.
In March 2018, NewDay increased the credit limit on Mr Ds account to £1,200. NewDay also 
increased the credit limit on Mr Ds account a further three times, ending with Mr Ds credit 
limit being increased to £3,700 in April 2019.
In July 2020, Mr D raised a complaint with NewDay on the basis that the initial credit 
application, as well as the subsequent credit limit increases, had been unaffordable for him 
at those times.
NewDay looked at Mr Ds complaint. They explained that they had conducted checks into Mr 
Ds financial position at the time of the account application and the later credit limit 
increases, and there had been nothing resulting from those checks that related to the initial 
application or the first two credit limit increases that gave them cause to consider that the 
credit being offered wasnt affordable for Mr D at those times.
However, NewDay did acknowledge that their review into Mr Ds complaint had led them 
conclude that it might have been the case that the last two credit limit increases  from 
December 2018 onwards - may not have suitable or affordable for Mr D. So, NewDay 
partially upheld Mr Ds complaint and reimbursed him proportionate interest from this date, 
as well as interest and fees, totalling approximately £1,280.
Mr D didnt feel that NewDays response went far enough, so he referred his complaint to 
this service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that the information 
available to NewDay at the application shouldnt have given NewDay cause to suspect that 
the initial credit limit was unaffordable for Mr D, but they did feel that the information 
available to NewDay at the time of all subsequent credit limit increases should have given 
NewDay cause to suspect that those credit limit increases would be unaffordable for Mr D. 
So, they recommended that the complaint be upheld in Mr Ds favour on that basis.
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a business to decide who it will offer credit to, and if so, on what terms. What this 
service would expect would be that the business conducts reasonable and proportionate 
borrower focussed checks at the time of the account application, as well as at the time of 
any later credit limit increases, to ensure that the credit being offered is affordable for that 
customer at those times.
NewDay say that theyve done that here. They took details of Mr Ds income and 
expenditure at the time of the account application to ensure that Mr D had sufficient 
disposable income to be able to afford the credit account, and they also reviewed Mr Ds 
credit file to gain a better understanding of his wider financial position. And NewDay contend 
that there was nothing resulting from these checks to suggest that a credit account with an 
initial credit limit of £300 would have been unaffordable for Mr D at that time.
Having reviewed the information available to NewDay at the time of the credit account 
application, its difficult to consider NewDays conclusion unreasonable here. Mr Ds credit 
file did demonstrate that he had a significant amount of existing borrowing, with outstanding 
debt of approximately £19,000. But the credit limit being offered in this instance was only 
£300, and when considered alongside Mr Ds stated income of approximately £20,000, Im 
satisfied that the approval of the credit account with a credit limit of £300 shouldnt have 
been considered unaffordable for Mr D at that time.
However, in the period between Mr D being first approved for the credit account in 
September 2017 and the time of the first credit limit increase  from £300 to £1,200  in 
March 2018, Mr Ds credit file appears to demonstrate a deterioration in his financial 
position.
I say this because in the six month period between the account being opened and the credit 
limit being increased, Mr D took out five new credit accounts, comprising four payday loans 
and another credit card, such that his total existing debt at the time of the first credit limit 
increase in March 2018 had risen to approximately £23,000  an increase of over 20%. This 
appears to suggest that Mr D had a significant need for credit at that time, which in turn can 
be a strong indicator of financial difficulty. And NewDay dont appear to have taken this into 
consideration.
In addition, NewDay increased Mr Ds credit limit by 300% - from £300 to £1,200. And its 
difficult to rationalise that such a significant increase in Mr Ds credit limit would have been 
approved in light of the deteriorating state of Mr Ds financial position without first conducting 
further checks into Mr Ds financial position at that time, as I feel would have been both 
reasonable and proportionate.
NewDay have explained that they did conduct a review of Mr Ds financial position before 
approving the first credit limit increase. This included a review of Mr Ds usage and 
management of the account up to that time which demonstrated that Mr D was using the 
account responsibly and for normal usage, including retail and social spend, and so didnt 
highlight any areas for concern.
NewDay have also stated that they also conducted an assessment of Mr Ds credit file 
before increasing the credit limit in March 2018, and that this didnt flag Mr Ds credit file as 
being of any concern.
Ultimately, NewDays position here is that the checks that they undertook demonstrated that 
Mr D had been managing his NewDay credit account and his external existing credit 
responsibly and without incident, such that there was nothing to suggest that Mr D should be 
suspected as being in financial difficulty at that time.
I can understand NewDays position here  to a degree  and NewDay have explained to this service that they dont undertake risk reviews based on opinion, but rather use a series 
of algorithms. Unfortunately, its difficult not to conclude that in this particular instance an 
unfair outcome has been arrived at potentially because of this, because while it may have 
been the case that the deteriorating position of Mr Ds financial position  as detailed 
previously above - may not have been visible within the parameters of the algorithms that 
NewDay use, it doesnt follow from this that Mr D wasnt potentially in financial difficulty at 
that time.
The sharp increase in Mr Ds total amount of external debt, especially when considered as a 
percentage of his declared annual income, as well as the number of new credit accounts that 
Mr D was applying for, does, in my opinion, provide a reasonable cause to suspect that Mr D 
may have been in financial difficulty at that time, such that additional, more proportionate 
borrower focussed checks into Mr Ds financial circumstances were warranted before the 
implementation of any proposed credit limit increase - especially one where the increase 
being considered was many multiples of the existing credit limit at that time. 
Of course, it may have been the case that these additional checks wouldnt have unearthed 
any additional information that might have ultimately led to NewDay deciding not to increase 
Mr Ds credit limit. But Im not convinced that this is the case in this instance, and I say this 
because Mr Ds bank account statements show a high number of gambling transactions 
such that its reasonable to suspect that Mr D may have potentially had a gambling addiction 
at that time.
NewDay have also stated that Mr D was not obliged to accept the credit limit increases and 
could have declined them if they were unaffordable for him. But Im not convinced by this 
argument, and Id suggest that its more incumbent on NewDay to ensure that theyre not 
offering credit to individuals in financial difficulty rather than expecting those individuals to 
decline further credit during times when they are financially vulnerable.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that NewDay were wanting here, but it follows from 
what Ive explained above that Ill be upholding this complaint in Mr Ds favour on the basis 
that feel that the information available to NewDay at the time of the credit limit increases was 
sufficient to provide reasonable cause for concern that the credit limit increase might not 
have been affordable for Mr D at those times. 
Additionally, I also feel that its more likely than not that had NewDay undertaken further 
checks into Mr Ds financial position at that time, as I believe was warranted by the 
information available to NewDay at those times, that its probable, on balance, that NewDay 
should have concluded from that additional information that Mr D couldnt afford the credit 
limit increases being considered.
I hope that NewDay can understand, given what I have explained above, why I have made 
the final decision that I have. 
Putting things right
NewDay must refund all interest, fees, and charges to Mr Ds account from the point of the 
first credit limit increase for the balance over £300.
If this results in a credit balance in Mr Ds favour, NewDay must pay this balance to Mr D 
along with 8% simple interest calculated from the date of the interest, fee, or charge being 
refunded to the date of the payment to Mr D.
NewDay must also remove all adverse information relating to this credit account from March 
2018 onwards from Mr Ds credit file.   My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 June 2021.
