The complaint
Mr A, initially through a representative, complains that Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) have 
failed to refund money that Mr A lost as part of an investment scam. 
What happened
The circumstances of the matter are well known to both parties so I will not go into too much 
detail as to what happened. 
But in summary; Mr As representative explained that Mr A was introduced by a good friend 
to a Bitcoin trading company that I will call B. This friend showed Mr A that he had made 
substantial profits from B and had shown him that he had also made large withdrawals from 
his profits. 
From what I can see he made the following card payments and transfers to Binance that 
were used to buy cryptocurrencies and were then forwarded onto B.
The payments made were as follows;

Mr A tried to withdraw his funds from B but kept on being told to pay a number of additional 
fees before he could withdraw. Mr A eventually realised that he had been scammed.
Mr A via a representative raised a complaint with Lloyds as he believed that Lloyds should 
have stopped him from making the payments in question.
One of our investigators looked into this matter and they decided that the transactions were 
not sufficiently out of character to warrant an intervention by Lloyds and that there was no 
other means for Lloyds recover the funds.
Mr A, now no longer represented, did not agree with this and therefore his complaint was 
passed to me to issue a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
It isnt in dispute that Mr A authorised the disputed payments he made to Binance (where his 
funds were subsequently transferred on to the scammers from his crypto wallet). The 
payments were requested by him using his legitimate security credentials provided by 
Lloyds, and the starting position is that banks ought to follow the instructions given by their 
customers in order for legitimate payments to be made as instructed.
However, Ive considered whether Lloyds should have done more to prevent Mr A from 
falling victim to the scam, as there are some situations in which a bank should reasonably 
have had a closer look at the circumstances surrounding a particular transaction. For 
example, if it was particularly out of character. However, having looked at Mr As account 
activity and the limited payment history into account, I do not think the payments he is 
disputing should have been regarded as particularly unusual.
The payments were not of such a large amount that they would represent a significant 
deviation from what would be considered as usual activity. I accept that the payment of 
£6,000 does represent a larger payment than Mr A usually made but not sufficiently so, in 
my opinion, to have necessitated an intervention from Lloyds. 
Especially as Mr A had made transactions to Crypto exchanges prior to these payments so 
him transferring funds to a Crypto exchange would not be that out of the ordinary for him.
So, having considered the payments Mr A made, Im not persuaded there was anything that 
ought reasonably to have triggered Lloydss fraud monitoring systems (apart from the first 
payment being checked that it was genuine), or that would have indicated he was in the 
process of being scammed. I therefore do not consider there to have been any obligation on 
Lloyds to have intervened any further.I should also add for the sake of completeness that even if Lloyds intervened, and to be 
clear I dont think it needed to, I dont think that an intervention would have altered Mr As 
decision to carry on with the transactions in question. To explain Mr A said in his initial 
submissions via his representative that he was recommended the investment by a friend and 
the friend said and demonstrated that he had made and withdrawn profits. There were also 
no credible warnings available online about B either. So had a warning been given by Lloyds 
I dont think it would alter Mr As decision to continue with the transactions in question.
Ive also thought about whether Lloyds did enough to attempt to recover the money Mr A 
lost.
In this instance the debit card payments could potentially have been recovered by a 
chargeback. But in this case, a chargeback would not have been successful, as the 
transactions Mr A used his debit card for was to pay Binance for the purchase of 
cryptocurrency, which he duly received. It was only when the cryptocurrency was transferred 
from his crypto wallet to the scammer did the loss then occur. So, he could not claim that he 
did not receive the goods or services paid for from his Lloyds account, which was the 
purchase of the cryptocurrency. As a result, I dont think Lloyds have acted unreasonably by 
failing to pursue a chargeback claim here.
In relation to the transfers as the funds had already been moved from Mr As crypto wallet 
the only remaining option for Mr A to recover the funds in question is via the Contingency 
Reimbursement Model (CRM). But the CRM does not apply to transfers made to an account 
in the customers own name and in this instance Mr A was transferring funds to an account 
with Binance that was in his own name.
I appreciate this will come as a disappointment to Mr A, and Im sorry to hear he has been 
the victim of a cruel scam. However, Im not persuaded that Lloyds can fairly or reasonably 
be held liable for his loss in these circumstances. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 November 2023.
