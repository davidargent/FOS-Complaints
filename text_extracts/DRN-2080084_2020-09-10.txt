Our adjudicator upheld partially upheld Mr Hs complaint and thought loans three and five 
shouldnt have been given as Lending Streams records showed the repayments were 
unaffordable for Mr H. He also thought loans six to 11 shouldnt have been given because 
the lending was unsustainable for him.
Lending Stream didnt respond to the adjudicator. As the complaint remains unresolved, it 
has been passed to me for a decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure     
Mr H could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr H didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one, two and four shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr H had with Lending Stream. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took  loans three, five and six to 11. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why.
Lending Stream has told this service about the checks it carried out before approving any of 
the borrowing. Its given us copies of the loans applications and I can see it asked Mr S 
about his employment status  he confirmed he was employed and for all of the lending     
Mr S had a declared monthly income of £2,500. Lending Stream also asked about his 
monthly living costs and Mr S declared these to be £1,200 for loans three and five per 
month. 
Lending Stream also used national average expense categories for a third-party verification 
and an independent credit reference agency to check for Mr Ss credit expenses. As a result 
of these checks, Lending Stream upwardly revised Mr Ss monthly expenses figures. For loan three, Lending Streams records show it left him with a monthly disposable income of 
£228 and for loan five the figure is £311.
When Mr H took loan three, loans one and two were still running and the combined monthly 
repayment for the three loans was £257.43. So, the repayment would have left him in a 
negative position each month when compared to his disposable income.  
For loan five, loans three and four were still running and the combined monthly repayment 
was £509.80. So again, Mr S would have been left in a negative position according to 
Lending Streams own figures. Clearly neither of these loans were affordable for Mr S and 
ending Stream shouldnt have agreed to them.  
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Lending Streams lending history with Mr H, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Lending Stream should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
six. I say this because:
At this point Lending Stream ought to have realised Mr H was not managing to repay 
his loans sustainably. Mr H had taken out six loans within 11 months. So Lending 
Stream ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr H was having to borrow 
further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Hs first loan was for £165 and loan six was for £200  and he had borrowed 
higher amounts in between those two loans.  At this point Lending Stream ought to 
have known that Mr H was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Lending Stream. Loan 
11 was taken out 18 months after Mr Hs first. Mr H had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Lending Stream over an extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out because Lending Stream continued to provide borrowing from loan 
six onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans which Mr H borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans three and five and 
loans six to 11 and Lending Stream should put things right.
Putting things right
If the outstanding balance due on Mr Hs loans has been transferred to a third-party Lending 
Stream should buy the loans back if it can. If Lending Stream cant buy the loans back, then 
it needs to work with the third party to make sure the following is achieved: A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr H towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr H which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr H originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr H as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. 
If this results in Mr H having made overpayments then Lending Stream should refund 
these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from 
the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 
Lending Stream should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move 
to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus, then the surplus should be paid to Mr H. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Lending Stream should try to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with Mr H. 
E) Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Hs credit file in relation to loans 
three and five. 
The number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans six to 11 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file. Lending Stream does not have to remove any outstanding loans 
from Mr Hs credit file until these have been repaid, but any adverse information 
recorded about these loans should still be removed.
                                                                                                                                 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. 
Lending Stream must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
If after doing the above Mr H still has an outstanding balance due, then Lending Stream 
should try and work together to come to a mutually agreeable repayment plan with Mr H in 
order to repay what is owed. But Id remind Lending Stream of its obligation to treat Mr H 
fairly. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Hs complaint. Gain Credit LLC 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 October 2020.
