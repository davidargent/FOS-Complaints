The complaint
Mr and Mrs T complain that National Westminster Bank Plc made errors which meant they 
were unable to port their mortgage. They had to apply to a different lender and paid an early 
repayment charge (ERC) to NatWest. Theyd like the ERC refunded.
What happened
In mid-2019 Mr and Mrs T contacted NatWest about porting their mortgage. They also 
wanted additional borrowing for home improvements. Mr and Mrs T didnt have evidence of 
their income which met NatWests criteria. The mortgage adviser said hed check whether 
NatWest could make an exception for this and get back to them. Mr and Mrs T say despite 
chasing, they didnt get a decision from NatWest. Mr and Mrs T contacted a broker who 
found a mortgage for them with a different lender.
In late 2019 Mr and Mrs T contacted NatWest again. At this point they were told theyd have 
to pass affordability tests to port the mortgage. They thought this would be a problem as 
theyd taken the summer off work to travel and couldnt provide three months wage slips for 
that period. They took out a mortgage with another lender.
NatWest said it didnt call Mr and Mrs T back as it had said it would. It paid £300 
compensation. Mr and Mrs T say if NatWest had responded to them in mid-2019 theyd have 
been able to port the mortgage and avoid paying the ERC. They say NatWest should refund 
the ERC.
Our investigator said it was reasonable for NatWest to ask Mr and Mrs T to go through an 
affordability assessment. Mr and Mrs T were given the opportunity to make a porting 
application and chose not to do so. The investigator said it wasnt fair and reasonable to 
require NatWest to refund the ERC.
Mr and Mrs T didnt agree. They said theyd have passed affordability tests in mid-2019, and 
told NatWest theyd be happy to go ahead without additional borrowing if it caused a 
problem. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs T took out a fixed interest rate product in early 2019. This included an ERC 
which applied until December 2020. The ERC was set out in the mortgage offer and Mr and 
Mrs T agreed to it when they took out the product. 
Mr and Mrs Ts interest rate product was portable  it could be transferred to a mortgage on 
another property. If the product was ported the ERC would be waived. The product offer 
says porting is subject to NatWests lending criteria. Mr and Mrs T also wanted to increase 
their borrowing, and rules on mortgage regulation say NatWest would have to assess this is 
affordable.
Mr and Mrs Ts mortgage was repaid in early 2020. I think NatWest was entitled, under the 
mortgage terms, to apply the ERC. 
Mr and Mrs T say theyd have passed affordability criteria in mid-2019 if NatWest hadnt 
caused delays. They say they didnt make a porting application in late 2019 after being told 
NatWest would complete an affordability assessment. They thought this would be a problem 
as they didnt have three months wage slips. They continued with their application with 
another lender. Because of this they say NatWest should refund the ERC. 
While there might be circumstances in which Id find it reasonable to require a lender to 
waive or refund an ERC, thats not the case here. Ive explained why below.
What happened?
Mr and Mrs T contacted NatWest in mid-July 2019 about porting their mortgage. They also 
asked about taking out additional borrowing. Mr and Mrs T didnt have evidence of their 
income that met NatWests criteria. They say the mortgage adviser said he would check this 
and get back to them within 3 to 5 days. NatWest cant provide a call recording or notes of 
this discussion. 
Its unfortunate there isnt a record of Mr and Mrs Ts discussions with NatWest in July 2019. 
As there arent any records, it seems unlikely they made a porting application at this point. 
NatWest accepts it failed to get back in contact with Mr and Mrs T, as it said it would.
As they hadnt heard from NatWest, Mr T called again in early August 2019 to see what had 
happened. NatWest said it would ask the mortgage adviser or his colleague to contact Mr T. 
Mr T said theyd accepted an offer for their property, and had a mortgage offer from another 
lender. He said hed been told by NatWest previously it would waive the ERC if it couldnt 
port the mortgage. 
NatWests notes say it tried to call Mr T back, but he wasnt satisfied the call was from 
NatWest and didnt want to go through security. When Mr T called NatWest the next day he 
failed security. NatWest said hed need to call back. 
Mr T got back in contact with NatWest in October 2019. NatWest explained the porting 
process. It says Mr T then hung up. Mr T says he didnt hang up. Either way, Mr and Mrs T 
didnt make a porting application. They repaid their mortgage in early 2020 and paid an 
ERC.
Is it fair to require NatWest to refund the ERC?
NatWest didnt respond to Mr and Mrs T in mid-2019 when it said it would. But Mr and Mrs T 
could have called NatWest and asked to meet with a mortgage adviser if theyd wanted to 
continue with a porting application. 
Mr and Mrs T were aware of the ERC in October 2019, when they decided to continue with 
their application to another lender and repay their mortgage with NatWest. This was about 
three months before their sale completed, so they had time to make a porting application.
I cant be certain that NatWest would have agreed to Mr and Mrs Ts porting application if 
theyd made it in mid-2019. Or that NatWest would have made a different decision if theyd 
applied in late 2019. Mr and Mrs T didnt make a porting application to NatWest. So NatWest 
didnt have an opportunity to consider it and decide whether to port their mortgage and offer 
additional lending.I dont think its fair and reasonable in the circumstances to require NatWest to refund the 
ERC. 
NatWest paid £300 compensation for the upset caused by it not contacting Mr and Mrs T 
when it had said it would. In the circumstances, I think this is fair and reasonable.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T and Mrs T to 
accept or reject my decision before 19 April 2021.
