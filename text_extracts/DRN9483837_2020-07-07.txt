*Provident wrote off the balances on loans 6 and 7.
In our adjudicators findings, she thought Provident were wrong to approve  all of Mr Cs 
loans. This is because the repayments  were equal to such a significant  portion of his 
monthly income that the lending was unlikely to be sustainable. Our adjudicator also thought  
that by loan 5, Mr Cs pattern of borrowing alone  suggested  the loans were not likely to be 
sustainable.
Mr C appeared to have  accepted our adjudicators findings.
Provident accepted the findings and offered to refund all the interest Mr C paid towards his 
loans, along with 8% simple interest and to amend his credit file. The adjudicator  thought this 
was fair and so Provident didnt need to do any more than what it had offered. 
Mr C rejected Providents offer as he feels Provident owes  him extra  compensation for the 
impact on him of the poor way it handled his loans and the difficulties he experienced as a 
result of this. As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed  to me for a 
final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
To begin with, Provident has already accepted  that something may have gone  wrong  when it 
approved Mr Cs loans.  And it appears that Mr C accepted our adjudicators opinion about  
this. 
Ref: DRN94838372Provident agreed to the settlement in-line  with what our adjudicator  recommended. Provident 
had waived some  interest on loan 6 back in February 2018. And for loan 7, on the same 
date, it waived all the interest along  with a significant  portion of the principle Mr C had 
borrowed but hadnt yet repaid. This goes above and beyond what  I would normally direct to 
put things right in a case such  as this. 
The remaining  dispute  is about the total amount of redress  to be paid to Mr C. He feels that 
Provident should pay him additional compensation for the trouble and upset the granting 
these loans caused him. So, this decision will focus  on whether Provident  needs to do any 
more to put things  right for Mr C.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
I will begin by saying  that Mr C says that he doesnt  think the offer is fair because of the 
health issues that he suffered as a result  of taking out these loans, which  includes having  
sleepless nights and going without food.  He  also said that hed repaid more to Provident 
then the refund provided.  Firstly, Im sorry to hear about the health  problems Mr C has told 
us hes experienced,  as well as the wider implications these loans  had on his situation.  
I dont doubt that his situation was very stressful and that Mr C was experience the health 
and wellbeing  problems  hes talked  about. The real question is the extent to which this upset 
was directly caused by Providents lending decision.  
I cant ignore that Mr C appears to have been  having wider financial problems because  we 
know that he is subject  to an Individual Voluntary Arrangement  (IVA). So its difficult to say 
that the sole, or even main cause of his problems was a direct result of the actions of 
Provident  although I do accept that Mr C knowing he had an outstanding balance  couldve 
contributed to the health and wellbeing problems  hes described. But, it seems  that Provident 
offer, overall, to resolve this complaint  is fair and reasonable. 
As Ive set out above, Provident has already  agreed to refund all Mr Cs direct  financial 
losses and has written  off a large  amount  of the principal he borrowed.  As there  is no 
evidence to persuade me that Providents  mistakes were the sole or main cause of Mr Cs 
overall no doubt distressing situation, it would  not be fair for me to award extra  redress  in 
compensation for trouble  and upset. .
I think Providents offer is fair and reasonable in these  circumstances, so I dont think 
Provident needs to do anything more  than it has already offered. So, I am not making a 
further award to Mr C. 
I also note that Mr C has told us that Provident has amended his credit file, and his credit 
score has increased  although not as much  as he was expecting. However,  as long as 
Provident has updated the credit  file in line with what it agreed,  then Id make  not further  
finding against Provident in relation  to this.  
Mr C is currently  subject to the terms of an IVA, and his Insolvency Practitioner has told us 
that it has an interest in any redress due. So Ill leave it up to Mr C to make sure that he 
complies with his obligations  under the terms of the IVA. 
Ref: DRN94838373My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I think the offer Provident Personal Credit  Limited  has made to 
settle the complaint is fair and reasonable and I make no further award. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 August 2020.
