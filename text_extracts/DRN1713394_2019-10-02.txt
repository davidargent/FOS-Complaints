K821x#15complaint
Mrs R says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about 31 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mrs R between  August 2015 
and November 2016. There is a summary of Mrs Rs lending  history from Sunny in the 
appendix.
 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mrs Rs complaint in part and thought  the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny didnt agree, saying it thought only the loans from loan 11 
onwards when Mrs Rs total monthly outgoings exceeded £2,000  should  be upheld. Mrs R 
didnt accept that so the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs R could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
Ref: DRN17133942the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Rs complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
Sunny needed  to do more when it approved loans 1 to 3. So I dont think Sunny was wrong 
to give loans 1 to 3 to Mrs R.
However I dont think Sunny carried out proportionate checks  for loans 4 and 5. Had it done  
so, I think Sunny would  most likely have made  different lending decisions.  I say this because  
by loan 4 there were  clear signs that Mrs R was struggling to manage her money, and this 
hadnt changed when she applied for loan 5 a few weeks later.  When Mrs R applied  for loan 
4 she had two outstanding loans  with Sunny and in just the five days prior to her application 
she had taken out short-term high cost credit from three other  lenders. So it was most  likely 
she was just borrowing  to pay off other loans. And there were frequent  gambling  
transactions on her bank  statements, further indicating it was likely Mrs R had wider  financial 
problems. 
In response to our view,  Sunny  said its not its role to dictate how a customer spends their 
money. But the adjudicators reference to gambling  transactions was not an inference that 
Sunny should  dictate  a customers expenditure, rather that such spending behaviour  can be 
an indicator of financial difficulties. I think it was in this case.  Mrs R bet over £850 in October  
2015 and this should have raised  concerns about  her ability to meet her loan repayments 
ongoing. Sunny also said says it doesnt  use bank statements in its checks   and I agree it is 
under no obligation to do so, but I think they are one way Sunny could have better 
understood Mrs Rs situation before deciding to lend.  
It follows I dont think Sunny should have given loans 4 and 5 to Mrs R.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history  with Mrs R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Rs case, I think  that this point was reached at 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs R was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Mrs R had taken  out six loans within  11 weeks. So Sunny  ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mrs R was having  to borrow  further to cover 
the hole repaying  her previous loan(s) was leaving in her finances and that Mrs Rs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
From  loan 6 onwards  Mrs R was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one. 
Ref: DRN17133943Mrs R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed Sunny. She had taken 
out 30 loans in the 14 months after her first loan. Sunny ought to have known that 
Mrs R was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income but to 
meet an ongoing  need. Mrs R had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service 
a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
The loans were  instalment loans, each  with 24 week terms. But Mrs R frequently  
repaid her loan in the same month that shed taken it out. This isnt how instalment 
loans should usually work.  I think  this pattern of lending should have alerted Sunny to 
the likelihood that Mrs R was having problems managing her money. I think  that 
Sunny shouldve been concerned that Mrs R might be borrowing elsewhere to repay 
its loans, again increasing her indebtedness unsustainably.
I think that Mrs R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Rs indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mrs Rs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
I have carefully considered Sunnys  response  to our adjudicators view. In summary, it 
explained the checks it had carried out on eligibility,  affordability and credit worthiness. It 
said it only ever gave  Mrs R a small amount  of credit relative to her income. It also 
highlighted that Mrs R repaid a number  of her loans  early,  arguing that this shows good  
loans management.  But these points dont change my conclusion.  
Sunny was required to do more  than check Mrs R could afford  each individual loan on a 
strict pounds and pence basis. It had to ensure Mrs Rs borrowing was sustainably  
affordable, and from loan 6 onwards  the pattern of Mrs Rs borrowing did not suggest this 
was the case.  Rather, it seems it was unfairly extending her use of high cost short term 
credit.
And with regards to the point about Mrs Rs repayment behaviour - it might,  in different  
circumstances, be reasonable to conclude that the early repayment of a loan indicates an 
improvement in financial circumstances. But I disagree that was the case here,  as shown  by 
Mrs Rs frequent and ongoing use of expensive credit. I think Sunny would have needed a 
lot more information on her financial situation to fairly conclude she was undertaking good 
loans management.  I think a more reasonable conclusion would have been that she was 
most likely making early repayments  by borrowing elsewhere, thereby increasing  her 
indebtedness unsustainably.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 onwards, and Sunny should put things right.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs R paid on loans 4 to 31;
Ref: DRN17133944pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Mrs Rs credit file
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse, so all entries about  loans 6 to 31 should  be removed from 
Mrs Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mrs R a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should pay Mrs R compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 November 2019.
