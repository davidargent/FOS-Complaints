K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that he didnt receive the payment that was agreed when he part-exchanged 
his car with Lynne  Maria  Fryer, trading as the Car Centre, and entered into a finance  
agreement with a finance company. 
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr M part-exchanged  his car with the Car Centre  in April 2016 and he signed  its 
terms and conditions,  pictures showing the condition of the car that was being 
supplied to him and an invoice;
the invoice  says: I have sold the  car to the Car Centre for the sum of £1.00, Mr M 
had signed next to that statement, and the invoice  showed  that the deposit  that hed 
paid for the car that was being  supplied to him was £1;
the invoice  shows that the cost of that car was £,6,001 and that Mr M was paying the 
balance of £6,000 under a credit  agreement with a finance  provider;
Mr M says that the car failed in early 2019  and, when he looked at the invoice, he 
realised that hed only been  paid £1 for the car that he part-exchanged rather than 
the £1,000 that hed expected so he complained to this service and says that the 
Car Centre should pay him £1,000;
Mr M didnt complain  about this until nearly three  years after the car was supplied to 
him and I consider  that it would be reasonable to expect that, if he was expecting  a 
payment of £1,000 for his car, hed have noticed that he hadnt received it soon after 
it was due;
the documents that he signed  clearly show that the price for the car that he part-
exchanged was £1, the price of the car that was being supplied to him was £6,001 
and that he was financing £6,000  and by signing the invoice I consider that he was 
accepting what it said;
theres no documentary evidence from that time to show  that the price  for the car that 
was being supplied to Mr M was more than £6,001, that the price that was agreed for 
the part-exchanged car was £1,000 or that the Car Centre had agreed to pay £1,000  
to Mr M; and
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that the Car Centre  has 
acted incorrectly in connection with the price that it paid Mr M for the car that he part-
exchanged and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require it to pay 
to Mr M the £1,000  that hes claimed or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
