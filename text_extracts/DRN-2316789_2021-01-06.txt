The complaint
Mr and Mrs H complain that National Westminster Bank Plc is defaulting a loan made to
them both, although Mrs H has offered to take on the repayments in line with the original 
agreement, and NatWest initially agreed to this.
What happened
Mr and Mrs H have a loan with NatWest. Mr H has been struggling financially, and he
entered into an Individual Voluntary Agreement (IVA). Mrs H told us that the loan that he
held jointly with her wasnt included in the IVA, although she later told us he is making
payments to this loan from the IVA.
Arrears had built up on the loan, and Mrs H says she has repeatedly agreed repayment
plans with NatWest. Shes paid enough to bring the loan up to date. But NatWest says she
must now either pay the loan in full, or it will default.
Mrs H says shes able to continue to pay the loan, and needs to avoid a default, otherwise
shell be barred from certain jobs and unable to rent properties in the future. Mrs H said she
wanted the default removed from her credit file, and to continue to pay the monthly
payments towards the loan.
NatWest said that the loan contained terms which provided for its termination if a party
becomes insolvent or otherwise enters into an arrangement for the benefit of creditors. It
said that it was sorry Mrs H had been given incorrect advice, but it said that the loan
wouldve defaulted in any event. It said only full repayment of the balance or a new loan in
the name of Mrs H alone wouldve avoided a default. NatWest thought that Mr Hs
insolvency practitioner shouldve told him about this, although it also said that its previous
practice has been to allow the other party to continue to pay the loan. It hasnt explained how
the insolvency practitioner wouldve known that internal policy had changed.
NatWest said it was sorry it had given Mrs H incorrect advice, but it had already paid £150 in
compensation for this. It wouldnt take the default off Mrs Hs credit file.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld in part. He didnt think NatWest had
to take the default marker off Mrs Hs credit file, because she wasnt able to repay the loan in
full. He did think NatWest should pay more compensation for the impact its incorrect advice
had had on her. He said it should pay £200 more.
NatWest agreed, but Mrs H didnt. She said she was able to keep up the monthly
repayments. And she didnt think it was fair to default the loan if she was offering to pay. She
wanted us to listen to the calls shed had with NatWest. NatWest wasnt able to provide
those recordings, but Mrs H had sent letters confirming that shed been told a payment plan
was set up. She also said shed repeatedly been assured that no default would be placed on
her file.
Our investigator changed his mind. He said that NatWest hadnt given Mrs H an opportunity
to clear the debt before the default marker was put on her file, because she was told she
could set up a repayment plan. Our investigator thought that Mrs H should be given this
opportunity now, and if she could clear the debt within a reasonable period, the default
should be removed from her file.
Mrs H didnt think that was fair. She said she was able to repay part, but not all of the loan at
once, and she noted that Mr H was paying some of it back through his IVA. Mrs H didnt
understand why NatWest couldnt come to an agreement with her to pay the loan back. She
said she could understand a default if she missed payments, but not if she didnt. And she
said that NatWest had written to her to say that it wouldnt default the loan if she paid all of it
off now, but it had already defaulted the loan.
Our investigator clarified that he was suggesting NatWest should allow Mrs H 12 months to
pay the loan back. Mrs H was happy with this, but NatWest wasnt.
NatWest said it hadnt actually defaulted the loan yet. But the loan agreement was broken
because of Mr Hs IVA. So it had to be paid in full, or a default would be applied.
NatWest said the option to make repayments was never open to Mrs H, under the terms of
the loan. That remained the case, despite the incorrect advice that NatWest gave. NatWest
said that it could allow 28 days for Mrs H to take a loan elsewhere, but if she didnt pay,
NatWest said it couldnt do anything other than default the loan.
Mrs H said she could set up a different loan with NatWest, but that the existing position on
the loan had caused her credit file to suffer. NatWest said that Mrs H could apply for a new
loan, in the same way as any other customer. But it didnt think she would be likely to get a
new loan if she did apply, because she hadnt maintained monthly payments on this loan.
Mrs H said NatWest had agreed to put the loan on hold while our service was looking at this
case. But it was still writing to her telling her to pay or a default would be applied. NatWest
confirmed to us that the debt was on hold, but Mrs H said it had told her it wasnt.
Because no agreement had been reached, this case came to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
There was some confusion about whether this loan was included in Mr Hs IVA. I now 
have a list of the debts included in that, and I can see one of those matches the 
balance for this loan, so I think it has been included.
Mrs H has told our service about the advice she was given by NatWest. NatWest 
accepts it made errors. It hasnt sent our service recordings of the phone calls that it 
had with Mrs H. It said it could only find one recording, and it wasnt able to send that 
because of technical difficulties. It doesnt appear to have provided a transcript either, 
or sent the notes of the calls it had with Mrs H.
Given that Mrs H has shown us that NatWest continued to contact her about an 
account that was supposed to be on hold, I dont think I should delay a decision in 
this case for further investigation. I think I have enough to decide this case. And as 
NatWest has accepted it made errors, I think its most likely that the calls happened 
broadly as Mrs H described.Mr and Mrs H were making all their monthly repayments on their loan. Mrs H said 
that the IVA advisor had told them not to make any repayments onto the loan, and I 
can see no repayments were made from November 2019. But Mrs H also said that 
she talked to NatWest about her husbands IVA before Christmas. This was when 
arrears were first starting to accrue on the loan. Mrs H said she was twice advised by 
NatWest to not to make any repayments until the IVA went through. I think its more 
likely than not that this advice was given, and it also seems likely that Mrs Hs credit 
file was affected by the fact she wasnt paying back this loan, in line with NatWests 
advice.
Mrs H then sought to set up a payment plan on the loan. She said she could clear the
arrears, and she made a lump sum payment which was credited to the loan in early 
February 2020. But NatWest wouldnt set up a repayment plan for her. It said that the  
debt had to default, because a provision in the loan required it do.
I note that NatWest hasnt previously used this provision to default joint loans, but 
has allowed the solvent party to continue to pay. I also note that NatWest doesnt say 
now that it had to default the loan no matter what. It says that Mrs H couldve paid the 
balance off, and she couldve arranged a loan in her sole name to clear the debt. 
NatWest hasnt suggested that it offered this advice to Mrs H at the time.
I think its too late now to offer Mrs H the option to take a new loan, if she has to 
apply in the same way as any other customer. Mrs H will struggle to arrange a loan in 
her sole name now. The position of her joint loan has affected her credit file.
Its particularly important to Mrs H that her credit file remains in good order, because 
of the position of her husband. Shes told us that shes concerned she wont be able 
to rent a home in future, because of this default. So Mrs H has been left in a very 
difficult position. I think thats not entirely, but mainly, the fault of the poor advice 
NatWest gave her. And I dont think its existing proposals do enough to put this right.
Mrs H has said that shes able to pay the outstanding amount off in 12 months, if 
NatWest would agree to that. I think that would provide part of a fair and reasonable 
outcome to this complaint, and I currently propose to include that in my award.
Ive also considered the stress that this issue has put Mrs H under. Shes described 
for us the effect this has had on her, and I think that has been very considerable 
indeed. So Ive thought about whether NatWest should make a compensation 
payment. But, in this instance, I think it may assist Mrs H more if I say that NatWest 
should waive any interest applied to this loan from 1 December 2019, and not charge 
any interest on her outstanding debt while she repays it.
If Mr H continues to make payments towards this loan from his IVA in this twelve 
month period, then those should also be counted towards the reduction of the overall 
debt. The issue of whether he does so or not is outside of the scope of this decision.
I also think that NatWest should remove any negative markers from Mrs Hs credit file 
from 1 December 2019 onwards (including a default if one has been added since 
NatWest last updated us on the status of this loan) and not add any markers in 
respect of this loan during the time she has to pay this debt.
If Mrs H isnt able to clear this debt within the period Ive granted, then NatWest can 
treat the debt as it would any other.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. Mrs H replied right away. NatWest asked for more time to consider the provisional decision. 
It said that it was broadly in agreement with what I proposed, but wanted to be sure that it 
could comply with my decision. I extended time, subject to NatWests assurance that it 
wasnt seeking to enforce this debt in the meantime. NatWest has now provided a reply.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs H accepted my provisional decision. I know she had hoped that this would be resolved 
already. Im sorry shes had to wait a little longer. It isnt in the interests of either party for me 
to make a decision that NatWest has difficulty complying with, so I wanted to make sure that 
what I was proposing wouldnt cause her further problems, if I could.
NatWest has agreed to refund interest on this loan in line with my proposed decision, and to 
allow Mrs H 12 months to pay it off. It has also said that it does have ways to make sure that 
my decision is implemented. 
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the award I originally proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must refund any interest charged on 
the loan made to Mr and Mrs H from 1 December 2019 onwards, and it must waive any 
further interest on this debt for twelve months from the date Mr and Mrs H accept my final 
decision. It should count any payments that Mr H makes from his IVA in this twelve-month 
period towards the reduction of the overall debt. And it should remove any negative markers 
from Mrs Hs credit file from 1 December 2019 onwards, then not add any markers in respect 
of this loan during the twelve months she has to pay under this decision.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H and Mr H to 
accept or reject my decision before 3 February 2021.
