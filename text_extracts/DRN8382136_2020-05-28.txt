In our most recent review of this case our adjudicator felt Cash Converters shouldnt have 
lent Miss W loans  7 - 34 and so upheld  Miss Ws complaint about these loans. Neither  party 
responded, so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Cash Converters needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure 
Miss W could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into 
account a number of different things, such as how much  was being lent, the repayment 
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages 
of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Cash Converters  should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN83821362the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Cash  Converter  was required to 
establish whether  Miss W could sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether  the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ws complaint. In our most recent review of this 
case adjudicator  didnt think that loans  1 - 6 should be upheld.  Neither party  responded to 
dispute this, so I havent considered these  loans further in my decision. But I have thought 
about these loans in the context of the overall lending relationship. 
Having reviewed Miss Ws overall pattern of lending with Cash Converters, Ive considered 
whether there was a point at which Cash Converters  should reasonably have  seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful  for Miss W. And so, Cash  
Converters should  have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ws case, I think  that this point was reached  by 
loan 7. I say this because:
At this point Cash Converters ought to have realised Miss W was not managing  to 
repay her loans sustainably. Miss W had taken out six loans within five months and 
the amounts borrowed were  generally  increasing  over this time.  So, I think  at this 
point, Cash Converters  ought  to have realised  it was more likely  than not Miss W was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in 
her finances and that Miss Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ws first loan was for £15 and loan 7 was for £70. So, Cash  Converters ought to 
have known that Miss W was not likely borrowing  to meet  a temporary  shortfall in her 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
Miss W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Cash  Converters. 
Loan 34 was taken out two years and eight  months after Miss Ws first. And loan 34 
Ref: DRN83821363was for £250, so for a much larger amount than her first. Miss W paid large amounts 
of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Cash Converters over an extended  period.
I think that Miss W lost out because  Cash Converters  continued  to provide borrowing from 
loan 7 onwards  because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ws indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 7 - 34 and Cash  Converters should put 
things right. 
putting things right  what Cash  Converters  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss W paid on loans  7 to 34;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  7 - 34 should be removed from 
Miss Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash Converters to take off tax from this interest.  Cash 
Converters must give Miss W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ws complaint. Medway Capital 
Limited, trading  as trading  as Cash Converters Gravesend , should  put things right as set out 
above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 June 2020.
