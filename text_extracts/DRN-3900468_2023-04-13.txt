The complaint
Miss D complains that PrePay Technologies Limited blocked access to and then closed her 
account.
What happened
Miss D had an account with one of PrePays agents. To keep things simple, Ill refer to 
PrePay in this decision. In August 2021, PrePay told Miss D that it had placed a restriction 
on the account  and asked her to provide additional information about herself and what she 
used the account for. Miss D provided this information, but PrePay didnt remove the 
restriction. Dissatisfied, Miss D complained to PrePay. PrePay looked at this and offered to 
pay Miss D £25 for the time it had taken to look at things. Dissatisfied, Miss D referred the 
complaint to us.
In February 2022, PrePay closed Miss Ds account, and paid the remaining balance to 
another of Miss Ds account. 
Our investigator looked at this and thought PrePay should instead pay £100 to reflect the 
inconvenience it caused  together with simple interest at 8% a year on the funds it withheld. 
PrePay disagreed. The complaint has been referred to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Financial businesses, like PrePay, are subject to a number of legal and regulatory 
requirements. These mean it needs to monitor its customers accounts and may need to 
review an account at any time. When PrePay does this it doesnt need to give reasons. And 
these legal and regulatory requirements mean PrePay may need to restrict the account while 
the review is carried out.
Based on what Ive seen, Im satisfied PrePay was acting in line with its legal and regulatory 
obligations when it restricted Miss Ds account.
Nevertheless, Id expect PrePay to complete its review in a timely manner. Here it appears 
PrePay didnt complete its review and decide to close the account until February 2022, 
shortly after it submitted its file about this complaint to our service. PrePay has apologised 
for the long wait times, and offered Miss D £25 in December 2021 to reflect the 
inconvenience this caused. PrePay says this reflects internal backlogs. This meant Miss D 
went without access to her funds from August 2021 until February 2022. Im satisfied that 
much of this delay was avoidable.
Ive also considered PrePays decision to close Miss Ds account. In general, both 
businesses and consumers are entitled to choose who they do business with. The terms and 
conditions allowed PrePay to close accounts immediately in some circumstances, and with 
60 days notice in others. Here, PrePay effectively closed the account immediately.
Based on what Im seen, Im satisfied PrePay would have been able to close the account 
with 60 days notice. But the terms only allowed PrePay to close the accounts immediately in 
certain circumstances, and based on everything Ive seen, Im not satisfied PrePay has 
shown it had cause to do so in this case. 
That said, whether or not PrePay gave Miss D the correct notice, it appears Miss D had 
access to another account in her name. Miss D doesnt appear to have used her account 
with PrePay for day-to-day spending  shes told us she was using it to sell items online and 
through social media. The real impact of PrePays actions stemmed from withholding the 
funds for so long, rather than the notice it gave.
With this in mind, Ive thought about what PrePay needs to do to put things right.
PrePay accepts it should have looked into things quicker. If things had happened as they 
should have, I think Miss D would have regained access to her funds much sooner, though I 
accept that PrePay would have needed some time to complete its review. PrePay should 
pay simple interest (the rate is 8% a year) on the amount it withheld from 28 August 2021 
until Miss D got the funds back.
PrePay has offered £25 to put things right. Thinking about everything Miss D has told us 
about the impact this all had on her, I think she should get more. It appears Miss D may 
have been vulnerable and I accept that not knowing what had happened to the funds was 
stressful. Miss D has told us she intended to use some of the funds to purchase an adapted 
vehicle. With all this in mind, I award £100 for the trouble and upset PrePay caused.
Putting things right
PrePay should pay Miss D:
8% simple interest a year on the £204, from 28 August 2021 until 18 February 2022.
£100 for the trouble and upset it caused.
My final decision
I uphold Miss Ds complaint. PrePay Technologies Limited should put things right by doing 
what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 May 2023.
