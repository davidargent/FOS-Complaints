The complaint
Mrs H complains about the way that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as 
Volkswagen Finance, has dealt with a charging order that it registered on her property. 
Mrs H is being helped with her complaint by a representative.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mrs H under a hire purchase agreement with Volkswagen 
Finance in August 2005 but she says that she returned the car about a year later 
because she was moving overseas but couldnt provide a forwarding address;
the car was sold but there was an outstanding balance of £4,021 on Mrs Hs account 
which couldnt been recovered from her so the debt was transferred to a third party 
and a charging order was registered over Mrs Hs property for £4,980.18;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the charging order was registered incorrectly or 
that Volkswagen Finance or the third party acted incorrectly in relation to it;
the charging order was still registered in 2019 when Mrs H, who had returned from 
overseas, applied for a mortgage; 
she and her representative contacted Volkswagen Finance and the third party about 
the charging order  and a payment of £4,980.18 was made in September 2019 to 
discharge the order and the charging order was removed before the end of that 
month  which was the deadline that the third party says that Mrs H and her 
representative had given for them to secure the mortgage;
Volkswagen Finance accepts that Mrs H and her representative made multiple calls 
to it and were given incorrect information  it apologised for that and offered Mrs H 
£200 compensation;
Mrs H says that the mortgage deadline was missed as a direct result of Volkswagen 
Finances and the third partys incompetence which has cost her an additional £1,728 
which she says Volkswagen Finance should reimburse to her with £500 to 
compensate her and her representative for their time, stress and anxiety  and her 
representative has provided detailed information about what he says are the failings 
of both Volkswagen Finance relating to the charging order and a subject access 
request  and he says that the compensation should be at least £1,000;
I consider it to be more likely than not based on the evidence that Ive seen that the 
charging order was removed before the end of September 2019 and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs Hs mortgage application 
failed solely and exclusively because of a failure to remove the charging order by that 
time;
I understand that the charging order was registered in 2010 so dont consider it to be 
unreasonable that there was a delay in Volkswagen Finance being able to provide 
information about it and it accepts that it provided incorrect information to Mrs H;
both Volkswagen Finance and the third party have explained why the order was 
registered in the amount of £4,980.18 and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that an incorrect amount was paid to discharge the order; 
Volkswagen Finance provided a detailed response to Mrs Hs subject access request 
and, though there may have been some mistakes in the information that it provided, 
Im not persuaded that those mistakes justify an award of compensation in these 
circumstances;
I sympathise with Mrs H for the difficulties that shes experienced  but Im only able 
to consider the impact that these events have had on her (and not the impact on her 
representative)  and I consider that Volkswagen Finances offer to pay her £200 
compensation is fair and reasonable in these circumstances;
Im not persuaded that a higher award of compensation is justified by these events 
and, although its clear that Mrs H and her representative have spent a considerable 
amount of time dealing with Volkswagen Finance, I consider that the charging order 
was registered correctly when Mrs H ended the hire purchase agreement with an 
outstanding balance which wasnt repaid until September 2019 when the charging 
order was removed; and 
I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Volkswagen 
Finance to pay to Mrs H the £500 compensation that she claimed in her complaint 
form or the £1,000 compensation that her representative has requested  or to take 
any other action in response to her complaint (other than to pay her the £200 
compensation that its offered to her, if it hasnt already done so).
My final decision
My decision is that, if it hasnt already done so, Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, 
trading as Volkswagen Finance, should pay to Mrs H the £200 compensation that it has 
offered to her.
.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 November 2020.
