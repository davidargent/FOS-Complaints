The complaint
Mr C says Loans 2 Go Limited irresponsibly lent to him.
What happened
This complaint is about 3 loans provided by Loans 2 Go to Mr C between August 2019 and 
July 2020. Mr Cs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date taken Amount Term Repayment
1 August 2019 £500.00 18 Months £114.28
2 February 2020 £576.73 18 Months £131.82
3 July 2020 £699.54 18 Months £159.88
Our investigator upheld Mr Cs complaint and thought he shouldnt have been given the 
loans. Loans 2 Go disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending - 
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr Cs complaint. These two 
questions are:
1. Did Loans 2 Go complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr C would be able to repay loans in a sustainable way and without experiencing 
significant adverse consequences?
If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
If not, would those checks have shown that Loans 2 Go wouldve been able to do 
so?
2. Did Loans 2 Go act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
The rules and regulations in place required Loans 2 Go to carry out a reasonable and 
proportionate assessment of Mr C ability to make the repayments under this agreement. 
This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or
affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower focused  so Loans 2 Go had to think about whether 
repaying the loan would be sustainable and cause significant adverse consequences for Mr 
C. In practice this meant that business had to ensure that making the payments to the loan 
wouldnt cause Mr C undue difficulty or significant adverse consequences.
In other words, it wasnt enough for Loans 2 Go to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr C. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they are seeking.
Even for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different
applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have
been more thorough:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
Did Loans 2 Go complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr C 
would be able to repay loans in a sustainable way?
Loans 2 Go has provided evidence to show that before lending to Mr C on the 3 occasions it 
carried out checks. It asked Mr C to declare his income and expenditure. It verified his 
income on each occasion and carried out a credit search to check some of his expenditure. 
Based on those checks Loans 2 Go thought it was fair to lend.
Based on the term of the loans and repayment amounts, I dont think the checks were 
proportionate on each occasion. This is because the amount of income and expenditure 
declared by Mr C was significantly wide. So, I think Loans 2 Go should have taken its checks 
further by verifying some of the information Mr C provided. This is so that it could assure 
itself that Mr C could afford the loan repayments on each occasion in a sustainable way.
Mr C has provided copies of his bank statements from the time leading up to his application 
for loan 1 to Loans 2 Go and I have been also able to look at them. On these statements 
there are many gambling transactions. I think this shows Mr C was having problems 
managing his finances at that time and on seeing this Loans 2 Go shouldnt have made a 
decision to agree to the first loan to him. Had Loans 2 Go carried out proportionate checks, it 
would have seen that the lending was unsustainable.
I dont think it is likely Mr Cs finances would have improved in this short period of time 
between him taking out loan 1 and loans 2 and 3. I think its more likely than not his financial 
problems would still have been evident at these times too. So, it follows that I dont think, 
based on what Loans 2 Go had in front of it, that it should have given Mr C these loans 
either. Loans 2 Go needs to put things right.
Did Loans 2 Go act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive also thought about whether Loans 2 Go acted unfairly in some other way and I havent 
seen any evidence that it did.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 1 to 3;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 1-3 from Mr Cs credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Loans 2 Go to take off tax from this interest. Loans 2 Go must 
give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Cs complaint. Loans 2 Go Limited should put 
things right for Mr C as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 June 2022.
