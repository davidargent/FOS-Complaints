The complaint
Mr Q complains that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118118 Money Limited) was
irresponsible to lend to him.
What happened
Mr Q had one loan from 118118 Money on 6 August 2018. He borrowed £3,000 and needed
to repay £236.11 per month for 24 months. The loan was repaid on 3 August 2020.
Mr Q says that the repayments were unaffordable, and he got into further debt and suffered
financial hardship as a result of the loan.
118118 Money says it asked Mr Q about his income and expenditure, the reason for the loan
and his employment details. It says it used industry standard verification checks and that
Mr Q was asked to confirm that he felt the repayments were affordable. 118118 Money says
its satisfied that the loan application was correctly approved.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He was satisfied that
118118 Money carried out proportionate checks and that there was nothing to indicate the
loan repayments were unsustainable.
Mr Q disagreed with the adjudicators view and requested a referral to an ombudsman.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mr Q and to 118 118 Money on 27 April 2022. Ive 
summarised my findings:
I considered 118 118 Moneys checks should have gone further because:
oThe loan was for a term of 24 months and 118118 Money needed to ensure 
the repayments were sustainable for that period;
oMr Qs credit file indicated that he might already be struggling financially:
Two payment arrangements;
Multiple cash advances;
A credit card over its limit;
Two defaulted accounts;
oIt was unlikely Mr Q would have been in a payment arrangement for two 
credit cards, with a combined balance of £2,594, if his disposable income was 
£1,700, as calculated by 118 118 Money;
I had a look at Mr Qs bank statements from the time, as a reasonable proxy for what 
proportionate checks would have shown:
oMr Qs income was averaging around £1,900 per month;
oHis regular expenditure, excluding food and credit, was at least £1,400;
oMr Qs minimum repayments on his credit cards were over £100;
oMr Q went overdrawn within days of being paid each month and incurred over 
£20 per month in fees;
oHe was gambling on average £260 per month in the two months preceding 
the loan;
I was satisfied proportionate checks would have indicated to 118 118 Money that the 
lending was unsustainable because:
oMr Q was likely to have less than £100 per month, after hed made the 
repayment, and assuming no spend on gambling.
oThis meant Mr Q had very little spare money for unforeseen expenses and 
made it likely the repayments would be unsustainable for 24 months;
oMr Qs spending on gambling appeared to be a compulsion and, therefore, I 
find it would have been irresponsible to lend him money to potentially fuel his 
addiction;
I accepted that Mr Q used almost half of the loan to make large repayments towards 
two of his credit cards, but I could see that the majority of the remainder was spent 
on further gambling.
In summary, I found that 118118 Money was irresponsible to have approved the loan, so my 
provisional decision was that I upheld Mr Qs complaint.
Mr Q responded to accept my provisional decision.
118 118 Money did not respond to the provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I outlined the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice in my provisional decision, 
so I wont repeat them here.
As neither party provided any additional information, I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money Limited) should:
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr Q towards interest, 
fees and charges on the loan;B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr Q which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr Q originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Pay Mr Q the total of A plus B;
D. Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Qs credit file in relation to the 
loan;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to deduct tax from this interest. 118 
118 Money should give Mr Q a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks 
for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Q to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 June 2022.
