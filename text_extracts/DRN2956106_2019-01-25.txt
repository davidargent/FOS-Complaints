K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains about the short term loans he took out with Active Securities Limited  trading  
as 247Moneybox.  Mr G says that 247Moneybox  lent to him irresponsibly and he struggled to 
repay the loans.  He says if 247Moneybox had made  the correct checks then it wouldve 
seen this he couldnt afford the repayments  and not lent to him.

247Moneybox has looked at Mr Gs complaint and said that it shouldnt  be upheld. It said 
that it did appropriate checks for all of the lending. And these checks showed  that the loans 
were affordable. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at what Mr G and 247Moneybox said.  She thought Mr Gs 
complaint should  be partially upheld. She thought  that 247Moneybox had made 
proportionate checks for loans  1 and 4  after a break in the lending  from loan 3. So she 
thought that 247Moneyboxs decisions to approve these loans were reasonable. 
She didnt  think that 247Moneybox had made proportionate checks for the other loans. She 
thought if it had, then it wouldnt  have agreed  to lend Mr G money for loans 2 and 3 and 
loans 5 to 19. This is because she didnt think that Mr G could afford the repayments. And 
247Moneybox wouldve  seen this had it completed  better checks.  
Ref: DRN29561062247Moneybox didnt agree with our adjudicator. It said that there  was a break between loans 
7 and 8 which was similar to the one between  loans 3 and 4. So it thought  loan 8 should be 
affordable in the same way loan 4 was. 
Our adjudicator contacted 247Moneybox  and said she thought that the break  between  loans 
7 and 8 wasnt  long enough, given  the amount of time 247Moneybox had been lending  to 
Mr G at this time. 247Moneybox  didnt want to comment further on this. 
So as no agreements been reached  the complaints been passed to me to me to issue  a 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Having done so, I agree with the adjudicator  that Mr Gs complaint should be partially  
upheld. Having reviewed  the evidence I have  available  I think  247Moneybox was wrong  to 
have given Mr G loans  2 and 3 and loans  5 to 19. Ill explain why.
Mr G didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 and 4. Because  of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about  these loans. So I wont  be making a 
decision about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Mr G had with 
247Moneybox. As such they are something  I will take into account  when considering the 
other loans  he took.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what theyre borrowing in a sustainable manner. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. The lending  shouldnt adversely impact a consumers financial situation.  
The guidance and rules themselves didnt set out compulsory  checks.  But they are clear that 
any checks needed to be proportionate and could take into account a number of different 
things. This could include how much was being  lent, the size of the repayments  and what  the 
lender found out about the consumer. 
Mr G continued to borrow from 247Moneybox  very usually very little break between the 
loans. I can see there  was a period of just under 5 months between  the end of loan 7 and 
the start of loan 8. But Mr Gs borrowing relationship  with 247Moneybox had lasted for over 
a year and half by this time. So I dont think its reasonable to say this was a significant break 
in lending at this point. And I think all of loans 5 to 19 should  be considered as continuous 
borrowing.   
So Ive firstly looked at whether 247Moneybox  performed proportionate checks. If I think that 
the checks were proportionate then Id usually conclude that it wouldve been reasonable for 
it to lend. But if 247Moneybox didnt do proportionate  checks Ive looked  at whether it 
wouldve been apparent to it that the loan repayments were affordable had it done better 
checks. 247Moneybox  should put things right if its likely to have  then found  that the loan 
repayments were unaffordable.  
Ref: DRN29561063247Moneybox says it: 
made comprehensive credit, identification and employment checks, and
looked at Mr Gs disposable income to see if he could afford the loans, and
only lent up to 45% of Mr Gs disposable  income; and
it asked Mr G about any other payday lending he may have had before approving 
loan 3. It said Mr G confirmed  each  time it lent that he didnt have any other short 
term high cost credit
And based on what it saw from this it thought  it reasonable  to lend to Mr G.
why I dont  think 247Moneyboxs checks were proportionate for loans 2 and 3 and 
loans 5 to 19 
Ive carefully thought  about what 247Moneybox  and Mr G have provided and what both 
sides have said. 
For loan 2 Mr G needed  to repay not far short of £600 the month  after taking it. 
247Moneybox recorded  Mr Gs monthly  income  as £1,750  and his monthly  expenditure as 
£800. So the loan repayment  was a very large  part of the £950 247Moneybox had recorded  
that Mr G had left over.  This situation  was very similar for loan 3. 
The loan repayments remained similarly  high over loans 5 to 19 with the average repayment  
being around £600. Mr Gs monthly recorded  income did increase to just over £1,900  later 
on, but at times his expenditure also increased to just over £1,100. So Mr G was borrowing 
and repaying a significant part, sometimes almost  all, of his recorded  disposable  income. He 
did this over a number of years. 
So I think 247Moneybox couldve realised at that time that Mr G may have some financial 
problems rather just using  the loans to help with any temporary cash flow problems he 
mayve had. And 247Moneybox shouldve also become concerned about whether it knew  
enough about Mr Gs true financial  situation.
So for loan 2 I think it wouldve been proportionate to find out about Mr Gs normal  monthly 
living costs  and financial commitments including any existing short-term credit  he mayve  
had with other lenders. And I think for loan 3, and from loan 5 onwards, that 247Moneybox 
needed to verify this information to get an accurate picture of Mr Gs finances.  In order  to 
make sure Mr G was in position  to make the repayments sustainably. I dont think 
247Moneybox did this here. 
As far as I can see 247Moneybox only obtained information about  Mr Gs income and 
expenditure. But it doesnt seem  to have found  out about any other short  term lending  he 
mayve had and it didnt verify the information he was providing. So I need to think  about 
what 247Moneybox wouldve  seen if it had carried out proportionate checks. 
what I think proportionate checks would most  likely have  shown for loans  2 and 3 and 
loans 5 to 19
Mr G has provided  some  information about his financial  circumstances this includes his bank 
statements and a current credit report. I accept that this isnt exactly what 247Moneybox 
wouldve seen at the time. But I think  it wouldve  found out similar information if it had made 
proportionate checks, so I think  its reasonable to rely on it.
Ref: DRN29561064The above  information shows that the regular income and expenditure details  247Moneybox  
recorded werent too far away from what Mr G seems to have been earning  and spending. 
But it also shows that Mr G had some  significant  financial  problems. Most  notably he was 
using other  short term lenders  and he was borrowing and repaying large amounts each 
month. As far as I can see this was at least £600  each month and sometimes  over £1,000.  
So Mr G was already  committed to spending  very close to, or more than, his disposable 
income before he needed to repay the 247Moneybox loans. 
I think that 247Moneybox  wouldve found  out this information if it had made proportionate 
checks. And I think 247Moneybox wouldve seen Mr G wouldnt have been able repay  loans 
2 and 3 and loans 5 to 19 in a sustainable way. So I think  that 247Moneybox shouldnt  have 
given loans 2 and 3 and loans 5 to 19 to Mr G and I think hes lost out as a result of this. So 
Im upholding Mr Gs complaint about  these loans. 
what 247Moneybox should do to put things  right
To put things right for Mr G, 247Moneybox should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loans 2 and 3 and loans 5 to 
19; and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Gs credit  file about  these loans;
HM Revenue & Customs requires 247Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 
247Moneybox must give Mr G a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Gs complaint.
Active Securities Limited should put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 February  2019.
