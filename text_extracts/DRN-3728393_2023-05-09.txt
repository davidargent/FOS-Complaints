The complaint
A company Ill call D complains that WorldPay (UK) Limited (WorldPay) blocked and closed 
its account, then withheld the funds in the account. D says WorldPay did so because it 
suspected D had committed fraud.
To put things right, D wanted WorldPay to return its money and pay compensation.
D is represented by one of its directors, Mr J.
What happened
Between 15 and 20 April 2021, D received a number of large payments into its account. Mr J 
told our service the payments were for goods ordered by a customer that D subsequently 
supplied. The payments showed on Ds WorldPay dashboard but hadnt credited Ds 
account, so Mr J called WorldPay to find out what was going on.
WorldPay wrote to D on 20 April 2021 to say it was withholding funds in Ds account pending 
completion of its investigation. It requested invoices for the transactions in question and 3 
months bank statements for Ds business.
Mr J sent in various documents to WorldPay, which WorldPay then reviewed, but it didnt 
accept that it showed D was entitled to the money. On 27 April 2021, WorldPay wrote to D 
saying it had completed its review. It said it no longer wanted to do business with D, and 
gave D 2 months notice of its intention to terminate its relationship. It also requested various 
other documents to establish if D was entitled to the funds it had received.
Mr J complained, but WorldPay didnt uphold the complaint. It issued its final response to Ds 
complaint on 6 May 2021, in which it set out its contractual right to monitor and withhold 
payments, and to terminate its relationship with D. It said it would review its decision to retain 
the funds in Ds account if D provided the information it had requested.
Ultimately, D wasnt able to provide satisfactory evidence to show it was entitled to the funds 
in the account, and so WorldPay completed the chargeback claims it had received, and 
returned the funds to the senders, leaving no money to return to D.
D brought its complaint to our service, but our investigator didnt uphold it. She based her 
findings on the following points:
1. WorldPays contract with D allowed it defer payments while it reviewed them;
2. WorldPay notified D on 20 April 2021 and tried to call D on 23 April 2021;
3. That WorldPay hadnt given Mr J incorrect information when he called to discuss the 
credits; and
4. That WorldPay couldnt have known there would be chargebacks given the time limit 
for chargebacks to be raised is 120 days. 
Ultimately, her view was that WorldPay had correctly processed the chargeback claims, and 
made no error in handling the situation.
Mr J didnt agree. He said WorldPay gave him false information, and had confirmed that the 
payments were safe. He asked for an Ombudsman to review the matter afresh. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr J has complained that WorldPay withheld Ds funds after he called WorldPay to ensure 
the money had arrived safely. He says he relied on WorldPays representations and that he 
only provided the goods, after having spoken with WorldPay. 
While I understand why Mr J felt comfortable in releasing the goods after satisfying himself 
the money had hit his account, I cant say WorldPay failed him in that respect. A chargeback 
can be made up to 120 days after the initial payment, so WorldPay wasnt in a position to 
guarantee D would retain the money. WorldPays terms of business (Merchant Services 
Agreement) state that it wont always be possible to dispute chargebacks, and that D 
accepts this as a risk to its business. And I havent seen anything to persuade me WorldPay 
gave any guarantees to Mr J. 
WorldPays operating guidebook also sets out what D can do to reduce the risk of fraud. It 
states that card not present transactions like those in question carry a greater risk, and 
specifically refers to the increased risk of chargeback fraud. The booklet also states that D 
will be liable for such transactions, if they are confirmed as fraud. The booklet also sets out 
various steps D can take to protect itself from fraud. For example, it highlights the following 
issues:
Multiple or bulk orders;
High value orders larger than usual; and
Orders shipped to a single address but purchased with various cards.
Mr J told our service he had received orders from the address in question before, but 
indicated those orders were significantly smaller and unusual compared to the transactions 
in dispute. The transaction also represented successive large transactions, and WorldPay 
has produced evidence that shows multiple different payment cards were used. 
Our investigator asked Mr J to confirm what steps he took to protect D from fraud on these 
transactions. But the only steps Mr J said he took was that he called WorldPay to check the 
payment was safe. Mr J didnt take steps to verify the identity of the buyer, or to check if the 
name on the card matched the name of the buyer. 
Ive seen that WorldPay wrote to D on 20 April 2021 to request Mr J call urgently to discuss 
a number of suspicious payments into Ds WorldPay account. And Ive seen an internal note 
that shows it attempted to call Mr J when it identified the suspicious transactions. WorldPay 
also sent chargeback notices to D for each transactions, setting out full details. Based on the 
evidence WorldPay has sent me, Im satisfied the payments in question were fraudulent and 
that it wasnt obliged to defend the chargebacks on Ds behalf.
Im satisfied WorldPay acted in line with its terms of business, and its legal and regulatory 
obligations when it blocked the transactions and approved the chargebacks. WorldPays terms of business provide that D is liable for the payments in these circumstances, so I cant 
say it treated D unfairly when it approved the chargebacks and withheld the funds in Ds 
account. 
Mr J told our service that WorldPay retained around Â£2,000 that wasnt connected to the 
transactions in question. But Im satisfied WorldPay acted reasonably in retaining that 
money, given D owed a debt to WorldPay as a result of the chargebacks.
While I empathise with Ds position given it has lost both the money and the goods, Im sorry 
to say that I cant reasonably hold WorldPay liable in these circumstances. So it follows that I 
wont ask it to refund D, or pay any compensation.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 June 2023.
