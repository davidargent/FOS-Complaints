The complaint
Mrs A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly closed her accounts 
without authority or notification.
What happened
Mrs A says NatWest closed two of her accounts without telling her and without her authority. 
She says that was unfair and would like the accounts re-instated as well as her money 
returned. Mrs A would like compensation for what took place.
NatWest says both accounts hadnt been used in many years and so it acted in line with its 
dormancy policy and closed the accounts. It says the money is available to Mrs A which is 
about £152. NatWest says the accounts were closed in 2018 and 2019 but says it cant 
reinstated the accounts and a new account can be opened.
Mrs A brought her complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator thought the accounts hadnt been used since 2011 and NatWest was entitled to 
close them. The investigator said NatWest had fairly agreed to pay Mrs A £100 for any 
inconvenience and that Mrs As money was available.
Mrs A doesnt accept that view and says NatWests actions have shattered her relationship 
with it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I also 
make clear that I have not seen any evidence that NatWest has offered Mrs A £100 
compensation for her inconvenience and it may have been the case that was directly offered 
to her. I dont intend to uphold this complaint and so I dont intend to order NatWest to pay 
that amount if it was offered. It will be for Mrs A to ask NatWest for that amount if it was 
previously offered if she wishes.
I have looked carefully at NatWests records and can see these accounts hadnt been used 
for many years by Mrs A. Im satisfied that NatWest in those circumstances was entitled to 
follow its dormancy policy and transfer the balances, which I dont think were significant, to a 
dormancy account. I appreciate Mrs A says she didnt receive any notification of that 
decision but also appreciate NatWest says it sent letters  some years ago. It follows that I 
dont think NatWest made a mistake or acted unfairly by closing the accounts. And I dont 
think Mrs A noticed that until some years later when she brought this complaint. Im satisfied 
that provides additional evidence that there was a limited impact on her in any event.
I appreciate Mrs A says the relationship between her and NatWest has been shattered. I 
dont know why Mrs A says that it the case but of course her money is available for her. And 
I can see that NatWest has fairly told her how to get it back and that she can apply for a new 
account if she wishes. I have made clear that I dont think the impact on Mrs A was 
significant as she hasnt lost her money and her account containing the main balance of just 
under £150 hadnt been used since 2011.
Overall, Im satisfied NatWest has acted fairly and hasnt made a mistake. It follows that I 
cant fairly order it to reinstate these accounts or pay compensation. I have made clear that 
Mrs A should contact NatWest and follow its advice on retrieving her money and if an offer of 
£100 was made then she should again contact it.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 February 2022.
