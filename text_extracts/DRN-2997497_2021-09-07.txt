The complaint
Miss R complained because PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA refused to refund her for a 
purchase which she said she didnt receive.
What happened
On 6 April 2020, Miss R used her PayPal account to pay Â£61.60 for goods to be delivered to 
her from abroad. 
On 24 April, she contacted PayPal, and said she hadnt received the goods. PayPal raised a 
buyer dispute, and contacted the seller. 
The seller provided PayPal with a tracking number from a delivery firm. PayPal checked 
online, and the tracking showed the parcels journey from the sender abroad, with the last 
entry stating 16 April 2020 Delivered [name of Miss Rs town] 16:56.
Miss R provided PayPal with a copy of a note from the delivery firm which had been put 
through her door. This shows a tick in the pre-printed box Delivered to your neighbour at 
the following address and a handwritten By wall in the box intended for the neighbours 
address. But PayPal replied that this note didnt have a tracking number, date or time, so it 
couldnt say that this note referred to the disputed delivery.
PayPal explained that it based Not Received claims on tracking information from delivery 
firms, which it said proved the parcel had been delivered. It said that if Miss R still hadnt 
received the parcel, she should contact the delivery firm direct.
Miss R said shed paid for signed for delivery. But PayPal said this was outside its buyer 
protection policy, and shed have to pursue this separately with the seller.
Miss R wasnt satisfied and complained to this service. She said she didnt receive the order, 
and had contacted the seller but didnt receive any reply. Shed then contacted PayPal for a 
refund, which they hadnt provided. Miss R explained that the parcel needed her signature, 
and she certainly hadnt signed. Shed asked for proof many times, but PayPal either didnt 
reply or ignored her requests.
Our investigator didnt uphold Miss Rs complaint. He said that PayPals buyer protection 
policy stated that a claim wouldnt be successful if the seller had provided proof of delivery. 
He said that when Miss R entered the contract with PayPal, shed agreed to the terms and 
conditions of the account. So he couldnt tell PayPal it had to acted outside that policy.
Miss R wasnt satisfied. She explained that shed contacted the delivery firm, which had said 
the parcel had been left outside the building. Shed also contacted the seller, who had said it 
had been a signed-for package. The delivery firms card saying it had left the parcel 
unattended by a wall wasnt signed-for proof of delivery.  She didnt understand why the 
delivery firm would leave a parcel, that was meant to be signed for, by a wall.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I do understand that Miss R is frustrated by not having received the goods she ordered. But 
my job is to look specifically at this dispute impartially, considering whats fair and 
reasonable in all of the circumstances  and its important to say that I cant consider any 
failings by either the seller or the delivery firm.
PayPals buyer protection policy, to which Miss R agreed when using PayPal, says:
Item Not Received claims 
 Your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not 
Received claim, if: 

- The seller has provided proof of delivery. 
- If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in 
favour of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the 
goods. 
The policy also defines how it interprets proof of delivery:
Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:
Date of delivery and delivered status
An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the "Transaction 
Details" page
An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or zip/postal 
code (or international equivalent).
The evidence which PayPal provided from the sender abroad, which tracked the parcel to 
Miss Rs town as delivered on 16 April, meets PayPals criteria.
PayPals criteria dont require a signature  and I recognise this would be frustrating for Miss 
R if she paid the seller more, in order to have a signed-for delivery. But as PayPals buyer 
protection scheme doesnt require a signature, I cant say that PayPal did anything wrong in 
refusing Miss Rs claim. And the while you were out delivery slip doesnt bear any of the 
identifying details of the specific item in question. While thats not Miss Rs fault, its another 
reason why it would be difficult for me to say that PayPal had acted unfairly.
Miss R told us she didnt get anywhere with the seller or the delivery company, but she may 
wish to try that again, if she has evidence that she paid the seller extra for signed-for 
delivery. But as this service doesnt have jurisdiction to consider complaints against the seller 
of Miss Rs goods, or the delivery company, unfortunately we arent able to help her with that.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 October 2021.
