The complaint
Mr A says that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) irresponsibly lent to him. He says 
NatWest increased his credit limit even though there was a default.
What happened
NatWest approved Mr As application for a credit card in 2011 with an initial credit limit of 
£3100. The credit limit was increased to £4100 in 2019.
Mr A feels that NatWest lent irresponsibly. He said hes had a default on his credit file since 
2018 and that the credit limit increase led him to borrow more.
NatWest disagrees. It says it carried out checks before increasing the credit limit and found 
nothing to indicate that Mr A wasnt able to sustainably repay the borrowing.
Our investigator agreed with NatWest but Mr A didnt and he asked for a decision by an 
ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr A opened the credit card account in 2011. Because this is more than 6 years ago, and 
because Mr A wouldve been aware of the credit limit and the interest rate, Im unable to look 
into the original lending decision because any complaint about it has been brought out of 
time.
The credit limit was increased in 2019. Im able to look into this part of the complaint.
Our approach to considering complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending is set 
out on our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering Mr As complaint.
Before providing credit to a customer, we would expect NatWest to carry out reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure that lending is sustainably affordable.
NatWest has explained that it carried out an affordability check based on Mr As 
management of the account in the months leading up to the credit limit increase. It says that 
it took account of Mr As account performance since it opened and checked that Mr A hadnt 
missed any payments. It also obtained a credit score. NatWest says that Mr A met the 
eligibility criteria for the credit limit increase.
Based on what Ive seen, I think NatWest carried out appropriate checks before increasing 
the credit limit. I havent seen anything to suggest that the increased credit limit wasnt 
affordable for Mr A.
Mr A has made the point that there was a default on his credit file when the credit limit was 
increased. Ive thought about what NatWest would likely have done if it had discovered the 
default.
Its important to say that a  default doesnt automatically exclude a customer from future 
lending. Ive looked at the evidence which Mr A has provided about the default. I think its 
reasonable to  assume that the default wouldve been registered on Mr As credit file and , as 
a consequence, wouldve impacted on Mr As credit score.
NatWest has said that Mr A passed the necessary credit score for the credit limit to be 
increased. Therefore, even if NatWest had been aware of the default, I think its likely that it 
wouldve reached the same conclusion and found the credit limit increase to be affordable.
In conclusion, I think NatWest carried out reasonable and proportionate checks before 
approving the credit limit increase. These checks didnt identify any sign of financial difficulty 
or suggest that the lending was unaffordable. I dont think NatWest lent irresponsibly.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2022.
