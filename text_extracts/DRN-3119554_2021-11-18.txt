The adjudicator, reviewed Ms Ws complaint and he thought STF had acted reasonably 
when it approved loans 1  9. He also thought, that by loan 10 STF ought to have been 
carrying out more detailed checks on Ms Ws financial position, but as he didnt have 
anything to show what Ms Ws finances were like at the time, he also didnt uphold this loan. 
But, the adjudicator thought, that from loan 11 and all future loans shouldnt have been 
granted. In his view, the overall pattern of lending was now harmful for Ms W and so these 
loans ought to not have been provided. 
Ms W appears to have accepted the adjudicators findings. 
STF disagreed with the adjudicators assessment. In response, STF said;
there was no nothing wrong in the way STF dealt with Ms W,
it adhered to all the regulations that were applicable at the time and
it was only from November 2018 that STF had the ability for the agents to keep any 
evidence they gathered as part of the application, for example bank statements. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
In my view, there are two chains of lending. Loans 1  5 and then loans 6  32. There is a 
gap of nearly a year between these chains, which is my view wouldve been enough for STF 
to have treated Ms Ws applications a fresh. 
There also doesnt appear to be any ongoing disagreement about the outcome the 
adjudicator reached about loans 1  10. So, I dont think I need to go into detail about those 
loans in this decision, expect to say that I agree with what the adjudicator or the same 
reasonable. 
Instead, in this decision Ill focus on what happened with loans 11  32. But Ive kept in mind 
loans 1  10 because these loans form part of the overall lending relationship between Ms W 
and STF. 
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms W could
repay her loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might suggest STF should have done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Ms W. These factors include: Ms W having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income); 
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ms W having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms W coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms W. The loan payments being 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case.
At the time loans 11  32 were given, STF was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, 
which has set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) that payments are 
sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and in particular, made on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to make them. If a 
lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make 
their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those 
repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Ms Ws complaint.
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 11 - 32 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. STF has been able to provide this Service with a copy of Ms Ws 
application forms for these loans. Looking at these, it appears for each loan it asked her 
about her income and expenditure. And based on what Ms W declared about her income 
and expenditure, it wouldve been reasonable for STF to have believed the loans would be 
affordable for Ms W. 
But Id be inclined to think that from loan 10, STFs checks really needed to go further. At this 
point in the lending relationship, I think STF ought to have been verifying Ms Ws income and 
overall expenditure in order to have an accurate understanding of her actual financial 
position. Its not clear to me it did this.
But in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Ms W, STF also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Ms W. Having looked at the overall pattern of 
STFs lending history with Ms W, I agree with our adjudicator that STF should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the time it 
provided loan 11. I say this because;
At this point STF ought to have realised Ms W was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Ms W had taken out six loans in 16 months (in this lending chain) and 
she had been indebted to STF for the entire time. So STF ought to have realised it 
was more likely than not Ms W was having to borrow further to cover an ongoing 
need and that Ms Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. It also seems that 
Ms Ws loan history up until this point clearly indicated that her underlying financial 
situation didnt seem to be improving, especially, when you take into account that in 
the first lending chain, Ms W had been indebted for around 18 months. 16 months into the lending relationship, Ms Ws capital borrowing had increased from 
£300 to £400. This suggests to me that Ms Ws indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably, and she was likely needing further borrowing to cover ongoing living 
costs, rather than as a means to cover one-off purchases, for example. 
Ms W usually took new loans around the same time previous ones were repaid, for 
example, loans 11 and 12 as well as loans 16 and 17 and at times Ms W had more 
than one loan running at the same time. This pattern continued throughout the 
lending relationship. So, STF ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms 
W, on these occasions, was having to borrow further to effectively cover a long-term 
financial need. To me, this is also indicative of her indebtedness not being 
sustainable.
Ms W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed STF. Loan 32 was 
taken out over five years after Ms Ws first loan in this lending chain. And it was for 
nearly twice the amount Ms W initially borrowed.  Ms W had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to STF over an extended period.
I think that Ms W lost out when STF provided loans 11 - 32 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ws indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans and the time in debt was likely to have had negative 
implications on Ms Ws ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 11 - 32 and Ill go on to set out
what STF should do to put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms W from loan 11 as I think it ought to.
 
Clearly there are several possibilities, and all hypothetical answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms W may have simply left matters there 
and not tried to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between her and STF which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, 
she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even 
possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and 
substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Ms W in a compliant 
way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Ms W would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.STF shouldnt have given Ms W loans 11 - 32.
If STF has sold the outstanding debts it should buy these back if it is able to do so and then 
take the following steps. If STF isnt able to buy the debts back then it should liaise with the 
new debt owner to achieve the results Ive outlined below;
 
A. STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms W towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance. 
B. STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms W 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms W originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled. 
C. STF should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Ms W as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Ms W 
having made overpayments then STF should refund these overpayments with 8% 
simple interest* calculated, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. STF should then refund the amounts calculated in A 
and B and move to step E. 
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Ms W. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then STF should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with 
Ms W and Id remind STF of its obligation to treat Ms W fairly and with forbearance. 
E. The overall pattern of Ms Ws borrowing for loans 11 - 32 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so STF should remove these loans entirely from Ms 
Ws credit file. STF do not have to remove loans 31 and 32 from Ms Ws credit file 
until these have been repaid, but it should still remove any adverse information 
recorded about these loans.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. It should give Ms W 
a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Ms Ws complaint in part.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 December 2021.
