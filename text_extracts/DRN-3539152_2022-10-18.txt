The complaint
E, a limited company, complains about delays by National Westminster Bank Plc in closing a 
Euro bank account and transferring the balance. It asks for compensation for time spent and 
losses due to changes in the exchange rate. E is represented by its director (Ms C) and a 
representative (Mr D) authorised by Ms C to bring the complaint.
What happened
Ms C contacted NatWest in June 2020 about closing Es Euro account. NatWest asked her 
to complete and return a form, which Ms C did by email. Ms C chased NatWest and made a 
complaint in October 2020 as the account hadnt been closed. NatWest said it hadnt 
received the form. The problem continued into early 2022.
Our investigator said NatWest should have been more proactive about explaining the 
problem with the form being received. She said NatWest should pay compensation for this. 
Our investigator said Ms C could have transferred the funds while the account was open if 
she was worried about exchange rate changes. Our investigator said NatWest wasnt 
responsible for any losses related to changes in the exchange rate.
Mr D said the completed form had been provided to NatWest a number of times, NatWest 
lost the forms and their attempts to follow up with NatWest were ignored. He said this 
happened again when E made a complaint. Mr D said it wasnt possible to transfer the 
funds, and if theyd made a request it would have been ignored leaving the funds trapped. 
He considers this theft and says banks should be better supervised.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I should first say that this service isnt a regulator and we arent responsible for the 
supervision of banks. We provide an informal dispute resolution service. I should also say 
that where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on 
the balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened 
in light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances. 
Ms C contacted NatWest about closing Es euro account in mid-2020. She sent a completed 
form authorising the account closure. She gave instructions about where to send the account 
balance in a covering email. This was to a Euro account with another provider. 
Ms C provided evidence she sent the form in June 2020, and reminders in July 2020 and 
September 2020. She sent the form again, after a complaint was raised on Es behalf in 
October 2020. NatWest gave Ms C the details of a staff member in the business banking 
team who would sort the matter out and ensure the account was closed without delay. 
I dont doubt that Ms C sent the form, and the address on her emails looks to be correct. 
NatWest says it didnt receive the form from Ms C, and cant explain why this was. NatWest 
couldnt act on or respond to instructions it didnt receive. But Ms C followed up her request, 
including with the complaints team. At some point it would have been reasonable for 
NatWest to look into what happened to Ms Cs emails and why they werent received. If this 
was due to a problem with NatWests systems and this couldnt be fixed, it ought to have told 
Ms C this and discussed other ways for Ms C to provide the form or otherwise authorise the 
closure of the account. It could have followed up with Ms C when it didnt receive the form  
especially after shed raised a complaint and been told the matter would be dealt with. I think 
its right that NatWest pays compensation for its poor service.
Es representatives ask for compensation for Es financial loss. They said E incurred bank 
fees. NatWest refunded fees related to a credit card and I havent seen evidence of other 
fees incurred as a result of the delay closing the account. They also ask for compensation 
for Es losses due to changes in the exchange rate after June 2020. Ms C says this resulted 
in losses of about £2,000. 
For me to find it fair to require NatWest to pay compensation for Es exchange rate losses Id 
have to find that Es officers were unable to transfer money from the account due to errors 
by NatWest. I dont think thats the case. 
Ms C told us that E receives some payments in Euros which were paid into its Euro account 
with NatWest, and this money was to be regularly converted into sterling. However, she says 
this was a slow manual process that involved her visiting her branch and completing forms. 
Ms C says she opened a Euro account with another provider to avoid this and because she 
says NatWests exchange rate charges were excessive. Mr D says the process of 
transferring Euros from the NatWest account to Es Euro account with another provider was 
similarly laborious, requiring a visit to the branch. He said they repeated this process about 
10 times over three years until all of Es clients made payments direct to Es other Euro 
account.
Ms C says she moved and visiting her branch was no longer practical. Ms C says she 
cancelled her credit and debit cards expecting the account to be closed. She forwarded an 
email shed sent in mid-2020 referring to her request to close the account and saying she 
thought shed no longer be able to access the Euro account online. Most likely though she 
would have been able to access the account, and shed reasonably have known this once it 
became apparent the account hadnt been closed.
I dont think its fair to say Es officers were unable to transfer funds out of its NatWests Euro 
account. While the account remained open they were able to transfer funds in the same way 
they had previously. Ms C could have visited her branch, as shed done previously. I 
appreciate her move made this inconvenient but NatWest wasnt responsible for that. 
NatWest says they could have transferred the funds via an online service or by sending a fax 
to its payment centre. Ms C or Mr D could have phoned and asked NatWest about their 
options. 
Mr D says if theyd called NatWest theyd have been put on hold and then told to complete a 
form that NatWest would say it didnt receive. If there was evidence that Es officers tried to 
make a transfer and NatWest failed to action the request I might come to a different 
outcome. But I havent seen any evidence that they did.
Putting things right
Ms Cs request to close Es Euro account wasnt actioned promptly. But this didnt stop her 
from transferring money from the account. I dont think its fair and reasonable to require 
NatWest to compensate E for any losses due to changes in the exchange rate while the funds remained in the account. Based on the available evidence, E didnt incur any bank 
charges due to the delay which havent yet been refunded.
E is the account holder and the complainant. I cant usually require banks to pay 
compensation to third parties (such as Ms C and Mr D) or for their time or upset. E is a 
limited company and as such doesnt feel upset or frustrated. But as a limited company it 
relies on its directors and officers to manage its affairs, and I can award compensation for 
inconvenience caused to them, when acting in that capacity. 
As I said, NatWest couldnt act on instructions it didnt receive. But it should have been more 
pro-active when it became aware there was a problem with it receiving emails from Ms C, 
and discuss other ways for her to provide the instructions. Its failure to do so caused 
unnecessary inconvenience to Ms C and Mr D, as they re-sent the form that NatWest still 
didnt receive. I think for the inconvenience this caused to them as officers of E, £250 is fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. I order National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
£250 to E. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask E to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2022.
