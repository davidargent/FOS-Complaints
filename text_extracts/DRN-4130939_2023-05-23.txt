The complaint
Mr S complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr Ss complaint is about three Aqua accounts and a Fluid account.
The first Aqua account was opened in December 2016. NewDay gave Mr S a card with an 
initial credit limit of £300. Mr S never used the account. The account was closed in January 
2017.
The second Aqua account was opened in May 2019. NewDay gave Mr S a card with an 
initial credit limit of £450. The account was closed in March 2020.
The third Aqua account was opened in December 2022. NewDay gave Mr S a card with an 
initial credit limit of £900.
The Fluid account was opened in February 2021, NewDay gave Mr S a card with an initial 
credit limit of £1200.
Mr S complains that NewDay lent to him irresponsibly. 
NewDay upheld Mr Ss complaint in relation to the first Aqua account. No redress was due 
because the account was never used so no charges or fees had been applied to the 
account.
NewDay also upheld Mr Ss complaint in relation to the third Aqua account and said it would 
rework the account to remove all interest and charges.
Mr S remained unhappy and brought his complaint to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He said that in relation to the second Aqua 
account, NewDay had carried out reasonable and proportionate checks and that the lending 
decision was fair. In relation to the Fluid account, the investigator said that it wouldve been 
proportionate for NewDay to verify Mr Ss income and expenditure, but that there wasnt any 
evidence to suggest that the lending decision wasnt fair.
Mr S didnt agree so Ive been asked to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending  is set out on our 
website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering Mr Ss complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say that NewDay had to complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Mr S could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable way. 
These checks needed to be focussed on the borrowers circumstances. The nature of whats 
considered reasonable and proportionate will vary but could include things like the amount of 
credit, the total sum repayable, the amount of repayments, the cost of credit and the 
consumers individual circumstances.
Theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. Bu lenders are required to consider the 
factors Ive mentioned above when considering whats reasonable and proportionate.
First Aqua account and third Aqua account
NewDay has upheld Mr Ss complaint in relation to these accounts so I wont be looking into 
these any further.
Second Aqua account
Mr S declared annual income of £19,000 when he applied for the card. He also declared 
unsecured debt of £6000. NewDay carried out a credit search. The search showed that Mr S 
had six active accounts. There was no adverse information on his credit file.
Based on what Ive seen, I think NewDay carried out reasonable and proportionate checks 
before opening the account. I also think the lending decision was fair. I say this because 
there was nothing in the information gathered by NewDay to suggest that Mr S was in 
financial difficulties or that he wasnt likely to be able to sustainably repay the borrowing.
Fluid account
Mr S applied for this account in February 2021. He declared an annual income of £19,000 
and unsecured debt of £1500.
NewDay carried out a credit search and based on the information gathered, gave Mr S a 
credit limit of £1200. This credit limit was increased to £2450 in April 2022.
Before approving the account, and before approving the credit limit increase, I think its 
wouldve been proportionate for NewDay to carry out further checks to verify Mr Ss income 
and expenditure.
I dont know what further checks NewDay wouldve carried out. This service asked Mr S to 
provide information to show what his financial circumstances were at the relevant time, to 
see what NewDay would have discovered had it carried out reasonable and proportionate 
checks. Mr S hasnt provided enough information for me to be able to determine whether the 
lending decision was fair. Because of this, Im unable to fairly say that NewDay lent to Mr S 
irresponsibly.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2023.
