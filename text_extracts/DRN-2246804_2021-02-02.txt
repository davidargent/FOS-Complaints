The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA didnt respond to letters in which Mr S 
advised of the financial difficulties he was experiencing. Mr S is also unhappy that PayPal, 
without responding to his letters, also passed his account to a debt collection agency
What happened
Mr S has a credit agreement with PayPal. In 2019, Mr S experienced financial difficulties and 
wrote to PayPal on several occasions to inform them of this and to seek assistance in 
managing his credit obligations to them. However, PayPal did not respond to any of Mr Ss 
letters, and later passed Mr Ss account to a debt collection agency.
Mr S wasnt happy with how PayPal had acted and so he made a complaint. PayPal looked 
at Mr Ss complaint, but they noted that they had tried to contact Mr S but that because he 
hadnt updated his address with them the letters that they had sent had been returned. 
PayPal also noted that they had tried to contact Mr S by alternative channels but that this 
had also been unsuccessful. So, PayPal didnt uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Mr S remained dissatisfied and the matter was referred to our service. One of our 
investigators looked at this complaint, but they also felt that PayPal had taken reasonable 
steps to try to contact Mr S, and so they didnt uphold the complaint either. Mr S didnt 
accept the view put forward by our investigator, and so the case was escalated to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear that Mr S feels strongly about this complaint but having completed my review I find 
that Ive reached the same conclusion as our investigator, for essentially the same reasons.
I note that Mr S believes that PayPal have failed to respond to the letters which he sent to 
them, and that while Mr S acknowledges that he has changed address, he notes that the 
letters he sent to PayPal included his present address and that PayPal therefore had record 
of that address and should have updated their systems so as to direct any post that they 
sent following receipt of his letters to his present address.
PayPal dont acknowledge that they received the letters which Mr S says that he has sent. I 
have no reason to doubt the testimony of either party in this instance, but I do feel that it is 
important to note that, should PayPal have received the letters from Mr S which were sent 
from his present address, this in itself would not have been sufficient for PayPal to update Mr 
Ss address on their system. 
This is because there are security requirements that must be met before a business can 
legitimately change a customers address, with the key factor being that the business must 
be able to verify definitively that the request to change the address is being made by the 
actual customer. 
It must be noted that the receipt of a letter alone does not provide the required level of 
verification to enable a business to confirm this. The business would need a more direct 
level of contact to verify that the request does in fact come from the customer who has sent 
the letter before any changes can be made.
PayPal have provided to this service copies of letters which they sent to the address they 
held on file for Mr S. Unfortunately, these letters were returned to PayPal as Mr S no longer 
lived at that address and PayPal had no record of Mr S updating his address with them.
In instances such as this where post is returned to a business, what this service would 
expect is that the business would attempt to contact its customer via alternative channels. 
PayPal have demonstrated that they have done this here, and this service has been sent 
copies of emails sent by PayPal asking Mr S to update his postal address. Importantly, these 
emails show as being sent to the email address which this service has used to successfully 
correspond with Mr S. 
Finally, PayPal attempted to contact Mr S by telephone. Mr S does not dispute this point and 
notes that he didnt want to communicate with PayPal by telephone. Mr S is entitled to take 
this position, but I hope he can understand why I have to consider PayPals attempts to 
contact him in this manner as proactive on their behalf, especially considering the lack of 
response which PayPal had received from other channels and also the potential 
consequences of Mr Ss continued non-payment which PayPal were taking appropriate 
steps to give Mr S the opportunity to avoid.
So, its difficult for me to consider upholding Mr Ss complaint in this instance. PayPal 
dispute ever having received the letters that Mr S says that he sent, but even if they had, 
they wouldnt have been able to update Mr Ss address based solely on the receipt of those 
letters because they didnt provide a sufficient level of verification to enable them to do so.
Furthermore, PayPal attempted to contact Mr S by both email and telephone when the 
letters they sent to the address they held on file for Mr S were returned as undeliverable.
All of which means it seems likely to me that PayPal werent aware of Mr Ss financial 
difficulties before Mr Ss account was passed by them to a debt collection agency, and that 
they only became aware of these difficulties when Mr S informed the debt collection agency, 
which then passed on that information to PayPal.
Having learnt of Mr Ss circumstances, PayPal acted to recall Mr Ss account from the debt 
collection agency and put a hold on collections activities. This is in line with what this service 
would expect, and so I cant fairly say that PayPal have acted unfairly or inappropriately 
toward Mr S here. 
I understand that this wont be the outcome that Mr S was hoping for, but it follows that I 
wont be upholding this complaint or asking PayPal to take any further action at this time.
  
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2021.
