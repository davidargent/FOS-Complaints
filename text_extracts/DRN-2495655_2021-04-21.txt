The complaint
Miss W complains that Mutual Clothing and Supply Company Limited lent to her 
irresponsibly. 
What happened
Using information from Mutuals records supplied to us here is a brief loan table to show the 
approved loans for Miss W. The first seven were considered to have been out of this 
Services jurisdiction and so no decision is made in relation to them and are marked as grey 
in the table. They remain relevant in terms of the lending history.

One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that Mutual should put things 
right for Miss W for loans 8 to 23. She thought that the pattern of lending was unsustainable 
from loan 8.
Mutual disagreed and the complaint was passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mutual has had other decisions from this Service which detail our approach to complaints
of this nature and what we think about the rules and regulations that surround the sale of
this type of credit. So Mutual should be aware of our approach to these issues. And our 
general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all the relevant rules, 
guidance and good industry practice  are on our website. So, I dont intend to go into detail 
about those here, but a brief summary is below.
Mutuals response to our adjudicators opinion letter is like the others we have received. 
Other decisions have addressed many of Mutuals points, comments and views raised in 
Mutuals submissions. These include points and issues relating to Mutual as a business in 
the lending market, the citation of published documents, the role of home credit lending, 
Mutuals view on repeat lending, and the provision of graphs to compare its repayments with 
high cost short term credit lenders.
 
So, I have read all the submissions, but I have not addressed each one of these points as 
Mutual has received many responses to these submissions already. Where Mutual has 
raised points relevant to Miss Ws circumstances or complaint I have referred to them where 
necessary. 
I consider it reasonable to describe this lending as high cost credit, as does the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA), which includes home collected credit within its identified high cost 
credit cohort. And while I note Mutuals loans have longer terms than, for example, a 
payday loan, that does not make it a low risk, or inexpensive, option for a consumer. And, as 
such, long-term use of these products can be harmful to a consumer. The FCA has not said 
anything to the contrary on this point. I have considered these issues alongside everything 
else in making my decision.
Mutual needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this meant that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss W could
repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much was being lent, the 
repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mutual should fairly and reasonably have done
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing 
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being
without undue difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, 
while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Mutuals lending history with Miss W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mutual should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Mutual should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. Given the circumstances of Miss Ws case, I think 
that this point was reached by loan 8. I explain why I think this in the following paragraphs. 
One part of Mutuals submissions about which I disagree is that it has said that there were 
gaps between the lending with Miss W and that is simply not the case. And despite its 
submission it has produced a chart which clearly demonstrates a continuous period of 
lending from April 2011 to October 2019. Miss W remains indebted as information I have at 
the time of writing this decision is that loans 20 to 23 remain outstanding.
I have little evidence from Mutual about exactly what it did know about Miss Ws financial 
situation when approving the loans. Its final response letter (FRL) to Miss W describes a 
number of application checks it did, or would have done, but Ive received no evidence of 
them. And the loan table in that FRL supplies some of the financial detail relating to the 
repayments scheduled. 
By the time Miss W applied for Loan 8 she had been in debt to Mutual for over three and half 
years. Mutual says that a good repayment record indicated that there was no financial 
difficulty and that records assisted in the decision making for Mutual to lend more. Past 
repayment record may be of some use but inevitably does not give the whole picture and if  
as is often the case - people in debt borrow to repay loans, then Id expect a professional 
lender to have questioned that element and double checked it especially after years of being 
in debt as Miss W was when she applied for loan 8.  
The overlapping nature of some of the loans meant that her weekly repayment sums had 
increased. By the loan 8 approval she had recently repaid two loans at the end of July 2014 
and still loans 6 and 7 remained unpaid.
 
So, at the point at which loan 8 was approved, Miss W was already showing signs of 
additional overlapping of loans, increase in weekly payment commitments, and likely 
borrowing to repay earlier loans. I have decided that Mutual ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not that Miss Ws indebtedness was becoming unsustainable. And the 
pattern continued. 
When Ms W applied for loan 15 in June 2017, four other loans remained unpaid: loans 11 to 
14. And so her weekly repayments had increased exponentially and I think Mutual ought to 
have been asking why Miss W needed to take more credit and needed to ensure she was 
able to repay it, in line with the FCA creditworthiness assessment requirement.            The proximity in dates between receiving the loan 16 capital and paying off loan 12 suggests 
that its likely she used the money from loan 16 to assist her with repaying of loan 12, or to 
fill in that gap inevitably left after repaying loan 12. Borrowing to repay debt is a clear 
indication of unsustainability. And at the time she had taken Loan 16 that left her with four 
loans to repay including loan 16 which I think is too much.
Miss W didnt make any real inroads to the amount she owed Mutual. The pattern I have 
described earlier repeated itself when Miss W applied for Loan 20 in October 2018. At that 
point Miss W had just repaid loan 16 a few days earlier. And its highly likely that she used 
the capital from loan 20 to repay it (indirectly) as she would have had a financial hole left to 
fill having paid it off. And it may be that loan 16 was refinanced into loan 20. And the same 
seems to have occurred with loans 21 to 23 for loans 17 to 19. The dates on which they 
(loans 17 to 19) were repaid are very close to the dates the new loans (21 to 23) were 
approved. Mutual disagrees with this idea of borrowers having to borrow to fill a previous 
vacuum created by repayments, but here is a good example of that likely having occurred. 
Miss W reached the stage where she has been unable to repay loans 20 to 23. Those loans 
have been outstanding for several years. And by loan 23, approved when she already had 
several other loans, Miss W had been indebted to Mutual for over eight years. The harmful 
pattern I think was established from loan 8, continued. Miss W had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Mutual over a very long time, and she remains in debt 
to them. 
I think that Miss W lost out because Mutual continued to provide borrowing from loan 8
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ws indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit over an extended period; and
the length of time over which Miss W borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 8 to 23 and Ill go on to set out
what Mutual should do to put things right.
Mutual has referred to the 2020 High Court judgement in the case of Kerrigan vs Elevate
Credit International Limited. It has given its own explanations as to what it thinks the Judge 
meant where that Judge said that the relationship could be fair if there were a lower number 
of loans per year: for example, under four loans a year. Mutual has said, as it lent a lower 
amount than this to Miss W, then this would indicate that it hadnt lent unsustainably.
The Judgment was about whether an unfair relationship had developed. This is a different 
question, with some different considerations than whether a loan or series of loans had been 
lent irresponsibly. There might be some overlap between whether a pattern of lending itself 
shows that the lending is unsustainable, and a relationship is unfair. But the court in this 
judgment was considering issues related to short term high cost credit rather than home 
collected credit. I can see Mutual has acknowledged they are different products with different
considerations. And it has repeatedly been keen to distance its products from those of short 
term high cost credit providers. So, I dont think that the Judges conclusions about a
differently structured product can be directly applied here.
And in any event the number of loans is just one aspect of decided whether a lending pattern
is harmful. The loan size, duration of loans, the repayments and other factors need to be
also looked at, as Ive done above.So, whilst I have noted Mutuals submissions on this point, it hasnt introduced any 
arguments which persuade me to change the outcome about this complaint.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Mutual should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Miss W from loan 8, as Im satisfied it ought to 
have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Miss W may have simply left matters there,
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed
between her and this lender which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable 
option, she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that 
was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Miss W in a compliant way at that time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Miss W would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. 
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Mutuals liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right.
Mutual shouldnt have given Miss W loans 8 to 23. If it has sold the outstanding debts Mutual 
should buy these back if its are able to do so and then take the following steps. If Mutual is 
not able to buy the debts back then it should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the 
results outlined below.
A) Mutual should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss W towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything Mutual has already refunded; and
B) Mutual should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss W  
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date she originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled; and
C) Mutual should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Miss W as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans; and
 
If this results in Miss W having made overpayments then Mutual should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the 
overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Mutual should then 
refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should be 
used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus then 
the surplus should be paid to Miss W.
 However, if there is still an outstanding balance then Mutual should try to agree an 
affordable repayment plan with her. 
Mutual shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal Mutual has already 
written-off.
E) The overall pattern of Miss Ws borrowing for loans 8 to 23 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so Mutual should remove these loans entirely from Miss W s credit 
file.
 
Mutual do not have to remove loans 20 to 23 from Miss W s credit file until these have 
been repaid, but Mutual should still remove any adverse information recorded about these 
loans.
*HMRC requires Mutual to take off tax from this interest. If Miss W asks Mutual for a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off, Mutual should provide this.
 
If Mutual intends to use the refund arising from this complaint to reduce an amount Miss W 
owes, it must do this after tax. 
Mutual cannot carry out a set-off unless it owns the debt. 
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Ws complaint in part and Mutual Clothing and Supply 
Company Limited must do as I have directed above  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 May 2021.
