The complaint
Miss C complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money gave misleading 
information about credit card payments. Miss C also complains that 118 118 Money unfairly 
took a manual payment.
What happened
Miss C has a credit card with 118 118 Money. On 12 September 2021, 118 118 Money sent 
Miss C a statement that said she needed to make a payment of £109.77 by 4 October 2021. 
Miss C has told us she used the associated app and found she needed to make a payment 
of around £75. Miss C made a payment of £35 on 28 September 2021 and £50 on 30 
September 2021. 
On 5 October 2021 118 118 Money claimed a further £24.77 from Miss C and she went on 
to raise a complaint. 118 118 Money sent Miss C a final response on 22 October 2021 and 
apologised that a member of staff had given some misleading information. But 118 118 
Money said the additional payment had been correctly claimed as Miss C hadnt made the 
minimum payment by the due date. 
An investigator at this service looked at Miss Cs complaint. They thought 118 118 Money 
had dealt with Miss Cs case fairly. Miss C asked to appeal and said theyd been told 118 
118 Money had a duty of care to give advance intent to charge, in line with industry 
regulations published by the Financial Conduct Authority. Miss C also said 118 118 Moneys 
app was misleading and unfair. As Miss C asked to appeal, her complaint has been passed 
to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss C has told us she made a payment that she thought was in excess of the minimum 
payment due on 4 October 2021. But 118 118 Money sent Miss C a monthly credit card 
statement. That said the payment required by 4 October 2021 was £109.77, but Miss C only 
paid £85 by the due date. 
Ive considered whether the information 118 118 Money sent Miss C about her 4 October 
2021 payment was clear. Miss C has told us she used the app to find her payment figure 
and that it was wrong. But I havent seen anything that shows 118 118 Money told Miss C to 
make a payment of around £75 by 4 October 2021. And the statement that was sent to Miss 
C on 12 September 2021 is clear in explaining what she needed to pay and when. The 
statement said Miss C needed to make a cleared payment of £109.77 by 4 October 2021. 
I think its fair to note the credit card agreement Miss C accepted with 118 118 Money says 
At the end of each month, you will receive a statement which sets out your Minimum 
Payment and the total amount that you owe us, which is the Account Balance The credit 
agreement doesnt say the minimum payment it will charge will solely be set out on the app. I 
appreciate information about the minimum payment is also given in the app, but Im satisfied 
the credit agreement says monthly statements will provide that information. 
The credit agreement also says the card holder consents to 118 118 Money debiting any 
shortfall in the contractual minimum payment by a Continuous Payment Authority (CPA) 
payment. I can see both 118 118 Money and the investigator have quoted the relevant 
section already so I wont do so again. But the credit agreement says shortfalls will normally 
be collected by CPA the day after a minimum payment becomes due. Im satisfied thats 
what 118 118 Money did on 5 October 2021, in line with the credit agreement. 
In response to the investigator, Miss C said 118 118 Money had failed to follow the FCA 
Principles, including acting in integrity and providing clear, fair and not misleading 
information. Im sorry to disappoint Miss C, but I havent been persuaded that 118 118 
Money failed to treat her fairly. And, as Ive noted above, Im satisfied Miss Cs minimum 
payment was clearly set out in the monthly statement issued on 12 September 2021. 
118 118 Money apologised to Miss C as one of its call handlers gave her incorrect 
information about whether the CPA payment it took could be refunded as fraud. 118 118 
Money has apologised for the error and I think thats fair. As there was no element of fraud 
here and the CPA payment was taken in line with the credit agreement, I havent found 118 
118 Money acted unfairly. And whilst I understand the mistake did cause Miss C some 
distress, Im satisfied 118 118 Moneys apology reflects the impact to her and is a fair way to 
resolve her complaint.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 September 2022.
