Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ws complaint  and thought the loans  from loan 3 onwards 
shouldnt have been given as Mr W had loans from other short-term lenders as well as 
MyKredit. They also thought  the pattern of borrowing  indicated  Mr W was reliant on short-
term loans. MyKredit disagreed and said Mr W was repaying his loans on time and in some  
cases earlier. As the complaint couldnt  be resolved informally, it was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
MyKredit needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure      Mr  
Ref: DRN30902192W could repay the loans  in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could consider several 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MyKredit  should fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So, whilst Ive noted MyKredits comments about  the actual payments Mr W paid, I think  that 
it is important for me to start by saying that MyKredit  was required  to establish whether Mr W 
could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments  were affordable  on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think MyKredit needed  to do more  when  it approved loans 1 and 2.     
Mr W didnt respond  directly to the view.  As there appears to no longer be a dispute about  
these loans, I wont be making further findings  on them.
MyKredit says it carried out checks before it lent loan 3 to Mr W and the results of these 
checks didnt raise  any concerns. But as this was Mr Ws third loan in nearly two months, I 
think MyKredit  should have been  looking to build a clearer picture about Mr Ws finances 
before lending him this loan. 
Had MyKredit  carried  out proportionate  checks before lending loan 3, its likely to have found 
that Mr W was borrowing from other short-term lenders. The repayments for these  other 
Ref: DRN30902193loans would have  been increasing his monthly  outgoings by around  £1,500   which  is a 
significant amount.
I dont necessarily agree with MyKredits conclusion that by repaying a loan early this means 
Mr W was managing his money.  Its equally possible that Mr W was juggling his finances by 
borrowing to pay off his short-term loans with MyKredit or other short-term loan providers. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MyKredits  lending history with Mr W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MyKredit should reasonably have seen  that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MyKredit should  have  realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 7. I say 
this because:
At this point MyKredit  ought to have realised  Mr W was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr W had taken out seven loans in four months.  So MyKredit 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr W was having to borrow  further  
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that      
Mr Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ws first loan was for £400 and loan 7 was for double  the amount. At this point 
MyKredit ought  to have known  that it was unlikely Mr W was borrowing to meet  a 
temporary shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need.
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MyKredit.  Loan 21 was 
taken out over 21 months after Mr Ws first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr W had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to MyKredit over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr W lost out because MyKredit continued to provide  borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ws ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
As such,  Im upholding Mr Ws complaint about  loans 3 to 21 and MyKredit  should put things 
right. 
putting things right  what Global Kapital Group Ltd needs to do
If MyKredit  has sold the outstanding debt MyKredit should buy it back if MyKredit is able to 
do so and then take the following steps. If MyKredit  cant buy the debt back, then MyKredit  
should liaise  with the new debt owner to achieve  the results  outlined below.
A) MyKredit should add together the total of the repayments made  by Mr W towards interest,  
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  anything 
MyKredit has already refunded.
Ref: DRN30902194B) MyKredit should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual  payments made by 
Mr W which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr W originally made 
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C) MyKredit  should remove all interest, fees and charges  from the balance  on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr W as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on the outstanding loan. If this results in Mr W having made 
overpayments then MyKredit should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. MyKredit should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on the outstanding loan. If this results in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Mr W. However,  if there is still an outstanding balance 
then MyKredit should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan with Mr W. MyKredit 
shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made  up of principal  MyKredit has already written-off.
E) MyKredit should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ws credit file in relation 
to loans 3 to 6. The overall  pattern of Mr Ws borrowing  for loans  7 to 21 means  any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so MyKredit should remove these loans entirely  
from Mr Ws credit file. MyKredit does  not have to remove the outstanding  loan from Mr Ws 
credit file until it has been repaid, but MyKredit  should still remove  any adverse  information 
recorded about this loan.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires MyKredit to take off tax from this interest.  MyKredit  must  give   
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Global Kapital Group  
Ltd should put things  right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 May 2020.
