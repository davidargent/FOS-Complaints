K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid) irresponsibly  lent to him. 
He wants a refund of the interest he paid and references removed from his credit file.
background
This complaint is about 12 instalment loans provided  to Mr S between  July 2012 and June 
2014. Mr S borrowed continuously from Quick Quid and there  were  no significant gaps in his 
borrowing. 
Details about the 12 instalment loans are given  in this table:

Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ss complaint and thought the loans from a top up provided on 
loan 2 and from that point  onwards shouldnt have  been given. 
Quick Quid disagreed and the complaint was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Quick Quid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. 
Ref: DRN11630942But certain factors might  point to the fact that Quick Quid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Quick Quid was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
The first two loans I am considering here (loan 1 and 2) were  relatively  modest compared to 
the income that Mr S declared to QuickQuid (£200 for loan 1 and £250 for loan 2). So given 
what Mr S needed to repay on this loan and that he was a new customer, I dont think  it 
wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask him for the amount of information that 
would be needed  to show the lending  was unsustainable. 
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr S provided or the information QuickQuid 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying. So I dont  think  QuickQuid was wrong to give these  two loans to Mr S.
Mr S took out a top up on loan 2 on 25/10/12 for £200. I think  at this point,  if Quick  Quid  had 
carried out proportionate checks it would have  seen Mr S wouldnt have been  able to afford 
this top up in addition to the amount he had already borrowed. Combined,  the amount 
borrowed was a significant part of Mr Ss declared income. So I dont think Quick Quid  
should have lent Mr S this top up.
Ref: DRN11630943Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Quick Quids  lending  history with Mr S from Loan 3. I 
think from this point  Quick  Quid should have realised that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further loans.  
I say this because:
By loan 3 Mr S had been borrowing continuously and in quick succession from Quick  
Quid. Mr S had requested 3 loans within a 7 month period and this included a top up.
When Mr S asked  for loan 3, Quick Quid ought to have realised it was more  likely 
than not Mr S had to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was 
leaving in his finances.
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Quick Quid and the 
amounts he tended  to borrow didnt decrease at all. Mr S had paid large  amounts of 
interest to, in effect; service a debt to Quick Quid over an extended period.
I think that Mr S lost out because Quick Quid continued to provide borrowing from loan 3 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing  
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time. 
The sheer number  of loans and top ups was likely to have had negative  implications 
on Mr Ss ability  to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these  
high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Ss complaint regarding the top up taken  on loan 2 and loans 3 to 12 
and Quick Quid should put things  right.
putting things right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on the top up taken on loan 2 along with 
loans 3 to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
take off any negative information  recorded  regarding the top up taken out on loan 2 
on Mr Ss credit file.
the number  of loans taken from loan 3 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 3 to 12 should be removed from   
Mr Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  
CashEuroNet must  give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
Ref: DRN11630944For the reasons  given  above, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Ss 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC should  pay Mr S compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 June  2019.
