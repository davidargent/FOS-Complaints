The complaint
Mr F complains NatWest Bank Plc unnecessarily blocked access to his accounts on two 
occasions.
What happened
Mr F has a current account with NatWest. In March 2020, Mr F was unable to access his 
bank account on two separate occasions. His bank cards were disabled, and his accounts 
disappeared from his online bank account page when he logged on. He phoned NatWest on 
each occasion, and access was immediately rectified. Mr F raised a number of complaints to 
NatWest relating to these access issues.
NatWest partly upheld Mr Fs complaint, agreeing it removed an incorrect account from his 
online banking, that hed received an incorrect message to say a card was no longer valid, 
and that hed experienced a long hold on a call hed made reporting the problems. NatWest 
offered Mr F compensation of £70, plus just over £10 towards phone costs incurred.
However, NatWest didnt uphold Mr Fs complaints about numerous restrictions having been 
placed on his cards previously, or theyd recorded an incorrect card as being missing.  
Unhappy with this, Mr F brought his complaints to us - he remained unhappy NatWest twice 
put a stop on his accounts, including his debit card not being valid on a particular contactless 
payment system, and about the length of time hed been placed on hold. He also thought 
£80 compensation doesnt properly reflect the anguish and stress experienced. He says he 
lost a lot of time trying to deal with the issues and wants compensation to properly reflect the 
distress he experienced. 
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Fs complaints. He agreed NatWest made some errors, 
acknowledging theyd admitted these and apologised for them, but felt the compensation 
offered was fair. And he felt NatWest had acted quickly in reinstating Mr Fs cards/accounts. 
Mr F was unhappy with our investigators conclusions and asked for an ombudsman to 
review his complaint, so its been passed to me to consider. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
And having done so, I wont be upholding Mr Fs complaint. Ill explain why. But first, I want 
to acknowledge that Mr F has responded to our investigator in some level of detail. I want to 
reassure Mr F that Ive read everything hes said in his exchanges with our investigator after 
hed sent his view. But I wont respond to every point hes made. I hope he realises I mean 
no disrespect by this, it simply reflects the informal nature of our service. 
Instead, Im going to focus on what I consider to be the key complaint issues here  how 
much Mr F was inconvenienced by NatWest when his cards and accounts were blocked or 
disappeared from his online banking, and whether the compensation they offered was fair. 
I appreciate it must have been frustrating that Mr F experienced having his accounts 
disappear on two occasions within one week. NatWest have admitted they made a mistake 
here, and they have apologised. Ive looked at the evidence on file, and agree that there 
were errors made that caused the wrong account to be blocked. However, having listened 
to the calls Mr F had with NatWest at the time, Im also satisfied NatWests agents acted 
quickly to ensure Mr Fs accounts were reactivated  they were back online and visible 
within the hour.  
I appreciate Mr F remains unhappy with NatWests offer of compensation. He says he spent 
a number of hours trying to deal with the issue, and he thinks the compensation amount 
should be greater. However, I disagree. 
When assessing whether to award compensation, I need to consider the effect of NatWests 
actions, and the distress their actions may have caused. I do accept phoning them about two 
issues in such a short space of time would have been inconvenient  Ive listened to the calls 
and have heard that Mr F was frustrated at times, although they only appear to add up to in 
the region of one hour. 
However, NatWest have already taken the length of these, and the time Mr F spent on hold, 
into account when making their previous compensation offer. Further, I havent seen 
anything to suggest that Mr F lost out financially as a result of having to make these phone 
calls  no loss of pay in other words  other than the cost of the phone calls, and this is 
included in NatWests compensation offer.  
Having considered the above, I think the amount of compensation NatWest have offered to 
Mr F for the distress and inconvenience he experienced is fair  its certainly in the region of 
the amount Id be looking to award had the offer not already been made. 
So, overall, I think NatWests offer of £70, plus just over £10 of phone cost reimbursement is 
fair and Im not going to ask it to do anything further. If Mr F wishes to accept this, he can 
contact our investigator who will ask NatWest to make this payment. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint. I leave it to Mr F to decide 
whether he wishes to accept NatWest Bank plcs offer of just over £80 compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2021.
