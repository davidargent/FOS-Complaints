The complaint
Mrs S complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) incorrectly declined to 
pursue a refund she tried to make through them.
What happened
Mrs S purchased a mobile phone from an online marketplace in December 2020. She paid 
around Â£120 for it using PayPal as a payment method.
Mrs S says her mobile phone wasnt working correctly. A few months later, Mrs S requested 
a full refund from PayPal, after exhausting an attempt of a refund from the online 
marketplace.
PayPal declined giving a refund to Mrs S by relying on its terms and conditions. Mrs S, 
unhappy with PayPals response, referred the complaint to our service.
Our investigator explained that he is only able to consider whether PayPal acted fairly within 
their own terms and conditions, as they didnt directly sell the mobile phone to Mrs S. He 
found that to be eligible for PayPals buyer protection, Mrs S needed to open a dispute with 
them within 180 days of the date she made payment for the phone. As Mrs S opened a 
dispute with PayPal after 180 days of making payment, the investigator believes PayPal has 
acted within their terms to deny her claim.
Mrs S asked for her complaint to be referred to an ombudsman and so it has been passed to 
me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding this complaint and Ill explain why below.
PayPals terms say that:
When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a 
refund under PayPal Buyer Protection. When applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection entitles 
you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs 
you paid, if any.
It also goes on to say, among other things, that to be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection, 
you must open a dispute with them within 180 days of the date you sent the payment and 
then follow their online dispute resolution process. If their process isnt followed, PayPal say 
a claim may be denied.
Mrs S made payment for her mobile phone on 6 December 2020. She then raised a formal 
dispute with PayPal on 25 July 2021, around 232 days later. Mrs S says she contacted 
PayPal earlier than 25 July 2021, and it was shortly after she received a response from the 
online marketplace regarding her refund request. Considering Mrs S contacted the online 
marketplace and received a response from them on 7 June 2021, it is likely the earliest she 
would have then got in touch with PayPal would have been around 184 days after the date 
she made payment. So its likely Mrs S raised her dispute to PayPal outside of the 180 day 
time limit they state in their terms to be eligible for their buyer protection.
Its unfortunate Mrs S brought her dispute to PayPal too late, but under the circumstances, I 
dont consider PayPal to have acted unfairly in declining Mrs S refund request.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 February 2022.
