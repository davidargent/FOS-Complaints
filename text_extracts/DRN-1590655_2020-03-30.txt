The complaint
Mrs S says Lloyds Bank PLC mis-sold her a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy. 
What happened
Mrs S bought the policy in 1998 at the same time as taking out a credit card. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Mrs S disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Ss case.
Ive decided not to uphold Mrs Ss complaint for the following reasons.
Mrs S ticked a box on her credit card application form to indicate she wanted PPI. So, I think 
Lloyds made Mrs S aware that she had a choice about buying the PPI, and that she chose to 
take it. 
Ive assumed that Lloyds recommended the PPI to Mrs S. It seems to have been right for her 
based on what Ive seen of her circumstances at the time. 
Its possible the information Lloyds gave Mrs S about the PPI wasnt as clear as it shouldve 
been. But Mrs S doesnt appear to have been affected by any of the main things the policy 
didnt cover  and based on what I know about her circumstances it looks like the policy 
couldve been useful to her. So I dont think better information wouldve stopped her buying 
it. 
Given the dates the credit card account was open, the regulator's rules on high levels of 
commission and profit share dont apply. So I don't think Lloyds needs to refund any of the 
commission or profit share it received.
Ive taken into account Mrs Ss comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 April 2020.
