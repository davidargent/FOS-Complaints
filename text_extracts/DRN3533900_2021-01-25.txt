K821x#15complaint
Miss T has complained that Madison CF UK Limited  trading as 118 118 Money lent to her 
irresponsibly.
background
Miss T was given a loan of £3,000 by 118 118 Money in June 2016.  The loan was due to be 
repaid in 24 monthly instalments of around  £303.  The total amount payable, including 
interest was just over £7,289. I understand the loan may still be outstanding. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint. He thought 118 118 Money ought not to 
have provided  the loan to Miss T and he asked the lender to put things right.  Ive not seen a 
response from 118 118 Money  to the adjudicators assessment . So, as the complaint hasnt 
been settled, it has been passed to me to resolve the matter.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to considering unaffordable and irresponsible  lending complaints  
on our website - including the key relevant rules, guidance, good  industry  practice and law. 
And Ive considered this approach when deciding Miss Ts complaint.
I think there are some overarching  questions  I need to consider in order  to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint:
Did 118 118 Money complete  reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself 
that Miss T would  be able to repay her loan in a sustainable way?  If not, what would 
reasonable and proportionate checks have shown at the time?
Ultimately,  did 118 118 Money  make  a fair lending  decision? 
Did 118 118 Money act unfairly  or unreasonably in some  other  way?
118 118 Money needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend to Miss T 
irresponsibly. The lender  was required to carry out a borrower  focussed  assessment or 
affordability check. The checks had to be borrower focussed  so 118 118 Money  had to 
think about whether  repaying the loan sustainably would cause difficulties or adverse 
consequences for Miss T. 
118 118 Money had to carry  out reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy  itself that 
Miss T would be able repay her loan sustainably. There was no set list of checks that 118 
118 Money had to do, but it could  take into account  a number of different things such  as the 
loan amount, the length of the loan term, the repayment amounts, and the borrowers  overall 
financial circumstances.
I think that a reasonable and proportionate  check ought generally  to have been more  
thorough:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
Ref: DRN35339002the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the longer  the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit  is 
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make  payments for an extended  
period).
There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed  a proportionate check 
should have been for any application  including  (but not limited to) any indications of 
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in future circumstances. Ive kept all of 
this in mind when thinking about  whether 118 118 Money did what  it needed to before 
agreeing to lend to Miss T.
118 118 Money says that Miss T applied for her loan via its website. 118 118 Money asked 
Miss T for information about  her income  and expenditure and it acquired a credit report. 118 
118 Money assessed  that the loan was affordable for Miss T.  
But I dont think that 118 118 Money made  a fair lending decision on this occasion and I will 
explain why.
118 118 Money was required to establish  whether Miss T could sustainably  repay  her loan  
not just whether the loan payments were  affordable  on a strict pounds  and pence 
calculation. The loan payments being affordable  on this basis might  be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't  automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Miss T declared  her monthly income  as £1,000. Her monthly  loan repayments  of £303 meant 
she would  have been paying over 30% of her income to repay  the loan from 118 118 Money.  
The FLA Lending  Code 2006 says that factors which may show a high risk of a consumer  
experiencing financial difficulty include spending  more than 25% of monthly  income on 
credit. 
I accept that the credit  report acquired  by 118 118 Money showed  that Miss Ts overall 
indebtedness was relatively low. She had declared  a low level of regular expenditure and 
was living  with her parents. But I think 118 118 Money ought reasonably to have queried  the 
level of Miss Ts living expenses and considered whether they would remain at this low level 
throughout the loan term. This was an expensive loan, repayable over an extended loan 
term and Miss T would have to commit over 30% - a significant proportion  - of her monthly 
income to repay her loan to 118 118 Money. 
I havent seen  anything which makes me think that 118 118 Money  queried  with Miss T 
whether she would have any difficulties committing such a significant proportion  of her 
income to repay her loan, every month for the next two years. Overall, I think 118 118 Money 
ought reasonably  to have realised that Miss T might  struggle to repay the loan in a 
sustainable manner.  So I dont think 118 118 Money ought reasonably to have concluded 
that it would  be right to provide the loan to Miss T, in her circumstances.
Ref: DRN35339003I dont think 118 118 Money treated Miss T unfairly  in some other way. But taking  everything  
into account, I dont  think it should  have agreed  to provide the loan to her. So, I uphold Miss 
Ts complaint and 118 118 Money  needs  to put things  right.
Putting things  right 
I think it is fair and reasonable for Miss T to repay  the principal amount that she borrowed,  
because she had the benefit of that lending. But she has paid interest  and charges on a loan 
that shouldnt  have been provided to her. 
I understand Miss Ts loan might still be outstanding. 118 118 Money should try to agree an 
affordable repayment  arrangement with Miss T in respect of any outstanding  balance - 
bearing in mind the need to treat her positively and sympathetically in those  discussions.
If 118 118 Money has sold the outstanding  debt it should  buy it back, if its able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If 118 118 Money  isnt able to buy the debt back, then it should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
118 118 Money should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges  on the loan and treat all the payments 
Miss T made  as payments towards  the capital. 
If reworking Miss Ts loan account  results in her having effectively made 
payments above the original capital borrowed, then 118 118 Money  should  
refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated  on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date 
the complaint  is settled*. 
If an outstanding balance remains, then 118 118 Money should try to agree an 
affordable repayment plan with her.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Ts credit file in relation to the 
loan. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money  to deduct tax from this interest.  118 118 
Money should give Miss T a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if she asks for 
one.
Ref: DRN35339004my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I uphold this complaint  and direct Madison CF UK Limited 
trading as 118 118 Money to put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 February  2021.
