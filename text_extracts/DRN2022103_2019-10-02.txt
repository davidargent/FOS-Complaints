K821x#15complaint
Miss B complains  that Uncle Buck Finance  LLP gave her loans that she couldnt afford to 
repay. She asks that it refunds interest  and charges.
background
Miss B took out 13 loans with Uncle  Buck between  January 2014 and August 2017. She 
says the loan repayments werent affordable. Miss B says Uncle  Buck was irresponsible to 
offer the loans  when she had a poor credit score  and a county court judgement  (CCJ) 
recorded on her credit  file.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld. She said it wasnt wrong 
for Uncle Buck to offer loans 1 to 3. But by loan 4 Miss Bs borrowing pattern suggested she 
was reliant on short  term loans. 
Uncle Buck  didnt agree. Uncle Buck said just because a customer  re-borrows  doesnt mean 
the loans are unaffordable  or they are reliant  on short  term loans in a negative way. The 
customer might have  income fluctuations and unexpected expenses. It said Miss Bs 
borrowing didnt increase after loan 5. Uncle Buck said there was a gap of more  than a year 
between loans 8 and 9 and other gaps between the later loans which  suggested Miss B 
wasnt reliant on them. 
Uncle Buck  said it had made errors  in its final response  letter and refund calculations which 
had made  is less likely Miss B would have accepted its offer.  It confirmed its offer to refund 
interest and charges on loans 4 to 8 which it calculates as £586.74. It said it would  offset this 
against the outstanding  balance on Miss Bs account and refund the difference, to which  it 
would add 8% interest. 
The complaint was passed  to me. I didnt  agree  with all of the adjudicators findings. So I 
sent a provisional  decision  to Miss B and Uncle Buck to explain why I intended to come to a 
different outcome to the adjudicator. Uncle Buck didnt respond and Miss B said she had no 
further information or comments. My findings and decision below are substantially  the same  
as set out in my provisional decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
Miss Bs income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.

*the dates  these loans  were repaid  isnt clear from the information provided.  I cant  see 
anything to suggest they werent paid when due. 
**this seems to be the due date for the first instalment, its unclear if the whole loan was 
repaid on this date.
Loans 1 to 3 (January to March 2014)
When Miss B applied for loan 1 she told Uncle Buck her monthly income  was about £2,050.  
Given Miss Bs stated income, the amounts of loans  1 and 2 and that this was the start of the 
lending relationship, I dont think Uncle Buck needed  to ask Miss B for information about  her 
expenditure. I dont  think it was unreasonable for it to offer loans 1 and 2. 
The amount  of loan 3 was significantly more than loans 1 and 2. I think  Uncle  Buck should 
have done more to check it was affordable. But, at this point, I dont think proportionate 
checks would have  given  it any reason  to think the loans werent affordable or that further  
checks were needed.
Loans 4 to 8 (June to October 2014)
Uncle Buck  has offered  to refund interest and charges on loans 4 to 8 with 8% interest. As 
this is what Id require  if I found it shouldnt have  offered these loans, I dont need  to say 
more about these loans here. 
Loans 9 to 13 (October 2015 to August 2017)  
Based on the evidence  provided by Uncle Buck, there was a break of about a year between 
Miss B repaying loan 8 and taking out loan 9. I think  this is sufficiently long for Uncle Buck  
reasonably to believe that any problems  Miss B had  such  as reliance on short  term loans 
or in managing her money  had been  resolved.
When she asked for loans 9 to 13 Miss B told Uncle  Buck her monthly income was £2,145 
and her outgoings were  between  about £1,200 to £1,500. 
Ref: DRN20221033Miss B took out loans  9 to 13 over about two years. But, while  Miss B borrowed over an 
extended period,  the gaps between the loans were such  that she spent  more  time without a 
loan than with a loan. She repaid loan 11 in July and asked for loan 12 in December 2016. 
There was a similar gap between loans  12 and 13. 
Miss B says she had county court judgements  (CCJs)  recorded  on her credit files. Uncle 
Buck provided the results  of its credit checks.  If Miss B had CCJs, I dont l think  Uncle  Buck 
was aware of this. It was aware that she had other loan commitments and that she had a 
default recorded on her credit file in mid 2017, before she took out loan 13. Uncle  Bucks 
records say that Miss B told it her partner paid the mortgage. Its records  say her monthly 
payments for credit card and store card accounts had reduced. 
I dont think, based on the information  it had and Miss Bs borrowing pattern, Uncle Buck  
should have known shed have difficulty meeting the repayments for loans 9 to 13 in a 
sustainable manner.   
what should happen now?
Uncle Buck  has offered  to refund interest and charges on loans 4 to 8. Uncle Buck  should:
refund  all interest and charges Miss B paid on loans 4 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove all information about loans 4 to 8 from Miss Bs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Miss B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that Uncle Buck Finance  LLP should  pay the redress  and take the steps set 
out above, as its offered to do.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 November  2019.
