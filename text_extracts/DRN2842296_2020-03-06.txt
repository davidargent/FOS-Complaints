Our adjudicator reviewed  the case and partially  upheld Miss Ss complaint and thought the 
loans from loan five onwards  shouldnt have been given. And that from loan six onwards all 
information about loans six to 17 was adverse  so all records of them should be removed 
from Miss Ss credit file. 
Sunny didn't  agree with the adjudicator. But in response to the adjudicator it asked for its 
latest offer to be put to Miss S, which  was to uphold the complaint from loan ten. This offer 
was passed on to Miss S, but she asked for her complaint to be referred to an ombudsman.
And as the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role 
as ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN28422962Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss S could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Miss S didnt comment on the adjudicators  opinion  that loans one to four shouldnt  be 
upheld. Because  of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision  about this lending.  But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Miss S had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ss complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan five would most likely  have 
shown that Miss S was struggling to manage her finances:
I say this because  when loan five was taken in August 2017 she still had loans two, 
three and four running which  increased her monthly repayments.
Ref: DRN28422963Miss S took loan five within two weeks of loan four which was a new pattern of 
behaviour. This could  have been an indication that Miss S was returning quickly  for 
additional borrowing  because  she was struggling  with her finances and was 
borrowing more to finance the debt she already  had with Sunny. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ss case, like the adjudicator I think that this point 
was reached by loan six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss S was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss S had been  indebted to Sunny for eight months  and indebted 
the whole  time. So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Miss S 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying her previous loans was 
leaving in her finances and that Miss Ss indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably. 
She was becoming  reliant upon  the borrowing.
From  loan six onwards Miss S was provided  with a new loan within  days or weeks of 
settling a previous  one. As an example, loan eight was taken the same day that loan 
three was repaid.  And, Miss S was repaying  some of her loans early.  While I 
appreciate this would have  saved  Miss S interest  charges, it could equally have been  
an indication that Miss S was borrowing further to pay off debts already held. 
Miss S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. I appreciate  
the amounts borrowed fluctuated, but Miss S had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.  And Miss S was continuing 
to borrow repeatedly in the same month.  In November 2017 Miss S took two loans 
totalling £350 and this amount significantly increased to £800 in December when she 
took three loans.  
I think that Miss S lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ss indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Miss S borrowed  17 loans 
in 17 monthly  was likely to have had negative implications on Miss Ss ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loan five onwards and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss S paid on loans five onwards;
Ref: DRN28422964pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about five from Miss Ss credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  six to 17 should  be removed from 
Miss Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss S a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ss complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 April 2020.
