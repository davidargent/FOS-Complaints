K821x#15complaint
Mr A complained about the delay  in receiving his compensation caused  by 
National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest)  following the mis-selling  of payment protection 
insurance (PPI)  policies,  attached to several  loans. Mr A wants  NatWest  to pay him 
additional compensation for its poor handling  of his complaint.
background
I issued my provisional decision on 16 May 2019.  A copy of my provisional  decision is 
attached and forms part of my final decision. My provisional decision sets out the 
background to this complaint. 
It explained why I provisionally thought NatWests offer of £100  for the inconvenience  
caused to Mr A wasnt fair. NatWest explained  it could have made the compensation 
payments to Mr A sooner  and it could have made the payments directly.  I was of the 
provisional opinion  that had this happened, Mr A, because of his financial circumstances, 
wouldnt have had to lose out by paying a percentage  to a third party to cash his cheques  
with a same  day service.
Because of this my provisional opinion to put things  right was for NatWest to pay Mr A £200. 
This was to ensure Mr A hadnt lost out, and for the trouble and inconvenience he had been 
put to by NatWest.
Both parties  confirmed they received my provisional decision. 
NatWest agreed that £200 instead of the £100 it initially offered was fair. 
Mr A responded agreeing that £200  was fair for the inconvenience he had been put to and 
for NatWests poor handling of his complaint. But Mr A thought the £200 should be in 
addition to the percentage he had to pay a third party to cash  his cheques  with a same  day 
service. Mr A says the percentage he had to pay the third party  to cash his cheques  was 
10%.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I am of the opinion  that the £200 I recommended  within  my provisional 
decision is fair.
Mr A thinks  that £200 for NatWests handling  of his complaint  is fair, but wants an additional 
amount to cover the fee he incurred by having  to use a third party  to cash his cheques.
Within my provisional decision I carefully considered  what had happened and how it had 
impacted Mr A. 
I was of the opinion that Mr A had lost out by having to cash his cheques  using a same day 
service and incurring  a 10% fee. Because of Mr As financial  constraints at the time, I was of 
the opinion that he didnt  have much of a choice and needed the compensation instantly.  
Had NatWest paid him directly and sooner,  then Mr A wouldnt have had to cash his 
cheques using a third party.
Ref: DRN92029212That is why I thought NatWests offer of £100 wasnt fair. The £100  didnt  cover  the fee Mr A 
incurred having  to cash his cheques. So I thought Mr A was out of pocket. But looking at the 
amount Mr A roughly paid to cash his cheques (10% each time), I was of the opinion  that 
£200 ensured that Mr A hadnt  lost out. And the remainder of the £200 award was for the 
inconvenience Mr A had been  put to by NatWest unnecessarily, which  included  the calls 
Mr A had to make  chasing his compensation.
While I understand Mr A feels strongly that he was let down by NatWest,  I am of the opinion, 
for the reasons given above that £200 is fair compensation  in the circumstances.
my final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc could have done more  for Mr A. 
National Westminster Bank Plc could  have paid Mr As PPI compensation payments sooner. 
And National Westminster Bank  Plc could have also paid Mr As compensation directly to 
Mr As nominated bank  account in light of his circumstances.
To ensure Mr A hasnt lost out, and for the trouble and inconvenience Mr A has been  put to, 
National Westminster Bank Plc should  pay Mr A £200 as compensation  for its poor handling 
of Mr As request regarding the payment of the PPI compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 June  2019.

complaint
Mr A is complaining about the delay in receiving his compensation caused by National Westminster 
Bank Plc (NatWest)  following the mis-selling  of payment protection insurance (PPI) policies, 
attached to several  loans. Mr A wants NatWest  to pay him additional compensation  for its poor 
handling of his complaint.
background
In 2018 Mr A complained  to NatWest about the sale of several PPI policies.  NatWest upheld Mr As 
PPI complaint. To put things right NatWest, on 21 August 2018,  offered to place Mr A in a position  
as if he hadnt been sold PPI. 
There were  delays in NatWest making the payments to Mr A. 
Unhappy with NatWest, and having  not received his compensation, Mr A brought  his complaint to 
our service.
Mr A wanted  additional compensation to take into account the trouble  and inconvenience NatWest 
caused him for not paying the compensation promptly. Mr A says he was in financial difficulty  and 
had made  that clear  to NatWest on the acceptance forms that he had signed  and returned to 
NatWest.
NatWest, while the complaint was with our service,  reviewed  its handling  of Mr As complaint and 
offered £100  for its errors. 
Our adjudicator thought NatWests offer of £100 for the inconvenience caused was fair. Mr A 
disagreed with the adjudicator. 
As the complaint hasnt been resolved, its been  passed to me for a final decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive provisionally considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont  think NatWests offer of £100 for the inconvenience caused is fair. Ill explain 
why.
On 21 August 2018, NatWest wrote  out to Mr A on each  of his three loans that had PPI. With each 
letter, Mr A was provided with an acceptance form for each offer of compensation. 
There was some contact  between  Mr A and NatWest about the offers and then on 18 September 
2018 Mr A signed to accept the offers. On each acceptance form Mr A provided his bank account 
number (held with another bank) and added a written statement explaining that he was experiencing  
financial hardship  and required the refund urgently. 
NatWest received Mr As signed acceptance forms on 21 September 2018 and sent Mr A a text 
message explaining that payment(s) should  be issued by 19 October 2018.
Ref: DRN92029214Mr A contacted NatWest several times prior to 19 October 2018.  The first call was to see if the 
payment could be made to another bank account other than the one he had indicated on the 
acceptance form. The second call was to chase up the compensation payments. Mr A was told that 
there were delays  and it was likely  to be longer than the 28 days  he had been advised  by text 
message. During this call Mr A was also informed  that if he provided evidence of any priority debts his 
compensation payment  may be prioritised. 
On 19 October 2018 Mr A called NatWest again to chase the payment(s). A cheque was sent for one 
of the compensation amounts. I note this was cashed  by Mr A on 5 November 2018.
On 22 October 2018 NatWest sent Mr A a text message  explaining that the PPI compensation for one 
of his loans was to be delayed  with payment being made by 19 November  2018.  The PPI 
compensation for this loan was sent to Mr A by cheque on 26 October  2018.
Mr A had, in the meantime, sent NatWest some documentation  which was received by NatWest on 26 
October 2018. This included a medical  report which  among other things,  confirmed Mr As current  
situation, his financial hardship and the reasons for it. 
The PPI compensation for Mr As final loan was subsequently sent by cheque to Mr A on 29 October  
2018.
Mr A explained to this service on 15 November  2018 that he had received the last two cheques  and 
had cashed them.
Mr A feels that NatWest  didnt take into account his financial  difficulties and should have made the 
payment sooner and paid him directly to the bank account he had listed  on the acceptance forms.  
NatWest on reviewing Mr As complaint explained to our service that it could have done more for Mr 
A. It explained that because Mr A had written  on the acceptance  form that he was in financial 
hardship, it should have referred this to its customer  care team to see what could  be done for Mr A. 
This wasnt done and was only picked  up by NatWest with Mr As call on 18 October  2018.  
NatWest also explained that given Mr As circumstances,  although its standard procedure is to issue 
compensation to its consumers via cheques,  in Mr As situation  it could  have done more.  It said it 
could have actioned Mr As request to make payment  direct  to the bank account he had wanted the 
compensation paid to.
In light of its handling  of Mr As PPI compensation, NatWest has admitted it could have done more  for 
Mr A. And to recognise  this it has offered Mr A an additional compensation  amount of £100. 
Mr A says he wants £100 compensation for each of the three  accounts  he was offered PPI 
compensation on. Mr A also says he had to pay a third party  10% of each compensation amount, 
when he cashed  the three cheques.
Having carefully considered Mr As complaint  and circumstances I can see that he was in financial 
difficulty and it was clear  to see that he needed the compensation urgently. This is why Mr A was so 
proactive in contacting NatWest about the compensation. And this is why Mr A also cashed his 
cheques, not through the bank  but through a third party that cashed cheques  with a same day 
service  at a cost.
NatWest say it could have  picked up on Mr As financial difficulty  and referred him to its customer care 
team earlier when it received  his acceptance forms. NatWest also say it could have paid Mr A directly  
to the bank  account he had advised of on the acceptance form.
So I need to consider  what impact NatWests  actions have had on Mr A and whether NatWests 
additional offer of compensation of £100 is sufficient to put that right.
Ref: DRN92029215Having done so, I dont  think NatWests offer is a fair amount and I think  Mr A has lost out as a result  
of NatWests poor handling.
Mr A had requested  the payment be made direct to his bank  account, urgently. And I think  this is 
because Mr A, was clearly going through an extremely difficult time (which NatWest are aware of), 
and needed the money instantly. This is why Mr A wrote on the acceptance form initially.
So NatWest, as it has now explained, could have made the compensation  payments sooner, and 
could have made the payments directly.  I think had this happened, Mr A wouldnt have had to lose out 
by paying a percentage to a third party  to cash his cheques  with a same day service.
All things considered I am of the opinion,  to ensure  Mr A hasnt lost out, and for the trouble and 
inconvenience he has been put to by NatWest, NatWest should pay Mr A £200. This £200  is 
compensation for its poor handling and failure  to do what it now says it could have  done for Mr A and 
his request regarding the payment of the PPI compensation.
my provisional  decision
Taking account of everything Ive seen  so far, I am of the provisional opinion that 
National Westminster Bank Plc could  have  done  more for Mr A. 
National Westminster Bank Plc could  have  paid Mr As PPI compensation  payments sooner. And 
National Westminster Bank Plc could  have  also paid Mr As compensation  directly  to Mr As 
nominated bank account  in light of his circumstances.
To ensure  Mr A hasnt lost out, and for the trouble and inconvenience Mr A has been put to, National 
Westminster Bank  Plc should pay Mr A £200 as compensation for its poor handling  of Mr As request 
regarding the payment of the PPI compensation.
I invite both parties to respond by 16 June 2019. I will then consider any further information I receive 
and look to issue  my final decision.
