The complaint
Mr F complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie, SCA have closed his account and withheld his 
funds.
What happened
In November 2020, Mr F said he made a chip and pin transaction sale with the buyer present 
for a designer watch costing £4,500. But when he tried to transfer some of these funds from 
his PayPal account to his bank account, the transfer was blocked by PayPal. They told him 
hed have to wait for 180 days for the funds to be released to him. He complained to PayPal.
PayPal said Mr Fs account was closed as they deemed it to be in violation of their 
Acceptable Use Policy. The money held in the account was held back for 180 days to allow 
for any refunds that needed to be made should the buyers question the transactions. They 
also said that sellers who violated their Acceptable Use Policy could be held liable for 
damages to the amount of $2,500 per violation. And as Mr F hadnt been able to provide 
receipts showing the authenticity of the goods he sold they hadnt released the funds back 
to him. 
Mr F wasnt happy with PayPals response, he said the buyer was present for the sale of the 
designer watch. He said hed only had one request for a refund and that customer had 
changed their mind and accepted the goods. He said hed sent the receipts to PayPal as 
theyd requested. He referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator said PayPal had applied their terms and conditions fairly and didnt uphold 
the complaint. 
Mr F didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
Mr Fs PayPal account was created in February 2020. The account was set up according to 
PayPals records for the sale of used cars and car parts. They said when Mr F created his 
PayPal account, he was required to tick a box accepting the PayPal User Agreement. 
PayPals User Agreement says in part:
In connection with your use of our websites, your PayPal account, the PayPal services, or in 
the course of your interactions with PayPal, other PayPal customers, or third parties, you 
must not:
Breach this user agreement, the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy, the Commercial 
Entity Agreements (if they apply to you), or any other agreement between you and 
us.
Sell counterfeit goods
And goes on to outline the actions PayPal will take if Mr F had engaged in any of these 
activities, this included but wasnt limited to:
..Terminate this user agreement at anytime in our sole discretion, limit your 
account, and/or close or suspend your account, immediately and without penalty 
to us.
Refuse to provide the PayPal services to you in the future.
At any time and without liability, suspend, limit or terminate your access to our 
websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide 
any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf, your PayPal account 
or any of the PayPal services, including limiting your ability to pay or send money 
with any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account, restricting your 
ability to send money or make withdrawals.
Hold your money to the extent and for so long as reasonably needed to protect 
against the risk of liability..
Block your PayPal account and/or hold any funds in the reserve account 
(including, without limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by PayPal, 
where PayPal's rights arise from your engagement in the restricted activity).
After June 2020 PayPal said they noted that the account was being used for the sale of auto 
parts, Air pods and designer shoes and trainers. In November 2020 Mr F sold a designer 
watch for £4,500. PayPal said on review of Mr Fs account they saw evidence of negative 
feedback referring to counterfeit products. And they considered some of the branded 
products being sold by Mr F were under-priced. They asked Mr F to provide receipts for the 
items he was selling to authenticate them as being genuine products. 
I can see Mr F has sent to PayPal the invoice for the sale he made of the designer watch. 
But I havent seen evidence of a receipt or provenance as to how Mr F acquired the watch 
himself to authenticate its a genuine product. PayPal have also shown evidence of designer 
shoes and trainers being sold by Mr F, again I havent seen any evidence of Mr F 
authenticating these as genuine products.
Where the conduct of an account causes Paypal concerns about risks that may have been 
caused, theyve said they will take steps to protect their legitimate business interests. So, I 
dont believe that PayPals actions are unfair or unreasonable as though no claims have yet 
arisen against Mr Fs account  that doesnt mean there is no future risk. And Mr F hasnt 
provided evidence to show the products sold are genuine so there remains the risk that the 
products could be considered to be counterfeit.
Mr F said he hadnt been given any notice of the actions PayPal would take. PayPals user
agreement says they will normally give advance notice of suspension. But the agreement 
also allows PayPal to take that action without prior notice if they determine the account 
holder is in breach of the agreement. Im satisfied the terms of the agreement allowed 
PayPal to take the action they did without advance notice. And I dont think its unreasonable 
that PayPal should be able to do so  where they need to protect their legitimate business 
interests.I know Mr F will be disappointed with my decision, but I cant say PayPal has acted unfairly 
or unreasonably in applying the terms of the agreement theyd with Mr F.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 August 2022.
