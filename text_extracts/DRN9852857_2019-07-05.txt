K821x#15complaint
Ms S complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid)  made  short-term  lending 
to her when  it shouldnt have.
background
In 2014 Quick Quid granted open-ended credit (flex credit) to Ms S. We have referred  to that 
as loan 1, under which there were 14 drawdowns. In 2015  and 2016 Quick Quid  granted  4 
payday loans  to Ms S. We have referred to them as loans 2, 3, 4 and 5. Loans 2 and 4 were  
each topped-up  before  Ms S repaid them.
Ms S repaid all the lending by 2017. In 2018  she complained that Quick  Quid  hadnt  properly 
checked that she could afford repayment   which  she says she couldnt.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in part. She didnt think 
that Quick Quid shouldve given Ms S some  of the loans it gave her. The adjudicator 
recommended that Quick  Quid should:
1.refund  all interest and charges that Ms S paid on the loans from 11 September 2014 
to 24 April 2015;
2.pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
3.remove any entries about those loans from Ms Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick  Quid to take off tax from this interest. Quick 
Quid must give Ms S a certificate  showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for 
one. If Quick Quid intends to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital 
balance, it must do so after deducting the tax.
Quick Quid disagreed with the investigators opinion. It asked for an ombudsman to review 
the complaint.  It says,  in summary,  that:
It lent responsibly to Ms S.
Ms S didn't exhibit signs of financial difficulty as she didn't incur  any late fees.
Its open-ended credit agreement wasnt a short-term lending  agreement.
Under CONC 5.2.1R, a lender must make a creditworthiness assessment before 
making a regulated  credit agreement. 
CONC 6.2.1R then provides the additional  requirement that before significantly 
increasing a credit  limit for running-account  credit  under  a regulated credit agreement 
the lender must  undertake an assessment of the customer's creditworthiness.  With 
open line of credit  lending, there are no rules set forth by business practices that say 
Ref: DRN98528572what's considered  frequent borrowing, especially if the repayments are being made 
without incident.  
This was Ms S's first loan with Quick  Quid, so it never had any lending  history to rely 
on prior to this. 
The credit  check results  showed nothing to suggest it shouldn't have lent to her. 
However, to amicably resolve Ms S's complaint,  Quick Quid  will agree  to adhere to 
our recommendation to refund all interest  and fees made on the FlexCredit  loan after 
the 11 September 2014 draw down  as follows: 
 Contractual interest and/or charges £79.01
 Interest at 8% simple  £28.05
 20% tax withholding on interest £5.61
 Amount paid to the consumer £101.45
For the payday loans, it has now attached the entire lending process including all the 
checks prior to lending, the screenshots of customer applications as well as the 
sample acknowledgement from the contract  that customers have to check  when their 
repayment amount  is greater than their estimated  disposable  income. 
There was a substantial breaking period of 87 days  after the successful repayment of 
the FlexCredit loan.
From  loan 2 to loan 3 the loan amount decreased by 83%.
Loans 2 & 3 were repaid without incident. 
These factors exhibits  a clear lack of loan dependency/debt spiralling. So we 
shouldnt uphold  loans  2 & 3. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority (from  1 April 2014)
The FCA Principles for Business  (PRIN) .1.1 R (6) says:
A firm must pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.
The Consumer Credit  sourcebook (CONC)  Section 5.2.1R(2) set out what a lender needed  
to do before agreeing to give a consumer  a loan of this type.  It said a firm must consider:
Ref: DRN98528573(a) the potential  for the commitments  under the regulated credit agreement  to adversely 
impact the customers financial situation, taking into account the information  of which  the firm 
is aware at the time the regulated credit  agreement is to be made; and
(b) the ability of the customer to make repayments as they fall due over the life of the 
regulated credit agreement, or for such an agreement which is an open-end agreement, to 
make repayments within  a reasonable period.
CONC also included guidance about proportionality of assessments. CONC 5.2.4G(2) said:
A firm should consider  what  is appropriate  in any particular circumstances dependent  on, for 
example, the type and amount of credit  being  sought and the potential  risks to the customer.  
The risk of credit not being sustainable directly  relates to the amount of credit  granted and 
the total charge for credit relative to the customers financial  situation.
CONC 5.3 contained further  guidance on what a lender should bear in mind when thinking 
about affordability. And CONC 5.3.1G(1) said:
In making the creditworthiness assessment  or the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R 
(1), a firm should take into account more  than assessing the customers ability  to repay the 
credit.
CONC 5.3.1G(2) then said:
The creditworthiness assessment and the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R (1) should 
include the firm taking  reasonable  steps to assess the customers  ability to meet repayments 
under a regulated credit  agreement in a sustainable  manner without the customer  incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant  adverse  consequences.
In respect of the need to double-check information disclosed by applicants,  CONC 5.3.1G(4) 
stated:
(b) it is not generally sufficient for a firm to rely solely for its assessment of the customers  
income and expenditure on a statement of those matters made by the customer.
And CONC 5.3.7R said that:
A firm must not accept an application for credit under  a regulated  credit  agreement where 
the firm knows or ought reasonably to suspect  that the customer  has not been  truthful  in 
completing the application in relation to information supplied by the customer  relevant to the 
creditworthiness assessment or the assessment required  by CONC 5.2.2R (1).
CONC 6.7 sets out a firms obligations  in relation to its post contract business practices. 
CONC 6.7.21G, CONC 6.7.22G and CONC 6.7.23R  contained  specific obligations for high-
cost short-term credit providers like CashEuroNet.
CONC 6.7.21G says:
A firm should not refinance high-cost short-term credit where to do so is unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful.
CONC 6.7.22G says:
A firm should not allow a customer to enter  into consecutive agreements  with the firm for 
high-cost short-term credit if the cumulative effect  of the agreements  would be that the total 
amount payable by the customer is unsustainable.
Quick Quid lending to Ms S
Ref: DRN98528574From its records and her bank statements, I see that Quick Quids  lending to Ms S was 
initially under  a flex credit  facility that allowed multiple drawdowns up to a credit limit. Later 
the lending was under payday loans. Overall  the lending was as follows:
loan No advance No date amount (£) date repaid
1 1 02.04.14 400.00 28.07.14
2 02.05.14 133.60 28.07.14
3 23.05.14 100.00 28.07.14
4 25.06.14 100.00 28.07.14
5 23.07.14 400.00 28.07.14
6 09.09.14   50.00 23.09.14
7 11.09.14 150.00 23.09.14
8 16.09.14 100.00 23.09.14
9 17.09.14 100.00 23.09.14
10 20.09.14   50.00 23.09.14
11 24.09.14 400.00 21.10.15
12 02.10.14 400.00 21.10.15
13 03.10.14 150.00 21.10.15
14 09.10.14 150.00 21.10.15

Flex credit advances between 2 April 2014 and 9 September 2014.
Before making the credit  agreement with Ms S, Quick Quid had to make checks  that she 
could afford  repayment.  Such checks had to be proportionate. Whats proportionate depends 
on factors  such as the size of the loan repayments  and the information Quick  Quid  had 
about Ms S.
Im satisfied that Quick  Quid  asked  Ms S about  her income  and expenditure. It recorded  her 
net monthly income as about £1,500.00 and her expenditure as about  £550.00. 
I accept that Quick Quid did a credit  check.  Ms S has provided us with her credit  file in a 
detailed format. And from that I cant say that Quick  Quids  credit check  shouldve prompted 
it to do further checks before making the first advances to Ms S.
So Im satisfied that  before the flex credit agreement  Quick Quid  did proportionate 
checks. 
And I dont  think that by 9 September 2014  the lending had quite reached the point at which 
Quick Quid shouldve realised it was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN98528575Therefore I dont find it fair and reasonable to order Quick Quid to refund interest  or to make 
any other redress in relation to that lending.
Flex credit advances between 11 September 2014  and 9 October 2014  
Payday loans January to April 2015   
After the sixth advance  on the flex credit on 9 September 2014, only a couple  of days went  
by before on 11 September 2014, Ms S asked for her seventh advance in six months.  
I think Quick Quid shouldve done more checks at that stage. If it had done so I think it 
shouldve seen that  far from using it as a short-term  solution to cash  flow difficulties - Ms S 
was using the flex credit as a long- term solution  to financial difficulties. It shouldve seen 
that this was unsustainable  and harmful to Ms S.
I dont think Quick Quid shouldve made  its flex credit advances between  11 September  
2014 and 9 October 2014. 
She had taken 14 drawdowns on the flex credit. After Ms S repaid it, there  was a gap of 
about three months before  she asked for a payday loan (loan 2). But  in view of what had 
gone before  - I dont think that gap was long enough to be significant. So I dont think  Quick  
Quid shouldve made its payday loans between  January and April 2015.  
Therefore  in an attempt  to put things  right  I find it fair and reasonable to order Quick  Quid  
to refund the interest  and any charges that Ms S paid on the lending  between 11 September 
2014 and 9 October 2014 and between January to April 2015  . Also I will order Quick  Quid  to 
remove from Ms Ss credit file all entries relating to that lending.
Payday loans 14 December 2015  and 6 April 2016
After repaying the previous loan, Ms S didnt  ask to borrow  from Quick  Quid  again  for almost 
seven months. I think that gap was significant.  So Quick Quid  could approach  the lending on 
14 December 2015 as though it were lending to Ms S for the first time.
Quick Quid again  recorded her net monthly income as about  £1,500.00. It recorded her 
expenditure as about £725.00.  From  the specimen documents  showing  its lending  process 
at that time, Im satisfied that Quick Quid had asked Ms S about  her normal monthly income, 
her normal  living costs,  her regular financial commitments and any other  short-term  financial 
commitments.
So Im satisfied that  before the payday  loans 14 December 2015 and 6 April 2016
 Quick Quid did proportionate checks.  And I dont  think  the lending  had again reached the 
point at which Quick  Quid shouldve realised it was unsustainable.
Therefore I dont find it fair and reasonable to order Quick Quid to refund interest  or to make 
any other redress in relation to that lending .
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid) to (in respect of its advances to Ms S 
between 11 September 2014 and 24 April 2015):
Ref: DRN985285761.refund  each amount of interest and charges Ms S paid; and
2.pay simple  interest at a yearly  rate of 8% of each such  amount from the date Ms S 
paid it to the date Quick Quid  refunds  it. If Quick  Quid considers that its required  by 
HM Revenue  & Customs to withhold income tax from that interest, it must tell Ms S 
how much  its taken  off. It should  also give her a tax deduction certificate if she asks 
for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate;
3.remove all entries from Ms Ss credit  file.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 August 2019.
