The complaint
Mr A complains that PDL Finance Limited, trading as Mr Lender, lent to him irresponsibly. 
What happened
Mr A took three loans. The two earlier ones have been ruled as being out of our jurisdiction 
and so I am not considering the merits of those. The third loan was approved by Mr Lender 
as a £1,000 instalment loan on 30 November 2014 and there was a significant gap between 
Mr A repaying the previous loan. So, it says that it counts as a fresh chain of lending. 
Mr A declared his net monthly income to be £1,570, his outgoings to be £200 rent or 
mortgage, £100 for food/travel and £46 for his telephone. Mr A declared that he was 
spending £370 a month on other loans which included other short term loans. Mr Lender has 
explained it had noted that.  
The repayments were to be over six months and were scheduled to be as follows: 
1 19/12/2014 £466.66 (Capital £166.66 Interest £300.00)
2 30/01/2015 £416.66 (Capital £166.66 Interest £250.00)
3 27/02/2015 £366.66 (Capital £166.66 Interest £200.00)
4 31/03/2015 £316.67 (Capital £166.66 Interest £150.01)
5 30/04/2015 £266.67 (Capital £166.66 Interest £100.01)
6 29/05/2015 £216.71 (Capital £166.70 Interest £50.01)
Mr Lenders final response did not uphold Mr A's complaint. It did offer a £25.00 voucher as 
a gesture of goodwill and Mr Lender said that this offer was no longer available.
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that Mr Lender did not need to 
put things right for this loan. Mr A disagreed. The complaint remained unresolved and was 
passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have considered the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice at the 
time the loans were offered.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner 
without it adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list several things a lender could take into account before agreeing to lend. The key 
element was that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to consider a number of 
different things, including how much was being lent and when the sum being borrowed was 
due to be repaid. 
I do think that it was reasonable for Mr Lender to treat the application for this loan (Loan 3) 
as if Mr A was a new customer. I say this because of the significant gap between repaying 
the previous loan and applying for this one. So, at this stage in this fresh loan chain, and for 
an instalment loan of this level, Id expect Mr Lender to have made enquiries about Mr As 
income, regular expenditure and his other credit commitments, including his short term 
lending costs. 
Mr Lender has demonstrated that it gathered information to satisfy itself that Mr A would be 
able to afford the loan and it approved the loan having carried out proportionate checks. 
In the circumstances I do not think that Mr Lender needed to do more for this loan and I have 
no other evidence from Mr A. He has told us that he had other short term loans at the time 
and I can see from Mr Lenders records that Mr A had declared that cost as £370 each 
month when he applied for the loan. Mr Lender approved the loan having carried out 
proportionate checks.  
I do not uphold Mr As complaint about the loan approved in November 2014. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr As complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2020.
