lent to him.

This complaint is about six payday loans  lent by QuickQuid and three instalment loans lent 
by Pounds to Pocket  to Mr G between  May 2012  and April 2014. Mr Gs lending history is as

Loans 1, 4 and 8 were instalment loans and the other loans were payday loans. Our 
adjudicator upheld Mr Gs complaint and thought the loans from November 2012 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. CashEuroNet disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
The adjudicator didnt think CashEuroNet was wrong to lend loan 1, Mr G hasnt disagreed 
with this finding. Also CashEuroNet has agreed  that it shouldnt  have lent Mr G loan 7 and so 
Ive focused my decision on the loans that remain in dispute  loans 2 to 6 and loans 8 to 9.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr G 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN16207622the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  was required to 
establish whether  Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments,  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. The Office of Fair Trading  (OFT)  guidance also 
defined sustainable  in much the same way as being without undue difficulties  in particular 
without incurring or increasing problem indebtedness, over the life of the credit agreement, 
out of income and/or  savings and without having  to realise security or assets. And it follows 
that a lender should realise, or it ought  fairly  and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont  
be able to make their repayments  sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their 
repayments without  borrowing  further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, when CashEuroNet  lent Mr G loan 2, he was still repaying  his 
instalment loan with Pounds to Pocket. The joint repayment for loan 2 and loan 1 was 
around £300. Taking into account Mr Gs declared income of £500, CashEuroNet ought to 
have realised Mr G wasnt  in a position to sustainably afford  to repay  loan 2 and it shouldnt 
have lent to him.
From loan 2 onwards, Mr G was given a new loan while  still repaying  a previous loan and 
I think CashEuroNet ought to have realised that he was struggling to repay his loans.  For 
loans 3, Mr G had to repay  an average  of around £262 over a two month repayment period.  
Again given that his declared  income at the time was £500, I think  it was more likely that he 
was wouldve struggled to repay as the repayment represented more than half his income. 
CashEuroNet should have been concerned about  this as I can see that Mr G rolled over the 
repayment of this loan. 
Mr G took out loan 4 and loan 5 on the same day and I think  that CashEuroNet  shouldve  
been carrying out a full review before agreeing  to lend loan 4 and had it done that, its likely 
to have seen that Mr G was self-employed and his income wasnt regular. Mr G has provided 
copies of his bank statements and his living expenses were over £1,000 and he had to repay  
a maximum of around £1,200 for loans 4 and 5. In these circumstances CashEuroNet  would 
have seen that it was more  likely  that Mr G couldnt sustainably afford to repay these loans.
Ref: DRN16207623And by loan 5 CashEuroNet should reasonably have seen  that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so CashEuroNet  should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Gs case, by loan 5, Mr G had been indebted to 
CashEuroNet for around 12 months without any reasonable breaks in lending.  Mr G had 
struggled to repay previous loans and had rolled over three previous loans. I can also see 
that he refinanced  loan 3 into a new loan (loan 5) and on some occasions, Mr G was 
borrowing on the same  day as repaying a previous loan. So CashEuroNet ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr G was having  to borrow further  to cover the hole 
repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Gs indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr G was borrowing for a long time and so wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he 
owed CashEuroNet  and was unable to free himself  from these loans. Loan 9 was taken out 
around 24 months after Mr Gs first, and it was for a larger amount more than double Mr Gs 
first loan. Mr G had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to 
CashEuroNet over an extended period.
I think that Mr G lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards and:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Gs ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 9 and CashEuroNet should put things 
right with these loans as well.
putting things right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 2 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 2 to 4 from Mr Gs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 to 9 should be removed from 
Mr Gs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  
CashEuroNet must  give Mr G a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
should pay Mr G compensation as set out above.
Ref: DRN16207624Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 August 2019.
