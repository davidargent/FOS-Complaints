The complaint
Mr B complains that Hastings Insurance Services Limited mishandled his motor insurance 
policy.
Where I refer to Hastings, I refer to the above-named company and I include employees and 
others insofar as I hold Hastings responsible for their acts or omissions.
What happened
Mr B has shown us a doctors letter saying that he suffers with long-term and severe anxiety 
and depression.
Mr B used Hastings as an insurance intermediary to set up a motor policy with an insurance 
company.
From at least January 2019, Mr B had a policy through Hastings. In late January 2019, Mr B 
and a third party were involved in an accident. 
On about 6 February 2019, the insurer paid Mr B about £1,700.00 in relation to his damaged 
vehicle. The insurer wished to recover that outlay from the third party.
From about 22 August 2019, Mr B had a policy through Hastings. He paid instalments by 
direct debit. These included two payments in early July and early August 2020 each of 
£29.12 (so those two payments totalled £58.24).
From about 22 August 2020, the policy renewed. Mr B paid instalments by direct debit. 
These included a payment of £34.02 in early September 2020 and ten instalments from early 
October 2020 to early June 2021 each of £34.08. Those 11 instalments totalled £374.82.
The total of £58.24 and £374.82 is £433.06.
From late July 2021, Mr B cancelled the direct debits to Hastings. He also initiated a direct 
debit indemnity claim via his bank. On 29 July 2021, Mr Bs bank credited his account with a 
total of £433.06.
In early August 2021, Mr B made a complaint to Hastings (which I will call the previous 
complaint) about delay with the claim against the third party and about unwanted renewal of 
the policy from 2020.
On 13 August 2021, Hastings wrote a final response to that complaint. It didnt uphold the 
complaint about the 2020 renewal. But it did uphold the complaint about delay, for which it 
said it was sending £200.00 compensation. Hastings also confirmed that the accident hadnt 
been Mr Bs fault. 
Notwithstanding that it hadnt upheld the complaint about the 2020 renewal, on 17 August 
2021, Hastings credited Mr Bs bank account with the 11 instalments that totalled £374.82.
On 18 August 2021, Hastings credited Mr Bs bank account with £200.00 (the 
compensation).
On about 12 October 2021, Hastings wrote to Mr B in relation to the January 2019 claim, 
saying that it was refunding his excess.
Many months passed. Hastings wrote a letter to Mr B dated 13 April 2022. It said that there 
had been an indemnity actioned in relation to the 13 instalments which it listed. The letter 
didnt contain the total of the 13 instalments (£433.06) but asked Mr B to pay an incorrect 
total of £491.30 (£58.24 more). 
On 22 April 2022, Hastings sent Mr B a text asking him to pay £58.24.
Mr B complained to Hastings that (in addition to refunding £200.00 instead of £250.00 for his 
excess) it had asked him to pay various incorrect balances.
By a final response dated 6 May 2022, Hastings turned down that complaint. It said that the 
excess had been £245.00 which it had refunded in October 2021. Hastings said Mr B owed 
£433.06.
In late May 2022, Mr B brought to us his complaint about the claim for the balances (the  
current complaint). He asked that Hastings should stop contacting him.
Our investigator recommended that the current complaint should be upheld in part. He 
thought that Mr B needed to pay £433.06. But the investigator thought that Hastings 
shouldve told Mr B the correct balance before he needed to raise a complaint. The 
investigator recommended that Hastings should:
1. contact Mr B to discuss his payment options regarding the outstanding balance; and
2. provide him with compensation of £100.00 for the distress caused by unclear 
notifications of the balance. 
Hastings disagreed with the investigators opinion. It asked for an ombudsman to review the 
current complaint. It says, in summary, that:
Mr B cancelled his policy to obtain a full refund.
It made a typo error on one occasion when it told Mr B the incorrect amount of 
£491.30.
£58.24 was correct. It was due from the previous policy term.
£433.06 was also correct and inclusive of the £58.24.
This wasnt an unexpected bill. Mr B cancelled the policy and received both a refund 
and a direct debit indemnity claim. 
Mr Bs own actions caused his distress.
It placed the account on hold on 25 April 2022 alleviating the distress to Mr B.£100.00 compensation is not fair or justified. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr B has shown us no reason why he shouldnt have to pay the final two instalments for the 
policy that ended in August 2020, totalling £58.24. 
Mr B had complained about the 2020 renewal. Notwithstanding its final response to that 
previous complaint, Hastings has told us that it cancelled the policy and backdated that 
cancellation. It refunded the 11 instalments totalling £374.82. When it did so, it didnt know 
Mr B had made an indemnity claim and already received a refund from his bank.
Months later, Hastings had to reimburse the bank. So I dont find that Hastings treated Mr B 
unfairly by asking him to repay the £58.24 or the £374.82, a total of £433.06.
Hastings communication from 13 April onwards was unwelcome to Mr B. That included 
mention of debt collection. But I dont hold Hastings responsible for saying anything 
inappropriate about that.
However, Im not satisfied that Hastings communicated with Mr B as clearly as it shouldve 
done. One notable example of this is the incorrect figure of £491.30 in its letter of 13 April 
2022. Another example is that an undated text incorrectly thanked Mr B for renewal of his 
policy, before asking for £58.24 by early May 2022. 
Another example is the final response in May 2022, Hastings included the following:
During this complaint on 12/08/2021, as you went to another insurer, you confirmed 
this was us and we backdated the cancellation to 22/08/2022, voiding the renewal. 
Due to this, we refunded a total of £382.02 for all the payments you made for the 
renewed policy. This consisted of 10 payments of £34.08 and 1 payment of £34.02, 
which you confirmed is what you had paid for your last policy with us '20-'21.
The date of 22/08/2022 cannot be correct. And the amount of £382.02 is neither the 
amount refunded nor the total of the 11 payments (£374.82).
Ive considered  the impact on Mr B of the shortcomings in the way Hastings communicated 
with him. I  hold Hastings responsible for causing some of the disturbance and frustration he 
felt. I keep in mind that he was already suffering anxiety and depression. 
Putting things right
Overall, I conclude that its fair and reasonable to direct Hastings to contact Mr B about his 
payment options and to pay him (or to credit against what he has to pay) £100.00 
compensation for distress and inconvenience.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Hastings Insurance Services Limited to:
1. pay Mr B (or credit against what he has to pay) £100.00 compensation for distress 
and inconvenience; and2. to contact Mr B about his payment options. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 December 2022.
