K821x#15complaint
Miss G has complained about a number of loans  she took out through a company called  
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Miss G says she was 
lent to irresponsibly and the loans caused  her financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Miss G took out 6 loans from Sunny  between  July 2018 and 
October 2018. Ive enclosed a summary  of Miss Gs borrowing with Sunny, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
 
Im sorry  Miss G has had to wait a while for the complaint to get to this stage. Nevertheless,  
one of our adjudicators has recently  re-looked into the complaint and said they didnt think  it 
should be upheld.  Ive been asked  to make an ombudsmans  final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Miss Gs 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Miss G 
could repay  the loans  she was given in a sustainable manner.  These checks  ought to have 
taken into account  a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer.  These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income)
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. Ive carefully  considered all of these things 
and what they mean  for Miss Gs complaint.
Ref: DRN90556342Sunny told us it carried out certain checks before agreeing to lend to Miss G, including 
assessing her income, expenditure and creditworthiness. It says that based on what  was 
said, this information  showed that Miss G would be able to make the loan repayments she 
was committing to on all 6 occasions.  
Im afraid I too dont  think  theres enough evidence to uphold this complaint. For all 6 loans, 
Miss G declared her net income (after  tax) as around £1,000 per month. She also provided 
details about her expenditure, which was quite  low. So it looks  very much like Miss G told 
Sunny that her disposable income  was comfortable  enough to meet the loan repayments. 
Bearing in mind what Ive said above  about the length of the lending relationship, I think the 
checks Sunny probably carried  out would have showed the repayments on the first 4 loans  
to be affordable, not least because the amounts being borrowed were  mostly moderate and 
Miss G paid them all back early.  I note there  was a very slight overlap in the lending  at times, 
but again, this wasnt  something that looked like Miss G couldnt afford. In summary 
therefore, it seems to me the repayments for these  loans would have appeared to be within  
Miss Gs capacity  to repay  given  what shed declared her income  and expenditure to be. So I 
cant uphold the complaint  about loans 1  4.
By the time we get to loan numbers 5 and 6, I do think Sunny ought to have carried out more 
detailed and comprehensive financial checks about Miss Gs situation, and I dont know that 
it did this. But even  if it didnt, I dont actually think it would have made any difference  to 
whether or not Sunny would have lent her more money. This is because the amounts were  
once again moderate and payable over 6 instalments. So the monthly  outlay to Miss G 
appeared well within her capacity to repay.  I havent seen anything else about her financial 
situation that would have  stood out or shown more lending Sunny was irresponsible,  for 
loans 5 and 6. Had the lending gone  on further,  then things  might  have looked different.
Im very sorry to disappoint Miss G. But there just isnt enough evidence for me to uphold her 
complaint. It seems all 6 loans were  within her capacity to repay and although Sunny may 
not have done everything  right, I dont think the lending was irresponsible in this particular 
case.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  And I dont direct  Elevate Credit International Limited to pay 
Miss G any compensation.  Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am 
required to ask Miss G to accept or reject my decision before 24 April 2020.
