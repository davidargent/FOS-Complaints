The complaint
Mr F complains that TSB Bank plc (TSB) mismanaged his credit card account.
What happened
In February 2020, Mr F applied for a 20-month interest-free balance transfer offer from TSB. 
He transferred his other credit card borrowing to the card, with a limit of £6500. He set up a 
standing order from his TSB bank account of £260 per month. But £260 per week was paid 
instead. There were then further problems with payments. In June 2020 and August 2020, 
he incurred late payment fees and his credit file was marked.  
Mr F complained that TSB had made errors. The standing order shouldve been for £260 per 
month (not per week). So, he paid six payments too much - £1560.  And when it was 
cancelled and reinstated in May 2020, there were further problems as payments were then 
missed, incurring late payment fees. He lost his interest free offer as a result. Mr F told us he 
was 81.
In July 2020, TSB said there had been problems with the standing order. They had reversed 
the over-payment of £1560. They reinstated the zero-interest rate period and refunded the 
late fee of £12. But they said the late payment marker on Mr Fs credit file was correct and 
wouldnt be changed. They recommended that Mr F set up payments to his card account 
using a direct debit, rather than a standing order. TSB paid compensation of £50.
Mr F brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator looked at what had happened. 
She said that the problems started when the standing order was cancelled in May 2020 and 
a new one was set up for £260 per month, starting in June 2020. But the June 2020 payment 
wasnt made  and a late fee was charged. But the July 2020 payment was made, and Mr F 
also made another manual payment of £260 that month also. The payment in respect of the 
August 2020 statement was missed, but Mr F paid the amounts due in September 2020 
himself. She said the root cause of the problems was the adjustments made to the standing 
order in May 2020. She said late charges should be refunded, and any adverse information 
on Mr Fs credit file removed. The promotional offer should be reinstated. Mr F should be 
paid compensation of £50 for inconvenience. Following further discussions with TSB  our 
investigator asked them to explain what had happened with the standing order in May 2020. 
They couldnt  and she issued an amended opinion which increased her recommended 
compensation to £100.
TSB commented further. They said they considered theyd put things right in their final 
response letter in July 2020 and didnt need to do anymore. They said a direct debit should 
be used going forward  and Mr F had been advised of this. They asked that an ombudsman 
look at Mr Fs complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reviewed Mr Fs complaint and what he and TSB have told us. The key issue here is - 
what happened with the standing order in May 2020. After Mr F opened the credit card 
account, he intended to make payments of £260 per month to it. But the original standing 
order was set up to pay £260 per week. These took place throughout March 2020 and April 
2020 - causing a lot of problems for Mr F. But after he contacted TSB, they reversed the 
overpayments of £1560. It looks to me that what happened then  is that the original 
standing order (of £260 per week) was cancelled and a new one set up for £260 per month. 
Ive seen the screenshot of the standing order file when it was changed in May 2020. This 
shows that monthly payments of £260 were to start on 16 June 2020  and until further 
notice. But it was also marked inactive. What happened then is unclear  and weve asked 
TSB about this several times and they cant tell us. But the result was that no payment was 
made on 16 June 2020. But it was made on 16 July 2020, but again it wasnt paid in August 
2020. A further late fee was charged in August 2020 and refunded. Ive seen the customer 
notes dated 6 July 2020 and these state that Mr F had contacted TSB. He told them he 
hadnt cancelled the standing order. The notes also say, no standing order is active on the 
accountneeds to be investigated.
TSB, to be fair, did try to put things right. In July 2020, they refunded the late fee charged in 
July 2020 and reinstated the zero per cent offer (which had been cancelled because of the 
late payment). They advised Mr F to use a direct debit for payments, rather than a standing 
order. Mr R recently told us that hes using a direct debit now.
But  on reviewing what happened here, TSB couldve done more. Weve asked them 
several times to explain what happened with the standing order, but they havent been able 
to. So, on balance, I must conclude that there was an error on the part of TSB  and what 
happened was through no fault on the part of Mr F. And, given the problems that emerged 
with Mr F over several months  it looks like here was a situation which TSB needed to help 
Mr F with, but they didnt. For example, they couldve spoken to him, worked out what had 
gone wrong, put it right  and helped him change over to a direct debit, for the right amount 
and timed to make the payments needed to the account. Mr F had told us that he had found 
the whole episode worrying and stressful  and caused him sleepless nights. 
So, in upholding this complaint, TSB should pay Mr F compensation of £100 for distress and 
inconvenience  in addition to the £50 theyve already paid. They should refund any late 
payments fees charged in 2020 and ensure his credit file is not affected as a result of the 
late payments in 2020. And ensure that Mr F gets the benefit of the 20-months interest free 
offer.
Putting things right
TSB Bank plc must pay Mr F compensation of £100, in addition to the £50 already paid. 
They should refund any late payment fees charged in 2020. They should remove any 
adverse information from his credit file. And, they should ensure Mr F gets the full period of 
20 months interest free borrowing on his account. 
My final decisionI uphold this complaint. TSB Bank plc must:
Pay Mr F compensation of £100  in addition to the £50 paid.
Refund any late payment fees in 2020 not already refunded.
Remove any adverse information at credit reference agencies in respect of late 
payments in 2020.
Ensure Mr F gets the benefit of 20-months interest free debt on his credit card 
account.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 May 2021.
