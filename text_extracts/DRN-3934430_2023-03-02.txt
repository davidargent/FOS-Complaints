The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) deactivated online banking 
for his personal bank account and that there were then significant difficulties in him regaining 
access.
What happened
Mr S held accounts with NatWest in both a personal capacity and as director of his business, 
a limited company. In March 2020 Mr S switched one of the business accounts away from 
NatWest. But he still held a reserve account in his business name and a personal current 
account with NatWest. 
In September 2021 NatWest decided it wanted to close the business reserve account. It 
wrote to Mr S to tell him what it would be doing. As part of this closure process NatWest 
deactivated Mr S online banking, this meant he could no longer view his personal bank 
account online.
Mr S contacted NatWest to complain, and NatWest sent codes to allow him to reactivate his 
online banking. But Mr S says there have been considerable issues with this process and he 
was only able to regain access to online banking in late 2022. 
One of our Investigators looked at what had happened. They felt that NatWest could have 
more clearly explained the impact of the business account being closed on Mr Ss online 
banking for his personal account. They also felt there was evidence to suggest that the first 
reactivation code wasnt sent correctly. So they recommended that NatWest pay Mr S £100 
to recognise the impact of what had happened. Overall though, they felt that not all of the 
issues with Mr S regaining access to online banking had been NatWests fault.
Mr S disagreed, he felt further compensation was warranted given the impact on him. 
NatWest also disagreed, it was only willing to offer £50 compensation as it felt it had been 
clear about the online banking being deactivated. As no agreement could be reached, the 
complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive reached the same conclusions as our investigator and for largely the 
same reasons.
In September 2021 NatWest decided it wished to close the reserve account held by Mr S 
business. It wrote to Mr S to tell him what would be happening  at the registered address 
for Mr S limited company  and in that letter it stated that online banking and the mobile 
application would be terminated. NatWest says it should have been clear to Mr S from this 
letter that he would be unable to view his personal account through online banking when the 
business account had closed. 
I dont agree, this letter was addressed to Mr S, but in his capacity as director of his limited 
company, and it referred specifically to the limited companys account number. I can 
understand why, having read this letter, Mr S might not immediately assume this meant he 
would no longer be able to use online banking to view and manage his personal account 
rather than meaning, for example, that the business account would disappear from online 
banking.
On 10 January 2022 NatWest sent Mr S an activation code to enable him to re-register 
online banking, this was done automatically as part of the process of closing the business 
account. He called NatWest on 14 January 2022 to try to regain access to his online 
banking. During this conversation NatWest confirmed the recent payments out of the 
account and the balance and explained that the online banking had been deactivated 
because of the closure of the business account. NatWest also explained that when Mr S 
received the activation code he would need to use it to re-register for online banking. During 
this call Mr S raised a complaint about what had happened.
NatWest looked into Mr S complaint, noted that the previous activation code hadnt been 
used, and so concluded it may not have been sent correctly. So on 19 January 2022 
NatWest sent a new activation code. NatWest says this code was also not used to try and 
regain access to online banking. Mr S says he was unable to reactivate his online banking 
using the information he had, he was eventually able to gain access in October 2022.
Ive looked at all the evidence Mr S has provided about his attempts to reactivate his online 
banking, and have listened to recordings of the conversations he had with NatWest, and I 
can understand how frustrating this all must have been for him. But having also taken 
account of NatWests comments, I dont think I can say that all of the issues Mr S had are 
NatWests fault. Mr S provided screen recordings of the errors he got when trying to 
reregister, but NatWest has said it has been unable to recreate that error, so its not clear 
why that process wasnt working as it should. Mr S also says that his customer number 
changed and that was why he was initially unable to re-register, but NatWest says the 
customer number didnt change, and that it just reconfirmed his existing customer number to 
him, and Ive not seen evidence to show that Mr S customer number was changed at any 
stage.
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest did what it could to help Mr S gain access. I do 
acknowledge that there were some errors by NatWest here  namely that it didnt make clear 
the online banking for Mr S personal account would be affected and that it may not have 
correctly sent the first reactivation code  but Im satisfied that the award recommended by 
our investigator of £100 is reasonable to recognise the impact of that. 
It may be helpful to explain that the purpose of an award for distress and inconvenience is to 
recognise the impact that errors have had on consumers. It is not a punitive power to 
exercise against financial businesses  so the award isnt increased for example if multiple 
errors are made. 
Mr S explained to NatWest that this account was largely used for payments relating to a 
hobby, and I can see that there were no direct debits or other regular payments other than 
two regular standing orders which appear to be to accounts in Mr S name. This account 
doesnt appear to have received regular income and was used for occasional spending but 
not for regular bills. So the impact of being unable to use online banking here isnt the same 
as it would be, for example, if this had been Mr S main bank account that he used for bills 
and day to day spending. And Mr S could have cancelled the standing orders and arranged 
a transfer of the balance out of the account over the phone if he needed access to the money. Not being able to use online banking is undoubtedly frustrating, but it is not the only 
way to manage an account. 
I note that this account did subsequently go overdrawn and that charges were applied, but 
NatWest has refunded those and Mr S has not asked us to consider those charges any 
further.
So with all this in mind, while I agree that Mr S was caused some level of frustration and 
inconvenience here, Im satisfied that the recommended award of £100 is a reasonable way 
to resolve this complaint.
Putting things right
To resolve this complaint NatWest should pay Mr S £100.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc should put things right in the way Ive 
set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 March 2023.
