The complaint
Mr W complains that Santander Consumer f(UK) plc recorded incorrect information about a 
fixed sum loan agreement on his credit file. He would like this corrected. And a higher level 
of compensation than Santander has offered.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Having done so I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons: -
Santander agreed as Mr W had paid off the arrears on his account in October 2018, 
and was able to continue with payments, it shouldnt have terminated his account. It 
couldnt unwind the termination but said it would manually amend his credit file each 
month to show payments were made. Unfortunately, this didnt happen.
Santander agreed to update the credit file and offered Mr W £250 for terminating his 
account in error. I think that was a reasonable offer.
However, I agree with our investigators view that as Santander didnt manually 
adjust the credit file when it agreed to do so, incorrect information was recorded over 
a two-year period causing Mr W some distress and inconvenience. Our investigator 
recommended Santander pay an additional £250 compensation to reflect this .I think 
that is reasonable given the length of time that wrong information has been recorded 
on Mr Ws credit file.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint.
In full and final settlement Santander Consumer (UK) plc should pay Mr W a total of £500 
compensation
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2021.
