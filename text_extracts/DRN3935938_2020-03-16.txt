Mr S says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly lent 
to him.
background
This complaint is about nine instalment loans Sunny provided  to Mr S between September 
2016 and November 2016.  Mr Ss borrowing history based on what  Sunny provided is as 
follows:

8* 17/10/2016 Sold to third party 6 £300 £177
9* 01/11/2016 Sold to third party 6 £250 £258
*these loans were  taken  while  Mr S had at least one loan outstanding, which meant  that the 
highest repayment would be across all outstanding loans in a given month.
**these amounts  have  been rounded up/down
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ss complaint in part and thought loans  5 to 9 should not have  
been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN39359382the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 5 would most likely  have shown  
that Mr S was having trouble in managing his money. Such a check  would most likely have 
shown: 
loan 5 was the fifth time Mr S has borrowed  from Sunny within the same month  so 
in very quick succession;
loan 5 was for an increased amount compared to loan 1;
when loan 5 was taken, Mr S was also paying  for loans  3 and 4 at the same  time.
It was clear from this that Mr S wasnt using these high-cost loans to deal with a short-term 
cash flow problem. So, in these circumstances, Sunny ought to have realised it was unlikely 
Mr S wouldve  been  able to sustainably repay loan 5  and any subsequent loans. 
Im not persuaded that the loan repayments being  less than a certain percentage of Mr S 
income or the fact that Mr S didnt say that he was having financial difficulty  means that 
these loans were sustainable.
Sunny continued  lending  to Mr S even when  this pattern was repeated and in circumstances 
where it ought reasonably to have realised  that any further loans were more likely than not 
unsustainable for him. 
Mr S had to pay interest and charges on loans 5 to 9, that Sunny  shouldnt have provided 
him with. So I think that he lost out and Sunny should put things right.
Ref: DRN39359383putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loan 5;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Mr Ss credit file.
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts on loans 6 to 9 Sunny should  buy these back  if 
Sunny is able to do so and then take the following steps. If Sunny cant  buy the debts back, 
then Sunny should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results  outlined below.
Sunny  should  remove all unpaid interest, fees and charges from the balance on any 
upheld outstanding loans, and then treat any repayments made  by Mr S as though  
they had been repayments towards the principal sum lent. If this results in Mr S 
having made overpayments then Sunny should  refund these overpayments.  To this, 
Sunny should  add 8% simple interest* calculated  on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen,  to the date the complaint is settled. 
If there  is still an outstanding balance then Sunny can use the refund  from loan 5 or 
any other loan where the principal has been repaid  in order to offset  any principal 
sum due. However, if there is still an outstanding balance  then Sunny  should try to 
agree an affordable  repayment plan with Mr S. 
Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  recorded on Mr Ss credit  file in 
relation to loan 6 to 9. Sunny does not have to remove any outstanding  loans  from 
Mr Ss credit file until these have been repaid, but Sunny should still remove any 
adverse information  recorded about these loans.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ss complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 April 2020.
