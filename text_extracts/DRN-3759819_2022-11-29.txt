The complaint
Mr L complains about a pending transaction on his online banking with PrePay Technologies 
Limited (PrePay). 
What happened
On 11 August 2022 Mr L called Prepay as a transaction was showing as pending and hadnt 
cleared. So, Mr L logged a complaint. 
PrePay investigated the issue and asked Mr L to delete and reinstall the banking application 
to see if it cleared the transaction, but Mr L refused. 
Mr L then called again on 25 August to say that he had reinstalled the application, but it 
hadnt cleared the transaction. PrePay apologised for the issue and told Mr L that their IT 
team were looking into the problem, and they would be in contact when the issue was 
resolved.  As a gesture of goodwill, PrePay refunded one months fee of £9.97 for the trouble 
and upset it had caused. 
Mr L remained unhappy with the complaint and asked for £20 compensation. PrePay didnt 
agree to this, so Mr L brought his complaint to our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. Our 
investigator found that as the pending transaction didnt impact the available balance on Mr 
Ls account, the offer of one months fee returned was fair. 
Mr L didnt agree with the investigators view, so the complaints been passed to me for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im come to the same outcome as the investigator, for largely the same 
reasons. Ill explain why. 
I can understand Mr Ls frustration when he found he had a payment showing as pending on 
his account. But PrePay have told Mr L that it was an error and that it was being 
investigated. PrePay also told Mr L that the pending transaction wouldnt impact his available 
balance. 
So, other than the frustration of seeing the transaction as pending, I havent seen any other 
detriment or financial loss to Mr L. PrePay have offered to refund one months management 
fee and considering the impact on Mr L that the pending transaction has had, I find this fair.
PrePay has told our service that the issue with the pending transaction was resolved on 26 
August, the day after Mr L raised the issue again. Although PrePay didnt communicate this 
to Mr L, he was in constant contact with the bank and didnt raise this again. So, on balance I 
think its most likely the issue was resolved around that time.  
In summary, I find the return of one months management fee fair compensation in the 
circumstances of this complaint. If Mr L hasnt already done so, he is free to accept PrePays 
offer of £9.97.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2022.
