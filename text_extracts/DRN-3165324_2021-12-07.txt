The complaint
Mr P complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC trading as Barclaycard (Barclaycard) didnt set 
up his balance transfer as he wanted.
What happened
In March 2019, Mr P received an email from Barclaycard offering a balance transfer of zero 
interest for 18 months - to September 2020, with a fee of 1.9%. It said he had to go online to 
accept and set it up. Mr Ps statement dated March 2019 showed he made a balance 
transfer of £7,734.85 on 22 March 2019, with a fee of £69.61 (0.9%) - until 1 September 
2019. His Barclaycard statement dated September 2019 showed interest of £71.73 was 
charged  so the interest free period had ended. Statements after that also showed the 
interest was being charged.
Mr P complained. He said he had opted for the balance transfer offer for 18 months, not six 
months. Barclaycard must have made an error  which wasnt fair. 
Barclaycard said Mr P had opted for the six months offer. Although theyd emailed 
customers about the 18-month offer (through to September 2020), when they went online 
there was more than one offer available  and Mr P must have selected one of those. His 
statements from March 2019 showed the balance transfer as due to expire on 1 September 
2019. While they were looking into his complaint, Barclaycard stopped interest on Mr Ps 
account  so hed had one month interest free.
Mr P didnt agree and brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Barclaycard had 
acted fairly.  Barclaycard had said that Mr P opted for the six month offer with a fee of 0.9%. 
Our investigator could see that this was shown on the statements that Mr P received. If hed 
opted for a longer offer period  this would have had a fee of 1.9%. 
Mr P didnt agree and asked for his complaint to be looked at by an ombudsman. He couldnt 
see that Barclaycard had proven that hed opted for the six-month offer - by showing his 
application form or online evidence. He didnt look past page one of his Barclaycard 
statements and so didnt see the expiry of the offer as being September 2019.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr P is certain that when he went online, he opted to take a balance transfer for 18 months - 
ending in September 2020. And so, when he later noticed  in March 2020 - that he was 
being charged interest from September 2019  he said that Barclaycard must have made an 
error.
The crux of Mr Ps complaint is that Barclaycard cant evidence anything that shows that he 
chose the six month offer rather than the 18-month offer. There isnt an application form or 
online evidence to show this. Weve asked Barclaycard more questions about this and 
theyve said they dont keep this information. They said there isnt an application form as 
such, as its not like a loan  but just an allocation of the credit limit at a zero-interest rate. 
And they didnt have a record of how Mr P opted for the offer online. So  I must base my 
decision on what I think happened  based on the balance of probabilities.
Ive seen that on 1 March 2019 - Mr P received an email which offered the 18-month balance 
transfer, at a zero-interest rate. This said 0% interest on balance transfers until 1 
September 2020 (1.9% transfer fee applies). Mr P then had to go online to view the offers. 
Barclaycard say there wouldve been more that the 18-month offer shown online  and Mr P 
must have opted for the six-month offer. I can see that he then transferred £7,734.85 on 22 
March 2019 and a fee of £69.61 was paid.
I think that its this aspect which is the critical piece of evidence here. The offer of 18 months 
had a fee of 1.9% - which wouldve been £146.96. But the offer of six months had a fee of 
0.9% - a fee of £69.61. And Mr P paid £69.61  so for me, its clear that he must have taken 
the six-month offer. 
Barclaycard told us that the option that Mr P took then was reflected onto his account  and 
his statements. They dont store all the offers they make and to which customers  as there 
are so many combinations. But  they said the offers that are accepted by customers are 
shown on their statements. And they say - thats what happened in Mr Ps case. Ive 
considered what Barclaycard have said and I think their argument is persuasive.
I can then see that on Mr Ps statements between 22 March 2019 and 22 August 2019, the 
transferred balance was shown and said also Interest on your balance transfer £0.00. 
Balance £xxxx interest 0.0% to 1 Sep 2019. Mr P says he didnt look at that part of his 
statements  but I cant hold Barclaycard responsible for that  as thats up to Mr P. But  
from 22 March 2019, he couldve seen what the offer was that hed taken. 
As I have said, I must make my decision based on the balance of probability as to what 
happened. And Im persuaded that on that basis, Mr P opted to take the six-month option 
when he went online to ask for the balance transfer. I appreciate that he is convinced he did 
otherwise and will therefore be disappointed by my decision  but Im not going to ask 
Barclaycard to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2022.
