Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Js complaint in part and thought loans 3-8 shouldnt have been 
given. Uncle  Buck didnt  agree. So the complaint  was passed to me, an ombudsman, to 
make a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr J 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN30811872refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because The Office of Fair Trading  and the FCAs Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Js complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
Uncle Buck  needed  to do more when it approved loan 1 and 2. This was early on in the 
lending relationship between the two parties  and the loan repayments seemed affordable 
based on what Mr J had told Uncle Buck. So I dont think Uncle Buck  was wrong  to give 
these loans to Mr J.
However I dont think Uncle Buck carried out proportionate checks for loan 3. Had it done so, 
I think Uncle Buck would most likely  have  made  a different lending decision.  By loan 3 there 
were clear  signs  that Mr J was struggling to repay his loans.  I say this because:
Loan 3 was for Â£400. This amount was twice as much as the first loan Mr J took out with 
Uncle Buck. When he requested loan 3 Mr J asked for this loan to be over a longer  time 
than his previous  loans, taking it out over 3 instalments. 
Mr J asked for repayment of loan 1 to be deferred twice and then did the same when he 
came to repay loan 2, deferring repayment of his loans on 4 occasions.
Mr J was borrowing again  on the same day he was repaying  his loans. He took out loan 
2 on the same day that he repaid  a loan 1. He then asked for loan 3 on the day he had 
repaid loan 2. This shows me that he was most likely unable  to repay previous loans 
without taking out a new one and was borrowing again to fill a gap in his finances.  
I think when I consider all of these points,  it shows  that there was a significant  risk that Mr J 
would be unable to meet his repayments  for loan 3 because he was showing signs that he 
was struggling to repay in a sustainable way.
It follows that I dont think Uncle Buck should have given loan 3 and every loan agreed after 
this point up to loan 8 to Mr J.
Ref: DRN30811873Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of Uncle Bucks lending history with Mr J, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Uncle Buck should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Uncle  Buck should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Js case, I think that this point was reached at loan 
5 and applied  to any loan taken out up to loan 8. I say this because:
At this point Uncle Buck ought to have realised Mr J was not managing  to repay  his 
loans sustainably. Mr J had taken  out five loans  within 10 months.  So Uncle Buck 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr J was having to borrow further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan(s) was leaving in his finances and that 
Mr Js indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr J wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Uncle Buck.  Uncle Buck 
ought to have known that Mr J was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall 
in his income but to meet an ongoing  need.  Mr J had paid large amounts of interest 
to, in effect; service  a debt to Uncle Buck over an extended period.
I think this pattern of lending should have alerted Uncle  Buck to the likelihood  that Mr 
J was having problems managing his money. I think that Uncle Buck shouldve been 
concerned that Mr J might  be borrowing elsewhere to repay its loans, again 
increasing his indebtedness unsustainably.
I think that Mr J lost out because Uncle Buck continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 to 8 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
The number of loans  was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Js ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 3-8 for the reasons given above.  
There was then a gap of nearly 10 months  from Mr J repaying loan 8 and asking Uncle Buck  
for another  loan. I think it is reasonable due to the long period of time that had elapsed  
between loan 8 and 9; that a new lending relationship had started between  the parties. So 
as loan 9 was the first request in this lending relationship,  I dont think  Uncle  Buck needed to 
do anymore checks than it did at the time and so I dont think it was wrong  to give this loan 
to him.
In conclusion, I am upholding Mr Js complaint about loans 3-8. Uncle Buck  should  now put 
things right.
putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
Refund all interest  and charges Mr J paid on loans 3 to 8;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
Ref: DRN30811874Remove any negative  information about loans 3 and 4 from Mr Js credit  file
The number of loans  taken from loan 5 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse, so all entries about  loans 5 to 8 should  be removed from Mr 
Js credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Uncle  Buck  to take off tax from this interest.  Uncle Buck  must 
give Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Mr J still owes  Uncle Buck some of the principal balance he borrowed  on his final loan. Mr 
Lender may deduct  this from the compensation  that is due to him. But, to be clear,  that 
outstanding balance should be recalculated to remove any interest and charges, whilst 
taking account  of any repayments  Mr J has made on that loan as though  they were applied  
against the principal sum borrowed.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Js complaint. Uncle Buck  Finance 
LLP (trading  as Uncle Buck) should pay Mr J compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 January 2020.
