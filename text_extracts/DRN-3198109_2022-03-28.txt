DRN-3198109
The complaint
Mr H complains that due to misleading information about direct debits from  Marks & 
Spencer Financial Services Plc (trading as M&S Bank )(M&S) he missed a payment on his 
credit card. He would like more compensation than the £25 M&S has paid
What happened
The details of this complaint are well  known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here . Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
I accept Mr Hs point that the screen shot he showed us stating "If you choose to set 
up the Direct Debit online, all you need to do is complete the online form and click 
'Submit' doesnt flag up any timeframe for a direct debit to be set up. 
However M&S  has explained that when a direct debit is set up it sends a message 
which,  in summary says,  the request is being dealt with and to ensure that 
payments continue to be made until confirmation of the first direct debit is made. 
M&S has evidenced that this message was sent to Mr H. So, I do believe M&S made 
Mr H aware the direct debit wouldnt be set up instantaneously.
I appreciate Mr Hs comments about the £25 compensation M&S has paid. M&S 
issued its final response letter on 7 September 2021 confirming it would refund the 
late payment fee , that Mr Hs credit file hadnt been affected and it paid £25 
compensation. I think M&Ss resolution was fair  given Mr H hasnt evidenced any 
financial loss and the issue was resolved promptly.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 April 2022.
