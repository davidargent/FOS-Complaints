K820x#14complaint
Mr A says The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) mis-sold him a payment protection  
insurance (PPI) policy.
background
Mr A bought the policy in 2000  at the same time as taking out a credit  card.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr A disagreed with the adjudicators opinion so 
the complaint  has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr As case.
Ive decided not to uphold  s complaint because:
 I think RBS made Mr A aware that the PPI was optional  and that he chose to take it. I 
say this because  he did complete  the box on the credit card application form to show  
that he wanted to take the cover.
 RBS didnt recommend the PPI to Mr A so it didnt have to check  if it was suitable for 
him. Mr A was entitled  to statutory sick pay if he couldnt work because  of sickness  or 
accident, and hes told us he didnt have any other means of covering his repayments. 
So I think its likely he decided  that the PPI wouldve provided a useful benefit  if he 
couldnt work. 
 Its possible the information RBS gave Mr A about the PPI wasnt as clear  as it should 
have been. But its unlikely Mr A would have  been affected by any of the main things 
the policy didnt  cover. And the policy was competitively priced and had a reasonable 
benefit. So I dont  think better  information wouldve stopped him buying it. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 April 2019.
