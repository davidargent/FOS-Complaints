The complaint
Mr G complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) acted unreasonably in closing his credit card 
account when he complained to NewDay about its actions in relation to a previous credit 
card. He wants negative information removed from his credit file. 
What happened
Mr G had a credit card from NewDay from around 2016. 
He managed his card satisfactorily and his credit limit was increased on a number of 
occasions.
Around summer 2018, Mr G had to leave the UK for a period due to a change in his 
circumstances. 
NewDay continued to send paper statements and letters to Mr G, but he did not make any 
payments to his credit card from June 2018. 
NewDay sent arrears letters and a default warning to Mr Gs address in the UK. 
After 6 months of missed payments, NewDay registered a default against Mr Gs credit file. 
Mr G subsequently returned to the UK. 
In early 2020, Mr G applied for another card with NewDay. This was approved and Mr G 
began using his second card. 
Mr G then settled his default for the first card and complained to NewDay that the default 
had been registered. He felt that NewDay had not done enough to contact him electronically 
to help him pay his credit card and avoid the impact on his credit file. 
NewDay then closed Mr Gs new credit card. Interest continued to accrue, and Mr G was 
able to make repayments to the card, but he could not use it.
Mr G complained to NewDay. NewDay responded and said that it did not think that there 
was an error in how it had acted. 
Mr G was not happy with this and contacted us. 
Our investigator has looked into this matter and did not recommend that Mr Gs complaint be 
upheld. NewDay responded saying that it had identified that it ought not to have opened the 
second credit card as Mr G had previously received a default on a NewDay card within the 
previous 6 years. NewDay offered to refund the interest on the new card and suppress any 
further interest or fees, so that all Mr G had to repay was the capital borrowed. The 
investigator considered that was fair and did not ask NewDay to do anything further. 
Mr G did not accept that view and asked for an ombudsman decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand why Mr G feels he has been unfairly treated. He did not consciously stop 
making payments on his first credit card while he was going through a difficult situation and 
he feels that the default he received was beyond his control and disproportionate. He has 
paid off the default and feels that the remaining marker on his credit file is a punishment.
He also feels that NewDay has punished him for making a complaint about the defaulted 
card, by cancelling the newer card. 
I understand that he doubts NewDays account that it had a policy in place not to lend to 
customers who had previously defaulted with NewDay in the previous 6 years. 
I do, however, agree with the investigators view. The investigator has set out in detail the 
process that was gone through before the default was issued and I do not intend to repeat 
that. I agree that NewDay went through a proper process and was entitled to register a 
default when it had not received any information from Mr G explaining his change in 
circumstances, and it had not received payments. Whilst NewDay could have done more to 
contact Mr G, it was ultimately his responsibility to ensure he kept up with his payments. 
As my colleague set out, the settlement of the default does not remove the default from a 
credit file, but the settlement is shown alongside. This is in order to give a fair representation 
of the account. 
In relation to NewDays actions in closing the second card when Mr G complained about the 
first account, I appreciate that NewDay misunderstood the complaint and wrongly closed the 
new account. 
However, NewDay has also demonstrated that it was wrong to open the second account in 
the first place and that this occurred because Mr Gs address details had changed and the 
earlier account was not identified at the time of opening. NewDay therefore argues that Mr G 
is in no worse a position, and has had the benefit of borrowing when he otherwise would not 
have been able to.  
I appreciate that Mr G was caused some inconvenience when his card account was closed, 
but I accept the argument from NewDay that the inconvenience caused to Mr G is balanced 
out by his having received borrowing which he would not otherwise have been able to have. 
I agree with the investigators view that in order to put Mr G in the position he would have 
been in without the errors from NewDay, his account should remain closed but he should be 
refunded the interest and fees that have been incurred on the account. 
This is what NewDay has offered, and I think this is reasonable. 
I note that my colleague indicated that NewDay should remove any adverse information up 
to date on the second card, but that it would be entitled to report on the management of the 
account going forward. This is sensible and I endorse it.
I therefore agree with my colleagues view and do not uphold Mr Gs complaint. I appreciate 
that this will be disappointing for Mr G but I hope it makes clear my reasons for reaching it. My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold Mr Gs complaint and do not ask NewDay 
Limited to do anything further. 
For the avoidance of doubt, NewDay ought not to report any adverse information in respect 
of the second card account up until the date of this decision, but it may report as normal 
going forward. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 June 2022.
