The complaint
Mrs B complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) declined her claim under its 
Buyer Protection policy.
What happened
Mrs B purchased a car through an online auction website in September 2019. She made a 
payment of £1950 through PayPal.
Mrs B found there were faults with the car that weren't made clear in the advert  and she 
had to pay to have these repaired. At the end of September 2019, Mrs B opened a dispute 
through PayPal requesting a partial refund of £760 for the costs of repairing the car.
A few days later PayPal declined Mrs Bs claim. It said motor vehicles are not covered under 
its Buyer Protection policy and that this is made clear in the User Agreement. But it did offer 
Mrs B £350 as a token of goodwill towards her repair costs.
Our investigator didn't think the complaint should be upheld. He said that PayPals User 
Agreement was clear and that its Buyer Protection policy didn't cover motor vehicles  so it 
hadn't made a mistake in declining this claim. He said that he wouldn't have awarded any 
compensation as he didn't think PayPal had made a mistake so thought the offer of £350 
was fair in the circumstances.
Mrs B didn't agree so the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, Ive reached the same 
outcome as our investigator and for the same reasons.
PayPal's User agreement states that it may reimburse its users for problems with purchases 
under its Buyer Protection policy under the following conditions:
"You may be reimbursed under PayPal's Buyer Protection for a problem with a purchase 
if...your purchase is an eligible purchase.  Purchases for most goods and services are 
eligible...except for the following transactions:
3. purchases of vehicles (including, without, limitation, motor vehicles, motorcycles, 
caravans, aircrafts and boats)"
PayPal has declined this claim as it says cars aren't covered under its Buyer Protection 
policy and from the terms outlined in the user agreement, I think that's correct. So while I 
realise Mrs B will be disappointed that her costs won't be reimbursed under PayPal's Buyer 
Protection policy, I don't think PayPal has done anything wrong in declining her claim on this 
occasion.Mrs B has recently told us that the online auction website confirmed that PayPal should have 
covered this claim. But that website and PayPal are separate entities and I can't reasonably 
hold PayPal responsible for incorrect information given about its User Agreement by a 
separate company.
PayPal has offered Mrs B £350 towards the cost of repairing the vehicle as a gesture of 
goodwill. Like the investigator, I wouldn't have asked PayPal to make any payment as I dont 
think its done anything wrong in declining the claim. If Mrs B now wants to accept PayPals 
offer she will need to contact it directly to find out if it is still available.
 My final decision
 My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 April 2020.
