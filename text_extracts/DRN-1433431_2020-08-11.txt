The complaint
Mr M complains about the amount that hes been charged by Arval UK Limited for damage 
to a car that he returned at the end of his hire agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mr M under a hire agreement with Arval that was dated in 
July 2016;
the agreement said that:  Arval shall invoice the Hirer for the cost of repairs 
(whether or not carried out) to a Vehicle returned to Arval that is subject to damage 
which, in accordance with the BVRLA Wear and Tear Guide for the Contract Hire 
Industry, would constitute unfair wear and tear ;
Mr M returned the car when the agreement ended and it was inspected  the 
inspection identified damage to a fog lamp, a wheel and the rear bumper;
Arval sent Mr M a damage recharge schedule in October 2019 which set out the 
charges for that damage and included photos of the damage  the cars mileage was 
recorded as being 15,485;
Mr M complained about the charges and, as a goodwill gesture, Arval credited his 
account with £80 (which was 50% of the charge for the damage to the rear bumper) 
which reduced the total charge to £246.07;
I consider it to be clear from the photos that theres damage to one of the cars lights, 
a wheel and the rear bumper and that the damage is more than would reasonably be 
considered to be fair wear and tear in accordance with the British Vehicle Rental and 
Leasing Association guidelines on fair wear and tear;
Mr M had agreed to make an advance payment of £1,887.26 and then 35 monthly 
payments of £314.54 for the car to be supplied to him and hed agreed that hed pay 
excess mileage charges if the car was driven for more than 21,000 miles;
Mr M drove the car for 15,485 miles but theres no provision in the agreement for him 
to receive a refund of any of the payments that hed made under the agreement (or to 
receive a credit against the charge for any damage to the car) if the car had driven 
for less than 21,000 miles  and I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for 
me to require Arval to reduce the amount that its charged Mr M for the damage to 
the car because hed driven less than 21,000 miles in it;
there have clearly been some issues with the service that Mr M has received from 
Arval  including that it incorrectly referred to the damaged light as a fog light and 
that it didnt address all of his complaint points  but Im not persuaded that those 
issues justify an award of compensation in these circumstances;
I consider that its fair and reasonable for Arval to charge Mr M for the damage to the 
car, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the charges are 
excessive and I consider that its response to his complaint has been fair and 
reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Arval to further reduce the amount that its charged Mr M for the damage to the car, 
to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 September 2020.
