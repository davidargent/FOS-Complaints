The complaint
Mr F complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) reversed a chargeback to his credit card 
account  although he had not given them agreement to do so. 
What happened
Mr F purchased artwork using his NewDay credit card but when the goods arrived, they were 
damaged. After unsuccessfully trying to contact the merchant on several occasions, Mr F 
then contacted the internet payment service provider he had used for the transaction but 
was told he needed to return the goods back to China where they originated, in order to get 
a refund. As the cost to return the goods was prohibitively expensive, Mr F decided to initiate 
a chargeback with NewDay. 
NewDay initiated the chargeback for Mr F and credited his credit card account. Mr F then 
received a notice from NewDay that said his credit card account was going to be re-debited 
as the merchant was now willing to send a replacement. Mr F says that he returned a 
declaration and stated that he didnt want a replacement from the merchant as he had made 
alternative arrangements and didnt authorise the transaction.
Mr F says that despite this NewDay went ahead and debited his credit card account. Mr F 
then made a series of phone calls to NewDay and lodged a complaint with them.
NewDay says that they have done nothing wrong as they have correctly followed the 
procedures and process when completing a chargeback. NewDay say they issued a letter to 
Mr F explaining the merchant could come back to them and this could result in the purchase 
being debited back to his credit card account.  NewDay says that they acted correctly when 
they re-debited the chargeback to his credit card account as this had been challenged by the 
merchant and they had offered to provide a replacement item without cost. 
Mr F was unhappy with NewDays response and says he didnt authorise this and has never 
received the replacement goods. Mr F then referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at the information available but didnt uphold the complaint as he felt 
NewDay had followed the chargeback process correctly.
Mr F was unhappy with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision. 
When looking at this complaint I have considered if NewDay correctly carried out the 
chargeback process for Mr F and acted fairly when doing so. 
I can understand Mr Fs frustration, having thought the refund had been made to his credit 
card account and the matter resolved, only to see this amount re-debited to his credit card 
account after it was challenged by the merchant. 
The chargeback process allows customers to get their money back (in certain situations) if 
there is a problem with goods or services that they have paid for. Under the scheme rules 
NewDay (like other card issuers) do not have to process the chargeback - but we think its 
good practice to try if there is a good reason to do so. Its important to note that there is no 
guarantee that when a chargeback request is made that a refund will be successful or 
guaranteed and it is a voluntary arrangement. 
Mr F says that the goods were damaged, and he was happy that NewDay originally carried 
out the chargeback but then wrote to him explaining the merchant had offered to replace the 
damaged goods free of charge.  I can see that Mr F made a number of phone calls to 
NewDay concerning his complaint and was given incorrect information about the status of 
his complaint - NewDay have accepted this and have compensated Mr F with Â£15, which I 
am satisfied is fair in the circumstances. Having listened to a number of phone calls I cant 
see that NewDay were suggesting Mr F shouldnt complain to this service, as he suggests,  
but more of a case he didnt have to as they were looking into his complaint, at that stage. 
What happened here was Mr F returned a declaration saying he hadnt authorised the 
transaction and had gone elsewhere for the goods he had ordered. NewDay took the view 
that was Mr Fs decision and the merchants offer wasnt something they felt they would be 
successful in challenging. NewDay says they were satisfied that the original chargeback was 
for faulty/damaged goods and therefore the merchants offer to replace these goods,  
effectively resolved the original chargeback claim. 
I have considered these points and although Mr F hadnt authorised the re-debiting of the 
chargeback,  I am satisfied that NewDay had explained to Mr F in a letter to him that the 
merchant may come back to them and his credit card account may be debited back.  While I 
can see that Mr F felt he had explained he had gone elsewhere to purchase these goods, I 
cant see that NewDay can be held responsible for this as this was a decision taken by Mr F.  
I am satisfied that NewDay carried out the process in the way I would expect to see and 
when  challenged by the merchant offering to replace the goods, it was a reasonable 
decision for them to make, not to pursue this any further. It is worth saying a review of the 
claim under Section 75 wasnt available to NewDay, given the amount involved, and this was 
also explained to Mr F by the investigator in his decision letter.
Mr F says that he has not received the goods from the merchant in China and this is 
something he should take up with the merchant directly as its not my role to look into 
disputes between consumers  and merchants,  but to ensure the chargeback process is 
correctly followed by banks, like NewDay, and from the information I have seen, this is what 
happened here.
I know Mr F will be disappointed with my decision, but it follows I wont be asking anymore of 
NewDay here. My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 September 2020.
