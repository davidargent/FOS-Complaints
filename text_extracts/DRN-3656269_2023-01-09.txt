The complaint
Mr A complains that he settled his loan from Vanquis Bank Limited (Vanquis), but there was 
a balance outstanding.
What happened
Mr A borrowed £3,000 from Vanquis in January 2020. Monthly repayments were £147.47  
36 payments. The total amount to be repaid was £5,308.92 and the interest rate was 49.9% 
APR. On 26 May 2020, Mr A contacted Vanquis by SMS to ask for an early settlement figure 
 he said the interest rate was too high. On 27 May 2020, Vanquis replied by SMS to say the 
settlement figure would be £3,069.08, and the offer was valid until 24 June 2020. The 
interest saving was £1,797.43. Vanquis said that if the next payment went through on 28 
May 2020, then £147.47 would be deducted from the settlement figure and the amount to 
settle would be £2,921.61.
On 30 June 2020, Mr A paid £2,774.14 to the loan account. Repayments stopped. Vanquis 
treated this sum as repayments until it was used up; after that, the loan was treated as being 
in arrears.
Mr A complained. He said Vanquis told him that he needed to pay £2,921.61 within 30 days. 
He said the SMS message came after he had paid the next instalment of £147.47, so he 
deducted that and paid £2,774.14. He said he had spoken to Vanquis to clarify that was the 
right amount. And he said he paid the amount in on 26 June 2020, but Vanquis claimed to 
have received it on 30 June 2020. The delay in the banking system wasnt his fault. He was 
now being asked to pay £1,579.22 to settle the loan that he repaid years ago. He said that 
was unfair and Vanquis should now close the loan with little cost to him.
Vanquis said a settlement figure of £3,068.08 was given to Mr A on 27 May 2020. They told 
him that after deducting the next instalment, the amount to pay would be £2,921.61. This 
was provided he paid this by 24 June 2020. But Mr A paid £2,774.14  which wasnt either of 
the settlement figures provided to him. And the payment was made on 30 June 2020 which 
was after the quoted settlement date. They advised missed payments to the credit reference 
agencies as payments werent being made. The amount to repay the loan as at 2 April 2022 
was £1,579.22. On a separate complaint, Vanquis apologised that they hadnt dealt with Mr 
As complaint quickly enough and paid compensation of £25 for that.
Mr A brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Vanquis acted reasonably  because 
Mr A hadnt paid the amount quoted and the date of the offer had passed by the time he paid 
in the amount anyway. He said that the credit reference agencies were notified of missed 
payments as the loan hadnt been settled, and payments missed.
Mr A asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I looked at the SMS exchange between Mr A and Vanquis  which is important to the crux of 
this complaint. On 26 May 2020, Mr A told Vanquis that he wanted to pay off the loan early 
because of the high interest rate. On 27 May 2020, Vanquis replied by SMS: If you want to 
settle your account in full the amount payable is £3,069.08 which includes an interest saving 
of £1,797.43. We will send you a written settlement quote by post. The settlement quote is 
valid for 28 days until 24/06/2020.
If the payment of £147.47 is paid on the 28/05/2020 but you still wish to settle the loan by the 
24/06/2020, this payment would be deducted from your quote leaving £2921.61 to pay. The 
interest saving would remain the same.
We asked Vanquis for a copy of the letter that was sent  they told us that in fact, a letter 
wasnt sent. But I dont think thats important here  as the SMS quote is clear. 
Mr A then paid in an amount lower than what was needed - £2,774.14. And he paid that on 
30 June 2020 - later than the deadline of 24 June 2020. Mr A says the payment delay was 
due to the banking system, and he paid it in on 26 June 2020. But  even that date was later 
than the deadline for payment in any case. So here  Mr A didnt pay the amount needed, 
nor by the settlement date. Why that happened isnt clear  quite possibly Mr A 
miscalculated or misunderstood what he needed to do. But as Ive said, Im satisfied that 
Vanquis instructions were clear.
Mr A has argued that he called Vanquis later - after the next instalment was paid (on 28 May 
2020) - and asked for clarification. He said he was told to deduct a further amount of 
£147.47 to arrive at the settlement amount. We asked Vanquis for their contact records and 
they show there was a call on 28 May 2020. We asked for this call and listened to it. But it 
related to Mr As credit card  not the loan. We saw Vanquis records of calls between 28 
May 2020 and 30 June 2020  and there werent any other calls between those dates. And 
so  I cant say there was a call during that time.
I went on to consider what happened after the amount of £2,774.14 was paid in  I wanted to 
ensure that Mr A was treated reasonably after that was done. What happened was that Mr A 
made a partial repayment. And in Vanquis loan agreement (which Mr A wouldve had a copy 
of) it says On or after making an early partial repayment, you can ask us to give you a 
statement showing the effect of your early repayment on your Account. If you make an 
early partial repayment, you can choose whether your remaining balance is to be repaid 
within a shorter Term (in which case the monthly payments will stay the same) or whether 
your monthly payments are to be reduced (in which case the original Term will stay the 
same). If you make an early partial repayment, we will assume that you wish the Term to 
remain unaltered unless you request otherwise. In other words  the onus was on Mr A to 
contact Vanquis to say he wanted the loan to be recalculated with lower payments, or a 
shorter term  but he didnt. So, I think Vanquis acted fairly in letting the loan run as before  
with the same payments and term.
Mr A cancelled his direct debit, and so Vanquis used the early payment amount of £2,774.14 
to meet the next series of payments until the amount ran out. And after that, they treated the 
payments as missed and reported them to the credit reference agencies  which I think was 
reasonable to do. 
I also saw that Mr A was sent an annual statement on his loan in January 2021 and then in 
January 2022  so he could have seen what was happening.
Its unfortunate for Mr A how matters played out, and he is now faced with a quote to settle the loan as Vanquis set out to him. But having looked at all the evidence, I think Vanquis 
acted reasonably and I wont be asking them to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 February 2023.
