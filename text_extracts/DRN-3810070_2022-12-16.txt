The complaint
Miss D has complained about the service she received when she called National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest).
What happened
On 3 August 2022 Miss D called NatWest several times to dispute a transaction on her 
account. Miss D says the NatWest representative she spoke to was rude to her.
NatWest listened to the telephone calls that took place on 3 August 2022 and agreed that 
the service Miss D had received was lower than what she should have expected. On 11 
August 2022 NatWest wrote to Miss D to explain that in response to her complaint feedback 
had been provided to the relevant department to prevent the same thing happening again. 
NatWest apologised for the service Miss D had received and paid her £75 compensation.
One of our Investigators considered Miss Ds complaint. He agreed the service Miss D 
received when she called NatWest was poor but thought NatWest had already done enough 
to resolve her complaint. So, he didnt think Miss Ds complaint should be upheld.
Miss D didnt agree. She says the compensation she received was too low considering the 
experience she had and says NatWest should pay her an addition £300 to resolve her 
complaint.
As Miss D didnt agree with our Investigators view of her complaint it has now been passed 
to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As a service we are not designed to punish a business when it gets something wrong. 
Instead, we are here to put the customer back in the position they would have been in had 
the error not taken place.
In this case both NatWest and Miss D agree that the service provided to Miss D when she 
called NatWest was lower than she should have expected. So, I need to consider whether 
NatWests response to Miss Ds complaint was fair.
I have listened to four calls that took place on 3 August 2022 and will now review each in 
turn.
first call
In the first call Miss D called NatWest to dispute a transaction with a retailer. The NatWest 
representative she spoke to started to explain that he would need to send Miss D a form to 
complete. But this call disconnected before any detailed explanation could be provided. 
While its disappointing that this call was disconnected, I dont think the service provided 
within the call was of a poor service.
second call
Miss D called back following her previous call being disconnected. Miss D explained that she 
wanted a transaction made in July to be refunded today. The NatWest representative told 
Miss D that she would have to speak directly with the retailer to obtain a refund. Miss D 
disputed the information she was given, and this call was also disconnected.
third call
Miss D called NatWest again and explained she was unhappy with the service she had 
received on the previous call. The NatWest representative apologised and offered to send 
Miss D a complaint form to complete. Miss D explained she would rather the complaint was 
recorded during the call.
The representative agreed to complete the complaint form for Miss D and proceeded to 
record the details of her complaint. 
Towards the end of the call the NatWest representative suggested sending the complaint 
form to Miss D so she could put the complaint in her own words. It appears that due to 
background noise Miss D started to raise her voice. The NatWest representative asked Miss 
D to speak to him like a normal person. Miss D was understandably upset by this 
comment. This call was also disconnected.
fourth call 
Miss D called again and explained she wanted to complain about the service she had 
received. The NatWest representative offered to send Miss D a complaint form which she 
agreed to. 
The transaction Miss D wanted to dispute was then discussed. The NatWest representative 
explained he would send Miss D a retail dispute form for her to complete. The transaction 
would then be refunded which would take 5-10 working days. 
It was agreed that the NatWest representative would complete the retail dispute form for 
Miss D and that she would complete the complaint form about the service she had received.
As explained above NatWest wrote to Miss D following her complaint apologising for the 
service she had received. In summary it explained that Miss D should have been provided 
with the information she received in the fourth call from the outset and that the way she was 
spoken to in the third call was unacceptable.
Having listened to the calls myself I agree that Miss D was given incorrect information in the 
second call she had with NatWest and the third call could have been handled in a more 
appropriate way. Although, as I have explained above, we are not here to punish NatWest 
for errors it makes.
I think the resolution NatWest offered Miss D to provide suitable feedback to the relevant 
department and compensate her £75 for the service she received was reasonable and in line 
with what I would have awarded had Miss Ds complaint been brought to our service without 
a compensation offer.
So, in summary I think the outcome NatWest offered Miss D in response to her complaint 
was fair and I dont think it should have to do anything more.My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 January 2023.
