K821x#15complaint
Mr L complains  about the short term loans he took out with Casheuronet UK LLC trading as 
QuickQuid. Mr L says that QuickQuid lent to him irresponsibly. He says it shouldve realised 
that he had financial  problems and not lent to him. 
background
Mr L took out seven  loans  between September 2016  and January 2018.  These  loans all had 
one, two or three  repayments. There were  usually one or two smaller repayments followed 
by a larger repayment. Increases to loans are labelled a and b. Some of the information 
QuickQuid has given  us is shown in the table below:

QuickQuid has looked at Mr Ls complaint and said that it shouldnt  be upheld.  It said that it 
did appropriate checks for all of the loans. And these checks  showed  that the lending was 
affordable based  on Mr Ls declared  monthly  income. It said that Mr L wasnt  dependent  on 
short term lending and he didnt  notify it that he was in financial hardship. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ls complaint and recommended  that QuickQuid refund 
the interest and charges that he paid on loans 3 to 7a. QuickQuid didnt agree with this 
recommendation and so the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Having done so, Ive decided to partially  uphold Mr Ls complaint. I think  QuickQuid was 
wrong to have given  Mr L loans  3 to 7a. Ill explain  why.
Ref: DRN11421202One of our adjudicators looked  at what Mr L and QuickQuid said. He thought  Mr Ls 
complaint should  be partially upheld. He thought that it had made  proportionate checks  for 
loans 1 and 2. So he thought that QuickQuids decisions to approve these loans was 
reasonable. 
He didnt think that QuickQuid had made proportionate checks  for loans 3 to 7a. He thought  
if it had then it wouldnt have agreed to lend Mr L money at these times. This is because  he 
didnt think that Mr L could afford the repayments.  And QuickQuid wouldve seen this had it 
completed better checks.  
QuickQuid didnt comment  on our adjudicators  findings about the proportionality of its 
checks or the affordability of the loans,  nor did it provide any new information for me to 
consider. It responded to our adjudication saying:
 In response to FOS assessment which recommends QuickQuid upholds loans which  
were funded after March 2015, we regret to inform you that we cannot  agree to FOS 
recommendations. Please note that in QuickQuids initial  response  to FOS we provided  
detailed information  indicating why the loans were responsibly lent to Mr L. Therefore, we 
kindly ask that you move this case to the ombudsman queue for a final decision.  
QuickQuid first mentioned  this argument in its business submissions  to us in which  it said:
 We started implementing changes to affordability assessment in June  2014  and all the 
changes were completed by 28 February  2015. Starting 01 March  2015, before Mr L 
borrowed his first loan, QuickQuid had implemented affordability review that is consistent 
with the FCA Handbook  and that was in place  at the time we received authorisation by the 
FCA. We confirm  that this assessment was conducted properly and individually for each of 
these loans 
It provided further detail  about the checks it had made when it approved  loans from 2015  
onwards in a document called CEU  Lending Criteria  and Proportional Checks.  And this 
response didnt  change our adjudicators opinion.
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic  argument  directly and through 
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to expand on this point any further here, though  I 
have considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. 
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  in 
how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman  are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent 
who handled  the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  
complaints received by the respondent and using this in training and development of 
the individuals dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
Ref: DRN11421203(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA, other relevant regulators and the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service  and communicating it to the individuals dealing  with 
complaints in the respondent. 
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Ls complaint and what  both parties have  said 
about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr L borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in mind 
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect  a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect QuickQuid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher  the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
Turning to the specifics of Mr Ls complaint. Mr L has accepted our adjudicators opinion 
about loans 1 to 2. Because  of this I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about 
these loans. So I wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But they were part of the 
borrowing relationship  Mr L had with QuickQuid. So they are something  I will take into 
account when  considering  the other loans he took.
QuickQuid says: 
it recorded Mr Ls monthly income  as being  £1,650 for loans 1 to 6 and £1,750 for 
loan 7 
it recorded his monthly expenditure as being £525 for loans 1 to 4 and £925  for the 
remainder of the loans  
it validated the information it obtained using credit reference  agency data
it used the information  it had gained  from the credit reports to adjust the amounts 
Mr L had provided  to calculate his estimated disposable income (EDI)
why I dont  think QuickQuids checks were  proportionate for loans 3 to 7a
Ive carefully thought  about what QuickQuid and Mr L have provided and what  both sides  
have said. 
For loan 3, before the increase, Mr L needed to make two repayments in just under a month. 
He had to make one repayment of just over £100  and one a month  later of over £800.  This 
was a very large  amount  and was around half of Mr Ls income. And this was his third loan in 
just over 4 months  and the amounts he was borrowing  had increased,  although  they were 
always reasonably  high. And going forward, as can be seen on my table above, Mr L 
continued to borrow  and the amounts he needed  to repay remained high. 
Ref: DRN11421204So I think QuickQuid couldve realised at that time that Mr L may have some longer term 
financial problems and he may not have  just been using the loans to help with a temporary 
cash flow problem. QuickQuid shouldve also become concerned  about  whether it knew  
enough about Mr Ls true financial situation.
So I think before  approving loan 3 it wouldve been  proportionate  to fully review  Mr Ls 
finances. And I think that QuickQuid needed to verify this information, as far as possible, to 
get an accurate  picture of Mr Ls finances.  In order to make sure he was in position to make  
the repayments sustainably.
Although I havent  seen  the full details  of all QuickQuids credit checks, it has provided me 
with its estimate of Mr Ls disposable income. This is lower than deducting Mr Ls declared 
expenditure from his declared income  for loan 7 only. I dont know  exactly  how QuickQuid 
calculated Mr Ls EDI  but it has said that credit checks  are one relevant factor.
Because I dont know how QuickQuid actually worked out the EDI, I dont think its 
reasonable to say that QuickQuid has provided enough information to allow me to say that it 
carried out proportionate checks.
And QuickQuid doesnt seem to have fully reviewed  Mr Ls finances in any other way. So I 
need to think about what its likely proportionate checks  wouldve shown QuickQuid if it had.
what I think proportionate checks would most  likely have  shown for loans  3 to 7a
Mr L has provided some information  about  his financial circumstances. This includes his 
bank statements and a recent credit  report. I accept that this isnt exactly  what  QuickQuid 
wouldve seen at the time. But I think  it wouldve  found out similar information if it had made 
proportionate checks, so I think  its reasonable to rely on it.
Mr Ls income wasnt too far away from what QuickQuid recorded but his expenditure was 
higher. As our adjudicator  detailed, his regular monthly living  costs were  about £1,200. This 
included rent of around £500, transport  costs of around £450 and other  household  bills and 
food of £250. He also had regular  credit commitments of around £350.  So his regular 
monthly outgoings were  around £1,550, which is not far short of his income. 
The highest  repayments to the QuickQuid loans were much  greater than the amount he had 
left over.  For example, for loans 3 and 3a Mr L borrowed £850 in total and the highest 
repayment was over £1,000. And for loan 5 Mr L borrowed £800, he increased this by £200 
only a few days later when he took loan 5a. The highest repayments for much of the 
subsequent borrowing were over £1,000 and in the case of loan 7a it was nearer £1,500.
The amounts Mr L was borrowing were so high that I cant  see how, even if the income  and 
expenditure details Mr L provided were correct, that QuickQuid could reasonably have said 
that he would be in a position  to repay them  sustainably. QuickQuids records  show  that it 
lent to Mr L for just under a year and a half. Over  this time it advanced £5,700  and Mr L 
repaid over £8,300. 
I think that QuickQuid wouldve found  out this information if it had made  proportionate  
checks. And I think it wouldve seen Mr L wouldnt have been able repay the loans 3 to 7a in 
a sustainable  way. So I think that QuickQuid  shouldnt  have given loans 3 to 7a to Mr L and I 
think he lost out as a result of this. So Im upholding  Mr Ls complaint about  these  loans. 
Ref: DRN11421205what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right for loans  3 to 7a
To put things right for Mr L, QuickQuid  should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loans 3 to 7a; and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ls credit file about   these  loans;
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr L a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ls complaint.
Casheuronet UK LLC should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 May 2019.
