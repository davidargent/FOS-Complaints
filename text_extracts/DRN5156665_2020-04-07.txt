Mr D says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 5 loans Sunny provided to Mr D between August  2018 and January 
2019. Mr Ds borrowing history is as follows:
LoanDate TakenDate 
RepaidAmount Repayment
1 19/08/2018 18/01/2019 £150.00 £42.82
2 23/08/2018 01/01/2019 £100.00 £70.53
3 13/10/2018 10/05/2019 £50.00 £87.20
4 17/11/2018 14/06/2019 £50.00 £103.87
5 09/01/2019 05/07/2019 £100.00 £109.51
In its final response Sunny told Mr D it did not uphold his complaint. It said that it had carried 
out credit  worthiness, eligibility and affordability checks  before  making  a decision whether to 
provide a loan and it assessed the loans as being affordable.
 
Our adjudicator partly upheld Mr Ds complaint. He said he hadnt seen enough to say it was 
unfair for loans 1-3 to be given to Mr D. But he said that loans 4 and 5 shouldnt have been 
provided.
Sunny disagreed with this view and asked that the matter be referred  to an ombudsman  for a 
final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr D could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN51566652the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint.  Ive decided to uphold Mr Ds 
complaint about  loans  4 and 5. I will explain why.
In the early stages of the relationship I think Sunny probably did enough. As each loan was 
taken out, Mr D hadnt repaid the previous loans  so when he took out loan 2, he hadnt 
repaid loan 1 and at the time Sunny provided loan 3 Mr D was still repaying loans1  and 2. 
But Mr Ds reported  his  income as £3011.67 and his expenditure was a much smaller  
proportion of that, so his repayments would have appeared  affordable. And as it was early  in 
the relationship,  I think the checks Sunny did were proportionate. I havent seen anything  
which might  have indicated Mr D was having  problems managing his money when he took 
out loans 1,2 and 3. 
But when Mr D took out loan 4, he had still not repaid loans 1,2,3. And Mr D was borrowing  
another smaller amount  of £50.00 for loan 4, but as he had other  loans outstanding his 
monthly repayments would have increased. So at this point I think  Sunny should have been 
alerted to the fact Mr D was likely having problems managing  his money and there was a 
risk that Mr D wouldnt be able to repay this loan sustainably. 
Similarly, when Mr D borrowed loan 5 he had still not repaid loans1,3,4 and 5. He was 
paying the highest repayment he had been and again I think  Sunny should have more likely  
realised that that these  loans were unsustainably  affordable. 
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 and 5 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr D paid on loans 4 and 5;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
Ref: DRN51566653remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Ds credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr D a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ds complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 May 2020.
