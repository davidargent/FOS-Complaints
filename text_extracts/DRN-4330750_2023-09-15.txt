The complaint
Mr B complains that NewDay Ltd declined his credit card application.
What happened
For several years, Mr B held a well-known high street store brand credit card. The credit 
facility was initially provided by a third-party bank until NewDay took over.
 
When the brand moved to NewDay as the new credit provider, a new application was 
required. Mr B applied, but his application was declined. Mr B was unhappy that NewDay 
didnt accept his application, so he decided to complain.
 
In short, Mr B said that he thought NewDay hadnt complied with the principles of 
Treating Customers Fairly (TCF). He felt that existing customers shouldve been given a 
new agreement in place of their old one. Ultimately, Mr B felt that he  and others like him  
had been cast aside and that NewDay hadnt shown the duty of care that it should.
 
NewDay sent its final response to Mr B on 30 November 2022. In it, NewDay said that it had 
taken several factors into consideration when assessing Mr Bs application. Unfortunately, 
though, Mr B hadnt met its eligibility criteria. So, NewDay hadnt accepted his application. 
Mr B remained unhappy. In May 2023, he contacted our Service for an independent review. 
An Investigator here looked at what had happened and, overall, didnt think NewDay had 
done something wrong. In summary, the Investigator said that NewDay  as the new credit 
provider  was entitled to request applications from new, incoming, customers. That was so 
it could ensure any lending decisions were made responsibly.
The Investigator also explained that NewDay was able to assess those applications in-line 
with its own criteria. It had done so here and, unfortunately, Mr Bs application had been 
declined. But that didnt mean NewDay had done something wrong. Rather, NewDay could 
make a commercial decision whether or not to provide Mr B with credit.
 
Mr B disagreed. He still felt that NewDay hadnt acted fairly. So, as no agreement has been 
reached, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
At the outset, given Mr Bs strength of feeling on the matter, I think its important for me to be 
clear that our role is to investigate individual complaints. I have no power to make or change 
rules for financial businesses. Nor is it for me, or our Service, to require a business to alter 
its own policies and procedures. These aspects fall firmly within the remit of the regulator, 
the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
 
Ill also say that I havent commented on each and every point Mr B has made, even though 
Ive considered them. I hope he wont take that as a discourtesy; my approach here is simply 
to align with our informal purpose.
Having reviewed what happened, I can see Mr Bs perspective and I understand why hes 
unhappy. He was a long-standing customer of the brand and, in turn, the previous credit 
provider. Its understandable that hed think his relationship with that credit card brand could 
continue, and I can appreciate why he wanted his credit card moved to NewDay without the 
need for a fresh application.
 
That said, while its true that hed had the credit card for some time, the fact is that Mr B was 
a new customer to NewDay. So, with that in mind, I dont think it was unreasonable of 
NewDay to carry out an assessment of his circumstances  before providing him with credit 
 to ensure that any decision it made to lend was made responsibly. In fact, thats what Id 
expect it to do.
  
Unfortunately, Mr Bs application wasnt successful. NewDay did, though, provide Mr B with 
more detail about why. Specifically, it explained that he didnt meet its criteria because he 
was unemployed at the time of his application. So, overall, NewDay has provided Mr B with 
its decision and its key reasoning. Again, thats something Id expect it to do.
 
On that basis, I can be reasonably satisfied that Mr B was treated no differently to any other 
new customer in a similar position. And while Im sure hes already aware of this; NewDay is 
entitled to set its own criteria and assess applications against it. Ive no reason to doubt that 
NewDays criteria is just as its said it is. So, given Mr Bs application didnt meet it, I dont 
think NewDay was wrong to decline the application. Theres nothing, in my view, inherently 
unreasonable about that.
 
I know Mr B sees NewDays wider actions here as breaching the principles of TCF, and Ive 
also noted his general unhappiness at the change from the previous credit provider. But my 
role is to focus on the circumstances of this individual complaint and, for the reasons Ive 
explained, I dont find that NewDay treated Mr B unfairly  or contrary to TCF guidelines  by 
requiring him to apply or when it assessed his specific application.
  
I recognise that what Ive said here will be disappointing for Mr B. I have empathy for the 
position hes found himself in, given he didnt have a say in the brand changing its credit 
provider. But even so, in all the circumstances of this complaint, I dont think NewDay treated 
Mr B unfairly.
 
Instead, I think it assessed his application against its lending criteria and reasonably decided 
to decline it based upon Mr Bs circumstances at the time. So, it follows that I dont require 
NewDay to do anything more.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2023.
