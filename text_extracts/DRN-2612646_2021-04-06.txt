The complaint
Mr A complains that he should get a refund from PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal).
What happened
Mr A sold a watch through an online selling website on 26 May 2020. He sold the watch in 
person and at the same time received £4269.16 through PayPal. On 27 May 2020, PayPal 
told him the transaction wasnt authorised by the buyer. PayPal debited Mr As account with 
the full amount.
Mr A complained. He said he should have been protected by PayPals seller protection. He 
lost the money and the watch.
PayPal said the payment was made under its Friends and Family payment method  which 
didnt carry any seller protection. Mr A should contact the police to try to get reimbursement. 
Mr A brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator said the payment was made as a 
personal payment  and therefore didnt quality for any seller protection. To get this, Mr A 
needed to ensure the payment was classed as a sale of goods  which he didnt do. So, 
PayPal werent obliged to refund any of the money to Mr A.
Mr A asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr A agreed to sell a valuable watch to a buyer from Germany. He told us the sale took 
place on a personal, one to one basis. So, he handed over the watch and the buyer sent him 
£4269.16 through PayPal. PayPal then said the payment wasnt authorised by the PayPal 
account holder and reversed the transaction  leaving Mr A without the watch or money.
I can see that on 26 May 2020, PayPal sent him a message which said, You received 
£4269.16 from (buyer). But on the following day, PayPal advised Mr A that they were 
debiting his account with the amount hed received. They told Mr A the payment wasnt 
eligible for seller protection as it was a personal payment. PayPal suggested that Mr A got in 
touch with the police.
Ive look at what PayPals terms and conditions say about this. Their seller agreement says 
that:
Transactions involving items that you deliver in person in connection with payment 
made in your physical store may also be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection so long 
as the buyer paid for the transaction in-person by using a PayPal QR code for goods 
and services transactions.
The payment must be marked "eligible" or "partially eligible" in the case of 
Unauthorised Transaction claims.
Your sale is not eligible for coverage under PayPal Seller Protection if: It involves a 
personal payment Personal Transaction" payment involves sending money 
(initiated from the Friends and Family tab of the Send Money flow) to, and 
receiving money into your PayPal Account from, friends and family without making an 
underlying commercial transaction (that is, the payment is not for the purchase of 
goods or services or for making any other commercial transaction). 
Also, PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for PayPal 
Seller Protection. Mr A signed up to these terms and conditions when he opened his PayPal 
account.
I can see that Mr A didnt mark the payment as a goods or service payment  if he had, he 
would have paid a fee for this  and he wouldve got seller protection. This wouldve meant 
he couldve claimed a refund (even though PayPal wouldve had to approve that in any 
case). And  the payment was for goods (the watch) being sold  and so didnt qualify for 
seller protection if it was made as a personal transaction.
We asked PayPal what Mr A was sent when he received the money. They showed us the 
message that Mr A received  it says, Mobile Payment Received (Personal).£4269.16 
Fee £0.00 GBP. So  he was advised it was a personal payment.
On the other hand, I can see that he also received a message for PayPal on his phone 
which said (buyer) sent you £4269.16 It didnt refer to it being a personal payment. 
But it also provided a link called Get the Details to the transaction which then said: 
Transaction detailspayment received from (buyer)payment type: Friends and 
Family.
It seems to me that Mr A probably handed over the watch to the buyer on the strength of 
the first message he got from PayPal  rather than looking at the details of the payment. 
If hed done that, he wouldve seen that it was a personal (Friends and Family) payment 
 and without a fee. Given the value of the item he was handing over, I think it wouldve 
been reasonable and sensible to expect Mr A to have looked at the details of the 
payment before he did that. And to think through and understand what that meant in 
terms of his rights of any refund.
Im very sorry that Mr A has lost out here. But on reviewing his case, and what both he 
and PayPal have told us, Im sorry to say that Im not going to ask PayPal to do anymore 
here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 May 2021.
