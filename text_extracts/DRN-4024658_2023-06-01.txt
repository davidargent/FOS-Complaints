The complaint
Mr B complains that the value of his pension with Legal & General Assurance Society 
Limited (L&G or Legal & General) has fallen by around half between November 2020 and 
November 2022. He would either like the original amount to be honoured, or for an 
explanation of how the value was able to fall.
What happened
Mr B had a pension from a former employer, which gave him a guaranteed income in 
retirement. Legal & General took on responsibility for paying this in 2007. Mr B is entitled to 
a pension of £1,243.44 a year from 2026.
In June 2020 L&G sent Mr B a statement. If he wanted to take benefits in November 2021 he 
could have £33,489.01 as a lump sum. There would be some tax to pay on this but there 
was no option to take an annual pension. If he waited until November 2026 he could have 
£1,243.44 every year, or a lump sum of £37,495.02. The statements said that the lump sum 
amounts were not guaranteed. Because they were in the future, they were estimates. 
In November 2022 L&G sent Mr B another statement based on taking benefits straight away. 
The lump sum was now £17,630.78 before tax and again there was no annual pension 
option. If he waited until November 2026 he could have the same annual pension of 
£1,243.44. Or instead of the pension he could have an estimated lump sum of £22,083.62.
Mr B did not understand why the value of his pension had fallen so he complained to Legal 
& General. Legal & General rejected his complaint. They explained that what he had was the 
right to an annual pension and not a pot of money. That pension was £1,243.44 a year from 
2026. Legal & General were not allowed to reduce it to pay it early so if he wanted to take 
anything from his pension before 2026 it would have to be as a lump sum. 
He would only be able to take the lump sum if all his pensions were below £30,000 in value. 
If he wanted to take the lump sum early, it would be lower than if he waited. The lump sum 
was worked out based on things like interest rates and inflation. Because these had 
changed, the amount of the lump sum had changed. L&G reminded him that his statements 
said that the lump sums were estimates and were not guaranteed. 
Mr B did not accept what L&G said so he came to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Our 
investigator said that Legal & General were being fair because they didnt have to offer the 
lump sum option, only the pension. And that the lump sum values would go up and down as 
interest rates and inflation changed.
Mr B was still not happy that he did not have an explanation for why the lump sum had 
changed. So the complaint came to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Legal & General are responsible for paying Mr B a pension from 2026. 
But Mr B wants to take his pension early. And because the rules do not allow Legal & 
General to pay less than £1,234.44 a year, they cant let him have an early pension because 
it would have to be reduced for being paid early. But they can let him swap his pension for a 
lump sum and even though they dont have to Legal & General will let him take his pension 
as a lump sum (subject to certain conditions). 
Legal & General explained to Mr B that the lump sum was not guaranteed and, if it was a 
lump sum in the future, then it was an estimate. It could go up or down.
So I dont think Legal & General have done anything wrong in relation to the offer of a lump 
sum.
But Mr B still wants an explanation of how the lump sum can change. As Legal & General 
explained, the pension of £1,243.44 a year is converted into a lump sum based on things like 
interest rates and inflation. The actual calculation is very complicated.
But I think if we look at just one part of it, interest rates, that might show why the lump sum 
could change so much between 2020 and 2022.
In November 2020 the interest rate that is set by the Bank of England was 0.10%. That 
means that a bank account holding £100 at that interest rate would earn 10p interest in a 
year. By November 2022 that same interest rate had gone up to 3.00%. So the same £100 
would earn £3 interest. 
If we think of Mr Bs pension as the interest (and remember the pension stays the same) 
then it would need a lot more money in the bank account in 2020 to pay that amount of 
interest (or pension) than it would in 2022. So the amount of money Mr B could swap his 
pension for in 2020 was higher than it would be in 2022. If interest rates go down again, the 
lump sum would go back up. 
There is more to how L&G work out the lump sum than just interest rates, but I hope that this 
shows Mr B why the lump sum has changed. And hopefully he can see that it is not because 
Legal & General are being unfair.
Conclusion
So in summary I find that Legal & General have acted fairly and I can see no evidence that 
they have done anything wrong. I hope Mr B now understands why the amounts of lump 
sum changed over time.
I am not going to ask Legal & General to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons given above I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint against Legal & General 
Assurance Society Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 June 2023.
