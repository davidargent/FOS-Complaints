The complaint
Mr B complains that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) was irresponsible 
to lend to him.
What happened
Mr B had two loans from 118 118 Money in March 2019 and November 2019 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly 
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 1 Mar 2019 £1,300 18m £119.76 1 Sep 2020 1 Jul 2019
2 4 Nov 2019 £1,000 18m £91.59 2 May 2021 3 Aug 2021
Mr B says he wasnt required to demonstrate his ability to repay the loans and had other 
outstanding debts at the time. He says he does not believe that 118 118 Money properly 
assessed his applications.
118 118 Money says it asked Mr B about his income and expenditure and also checked his 
credit file. It says it acted correctly in approving Mr Bs credit applications.
Our investigator recommended the complaint should be upheld. She found that the checks 
carried out by 118 118 Money indicated that further lending was likely to be unsustainable 
for Mr B. She recommended that 118 118 Money should refund any interest and charges 
added to the loans and remove any associated adverse information from his credit file.
118 118 Money responded to say, in summary, that there was nothing to show Mr B was 
struggling to repay his other commitments and that it disagreed that the additional borrowing 
was unaffordable.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I need to take into account the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice. 
Bearing this in mind, in coming to a decision on Mr Bs case, I have considered the following:
Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks when assessing 
Mr Bs loan applications to satisfy itself that he would be able to repay the loans in a 
sustainable way? 
oIf not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown? 
Did 118 118 Money make a fair lending decision?
Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Loan 1
When Mr B applied for the lending, Ive seen evidence to show 118 118 Money checked his 
credit file and asked about his income and expenditure. These checks showed:
A declared income of £2,020 per month;
Mr B said he spent £900 on rent, £170 on bills, £150 on food and £100 on credit 
commitments;
A credit file with:
oFour defaulted accounts  the latest of these was in June 2016 and all had been 
satisfied by June 2018;
oThree credit cards with a combined balance of £2,053 with credit limits totalling 
£2,700:
Two of the credit cards had been taken out in the previous three months;
Mr B had taken out five cash advances totalling £340 in January 2019;
oTwo telecoms loans with monthly repayments totalling £81  both were up to 
date;
oFive short-term loans since 15 January 2019  combined monthly repayments on 
them totalled £277.
Based on the above Im not satisfied that 118 118 Moneys checks went far enough. I say 
that because:
The loan was for 18 months, and 118 118 Money needed to be satisfied that the 
repayments were sustainable for that period;
I cant see that 118 118 Money verified Mr Bs income or rental cost;
Given the adverse information on Mr Bs credit file, I consider it would have been 
proportionate for 118 118 Money to gain a thorough understanding of Mr Bs current 
financial situation.
However, I think 118 118 Money had enough information to realise that Mr B was already 
struggling financially:
His monthly credit commitments, including credit card repayments, were over £420, 
as compared with the £100 hed declared;
oWith the additional loan repayment, this meant Mr B was committed to 
spending almost 27% of his declared income on credit;
Mr B had taken out two new credit cards in the last three months, and five short-term 
loans in the last six weeks;
Mr B was also using these new credit cards to take out regular cash advances in the 
month prior to the loan application.So, based on the information it had, I consider 118 118 Money should have realised that 
further lending was unsustainable to Mr B, and I find it was wrong to have approved loan 1.
Loan 2
Mr B settled loan 1 on 1 July 2019, but four months later he applied for a further £1,000 loan.
This time the checks showed Mr Bs debt was almost twice what it was at the time of loan 1. 
Although he didnt have any current short-term loans, he had been taking them out regularly 
whilst repaying loan 1 and was also using credit cards to take out cash  around 30 cash 
advances totalling over £1,400 in the previous 12 months. With increased credit limits and a 
new 118 118 Money credit card now showing on his credit file, Mr B now had access to an 
additional £3,000 of credit on cards.
Although Mr B declared his income was slightly higher, I find it was irresponsible for 118 118 
Money to approve further lending given what it knew about his circumstances at the time.
So, in summary, I find 118 118 Money did not make fair lending decisions for the loans, but I 
cant see it acted unfairly in any other way.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) should: 
Add up the total amount of money Mr B received as a result of having been given 
these loans. The repayments Mr B made should be deducted from this amount.
oIf this results in Mr B having paid more than he received, then any 
overpayments should be refunded along with 8% simple interest (calculated 
from the date the overpayments were made until the date of settlement)*;
Remove negative information recorded on Mr Bs credit file regarding these loans.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2023.
