The complaint
Mrs W complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that shes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Shes being represented in her complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs W entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in February 
2008 to pay for a holiday club membership. Her representative says that Mrs W had an 
existing membership but purchased another membership in February 2008 and, as part of 
that arrangement, the holiday company agreed to take back her existing membership. The 
amount of credit provided to Mrs W in February 2008 was £25,000 and she agreed to make 
120 monthly repayments of £304.63 to Barclays Partner Finance. The loan was repaid in 
October 2013, Mrs W relinquished her membership in September 2019 and the holiday 
company stopped trading in 2020.
Mrs Ws representative sent a letter to Barclays Partner Finance in June 2020 in which 
claims were made under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act. A complaint was 
then made to this service in September 2020 that: Barclays Partner Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mrs W; the holiday company 
failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mrs Ws ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured 
her into entering the agreements, misrepresented the membership to her and used 
aggressive commercial practices to pressure her; all rendering the agreement unfair 
pursuant to section 140A and a claim was also made under section 75. Barclays Partner 
Finance says that the claims are time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Ws complaint should be upheld. She said that 
Mrs Ws section 140A claim was too late and she thought that Barclays Partner Finance was 
entitled to rely on the timing of her misrepresentation claim to turn it down. She also said that 
Mrs W had requested that her membership be relinquished prior to the holiday companys 
liquidation so she didnt think that it had breached the contract.
Mrs W has rejected our investigators recommendations and has asked for her complaint to 
be considered by an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Ws complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Ws complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that 
shed made to it and I accept that she referred her complaint to this service within six 
years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to 
her claims;
Mrs Ws claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs Ws misrepresentation claim under section 75 is that the membership was 
misrepresented to her and that she wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to her - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays 
Partner Finance would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was 
brought outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would 
be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs W could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her into buying 
the membership in February 2008 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been incurred 
as that was when she also entered into the loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made to Barclays Partner 
Finance until June 2020, more than twelve years later which was outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that her misrepresentation claim is 
now time-barred;
I understand that the holiday company stopped trading in 2020 and Mrs Ws 
representative says that Mrs Ws membership was rescinded in 2019  so, when the 
holiday company stopped trading, Mrs W no longer had a membership so I dont 
consider that the liquidation of the holiday company is a breach of contract for which 
Barclays Partner Finance would be liable to Mrs W under section 75 - and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any other breach 
of contract by the holiday company prior to Mrs Ws recission of her membership;
Mrs Ws representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs W 
and Barclays Partner Finance and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst 
other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that the loan agreement ended in October 2013 and 
Ive seen no evidence to show that it continued after October 2013 - so Mrs W would 
have had six years from then to bring a claim against Barclays Partner Finance under 
section 140A  but a claim wasnt made until June 2020, more than six years later 
which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that her 
claim under section 140A is now also time-barred;
I consider that it was fair and reasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to say that 
Mrs Ws claims are time-barred; and
I sympathise with Mrs W for the issues that she had with her membership but her 
loan agreement has ended and shes relinquished her membership and I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays 
Partner Finance to refund to her any of the money that she paid under the loan 
agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 April 2023.
