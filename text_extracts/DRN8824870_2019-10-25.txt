Our adjudicator thought that proportionate  checks wouldve shown Cash4unow that Mr L 
couldnt afford to repay loan 2 and any subsequent  loans. Cash4unow disagreed  and the 
complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Cash4unow needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Cash4unow should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN88248702the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Cash4unow was required to establish whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
The adjudicator thought  that Cash4unow  did enough  before lending loan 1, neither party has 
disagreed with this finding  and so Ive concluded that this loan is no longer in dispute. So Ive 
focused my decision on loans 2 to 8.
After Mr L repaid loan 1, Cash4unow says Mr L applied for 27 other loans between April 
2016 and July 2016. All 27 loans were  declined before it approved Mr Ls second loan in 
August 2016.
Before it lent to Mr L, Cash4unow says, it asked him about his income  and living costs.
Mr L declared his income as £1,800  and his living costs varied from £1,095 to £1,295 during 
the lending. Cash4unow also says it searched Mr Ls credit file and there  were  no defaults or 
bankruptcies recorded  on his file.
Id expect a lender to take into account  the relevant information about a customer  it was 
aware of when deciding to lend.  In this case, I think Cash4unow ought  to have been aware 
from Mr Ls 27 loan applications in four months that it was likely he may have had wider 
financial problems. And in the circumstances  before lending loan 2 and any of the 
subsequent loans, it should  have  been  looking to build a clear picture of Mr Ls finances 
including verifying  some of the information he provided.
I can see that Cash4unow makes the point that it carried out an extensive search of Mr Ls 
credit file before lending  to him and the information  on the file didnt give it cause for 
concern. But I think in this particular circumstance,  a reasonable lender wouldve wanted to 
know why Mr L was in such need  of these  types  of loans and ought to have taken its checks 
further. So I dont  think Cash4unow did enough before lending loans 2 to 8.
Ref: DRN88248703Had Cash4unow carried proportionate checks before lending loan 2 and the subsequent 
loans, its likely to have  found that Mr Ls income was around  £1,854   similar  to the amount  
he declared. And from the bank statements Mr L has provided to this service, I can see that 
he was gambling  significant sums regularly. Around the time of loan 2, Mr L had spent over 
£1,200 on gambling alone.  He was also regularly borrowing from other short  term lenders. 
Mr Ls bank statements show that he was borrowing from at least  seven other short  term 
lenders and had at least £850 outstanding when he was lent loan 2, this wasnt a 
sustainable position and Cash4unow shouldnt  have been lending  here.
I can see that Mr Ls circumstances  stayed very similar through  the rest of the lending as he 
continued to gamble significantly  and also borrow from other short  term lenders.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Cash4unows lending  history with Mr L, to see if 
there was a point  at which Cash4unow should  reasonably have seen that further lending  
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Cash4unow should  have  realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
3. I say this because:
Mr L had been either  repaying or taking  out a new loan for around 12 months.  So 
Cash4unow ought to have  realised  it was more likely than not Mr L was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ls indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
From  loan 3 onwards  Mr L was provided with a new loan shortly after of settling a 
previous one. I dont  consider there were any breaks in the lender where Cash4unow 
could reasonably believe that Mr Ls circumstances  had improved. Particularly given 
the number of declined loan applications Mr L had with Cash4unow. Also the results  
of its credit search  that showed  he was using  more  credit  and repaying significant 
sums to other lenders.
Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed. Loan 8 was taken out 
around 22 months after Mr Ls first. And it was for a similar  amount. Mr L had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Cash4unow over an extended 
period. These loans  are not intended  for extended use and Cash4unow ought to 
have been aware that Mr L was likely reliant on these loans as a long term financial 
solution.
I think that Mr L lost out because Cash4unow  continued to provide borrowing from loan 3 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the length of time over which Mr L borrowed was likely to have had negative  
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Ls complaint about  loans 2 to 8 and Cash4unow  should  put things 
right.
Ref: DRN88248704putting things right  what Cash4unow  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 2 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 2 from Mr Ls credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 3 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 3 to 8 should be removed from 
Mr Ls credit  file.
I note theres an outstanding balance on loan 8, Cash4unow should remove any 
interest and charges  added, if Mr L has made any payments towards this loans, 
those payments should be treated  as payments towards the principal. Cash4unow  
may choose to deduct the outstanding principal balance from the redress but it may 
only do this if it still owns the loan.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash4unow to take off tax from this interest. 
Cash4unow must give Mr L a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  Novaloans Ltd should 
pay Mr L compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 November  2019.
