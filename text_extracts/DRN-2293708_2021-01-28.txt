DRN-2293708
The complaint
Mr W complains about the service he has received from Studio Retail Limited (Studio).
What happened
Mr W says that he:
is unhappy with the assistance and support he has received from Studio
feels Studio has discriminated against him
is unhappy that Studio decided to close his account in June 2020
doesnt think studio should have reduced his credit limit in July 2020
Mr Ws complaint was considered by one or our investigators. They concluded that Studio 
had done nothing wrong.
Mr W didnt agree and so his complaint has been passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate Mr W will be disappointed. But having reviewed everything Ive come to the 
same conclusion as the investigator and for the same reasons.
Im satisfied that Studio has provided Mr W with appropriate support and assistance
Ive seen no evidence that Studio has discriminated against Mr W, or that Mr W has 
been treated unfairly
the decision to close Mr Ws account in June 2020 was one Studio was entitled to 
make
the decision to reduce Mr Ws credit limit in July 2020 was one Studio was entitled to 
make.
Studio took the decision to reopen Mr Ws account in December 2020. It appears that Mr W 
is unhappy with how this was managed. However, if this is the case, Mr W needs to have 
this considered as a separate matter. In other words, I make no finding on this issue here.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 February 2021.
