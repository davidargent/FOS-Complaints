The complaint
Mr C complains about the way that Shop Direct Finance Company Limited, trading as Very, 
has dealt with the purchases that hes made on his credit account.
 
What happened
Mr C has a credit account with Shop Direct that he used to buy a sofa in June 2019. There 
were issues with the delivery of the sofa so it had to be reordered twice and adjustments 
were made to his credit account. He complained to Shop Direct that the balance on his 
account wasnt correct and that goods that hed paid for on buy now, pay later terms had 
been and transferred onto his flexible account without his approval.
Shop Direct said that, after adjustments made to his account in January 2020, hed been 
charged the correct amount but it removed administration charges totalling £72 and interest 
of £117.93 and requested that any adverse information due to non-payment that had been 
exchanged with the credit reference agencies be removed. Mr C wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service.
Our investigator said that Mr Cs account had been incorrectly adjusted but that it had been 
corrected by Shop Direct when it removed the administration charges and interest. Although 
she was satisfied that Shop Direct had put things rights, she said that Mr C would have been 
caused some confusion and frustration by the way that his account was managed. She 
recommended that Shop Direct should pay him £150 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience caused.
Shop Direct has agreed to pay that compensation to Mr C but he says that he wants: the 
arrears removed from his account; his account reinstated to what it was before any mistakes 
from Shop Direct had been made; his credit file to be amended; and a payment plan put in 
place to recover the money owed on his account.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
Mr C ordered a sofa from Shop Direct but it wasnt delivered to him because it was 
damaged, he ordered a replacement sofa using a credit advance from Shop Direct 
but that sofa was also damaged so a third sofa was ordered and further adjustments 
were made to his account;
its clear that his account was incorrectly adjusted so the outstanding balance of his 
account wasnt correct and he complained to Shop Direct about that;
it upheld his complaint and said that after adjustments made to Mr Cs account in 
January 2020, hed been charged the correct amount but it removed administration 
charges totalling £72 and interest of £117.93 and requested that any adverse 
information due to non-payment that had been exchanged with the credit reference 
agencies be removed;
Mr C then made a payment for the sofa in July 2020 and Shop Direct refunded 
deferred interest of £237.92 as had been agreed;
the issues with Mr Cs account will have caused him confusion and frustration so I 
agree with our investigator that it would be fair and reasonable for Shop Direct to pay 
£150 to Mr C to compensate him for that distress and inconvenience  and it has 
agreed to pay that compensation to him;
Shop Direct said, in its final response letter, that Mr Cs account balance had been 
corrected and that he shouldnt withhold further payments to his account because of 
his dispute with it  but he hasnt made the payments as theyve become due and his 
account had gone into arrears;
it says charges applied, and information shared with the credit reference agencies, 
since then have been correct and in line with the terms and conditions of the account;
Mr C says that it should remove the arrears from his account; his account should be 
reinstated to what it was before any mistakes from Shop Direct had been made, his 
credit file should be amended and a payment plan should be put in place to recover 
the money owed on his account;
I consider that Shop Direct has provided enough evidence to show that Mr Cs 
account has been corrected and Im not persuaded that hes provided enough 
evidence to show that the balance is incorrect or that hes now been charged the 
wrong amount for goods bought on buy now pay later terms;
Mr C hasnt made the required payments to Shop Direct since his account was 
corrected and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require 
it to remove the arrears from his account or to refund any charges that have been 
applied to his account;
Shop Direct is required to record true and accurate information with the credit 
reference agencies and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me 
to require it to remove any adverse information that its recorded on Mr Cs credit file 
about the payments that hes missed since his account was corrected; 
I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Shop Direct to put 
in place a payment plan on Mr Cs account but I suggest that he contacts its 
customer arrears support team as advised to try to agree an affordable repayment 
plan for the amount that he owes it  and its required to respond to any financial 
difficulties that hes experiencing positively and sympathetically; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Shop Direct to pay any compensation to Mr C, other than the £150 referred to above, 
or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
Putting things right
I find that, if it hasnt already done so, Shop Direct should pay £150 to Mr C to compensate 
him for the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused by the way that its dealt with 
his account.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Cs complaint in part and I order Shop Direct Finance 
Company Limited to pay him £150 (if it hasnt already done so) to compensate him for the 
distress and inconvenience that hes been caused.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 November 2021.
