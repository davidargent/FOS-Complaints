The complaint
Mr M complains that PayrNet Limited closed his account and returned the money to source.
What happened
Mr M had an account with one of PayrNets agents. To keep things simple, Ill refer to 
PayrNet throughout this decision. In June 2021, PayrNet contacted Mr M to ask him for 
identity documents, proof of address, and information about the source of the funds paid into 
his account. 
Mr M sent PayrNet some information, but PayrNet wasnt able to review this at first as he 
replied from a different email address. After Mr M sent PayrNet the documents again it said it 
was able to verify his ID and address. But it still wanted further information about the funds in 
the account. Specifically, it wanted paper-based evidence of the source of the funds, and 
further information about Mr Ms account.
Mr M said that these payments were made directly to him by bank transfer  but included 
£30 a month in relation to damage caused to a car he rented, and a further £1,418.77 from 
another customer for a car he was renting.
PayrNet then asked Mr M for further information, such as invoices or contracts relating to the 
transactions. In response, Mr M provided a signed agreement with one of his customers  
but said the other agreement was verbal. He also provided further details of his business.
Not having heard anything further, Mr M complained to PayrNet, and referred the complaint 
to us. Since then, PayrNet completed its review, closed Mr Ms account, and in November 
2021, returned the funds in the account to source.
Our investigator looked at all of this. Mr M said he didnt know what had happened to the 
funds in his account. PayrNet confirmed this payment was made on 29 November 2021  
and with this information Mr M was able to approach the recipient of the £1,418.77 and 
arrange for them to be repaid to him. Mr M has separately agreed a new arrangement with 
the sender of the £30 a month.
Looking at everything, our investigator didnt think PayrNet acted fairly in returning these 
funds to source. As a result Mr M was out of pocket and, although he was ultimately able to 
receive the funds from the recipients, this took a considerable time. To put things right, our 
investigator thought PayrNet should pay simple interest (the rate is 8%) from 19 June 2021 
until Mr M got these back. (Mr M says he received £418.77 on 30 September 2022, and a 
further £1,000 on 13 October 2022.) Our investigator also recommended that PayrNet pay 
Mr M £250 to reflect the stress and frustration it caused.
Mr M agreed with the investigators findings. PayrNet does not agree. It says it returned 
these funds to the senders in line with its internal processes  and doesnt think its our role 
to question these processes. And it doesnt see why it should pay simple interest beyond the 
date it paid the funds to the recipients.
As we couldnt resolve matters informally, the complaint has been referred to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Financial businesses, like PayrNet, are subject to a number of legal and regulatory 
requirements. These mean PayrNet needs to have processes in place to monitor 
transactions and mean it may need to review an account at any time. Where it does this, it 
doesnt need to give reasons.
Looking at everything Ive seen, Im satisfied PayrNet was acting in accordance with these 
legal and regulatory obligations when it reviewed Mr Ms account.
PayrNet then contacted Mr M to ask for further information about the payments into his 
account. PayrNet says the information it received allowed it to verify Mr Ms address and 
identity  but it still wanted more information about how Mr M was using the account. After 
completing its review, it decided to close the account and returned the funds to its senders.
Ive considered PayrNets decision to close the account. I note the terms and conditions 
allowed PayrNet to terminate the agreement at any time  and that unless there were 
exceptional circumstances, it would give 60 days notice. And where the account is closed, 
the terms and conditions allow PayrNet to either return the funds held to the senders of the 
payments or, subject to the account holder providing satisfactory proof of the account, by 
transfer to a UK bank account held by the account holder.
Ive thought about this. I accept that PayrNet may have had grounds to close Mr Ms 
account. Leaving aside any specific concerns PayrNet may have had, it appears Mr M was 
mainly using his account for business purposes  all the payments into the account related 
to payments for vehicles he hired out.
But Im not satisfied PayrNet treated Mr M fairly by returning the funds to their senders. In 
response to PayrNets requests for information, Mr M was able to explain the purpose of the 
payments. And when weve asked Mr M for details of this, hes been able to supply written 
agreements and paperwork relating to the ownership and licensing of the vehicles he says 
he hired out. Similarly, the references on the payments into the account appear to 
correspond to vehicles he was hiring out. The information Ive seen doesnt persuade me Mr 
M wasnt entitled to the funds. Moreover, PayrNet doesnt appear to have had any reports 
from third parties suggesting these funds were illegitimate.
Ive therefore gone on to consider the impact this all had on Mr M. It appears Mr M was 
ultimately able to rearrange payment by the third parties to whom PayrNet returned them. 
But this took Mr M a considerable time  in particular, the recipient of the £1,418.77 told him 
he hadnt received anything. It was only after we passed on details of the precise date on 
which PayrNet returned the funds that Mr M was able to arrange for this amount to be paid 
to him. Mr M was out of pocket for this period. Im also mindful that there also appears to 
have been considerable delay between PayrNet receiving the last piece of information from 
Mr M and its final decision to close the account and return the funds.
Thinking about all of this, I find that PayrNets decision to return the funds meant that Mr M 
was deprived of the funds. So in the circumstances, I think it would be fair for PayrNet to pay 
Mr M interest on the £1,418.77 to compensate him for the time hes been out of pocket. I can 
also see that what PayrNet did caused inconvenience to Mr M, as he needed to chase the 
recipients of the funds and obtain further information about when PayrNet returned these funds before he could sort things out.
Ive considered PayrNets further comments. PayrNet doesnt think it should pay interest 
beyond the point it returned the money to source. But Im satisfied that Mr M wasnt able to 
recover the funds initially  and this wouldnt have happened if PayrNet hadnt returned the 
funds. So I think its fair that any compensation also cover this period. PayrNet also doesnt 
think we should question its internal processes. But Im satisfied I still need to decide 
whether PayrNets actions were fair. So this doesnt change my conclusions.
Putting things right
For these reasons, I think the fairest thing to do would be to pay Mr M simple interest (the 
rate is 8%) from the 19 June 2021, two weeks after it blocked the funds, until Mr M got the 
funds back on 30 September and 13 October 2022. (Based on what Ive seen, Mr M 
received £418.77 on 30 September 2022, and a further £1,000 on 13 October 2022.)
If PayrNet is required to deduct tax from this interest it should send Mr M a certificate setting 
out how it has calculated this should he want one. 
I can also find that PayrNets actions would have been frustrating for Mr M. I therefore award 
£250 to reflect the trouble and upset PayrNet caused.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint. PayrNet Limited should put things right by 
doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 February 2023.
