The complaint
Mr K complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc sent an international payment to an account he has 
in Turkey in the wrong currency. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
HSBC have explained that the international payment was instructed by Mr K using 
his online banking facility. HSBCs systems automatically use the currency of the 
destination account in the transfer, but customers can amend it to one of their own 
choosing. 
Ive seen the Advice of Debit letter HSBC sent Mr K on 21 August 2019 to confirm 
the international payment details. The information shows Mr K instructed the 
international payment to be made in Turkish Lira. Im satisfied HSBC acted in line 
with the instructions provided. 
As I havent found that HSBC made an error and Im satisfied it has dealt with Mr Ks 
complaint fairly Im not telling it to take any further action. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2020.
