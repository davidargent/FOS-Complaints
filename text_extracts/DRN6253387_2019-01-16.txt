K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains about a term assurance  policy he has with HSBC  Life (UK) Limited. Hes 
unhappy he cant reinstate the sum assured back to its original level after it was reduced.
background
Mr S and his wife have  similar policies. This complaint is only about Mr Ss policy,  Mrs S has 
no complaint about her policy  and she isnt joined to Mr Ss complaint. 
In 2005 Mr S took out a level term life assurance  policy with HSBC  Life for 22 years.  The 
sum assured was £200,000 with a monthly premium of £30.10. The policy had optional 
annual indexation,  whereby the sum assured  (and thus the premium)  could be increased on 
an annual basis in line with the retail prices  index (RPI). 
In October  2016, due to a change in his financial circumstances, Mr S asked HSBC Life to 
reduce the sum assured to £100,000, which meant  the monthly  premium  fell to £17. HSBC  
Life confirmed his choice  in writing and said he could continue  to increase the sum assured 
annually in line with RPI, with the applicable rise in premium. But it warned, he wouldnt be 
able to revise the sum assured as this facility  had been withdrawn in 2010. Mr S signed and 
returned his acceptance form and the changes were made  with effect from early November 
2016.
In January 2018 HSBC Life sent Mr S an incorrect annual  indexation  letter which  showed  the 
revised sum assured as £278,576 and a revised  monthly premium  of £44.78. Mr S thinks  
this means he can rely on the higher sum assured figure. HSBC Life said the letter  had been 
sent in error due to a system issue. And the higher sum assured is clearly  not consistent  with 
applying an increase in line with an RPI of 4.1183% to a sum assured of £100,000. But it 
offered £50 for the mistake in the letter.
Mr S said hed intended the reduction to be temporary. He was assured at the time hed be 
able to reinstate  the sum assured again  if he wished. So he complained to this service.  
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. He said Mr S reduced his sum assured after 
2010, when the facility  to increase it again was withdrawn.  And hed listened to Mr Ss call 
with HSBC Life when  he requested the reduction, and reinstating  the sum assured  in the 
future hadnt been discussed. 
Mr S felt that as HSBC  Life was admitting it had made an error he should  be put back  in the 
right position. So its come to me to make  a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint..  Having done so, while I appreciate  how 
strongly Mr S feels about this Im not going  to uphold it. Let me explain why. 
HSBC Life has provided its contact notes for Mr Ss policy. The original confirmation  letter  
from February 2005 made an assumption  based  on annual  indexation,  that by the fifth year 
the sum assured would have risen  to £243,331. And the monthly premium by then would be 
£36.59. HSBC Life cant predict  the actual annual increase, as thats dependent  on the RPI 
Ref: DRN62533872In January 2016, eleven years into the term, the annual indexation  letter from HSBC Life 
showed Mr Ss sum assured had risen to £271,193 with a monthly premium of £42.83. And it 
advised from March  that year the sum assured would  be £274,458 and his monthly  premium  
would go up to £43.60. In October Mr S decided  to reduce the sum assured down to 
£100,000. This reduced his premium by almost £30 a month. To make sure Mr S understood 
that once the reduction had taken place  it couldnt  be reinstated, HSBC  sent Mr S a Reduce 
Sum Assured letter  dated  7 November 2016.
On the front page the reduced sum assured of £100,000 and premium of £17 with effect 
from 3 November 2016 are set out in table  format. Underneath this it says Please also be 
aware that the facility to increase the Sum Assured on this type of policy was withdrawn in 
October 2010, therefore should you decide  to proceed with this alteration,  I regret that we 
will be unable  to action any Sum Assured  increases  in the future. 
The letter included an acceptance form which Mr S signed and dated  11 November 2016. 
HSBC Life then realised  while  the letter included the figures,  the acceptance form was a 
template with xxxxx in place of the actual figures he was agreeing to. So it wrote  to Mr S to 
apologise and included a corrected acceptance form.  Mr S didnt return this, so HSBC 
chased him in early  December. Mr S then signed and returned the revised form on 
6 December 2016. The reduction  was backdated  to 3 November 2016.  As  hed effectively 
overpaid some premiums HSBC Life refunded Mr S £53.20, and sent him a revised policy  
schedule. 
The January  2017 indexation  letter stated the correct sum assured of £100,000 and RPI of 
2.4942%. But it showed  an incorrect revised sum assured  of £276,952 and the wrong  
premium of £44.27.  Mr S telephoned HSBC Life on 6 February 2017 to say he wanted  his 
premium to remain at £17. HSBC Life wrote  to Mr S on 6 February  2017  confirming he didnt 
want his sum assured  to automatically increase  that year. 
Unfortunately the indexation letter in January 2018  repeated the same error. The current 
sum assured and premium are shown  correctly as £100,000 and £17. But the revised  sum 
assured is shown as £274,576 with a revised premium of £44.78.  The letter  said if Mr S 
accepted the changes  he didnt need  to do anything  as theyll be applied  automatically. 
But in April 2018  Mr S and his wife must have compared their policies. Mrs S phoned HSBC 
Life to query  why her policy showed a lower sum assured than her husbands when they 
should be the same. Mr Ss position is he accepted  the changes set out in the January 2018 
letter so was expecting  his sum assured to be £274,576. At this point he was prepared to 
pay the increased premium. But Mr Ss wife is right, the policies should be the same   the 
sum assured is £100,000 and the monthly premium is £17.
Its unfortunate a system error meant  HSBC Life sent Mr S, but not his wife, inaccurate 
letters on two occasions. But I dont agree its obliged  to honour the higher sum assured. In 
2016 Mr S decided to more than halve the sum assured to make  his premium more  
affordable. And he didnt  want to increase it in 2017.  And he knew  he hadnt been paying 
more than £17 since then. So I dont think he reasonably expected  the sum assured to be 
increased.
Mr S said he couldnt have received the Reduce Sum Assured letter containing  the 
warning. But while he may not remember, I think he did. This is because HSBC  Life sent him 
Ref: DRN62533873the original letter with the template acceptance slip, and followed this up with another letter 
and a corrected  acceptance slip. And Mr S signed and returned both slips. 
Mr S recalls  being told on the phone hed be able to increase the sum assured again  once it 
had been reduced. But Ive listened to the 28 October 2016 call and I agree with our 
investigator that wasnt discussed.  After completing  security Mr S declined  to speak to an 
advisor to review his financial needs. He just wanted to reduce  the sum assured  to £100,000 
as his wife had done the same. And he didnt  want to change the term. Hes told a quotation  
will be sent to him, which hed need  to sign and return  in order  to proceed.  And Mr S said no 
when the advisor  asked  if there was anything  else he could help with. So Im satisfied that if 
Mr S believed he could  reverse his decision it wasnt as a result of this phone call. Mr S may 
be thinking of the annual  indexation, which does continue after the sum assured has been 
reduced. But that wasnt discussed in this call either. 
Mr S wants  to be put back in the position hed be in if HSBC Life hadnt  made  an error. And I 
hope I can reassure  him he is in the right position. When he asked to reduce the sum 
assured he didnt have the right to reinstate it again. And I dont think  he was told he could. 
Hes paid the right premiums for the sum assured of his policy.  If he wants  more cover  he 
can apply for this with HSBC Life or another provider.
The only error HSBC  Life made was to send him incorrect letters. For which  it has 
apologised and offered £50, which I think is fair. I assume this offer is still open to Mr S if he 
wishes to accept it.  
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint as the redress offered by HSBC Life (UK) Limited  is fair. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 February  2019.
