The complaint
Mr G complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA closed a dispute in the sellers favour, 
despite him providing them a tracking number.
What happened
Mr G bought an item and paid for it using PayPal Credit. Due to the item being faulty the 
item was returned to the seller. Mr G says he agreed with the seller to return the item using a 
carrier service which the seller arranged to an address that they told him so he could receive 
a full refund.
As Mr G didnt receive a refund in a timely manner, he raised a dispute with PayPal. 
Although Mr G provided PayPal with the tracking number of the returned item, PayPal closed 
the dispute and ruled in the sellers favour as they couldnt verify the item was delivered to 
the sellers address. This was because the correct address didnt show on the tracking which 
Mr G provided to PayPal. Mr G received a full refund of the item from the seller on 23 
December 2020.
Mr G raised a complaint. PayPal did not uphold Mr Gs complaint. They said that the dispute 
was ruled in the sellers favour as Mr G had not provided the supporting documentation they 
required to rule in his favour. 
Mr G told us he wasnt happy with PayPals response. In summary he said that he had 
provided PayPal with information during the dispute but they ignored this. He said PayPal 
failed to fulfil their own buyer protection policy and wouldnt allow him to reopen the dispute.
Our investigator did not uphold Mr Gs complaint. He said that Mr G hadnt met the PayPal 
buyer protection requirements as the shipping information didnt confirm the sellers address. 
Mr G asked for an Ombudsman to review his complaint and highlighted that PayPals terms 
and conditions show that he should try and resolve the issue with the seller in the first 
instance. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr G has made a number of points to both PayPal and this service and Ive considered and 
read everything hes said and sent us. But, in line with this services role as a quick and 
informal body Ill be focusing on the crux of his complaint in deciding whats fair and 
reasonable here.
Ive considered what Mr G said regarding PayPal stating that he should try and agree a 
resolution with the seller first. This is what the PayPal User Agreement urges him to do. I can 
understand that he thought that there was an agreement in place with the seller and thats 
why he arranged for the item to be returned so he could receive a full refund. But when he 
didnt receive the refund in a timely manner, he continued the dispute with PayPal.
So Ive considered what else PayPals User Agreement says  which Mr G will have agreed 
to when he opened his PayPal account. One of the steps that needs to be followed when 
raising a significantly not as described claim is step four  comply with PayPal's shipping 
requests in a timely manner, if you're filing a Significantly Not as Described claim. PayPal 
may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third 
party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.
Ive considered whether this step was met. One of the conditions that must be met for proof 
of delivery is an address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the 
transaction details page. So Ive looked at the tracking information for the item sent. 
Unfortunately, this does not show the buyers registered address and so Im not persuaded 
this step was met. 
Ive noted the strength of feeling that Mr G has when hes told us that PayPal have not acted 
in line with their buyer protection. But Im persuaded they did follow their buyer protection 
policy here and treated Mr G fairly when they declined his claim. They asked information in 
line with their policy and Mr G was unable to provide the information that they had asked for, 
regardless if he had sent the item back before continuing his dispute with PayPal. So as 
PayPal have followed their procedure and fairly rejected Mr Gs claim, it follows I wont be 
asking PayPal to do anything further.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 August 2021.
