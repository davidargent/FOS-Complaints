K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118118 Money irresponsibly lent 
him money  which he says was unaffordable.
background
Mr M says he borrowed £3,500 in August 2018  but at the time was in financial  difficulties  due 
to a gambling addiction. He says 118118 Money  didnt  carry out sufficient checks  on his 
finances and that he understated his outgoings  in order to get the loan. Mr M says a check  of 
his bank statements  would have shown the level of his financial problems and gambling. He 
would like the interest cancelled on the loan.
118118 Money says it carried  out checks on Mr Ms application with the Credit  Reference 
Agencies (CRAs) and doesnt accept making a mistake. It says it spoke to Mr M about the 
loan and he confirmed  the information was correct.
Mr M brought his complaint to us but our adjudicator  didnt think 118118 Money had acted  
unfairly or made a mistake. The adjudicator thought  Mr M had said in his application he 
earned about £2,350 a month with outgoings  of about £590. He also thought 118118 Money  
had provided evidence that it had credit scored Mr Ms application  and it was Mr Ms 
responsibility to provide  accurate information.
Mr M doesnt accept that view and says the information on his credit file should  have  led to 
118118 Money carrying out further  checks. He says the lending as made his position worse.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall view as the adjudicator for the same reasons. I realise Mr M will be disappointed  by 
my decision.
Ive looked at Mr Ms application and Im satisfied that on the face of it the loan was 
affordable as Mr M was in full time employment and had declared his outgoings as £590. Im 
also satisfied that 118118 Money  did carry out checks on the information Mr M provided  and 
also looked at his credit file. So I think 118118 Money did carry out reasonable and 
proportionate checks on Mr Ms application  before approving it. I also think it spoke to Mr M 
and asked him to confirm  the information  he provided was accurate.
I appreciate Mr M says he understated his outgoings in order to obtain  the loan and I also 
appreciate that at the time he had a gambling  addiction. But I cant  fairly hold 118118 Money 
responsible for that and I also think that it was Mr Ms responsibility to provide accurate 
information. For the reasons Ive explained I dont think 118118  Money simply accepted what  
Mr M said and that it checked his credit file and the information he gave it. Ive also looked at 
Mr Ms credit file and have come to the conclusion that the lending  was not irresponsible  or 
unaffordable. I can see that Mr M has made regular loan repayments to 118118 Money and 
has repaid about  £3,000. So I think that also suggests the loan was affordable.
Overall as Im satisfied that 118118 Money  hasnt made a mistake or acted unfairly I cant  
ask it to write off the interest  on the loan.
