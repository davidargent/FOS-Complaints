The complaint
Ms K is unhappy with several aspects of the service that shed received from National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest).
What happened
Ms K opened an account with NatWest but couldnt access her online banking. Ms K 
contacted NatWest about this, but they were unhelpful. Ms K was particularly unhappy about 
this because money was being taken from her account that she hadnt authorised and which 
she could do nothing about because she couldnt access her account online. And NatWest 
were also unhelpful about the unauthorised money being taken from her account.
Additionally, when Ms K went into branch to try to withdraw the money from her account and 
then close it, NatWest were again unhelpful and passed her between several branches. Ms 
K also feels that NatWest staff discriminated against her on religious and gender grounds 
and deliberately didnt assist her for these reasons. And so, Ms K raised a complaint.
NatWest responded to Ms K and explained that there hadnt been any technical issue with 
their systems that may have prevented Ms K from accessing her online banking and made 
suggestions as to how Ms K might alter her own internet settings which might be the cause 
of her problem. NatWest also confirmed that they hadnt shared any of her account details 
with any unauthorised third-party as Mrs K suspected and highlighted the layers of account 
protection that all their account holders, including Ms K, benefited from. 
Finally, NatWest explained that they didnt feel that Ms K had been discriminated against as 
she felt she had been, but they acknowledged that Ms K may not have received the standard 
of service in branch that she should be entitled to expect. NatWest apologised to Ms K for 
this and made a payment of £25 to her as compensation for any upset or trouble she may 
have incurred because of this. Ms K wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so she 
referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They didnt feel NatWest had acted unfairly 
towards Ms K in how theyd managed this situation, or that NatWest had discriminated 
against Ms K as she believed. Ms K wasnt happy with the view of this complaint put forward 
by our investigator, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Id like to begin by confirming that this service isnt a regulatory body or a 
Court of Law and doesnt operate as such. This means that it isnt within my remit here to 
declare that NatWest have acted in a non-regulatory or unlawful way. Such declarations 
would be for a regulatory body or a Court of Law to potentially make. 
Instead, this service is an informal, impartial dispute resolution service. And while we do take 
relevant law and regulation into account when arriving at our decisions, our remit is focussed 
on determining whether we feel a fair or unfair outcome has occurred  from an impartial 
perspective, after taking all the circumstances and factors of a complaint into consideration.
Ms K is unhappy she couldnt access online banking for her account and feels NatWest 
werent helpful when she tried to resolve this issue. Im unable to comment on what was or 
wasnt said to Ms K about this issue when she reported it to NatWest while in branch. But its 
evident that NatWest did investigate Ms Ks concerns and found that there wasnt any issues 
with their own systems that may have prevented Ms K from accessing her online banking. 
As such, it seems reasonable that it may have been something with Ms Ks own internet 
settings which may have prevented her from accessing her account online.
To that effect, I note that NatWest believed that Ms K might be using a Virtual Private 
Network (VPN) and explained to Ms K that this may be the cause of any issues shed 
encountered and that she would need to disable VPN setting before attempting to access 
her NatWest account online. And I also note that NatWest provided further detailed 
accessibility support information in their response to Ms Ks complaint.
NatWests actions here seem reasonable to me, and Im satisfied that they do constitute a 
fair response to the issues that Ms K has encountered. And its notable that Ms K has now 
closed her NatWest account, meaning that there is no further corrective action in this regard 
to Ms Ks online accessibility issue I could instruct NatWest to take.
Ms K also complained to NatWest that her PIN wasnt working on her account, to which 
NatWest responded that if this were the case then Ms K would need to contact their 
customer services department to request a new one. Again, this seems reasonable to me, 
and its in line with the process followed by many banks when a customer finds that, for 
whatever reason, the PIN theyve been issued isnt working. 
Additionally, there can be many reasons why a PIN might not work, and I dont feel that 
theres anything in the information available to me which reasonably confirms that any action 
of NatWest led to the PIN issues which Ms K encountered.
Ms K is also concerned that NatWest may have been sharing her direct debit and account 
details with unauthorised persons. NatWest have denied Ms Ks claims and outlined the 
many levels of security that they have in place to prevent the kind of security and information 
breaches Ms K had raised concerns about. And I also havent seen anything in the 
information provided to this service by Ms K, including in her personal testimony, which I feel 
does provide any compelling evidence to suggest that Ms Ks account information has been 
given to any unauthorised persons by NatWest. 
Notably, Ms K explained to NatWest that she suspected her account information had been 
leaked to unauthorised persons because she had been having issues with her internet 
provider, and felt these issues were arising because unauthorised persons were trying to 
access her NatWest account. But if Ms K was having issues with her internet provider, then I 
feel the most reasonable cause of action would be for Ms K to have approached her internet 
provider directly, and I dont feel these issues imply any data breach on the part of NatWest.
Ms K also feels that NatWest were complicit in allowing unauthorised direct debits to be 
taken from her account by a well-known utilities company. But Ms K has confirmed that she 
was a customer of that utilities company, and it appears that pre-existing direct debits to this 
utilities company had been moved over from Ms Ks prior current account via the current 
account switch process by which Ms K opened the NatWest account.Notably, following an investigation, NatWest have reimbursed to Ms Ks account three of the 
four direct debit payments made from her account to that utilities company. And so, Im 
satisfied that NatWest havent been complicit in the direct debits been taken in the first 
instance and have also listened to Ms Ks concerns about those direct debits and responded 
accordingly. And again, NatWests actions here seem both fair and reasonable to me. 
Ms K is also unhappy that when she wanted to withdraw all the money from her NatWest 
account and then to close it, that she was passed between several branches before this 
could be done. But, in her referral of this aspect of her complaint to this service, Ms K has 
provided what appears to be a reasonable explanation as to why this was the case.
This includes that the first branch Ms K visited was a non-counter service branch and so 
didnt hold any money which she could withdraw. Ms K was therefore referred to a NatWest 
branch that did provide a counter service. But unfortunately, when Ms K went to a branch 
that did provide a counter service, she was told that that particular branch didnt have the 
money available at that time to meet her withdrawal request, which caused her to have to go 
to a third branch. And it was at this third branch that Ms Ks request to withdraw all the 
money in her account was met.
I can appreciate how Ms K may have been inconvenienced by having visit three branches 
before being able to withdraw all the money from her account. But I dont feel that it follows 
from this inconvenience that Ms K was treated unfairly. And this is because I find the 
explanation as to why Ms K couldnt withdraw all the money from her account in the first two 
branches to be reasonable. 
Ms K is unhappy with the service she received while in branch and feels that she was 
discriminated against by NatWest staff on the basis of her religion and her gender. And    
Mrs K has also raised some wider concerns in this regard in response to the view of this 
complaint put forwards by our investigator.
Having looked at the evidence Ive not been able to find anything that indicates Ms K was 
treated any differently than any other customer would have been in a similar situation. I know 
Ms K feels very strongly about this point and I hope it helps her to know that someone 
impartial has looked into it and found that the business behaved in a reasonable way.
I note that one incident about which Ms K has concerns involves a member of staff asking to 
see Ms Ks driving license to verify her identity before assisting her in resetting her PIN. Ms 
K has explained that NatWests staff member asked her to take her driving license out of her 
purse and hand it to her, which Ms K was unwilling to do and wanted instead to show her 
driving licence to the staff member while it remained in her purse. 
This resulted in the NatWest staff member taking the position that they were unable to help 
Ms K because they felt they were unable to verify Ms Ks identity to their satisfaction. While I 
appreciate that Ms K may disagree, NatWests staff members position here doesnt seem 
unfair to me, and I dont feel that the staff member asking Ms K to present her driving license 
to them taken from her purse was an unreasonable request. 
Finally, while NatWest didnt agree that Ms K had been discriminated against by members of 
their staff, they did acknowledge that Ms K may not have received the standard of service 
from their staff which she was reasonably entitled to expect. And NatWest apologised to Ms 
K and made a payment of £25 to her as compensation for any trouble or upset this may 
have caused. 
Matters of compensation can be subjective, but the £25 already paid to Ms K by NatWest for 
this potential poor service does feel fair to me, given the circumstances under consideration here. And I can confirm that its commensurate with what I might have instructed NatWest to 
pay Ms K in relation to this matter, had they not already done so. 
All of which means that Im satisfied the response that NatWest have issued to Ms Ks 
complaint already represents a fair and reasonable resolution to what happened here. And it 
follows from this that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any 
further action. 
I realise this wont be the outcome Ms K was wanting, but I hope shell understand, given 
everything Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2023.
