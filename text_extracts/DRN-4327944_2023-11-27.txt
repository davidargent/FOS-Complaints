The complaint
Mr F has complained that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA placed restrictions on his PayPal 
account; didnt cancel a continuous payment to a retailer; and set up a new payment account 
without his consent.
What happened
Mr F added new account details to his PayPal account on 25 April 2023 and on the 26 April 
2023 Mr F transferred money into his PayPal account with the intention to transfer the 
money out again. But when he went to transfer the money out of his PayPal account, it was 
blocked. Mr F says he called PayPal to find out what had happened, and he was told a 
freeze had been applied to his account due to irregular activity being detected on his 
account. Mr F was eventually able to get the block lifted, but was told that it could take up to 
a day for the block to be removed. Mr F was then able to transfer the money out of his 
PayPal account on the 27 April 2023.
During this time, a retailer that hed previously had a continuous payment set up for debited 
money from his PayPal account. Mr F says that hed cancelled the continuous payment 
authority and says that the payment should not have been taken from his account.
During this time, also Mr F received an email saying that hed applied for a PayPal Xoom 
account  Mr F says he hadnt applied for such an account.
Mr F raised his concerns with PayPal. In its final response letter PayPal explained that its 
fraud detection systems identified the request to withdraw money to a newly added account, 
and as Mr F had accessed the account via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), it placed a 
freeze on the account to ensure that the transfer was being made by Mr F and to ensure that 
his account had not been compromised. It also explained that when the freeze was lifted, 
some of the same indicators were present and so PayPals fraud detection system reinstated 
the block as a precaution, until it was satisfied that it was Mr F making the transfer.
In terms of the retailer withdrawing the money from Mr Fs PayPal account, PayPal said that 
the retailer had been attempting to take the money from Mr Fs account since November 
2022 under a continuous payment thatd been set up, but until that point, it had been 
unsuccessful in doing so as there was insufficient balance in Mr Fs account. PayPal 
explained the process for Mr F to dispute the transaction on his account. PayPal confirmed 
that itd look further into Mr Fs concerns about the Xoom account, and to apologise for the 
inconvenience that Mr F experienced, PayPal paid Mr F £100.
After referring his complaint to our service, one of our investigators assessed the complaint 
and they didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr F disagreed with the investigators assessment, so the matter was referred for an 
ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed everything, I agree with the outcome reached by the investigator, for 
broadly the same reasons. I will explain why.
Blocks on account
Looking through the evidence surrounding the block that was applied to Mr Fs account, its 
clear that this occurred due to PayPals automated fraud detection system. PayPal has not 
given the exact reasons as to why the block was applied to Mr Fs account. But I wouldnt  
necessarily expect it to disclose such detailed information, as such information could 
potentially allow fraudsters to circumvent its fraud detection systems. Nevertheless, PayPal 
has explained in its final response letter that a number of factors were involved in the block 
being applied. This included the addition of a new account to the PayPal account; a transfer 
out to the newly added account; and also Mr F accessing the account via a VPN.
In the circumstances, I can see why Mr F was frustrated that he was unable to transfer the 
money that he had put into his PayPal account. I appreciate that Mr F questions why the 
block was put in place, as he says the amount was not unusual and that he had used a VPN 
to access his account many times before without issue.
However, PayPal only placed the block on Mr Fs account so as to protect him from 
potentially being a victim of fraud. Indeed, due to the ever-increasing levels of fraud and 
scams, this is unfortunately becoming an increasingly necessary action for financial business 
to take to protect their customers. As such, I cant reasonably say that PayPal was being 
unreasonable in placing a block in the circumstances. 
Nevertheless, I can see that when Mr F called PayPal about the blocked transfer, once 
PayPal was assured that it was a genuine transaction, PayPal arranged for the block to be 
removed. And although there was an initial delay in it being lifted, PayPal did warn Mr F that 
it could take up until the next day for the block to be removed. I can see that Mr F was able 
to make the transfer on the afternoon of the following day i.e. 27 April 2023. As such, 
although I recognise that implementing such protections has caused Mr F some 
inconvenience on this occasion, I think that PayPal dealt with the matter in a fair and 
reasonable way.
Disputed transaction
During the period that Mr F was blocked from his account, a retailer debited a payment from 
his PayPal account. I understand that this related to a previous disputed transaction and 
PayPal explained that the retailer had in fact been attempting to take the payment for some 
time, but until then, it was unsuccessful as there were never enough funds in the account. 
Mr F says that he had previously cancelled the payment authority to this retailer and so says 
the payment should never have been made. In response to this, I can see that PayPal 
explained how Mr F could raise a dispute about this payment with PayPal. And Im glad to 
hear that the matter was subsequently resolved.  
Xoom account
Finally, Mr F says that he never set up or agreed to the Xoom branded money transfer 
account. Whereas PayPal has provided evidence to show that Mr F had logged on to his 
PayPal account and whilst he was logged in, applied for the Xoom account.On balance, the evidence does indicate that Mr F did apply for the Xoom money transfer 
account. I note that the process to set one up is fairly straightforward. So I think its possible 
that Mr F mayve applied for a Xoom account without realising hed done so. For example, 
under the send option, PayPal provide the following options to send money:
To a bank account
Cash for pick-up
Reload phones
Mobile wallet transfers
By clicking on any one of these options, the account holder is presented with a pop-up which 
says:
By continuing, you confirm you are at least 18 years old and agree to the Xoom User 
Agreement. Well use your PayPal details to create a Xoom account.
This is followed by a button saying: Agree and Continue.
As such, in the circumstances, I think its possible that Mr F had clicked on the wrong 
buttons, or perhaps clicked the Agree and Continue button without reading the pop-up in an 
attempt to get rid of the pop-up and inadvertently agreed to open a Xoom account without 
realising what hed done.
Nevertheless, if it is the case that Mr F didnt agree to it and PayPal had set up the Xoom 
account in error (although I dont think it did), I cant see that Mr F has lost out by this. 
PayPal has confirmed that Mr Fs Xoom account has since been deleted.
So taking everything into account, whilst I recognise that Mr F experienced some 
inconvenience because his attempt to make a transfer was temporarily blocked, pending 
verification from PayPal that it was a genuine transfer, I dont think that PayPal has acted 
unfairly or unreasonably. I also think that the steps it took to resolve the other two issues i.e. 
directing Mr F to raise a claim about the disputed transaction and to close his Xoom account, 
were fair. 
Overall, I think that the £100 that PayPal paid to Mr F was reasonable and I dont think any 
further payments of compensation are warranted in this case.  
My final decision
Because of the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2023.
