The complaint
Mr J complains that National Westminster Bank Plc sent him marketing emails, after hed 
asked it not to.
What happened
Mr J said he didnt want NatWest to email him. He told us that it kept trying to get him to 
accept paperless statements, which he didnt want. And he said that he didnt want 
marketing emails either. He said NatWest had told him it was part of their terms and 
conditions that he had to have an email address, but it couldnt show him where that 
requirement was. Mr J wanted all emails to stop. He said that sending these to him was a 
breach of data protection. 
NatWest said it could see that Mr J had opted out of marketing communications, so he 
shouldnt get marketing emails. It also noted that hed selected paper statements, so it 
agreed he shouldnt have received any emails asking him if he wanted to go paperless. 
NatWest said it was sorry. 
NatWest said that it required an email address for customers to have an account with it, and 
it did prefer to contact people by email, to save paper. It said that if Mr J had a specific 
reason why he didnt want his email address recorded, then he could speak to his local 
branch about that. In the meantime, NatWest would write to him. NatWest didnt think it had 
breached data protection, because it had only used an email address that Mr J had given it, 
and it doesnt send sensitive or personal data in emails. 
But when NatWest wrote to us, it said something a little different. It said its terms and 
conditions confirm it can send some communications by email, so it no longer thought it had 
made a mistake. Mr J would still get some emails. NatWest has shown us that it is 
mandatory for customers to give an email address and a mobile number to open an account 
with it. 
Our investigator asked which bit of the terms NatWest relied on to say Mr J had to accept 
some emails, and it pointed to a section which said Well contact you and provide 
communications to you (which will be in English) by: post; phone; email to the email address 
you gave us; secure message to your inbox in online banking; text message to the mobile 
phone number you gave us; and/or notification through the mobile banking app.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said that NatWest had 
shown us that its terms say NatWest can contact Mr J by email, so he thought that in 
accepting those terms, Mr J had accepted that NatWest could email him. It isnt in the terms 
that Mr J is required to maintain an email address, but customers to have to give an email 
address when opening an account. 
Our investigator said that Mr Js preferences were now set to paper statements, and no 
email marketing. So, although he appreciated that it was annoying for Mr J to have received 
marketing email, he shouldnt receive this again. Our investigator didnt think it would be fair 
to ask NatWest to do anything further. 
Mr J didnt agree. He said hed always opted out of email communications. And he said the 
email caused him great concern as a result. He thought someone had got hold of his 
banking details, and might be going to steal all his money. And he said because hed opted 
out of marketing communications, he thought NatWest had breached the data protection act. 
Because Mr J didnt agree with our investigator, the case was passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator.
Mr J says that NatWest has breached the data protection act. But our service isnt the expert 
on data protection law. Questions around the legality of NatWests actions may be more 
suited to a court, or to the Information Commissioners service. My core responsibility here is 
to consider if what NatWest did was fair and reasonable. 
But I also think that NatWest has asked Mr J if he wants to receive marketing emails, and 
paperless statements. Hes said no. NatWest accepts that it shouldve respected his wishes 
on that, and it didnt. It has told us it has now reset his preferences, so he wont be sent 
marketing emails in future, and he wont be asked to opt out of paper statements.
I know that Mr J said he was initially very worried when he got an email from NatWest, 
because he thought someone else had his banking details. But I think NatWest always 
accepted it had sent this, so I hope Mr J was quickly reassured on this point. And NatWest 
has now apologised, and set things right. I think thats enough to provide a fair and 
reasonable outcome to this complaint. I dont think NatWest has to do more, such as pay 
Mr J compensation. 
I know that Mr J will be disappointed, but because NatWest has already put things right in 
this case, I dont think his complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 November 2020.
