The complaint
Mrs W complains that NewDay Limited wont refund to her the money that she paid for a 
cruise. Her husband is also involved with her complaint.
What happened
Mrs W used her NewDay credit card, which is branded as Debenhams, in October 2019 to 
pay £6,470.48 to a holiday company for a Christmas and New Year cruise. She also made 
other payments for the cruise. She complained to the holiday company and to NewDay in 
January 2020 about some issues with the cruise. The holiday company gave Mrs W a £100 
holiday voucher. NewDay made a chargeback claim and credited the £6,470.48 back to 
Mrs Ws account. The chargeback was defended by the holiday company. 
Mrs W contacted NewDay in April 2020 and was told that the dispute process had been 
completed and the credit balance on her account of £4,929.46 was transferred to her bank 
account at her request. NewDay then said that the chargeback claim had been defended by 
the holiday company and it would consider Mrs Ws claim under section 75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974. It re-debited the payment of £6,470.48 from Mrs Ws credit card account but 
it upheld her complaint in part and awarded her £80 compensation in view of the incorrect 
information that had been provided to her in April 2020. 
Mrs W complained to this service and said that the cruise had been a disaster and wasnt as 
described. Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He had 
discussed the complaint in detail with Mrs Ws husband and he considered each of the 
points that he understood was being complained about. Although he said that he didnt doubt 
that Mrs W and her husband had experienced a number of issues on the cruise, he didnt 
think that he could fairly say that there was a breach of contract or misrepresentation. He 
said that some aspects of the service that they received may not have met their expectations 
but he couldnt reasonably conclude that the cruise didnt provide what was agreed or that 
what was provided was objectively unsatisfactory and he was satisfied that theyd received 
the flights, transfers and accommodation that Mrs W had paid for. He thought that NewDay 
had responded fairly and reasonably to Mrs Ws claim under section 75.
Mrs Ws husband, on her behalf, has asked for this compliant to be considered by an 
ombudsman. He has responded to our investigators recommendations in detail and has 
provided photos showing the food as advertised in the cruise brochure and health and safety 
documents. He says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
the injury, pain and missed holiday that he suffered has been played down  he is 
extremely careful, its a bit insulting to just state that accidents happen and he 
doesnt accept that it was an accident;
there was nothing around the pool or spa area, and no other warnings were given, 
regarding wearing protective footwear;
the holiday companys and NewDays word has been taken over theirs which infers 
that they are not being truthful;
he wants the focus to be on the way in which they were treated by NewDay;
they booked and paid in good faith for the cruise to celebrate a wedding anniversary 
and didnt take equipment to record what had happened with the intent of making a 
claim on their return and expected to receive what theyd been sold, were promised 
and had paid for;
its clear that they didnt receive what they paid for and that the holiday company 
didnt deliver what it sold them;
theyve complained to this service because of the way that they were treated by 
NewDay, that it put them into debt without notification, it mis-informed them and paid 
money back to them only to take it back without notification a few days later;
the time taken to deal with their complaint to the end of August 2021 has caused an 
additional £903 of interest to be charged to their account;
they paid for the upgraded drinks package but on several occasions were given non-
branded drinks and suffered attitude from staff when asked for the correct drinks;
the dress code wasnt enforced for the captains gala night;
there were issues with the cabin and their special anniversary meal which hes 
described in detail; and
on a few occasions they had to bring the crews attention to minors being served 
alcohol and that there was under-age drinking taking place onboard  but it wasnt 
addressed by the holiday company or our investigator.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
Mrs W paid for the majority of the cost of the cruise using her NewDay credit card 
and, in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Ws complaint about NewDay, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company and 
that NewDays response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but 
Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Ws claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
both Mrs W and her husband have described in detail a wide range of issues that 
they had with the cruise and theyve provided some photos and video in support of 
what they say;
this was clearly an important celebratory event for them which included Christmas, 
New Year and an anniversary and Mrs W has described the cruise as a disaster - 
there were issues during the cruise that affected their enjoyment of it and they 
strongly believe that the cruise wasnt of the quality that theyd expected and paid for, 
there were breaches of contract by the holiday company and that the cruise was 
misrepresented to them;
I sympathise with Mrs W and her husband for all of the issues that they experienced 
 particularly for the burned feet that were suffered by Mrs Ws husband  that must have been a painful and distressing experience for him which will have affected their 
enjoyment of the cruise;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the injuries that were 
suffered by Mrs Ws husband were caused as a result of the holiday companys 
failure to provide the cruise with reasonable care and skill or that they resulted from a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company;
Mrs W and her husband were provided with the flights, transfers, and board and 
accommodation during the cruise  theyve described some issues with their cabin, 
particularly relating to the door to the cabin, the lights, a dangerous table and a smell 
caused by a shower curtain  I can understand why those issues might have affected 
their enjoyment of the cruise but Im not persuaded that theyre enough to show that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company;
theyve also described the issues that they had with the food and the drinks package 
 I can understand the disappointment that they experienced as a result of the issues 
with their anniversary meal and its clear that the food wasnt as good as they 
expected it to be  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
the food was misrepresented to them by the holiday company or that the holiday 
company breached its contract with them because of their issues with the food;
although Mrs Ws husband has described the issues that they had with the drinks 
package and non-branded drinks, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that the drinks package was misrepresented to them or that theres been a 
breach of contract by the holiday company relating to the drinks package;
Mrs Ws husband has said that the dress code wasnt enforced for the captains gala 
night and that other guests werent smartly attired and hes complained about other 
issues such as under-age drinking  although they were clearly issues that caused 
frustration and disappointment for Mrs W and her husband, I dont consider that 
those issues are enough to be a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
holiday company;
whether or not a holiday or cruise is of an acceptable standard is often very 
subjective and what is acceptable to one customer might not be acceptable to 
another  but because a customer doesnt consider it to be of an acceptable 
standard doesnt mean that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation;
the holiday company has provided reviews that were posted at the time of Mrs Ws 
cruise from other guests which are very positive and I consider it to be more likely 
than not that other customers will have found the cruise to have been of satisfactory 
quality;
its clear that there were some failings by NewDay in the way that it dealt with 
Mrs Ws chargeback claim and that will have caused her distress and inconvenience 
 it has accepted that she was given incorrect information about the claim in April 
2020 and that it then didnt send her an e-mail before it re-debited the £6,470.48;
I consider that NewDay should have done more to notify Mrs W before the payment 
was re-debited from her account but it has apologised and has credited £80 to her 
account - I consider that to have been a fair and reasonable response to those issues 
and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require NewDay 
to pay her any more compensation for those issues;
I dont consider that NewDay shouldnt have re-debited the payment to Mrs Ws 
account or that theres enough evidence to show that its incorrectly charged interest 
on that amount;I sympathise with Mrs W and her husband for all of the issues that theyve described 
but Im not persuaded that those issues, either individually or collectively, are enough 
to be a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company for which 
NewDay would be liable under section 75;
I consider that NewDays response to Mrs Ws claim under section 75 has been fair 
and reasonable in these circumstances; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require NewDay to refund to 
Mrs W any of the money that she paid for the cruise, to pay her any other 
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 December 2021.
