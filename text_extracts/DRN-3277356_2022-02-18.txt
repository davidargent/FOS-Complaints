The complaint
Miss C is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc wont allow her to open a bank 
account with them. Shes also unhappy with how long it took them to handle a subject 
access request.
What happened
Miss C had a bank account with NatWest, which they decided to close in January 2021.
Later that year Miss C tried to open a new account with NatWest, but they wouldnt allow her 
to do this. Miss C thinks this is unfair because she doesnt believe she has done anything 
wrong. And because shed like to take advantage of an offer where payment of Â£150 can be 
made to someone who switches their account to NatWest.
Miss C also felt NatWest took too long to deal with her subject access request.
NatWest said it was their decision as to whether they allow Miss C to open a new account 
with them. And they said they couldnt tell her if or when their position on this might change. 
They also raised the subject access request for Miss C and have now provided her with her 
data.
Miss C remained unhappy so brought the matter to our service. An investigator here looked 
into the case and said NatWest hadnt treated Miss C unfairly.
Miss C still didnt agree and so the case has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to disappoint Miss C but I dont believe NatWest have treated her unfairly either.
I consider NatWest to be entitled to decide whether or not it accepts a bank account 
application, provided it isnt doing so in a discriminatory way  such as basing their decision 
on a protected characteristic.
Ive not seen anything in this case to make me think thats what NatWest have done. In fact, 
given that they previously closed an account of Miss Cs, its understandable that they 
wouldnt want to provide her with a new one in the near future  or possibly ever.
I appreciate this is frustrating for Miss C, especially as she doesnt feel she has done 
anything wrong, and because shed like to take advantage of the account switching offer. But 
that alone doesnt allow me to say that NatWest has treated Miss C unfairly.
I also appreciate that Miss C found the subject access request process frustrating and to 
have taken too long. But I see that NatWest have processed that for her, so I dont think 
there is much more to be done here. I dont think NatWest has done anything that I could 
reasonably ask them to pay compensation for.
In closing, given how upset Miss C is with NatWest she may wish to consider using a 
different bank, rather than keep trying to open an account with a bank that has caused her 
so much frustration.
My final decision
It is my final decision that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 March 2022.
