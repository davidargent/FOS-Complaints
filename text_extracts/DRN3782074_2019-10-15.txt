K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that MoneyGram International Limited wouldnt process two transactions he 
wanted to make to third parties abroad. 
background 
Since 2015 Mr S has been sending payments to his stepson and making charitable 
donations to a third party,  which I will refer to as B. 
On 3 July 2018,  Mr S tried to send  500 EUR  to his stepson abroad.  MoneyGram asked Mr S 
for more information about the payment. Based on what Mr S said,  Moneygram decided  to 
stop the payment.  
On 29 July 2018, Mr S tried to send 100 EUR to B. Mr S explained that this was a charitable 
donation hed been making  to a military hospital  regularly.  MoneyGram  rejected the 
payment. MoneyGram  returned both payments to Mr S. MoneyGram also told Mr S it 
wouldnt allow further payments to be made by him though its services. 
Mr S says he hasnt done anything wrong and MoneyGrams actions  made him feel like a 
criminal. He wants an apology and an explanation for why his payments  were rejected. 
MoneyGram said that all its transactions are put through routine monitoring and security 
checks. It actively reviews transaction amounts and frequencies and will, from time to time, 
put restrictions in place to safeguard its consumers. If it does not feel comfortable  with the 
send or receive  activity,  or with the purpose  of the transaction, the service could be 
declined. MoneyGram  also explained  that it was concerned Mr S had been the victim of a 
scam or fraud regarding the payment  he wanted to make to B. Mr S wasnt happy with this 
explanation. So he brought  his complaint to our service.
One of our investigators  looked into Mr Ss complaint. He said MoneyGram hadnt done 
anything wrong  and had acted in accordance  with the terms and conditions. And it had 
complied with its legal and regulatory  obligations when it decided to review and reject the 
two payments. The investigator also said that MoneyGram didnt have  to provide Mr S with 
an explanation  and had the right to choose who it decided to do business with. Mr S 
disagreed. He says it is nonsense that MoneyGram  rejected his payments for his own 
safety and pointed out hes related to one of the people he was trying to send money  to. As 
no agreement could  be reached the matter  has come to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see Mr S feels very strongly about  whats happened here. Thats clear from whats  hes 
said to us and to MoneyGram. Whilst I appreciate  Mr Ss frustration,  its important to point 
out that the only thing in question here is whether MoneyGram has done  what it should have 
done. And I think it has. Ill explain why.
Mr S says he hasnt done anything wrong and he hasnt been  the victim of a scam. That may 
well be the case.  But a business  like MoneyGram has to have in place security  measures  
Ref: DRN37820742and procedures in order to try to prevent  fraud and safeguard its customers  accounts.  And 
its not for this service to interfere with these processes. Thats a matter for MoneyGram.
There is a balance to be achieved between MoneyGram assisting individuals  who contact  it 
to make payments  and it providing protection from fraud. Having put a fraud detection  
system in place, when  it flags up a transaction as potentially suspicious, its not 
unreasonable for MoneyGram to act on that. I think that MoneyGram  asking Mr S for more  
information about the payments was a reasonable request and in line with the terms and 
conditions. 
Mr S says MoneyGram hasnt  fully explained why it wouldnt  process his payments.  
And I can understand that hes frustrated that he hasnt been  given a proper explanation.
But MoneyGram doesnt have to provide this information to him. So I cant  say it did anything 
wrong by not giving this to him. Having said that, I can see that Mr S has told us Moneygram 
thought hed been the victim of a scam, which  is why it blocked his payments. So I think he 
had some understanding of why his payments were  rejected  even though  he didnt agree 
with the reasons provided. 
Mr S has said hed been making  the same payments for some time which  he says shows it 
they were legitimate. But the fact that none of his previous transactions  hadnt been  picked  
up by MoneyGrams security systems doesnt  mean it was wrong to highlight the July 
payments. Its for MoneyGram to decide  what factors  their system should look at when 
reviewing transactions.  And I havent  seen  anything which suggests it was used unfairly  or 
incorrectly here. So I cant say MoneyGram  did anything wrong when it declined to process  
Mr Ss payments in July 2018.
I appreciate that MoneyGrams decision to no longer offer Mr S its services  in the future has 
caused him inconvenience. But MoneyGram can make commercial decisions about  who it 
offers services to. They cannot unfairly discriminate  against a customer. But they can say 
they no longer  wish to do business with individuals. Thats because theyve got the 
commercial freedom to decide who they want to contract with. And Im satisfied  that 
MoneyGram has exercised its commercial  decision legitimately  when  it decided  to no longer 
wished to do business with Mr S. So I cannot fairly and reasonably say its done anything  
wrong.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint. Under  the rules of the Financial  
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or reject my decision before 
15 November 2019.
