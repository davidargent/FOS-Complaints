K822xcomplaint
Miss A complains  about the amount that shes been  charged by Lex Autolease  Limited for 
damage to a car that she returned  at the end of her hire agreement.  Shes being helped  with 
her complaint by her partner.
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
the hire agreement said that Miss A had to return  the car at the end of the agreement  
and: If the returned goods are not in reasonable condition for their age and mileage, 
you must immediately pay to us the cost of putting  them  in that condition  or (if we 
choose) the reduction  in their value caused by them not being in reasonable 
condition;
Lex Autolease arranged for the car to be collected from Miss A and inspected in 
January 2019  when  the agreement ended  and the vehicle condition report  
identified some damage to the car;
photos of some  of that damage  were  taken after the car had been collected and 
Miss A was charged  £417 for scratches  to three  of the doors and bird lime damage 
on the bonnet and £250 for a missing service history;
Lex Autolease removed the charge  for the missing service history  and the 
investigator recommended that the charges for the three dented doors  should  be 
removed because there wasnt enough  evidence  to show  that there were any dents 
that would  be considered to be more than fair wear  and tear  but he was satisfied 
that it was entitled to charge £163 for the bird lime damage on the cars bonnet;
Lex Autolease agreed with the investigators  recommendation and I dont  consider  
that the photos provided show clear dents  on the cars doors that would  properly be 
considered to be more  than fair wear and tear;
one of the photos clearly shows significant  damage to the paint on the cars bonnet 
and I consider that Lex Autolease  has provided  enough evidence  to show  that the car 
was damaged when it was returned  by Miss A;
the bonnet damage is consistent with the damage identified  on the vehicle condition 
report (although its referred to as a chip) and I dont consider that the damage would 
reasonably be considered  to be fair wear  and tear; and 
I consider that its fair and reasonable for Lex Autolease to charge  Miss A £163 for 
the damage to the bonnet  and Im not persuaded that that charge is excessive or 
unreasonable. 
Ref: DRN14265512my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Miss As complaint in part and I order  Lex 
Autolease Limited  to reduce the total charge  for the damage to the car to £163.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 May 2020.
