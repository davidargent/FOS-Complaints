K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that he was mis-sold a hire purchase agreement  for a car, financed  by PSA 
Finance UK Limited.
background
In November 2015 Mr S bought a car under a hire purchase agreement financed by PSA 
Finance. In 2018,  at the end of the agreement, he discovered that if he wanted  to keep the 
car then he would have to pay a final balloon  payment of over £7,000. He says he was not 
told about that when he entered the agreement. He had expected to pay off all that he owed 
with his monthly payments. He complained to both PSA Finance and to the dealership, but 
they both told him that the terms of the agreement had been clear  all along. So he brought  
this complaint to our Service.  Meanwhile, his account was defaulted due to non-payment, 
and the agreement was terminated.  (Repossession  has been put on hold while the complaint  
was with our Service.)
Our adjudicator did not uphold this complaint. She thought the documentation had made it 
clear that the balloon  payment would  have to be paid. She provided figures  to explain the 
difference between  what  the agreement said Mr S owed and how much Mr S thought he 
owed.
Mr S insisted that he had never wanted a personal  contract purchase (PCP) agreement, and 
that he had only wanted a hire purchase agreement with no balloon  payment. He also said 
that the agreement gave  the wrong figure  for the advance payment he made when  he 
bought the car. So this case was referred to me for an ombudsmans  decision.
I wrote  a provisional decision which read as follows.
my provisional findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
A hire purchase agreement, whether it is a PCP agreement  or not, would normally  have a 
balloon payment at the end of its term. So whatever kind of hire purchase agreement Mr S 
had, I think it would be essential for him to check the written agreement  to see if the payment 
terms were what  he was expecting them to be. This is not intended  to be a criticism  of him 
for not having  done so. (Indeed,  he may well have done so at the time and forgotten  since.)  
But I dont agree that the agreement was mis-sold  to him. So I will now turn to whether he 
has been charged the correct amount.
The hire purchase agreement is the only contemporaneous  documentary  evidence of what 
was agreed when Mr S bought the car. I have  read it carefully. It clearly sets out the 
following figures.
The cash  price of the car was £16,085 (including VAT). This is not in dispute.
The agreement says that an advance payment was made of £6,300. This figure is in dispute.  
I will have more to say about this figure later on, but until then I must ask Mr S to accept it for 
now.
Ref: DRN20507042The amount  of credit is given as £9,785; this is the difference between £16,085 and £6,300.
The interest was £1,271.28 . (Mr S has not specifically  complained  about this figure,  but of 
course if the advance payment figure is wrong  then this figure  will also be wrong.)
The total amount  payable  is £17,356.28; this is the sum of the cash price  of the car and the 
interest.
Right below  all of those  figures, the agreement says that the duration  of the agreement was 
37 months. Right below that, it sets out the terms of payment. These  were  36 monthly 
payments of £101.73 , followed  by one payment of £7,394 payable 37 months after the date 
of this agreement.
Multiplying £101.73  by 36 gives £3,662.28. Adding  to that figure the advance payment of 
£6,300 (still assuming that it is correct  for now)  gives £9,962.28. And adding  the balloon 
payment of £7,394 gives a total of £17,356.28, which is the total amount payable.
So, provided that Mr S did indeed  pay a deposit  of £6,300, then we can see that the balloon  
payment figure of £7,394  would indeed be correct.
Mr S disputes those figures,  because he says he paid an advance payment of £9,000 . The 
difference between  these  figures is £2,700. He has therefore argued that the true 
outstanding balance is £4,694, which of course is £2,700  less than PSA Finance says it is.
So to resolve this complaint, I must establish  whether Mr S paid in advance £9,000 or 
£6,300.
I have seen the dealers  invoice  for the car. It clearly  says  in two places  that Mr S part-
exchanged his previous  car for £8,500. He also paid another £500 as a deposit: a total of 
£9,000. So the dealership deducted  £9,000 from the cash  price  of the vehicle (£16,085) to 
get a total amount due of £7,085. That is, of course,  £2,700 less than Mr S borrowed.
PSA Finance has suggested that the part-exchange  figure on the invoice is incorrect,  and 
that it should really  be £5,800. It argues that when  it created the hire purchase  agreement,  
someone must have  entered  the 5 and the 8 the wrong way round by mistake, thereby 
wrongly entering a part exchange figure  of £8,500  instead of £5,800. The difference between 
these figures is of course £2,700, and adding the £500 deposit to that amount explains 
where the figure of £6,300  came from. So PSA Finance maintains that the correct  part-
exchange figure is £5,800, the total advance payment is £6,300, and therefore Mr S needed  
to borrow £9,785 to pay the dealer.
However, there is no evidence for that assertion;  it is pure conjecture. To clarify what  I mean: 
I accept that someone  transposed the figures 5 and 8 by mistake, but I think the correct  
figure was £8,500, and £5,800 was the mistaken figure. 
Mr S insists  that he would  never have accepted such a low part-exchange figure  for his old 
car. I have no way to evaluate that now, but I have no reason to doubt him. I am satisfied 
that the correct  part-exchange figure is £8,500,  because that is the figure given in two 
documents: the dealerships invoice,  which is a contemporaneous document,  and the 
dealerships final response letter in October 2018, which it wrote after investigating  Mr Ss 
complaint. I will elaborate.
Ref: DRN20507043Firstly, I think the dealerships invoice is the most  persuasive evidence in this case,  because  
it is a document  which sets out how much the old car was part-exchanged for, produced  by 
the people who part-exchanged it. So it is likely to be right.
Secondly, the invoice gives the part-exchange  figure twice:  in the middle  of the page, under 
the sub-heading  Statement/Summary, and again  below that in a row headed Trade-in  
vehicle details, under  the column Net Allow. In both places the figure is £8,500. Its 
unlikely that someone  keyed  a 5 and an 8 the wrong  way round twice.  Its more likely to have 
happened only once.  That error  would only have had to happen once during the preparation 
of the hire purchase  agreement, so its more likely to have  occurred then.
Thirdly, the part-exchange  figure doesnt actually appear on its own anywhere  in the hire 
purchase agreement,  so the figure of £5,800 was never printed anywhere. The £500 deposit 
was added to it first, and so it was subsumed within the total advance payment figure of 
£6,300. I think  that could  have made  the error  more  likely to go unnoticed  at the time.
Fourthly, although the hire purchase agreement  is also a contemporaneous document, it 
contains another error. At the bottom  of page 1, there is a box entitled VAT. It provides two 
figures, both of which are demonstrably wrong. They are as follows:
Amount within Cash Price  of vehicle on which VAT is charged £13,358.33
VAT at 20.00  % on the above amount is £2,671.67
The second  figure is indeed 20% of the first figure. But these figures  do not add up to 
£16,085. That is because  the first figure is not really the amount on which VAT was charged. 
The invoice for the cash  price  of £16,085  was made  up mainly of the car itself and a delivery 
charge for the car. But it also included five other items, including  two fees:  a first registration  
fee of £55, and a plate transfer  fee of £80. No VAT was charged on those two fees. So 
the total VAT figure  was less than 20% of the total bill. The sub-total of all the items, before 
VAT, came to £13,426.67. Subtracting £55 and £80 from that figure gives  the amount on 
which VAT was charged, which is £13,291.67. 20% of that comes  to £2,658.33, which is the 
VAT figure given in the invoice.
Fifthly, once  Mr S complained to the dealership, the dealership investigated  the matter and 
gave its conclusions in its final response  letter. If it really had made an error  in 2015, then its 
likely that this would have come to light during its investigation. Instead, the dealership stuck 
by its figure  of £7,085 as the total amount which was due to it for the new car.
In its final response letter,  the dealership went on to explain what  it had done back in 2015, 
when it had received  £2,700 more from PSA Finance  than Mr S had needed to spend on the 
car. It showed its workings. It started with the total amount that Mr S had to pay after making  
his £9,000 advance payment  £7,085. From that figure, it deducted  the £9,785 it received 
from PSA Finance, which  of course is an overpayment of £2,700. It then deducted a finance 
deposit allowance of £1,000, so it now owed Mr S £3,700. But then it added  £99 for a 
service plan package.  That gave a total refund figure of £3,601 .
In an email to our adjudicator on 7 June 2019,  Mr S told her that he had found  a refund 
receipt from the dealership for £3,601.  He didnt know what it was for, or even whether it was 
relevant, so I am very grateful to him for bringing it to our attention.  Three days later, he 
checked his account and found that he had received  a payment of that amount in November 
2015, which is the same month in which he signed the hire purchase  agreement.
Ref: DRN20507044Mr S couldnt recall what the refund was for. Our adjudicator reminded him about  the 
calculations in the dealerships final response letter, but he struggled to follow the 
explanation at the time. In case my own explanation  in the previous paragraph was hard to 
follow, I will set out the figures again in a column:
Total amount due, from the invoice £7,085
Minus the amount financed by PSA Finance £9,785
Sub-total = £2,700
Minus the finance  deposit allowance £1,000
Sub-total = £3,700
Plus the service plan package £99                                .
Grand total refund =£3,601
This refund includes the £2,700. If it hadnt, then I would have agreed with Mr S that the 
balloon payment should have been £2,700 less than it is, or £4,696. But since  he has had 
this back already  because  the dealership dealt with it at the time  he cant have it back  
twice. So the balloon payment of £7,394 is correct.
Actually, I should really  say that the balloon payment figure  is almost  correct. Its still wrong, 
because although  the dealership refunded the £2,700 to Mr S, PSA Finance has still 
charged him interest on it, because it wrongly  lent him £2,700 too much  £9,785, instead of 
the £7,085 he needed.
So although  I find that the balloon  figure  was calculated correctly  based on the interest figure 
given in the agreement,  I think that Mr S has been  charged too much  interest.  He shouldnt 
have been charged interest on the sum of £9,785, because PSA Finance  shouldnt have lent 
him more  than £7,085. It follows that the interest  figure should  be lower  than £1,271.28.  The 
difference between  that figure  and what that figure should have been  should be deducted 
from the arrears on Mr Ss account.
I cant see how the figure of £1,271.28 was arrived at anyway, on an interest  rate of 2.52%. 
So I request  that PSA Finance shows its working when it calculates the new interest  figure.
Once the correct  figure has been  calculated,  Mr S must pay PSA Finance the revised  
balloon payment, or return the car. He hasnt yet paid his debt in full, and until he does,  PSA 
Finance will be entitled to repossess the car.
my provisional decision
My provisional decision is that I am minded to uphold this complaint in part. Subject to any 
further representations I receive  from the parties by the date below, I intend to order  PSA 
Finance UK Limited to:
recalculate how much interest Mr S would have been charged if he had only 
borrowed £7,085  instead of £9,785, and
deduct the difference from his arrears.
PSA Finance UK Limited must show how it calculated the new interest figure, so that I can 
verify that it is correct  before Mr S decides  whether to accept my final decision or not.
Ref: DRN20507045To be clear, I do not intend to require PSA Finance UK Limited  to deduct £2,700 from the 
arrears, because Mr S has had this refunded to him already.
I invite submissions from both parties about whether  any further compensation, and how 
much, should be awarded for any distress  or inconvenience caused to Mr S.
responses to my provisional  findings
Mr S accepted my provisional decision. He did not ask for additional compensation.
PSA Finance accepted  my findings.  It calculated  that Mr S had been charged  excess interest 
of £204.07 (and showed its workings). It agreed to reduce the balloon payment  by that 
amount.
my findings
I have checked  how PSA Finance worked out the figure of £204.07,  and I agree that it is 
correct. When that is deducted  from the balloon payment, that gives  a new balloon payment 
figure of £7,189.93. Mr S will have  to pay that if he wishes to keep the car.
Alternatively, if Mr S no longer wishes to keep the car, then I encourage him to contact PSA 
Finance as soon  as possible and arrange to have  the car returned to them,  to avoid the need  
for court action for repossession.
I have considered whether to order PSA Finance to refund £204.07 to Mr S if he returns  the 
car, but on balance I dont  think that would be fair, because the car will have depreciated in 
value during the time since the hire purchase  agreement ended.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order PSA Finance  UK Limited  to deduct 
£204.07 from the balloon payment figure.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 January 2020.
