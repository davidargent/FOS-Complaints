K820x#14complaint
Mr F complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase  agreement with 
FirstRand Bank Limited, trading as MotoNovo Finance, wasnt of satisfactory quality. 
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
MotoNovo Finance,  as the supplier  of the car, was responsible  for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality  when  it was supplied to Mr F - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend  on a number of factors, including  the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to him was about  five and a half years old, had been  driven  
for 85,000 miles and had a price of Â£11,485  - satisfactory quality also covers  
durability which means that the components within  the car must be durable  and last a 
reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long that time is will depend on a 
number of factors;
Mr F says that within a month of the car being  supplied to him there  were  issues  with 
the start/stop function, the gearbox and the reversing camera so he returned the car 
to the dealer for repairs  but no fault with the gearbox could  be found and he paid 
for the battery to be replaced;
he says that there have also been issues with the headlight  unit, tyres, front 
suspension and front brake discs and pads and that hes paid for those issues (other 
than the brakes)  to be dealt with;
he complained  to MotoNovo Finance about the issues with the car in January 2019, 
about seven months after it was supplied  to him, and said that hed been able to 
drive about 12,000  miles in the car;
it didnt uphold his complaint because  it said that the repairs  had removed  its 
opportunity to investigate  liability  and it would  need to evidence  that the faults were 
the responsibility of the dealer;
the car passed  an MOT test with no advisories in June 2018, was supplied  to Mr F 
that month and he was able to drive about 12,000  miles in it between then and 
January 2019  when  he complained to MotoNovo  Finance;
there have clearly been some issues with the car and I sympathise with Mr F for that 
 but some of those  issues have been  repaired by the dealer  and Mr F has paid for 
some of the issues to be dealt  with; 
Ref: DRN27109512brakes and tyres are wear and tear items and no issues with them were identified  
when the car passed the MOT test  so I consider  any issues  with the brakes  and 
tyres to be Mr Fs responsibility;
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that the other issues  about 
which Mr F has complained were present when the car was supplied to him - so Im 
not persuaded that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality at that time or that MotoNovo 
Finance has acted incorrectly in response  to Mr Fs complaint;  and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
MotoNovo Finance:  to allow Mr F to reject  the car; to pay for it to be repaired; to pay 
him any compensation; or to take any other action in response  to his complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 June 2020.
