K821x#15complaint
Mr D complains that Harvey & Thompson Limited  (H&T) was irresponsible  to lend to him.
background
H&T provided loans  to Mr D between May 2006 and January 2011.
H&T has only been able to provide limited information about  this lending (which  is 
unsurprising after so long). But our adjudicator looked at the complaint and worked out the 
information thats set out in the table below. H&T appears to have  accepted this gives  an 
accurate picture  of Mr Ds lending  so Ive based my decision on the information  shown.

1 09/05/2006 09/06/2006 1 £174.00 £200.00
2 05/06/2006 06/07/2006 1 £174.00 £200.00
3 05/07/2006 09/08/2006 1 £261.00 £300.00

Mr D complained that these loans were unaffordable for him.  
Our adjudicator partly upheld the complaint. He thought he hadnt seen enough to say it was 
unfair for H&T to provide  loans 1 to 6 to Mr D - but all of the loans from loan 7 onwards 
shouldn't have been lent. Our adjudicator set out the steps he felt H&T should  take to put 
things right for Mr D.
After consideration  of our adjudicators view, H&T told us it was happy  to agree our 
adjudicators findings.  So our adjudicator asked H&T to send us details of the offer it planned 
to make and to show us how this had been worked  out.
Nothing further has been heard from H&T and the date by which  our adjudicator  asked for a 
response has passed. So the case comes  to me to issue a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
H&T needed to take steps to ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In practice this means 
that it should have carried out reasonable checks to make sure Mr D could repay the loans 
in a sustainable manner. 
Ref: DRN87891272These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable. 
But certain factors might  point to the fact that H&T should fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
H&T was required to establish whether Mr D could  sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. 
Loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint.
Like the adjudicator,  I think  the gap in lending between loan 3 and loan 4 was long enough 
for H&T reasonably to think  that Mr D had put his finances in order  as it would  seem  that he 
hadnt been dependent on high cost short term loans during this period. This meant that 
when Mr D applied for loan 4 in August 2007, around a year or so after hed paid loan 3, he 
was effectively starting over.
So I think it was fair for H&T to treat this as a new chain of borrowing and assess Mr Ds 
lending requests accordingly.
This means  Im looking at two lending chains with loans 1 - 3 in chain 1 and loan 4 onwards 
making up chain  2.
Ref: DRN87891273I agree  with what our adjudicator said about  loans 1  6 and that there isnt enough 
information to say H&T shouldnt have provided  these loans. Mr D hasnt raised any 
objection to the adjudicators recommendation in relation to these loans, so I dont think that 
I need to say more  about them.
Also, I agree  with our adjudicator that by loan 7, H&T shouldve  seen that Mr Ds borrowing 
history indicated that he was likely having money  problems and finding  it difficult  to repay his 
loans. So this loan was unfair  and H&T shouldnt have provided loan 7  or any of the loans 
that followed.  
And I think that by loan 10 H&T ought to have  realised it was likely  Mr D was borrowing 
further to cover the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances each time 
and that his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.  
I think that Mr D lost out when H&T provided loan 10 because:
this loan had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time 
and even after allowing for the break in lending and a new chain  of borrowing starting 
with loan 4, the length  of time over which Mr D borrowed these loans  was likely to 
have negative implications on his ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him 
in the market for high-cost loans. 
So I think H&T was right to agree to refund all interest  and charges in line with our 
adjudicators recommendation in relation to loan 7 onwards. 
putting things right  what H&T should do
A)add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr D towards interest,  fees and 
charges on loans 7  10, including payments made to a third party where  applicable, 
but not including anything  already  refunded
B)calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr D which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr D originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled
C)pay Mr D the total of "A" plus "B"
D)remove any adverse information  H&T recorded  on Mr Ds credit file in relation to 
loans 7 - 9 
E)the overall pattern of Mr Ds borrowing by loan 10 means any information recorded 
about this loan is adverse, so H&T should remove  this loan entirely from Mr Ds credit  
file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires H&T to take off tax from this interest. If Mr D asks H&T 
for a certificate showing how much  tax has been  taken off, H&T should  provide this.
Ref: DRN87891274my final decision
I uphold this complaint  and direct Harvey & Thompson Limited to take the steps set out 
above to put things right for Mr D.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2020.
