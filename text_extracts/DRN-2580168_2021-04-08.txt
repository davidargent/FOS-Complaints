The complaint
Mr W complains Fairmead Insurance Limited have declined his home insurance claim.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
Mr W raised issues that relate to the information given to him at the time the policy was sold 
to him. I can see these complaint points have been addressed under a separate reference 
against the broker of the policy. So I wont comment on issues relating to this further here. 
My decision focusses on whether Fairmead, the policys underwriter have acted fairly in 
declining Mr Ws claim.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The policy says said it doesnt cover accidental damage to items used for business 
purposes 
Mr W has confirmed the laptop belonged to his employer and is used for business 
purposes, which became clear to Fairmead when he provided proof of ownership
As the laptop is owned by Mr Ws employer, and not Mr W, he wouldnt have an 
insurable interest in the item. So I dont think Fairmead have acted unfairly in 
concluding that any damage to it isnt covered under his personal policy
So for these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 May 2021.
