The complaint
B  a limited company, complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) refused to 
process a payment, was rude and caused embarrassment in front of a supplier, damaging 
the business. It would like £50,000 compensation for this.
What happened
B is owned by Mr H, and for ease of reading, Ill refer to him throughout this decision. Mr H 
had banked with NatWest for many years. He says his business was growing rapidly as hed 
secured a new overseas supplier four months earlier, after three years of development work. 
Mr H says the supplier was visiting him as part of a due diligence check. Mr H says his 
supplier accompanied him to a NatWest branch where Mr H wanted to make a payment to 
him.
Mr H approached a member of staff, who Ill call Mr A, and asked to make the payment. Mr A 
said it couldnt be made, broadly because it relied on a payment coming into Mr Hs account 
that day which hadnt fully cleared. Mr H disputed this saying it had cleared and wanted to 
know the real reason. 
Both Mr H and Mr A have provided their recollection of what happened next with differing 
views on who escalated the exchanges. Mr H says Mr A was rude and raised his voice 
before asking Mr H to leave the branch. Mr A says Mr H was aggressive and intimidating. 
But both Mr H and NatWest accept that a police officer entered the branch. The officer had 
heard some of the exchange and asked Mr H to leave and after some further argument, 
escorted Mr H from the branch.
Mr H says he called NatWest business banking and was told the payment had cleared. He 
was able to pay the supplier the next day. He complained to NatWest, saying the incident 
ended his relationship with his supplier, damaging his business. 
NatWest reviewed the CCTV footage, which has since been deleted. It said this showed a 
heated discussion but there was no audio so what was said wasnt available. In its final 
response letter sent to Mr H, NatWest said it felt it should have handled the situation better, 
avoiding the involvement of the police. NatWest offered £250 in compensation. It suggested 
Mr H send a copy of its letter to his supplier to show the matter escalated needlessly, due to 
the poor service. 
Mr H rejected NatWests offer and referred his complaint to our service. NatWest provided 
additional information including a full statement obtained from Mr A referenced above. 
NatWest said on reflection and in contrast to the FRL sent to Mr H it now felt that it hadnt 
done anything wrong and Mr A had handled a difficult situation well. It said it considered its 
offer of £250 very fair. Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint, he said there was a 
disagreement but wouldnt lay blame as to who was responsible as he wasnt there. 
He said Mr As refusal to process the payment had caused the dispute. But said Mr A was 
carrying out a verification check required by NatWests system and that a bank has a 
responsibility to process payments in a manner which doesnt cause it risk. So, NatWest 
hadnt been unreasonable in not agreeing to make the payment at the time.
In terms of damage to Mr Hs business, our investigator said he could only consider what 
had happened, not what might have. He said there wasnt conclusive evidence that the 
incident in the branch lost Mr H his supplier. And in any case as it was a relatively short 
relationship there was no track record to demonstrate a tangible loss. He agreed Mr H had 
been embarrassed and said the £250 offered by NatWest was fair and reasonable 
compensation for this. Mr H disagreed. He said NatWest was chasing repayment of an 
overdraft and then closed all his accounts with it. As Mr H doesnt agree it has come to me to 
decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I do not uphold the complaint. I know my decision will disappoint Mr H, so Ill 
explain why Ive reached it.
I am only considering the initial complaint Mr H has made about the incident in the branch 
and not any debt recovery or account closure matters. These are separate issues which he 
will need to take up with NatWest directly. He may be able to refer them to our service if he 
isnt satisfied with NatWests response.
This was a very unfortunate situation, but I dont think NatWest has done anything wrong. 
Verification checks are generally part of banking procedures and the payment made into Mr 
Hs account may not have been fully cleared at that point. So, I dont think NatWest was at 
fault in not processing the payment at the time if its requirements werent met. The situation 
then seems to have become heated almost immediately.
When Mr H didnt leave the branch after being asked, Mr A says he went outside the branch 
to see if a police officer was nearby (the branch is within the concourse of a large train 
station where officers are on duty at most times) but there wasnt. I think Mr A must have 
been very concerned to do this. 
A plain clothes officer then came into the branch and observed some of the exchange before 
identifying himself to Mr H. Mr A says another officer also came in after hearing raised 
voices. Mr H accepts the police told him to leave but that he continued to question what was 
happening at which point the police escorted me out of the train station in front of my 
supplier.  
Sometimes situations can become heated and thats clearly whats happened here, but I 
havent seen anything to suggest that NatWest acted unfairly towards Mr H or made any 
mistakes in how it handled the payment or the situation around it. In any event, it seems like 
the payment was made the next day and in line with NatWests processes. So, if there was a 
subsequent problem with the supplier, I dont think itd be fair to hold NatWest liable for this.
NatWest has offered £250 for any embarrassment caused and Mr H should contact NatWest 
if he now wishes to accept this on behalf of B. But as I dont think NatWest has treated B 
unfairly or unreasonably, I wont be asking them to do anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is that I that I do not uphold the complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask B to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2020.
