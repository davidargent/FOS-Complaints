The complaint
Miss T complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
Black Horse Limited, trading as Land Rover Financial Services, wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A nearly new car was supplied to Miss T under a hire purchase agreement with Land Rover 
Financial Services that she electronically signed in June 2016. She had some issues with 
the car relating mainly to its diesel particulate filter which has been regenerated and 
replaced. She complained to Land Rover Financial Services in August 2017 about the issues 
with the car and said that she wanted to reject it. It said that that the dealer had repaired the 
car and confirmed there was no fault with it and the reason that she was experiencing such 
issues was down to the way the car was being driven. 
Miss T says that she continued to have issues with the car and it had to be repaired 
frequently until she returned the car when the agreement ended. She complained again to 
Land Rover Financial Services and it accepted that the car wasnt of satisfactory when it was 
supplied to her. It offered to waive the excess mileage charge of £1,221.19 and to pay 
Miss T £5,706.84 as a partial refund of her monthly payments, with interest (net of tax) of 
£1,535, £2,756.25 for any potential loss of enjoyment she may have experienced and £1,500 
for any trouble or upset caused by the issues. Miss T didnt accept its offer and complained 
to this service.
Our investigator recommended that her complaint should be upheld. He said that, in addition 
to the payments offered by Land Rover Financial Services, it should also refund to Miss T 
the deposit of £500 that she paid for the car and repair costs totalling £1,104.93. Land Rover 
Financial Services has accepted those recommendations but Miss T has asked for her 
complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that the amounts proposed arent 
satisfactory.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Land Rover Financial Services, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for 
ensuring that it was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss T - whether or 
not it was of satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, 
including the age and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Miss T was a nearly new car and had only been driven 
for 1,664 miles so I consider that it was reasonable for her to expect that it would be 
free from defects;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
its clear that Miss T has had considerable issues with the car, that those issues 
started soon after the car was supplied to her and continued until she returned the 
car when the agreement ended;
Land Rover Financial Services said in its final response letter to Miss T: The fact 
[the dealer has] continued to repair the vehicle at their cost over the number of years 
along with the sheer number of times the vehicle was returned, then it is plausible 
there is an underlying issue with the vehicle that was never resolved. As a result you 
have suffered impaired use of the vehicle on an ongoing basis for the 4 years of 
ownership. Therefore considering the short amount of time and mileage elapsed 
when the first issue was raised and the fact the issue has continued to persist with no 
resolution, I would consider the vehicle was not of a satisfactory quality at the time of 
sale;
as Land Rover Financial Services has accepted that the car wasnt of satisfactory 
quality when it was supplied to Miss T, Im satisfied that it wasnt of satisfactory 
quality at that time so havent considered that any further;
the cars mileage when it was returned by Miss T was 33,413 miles and she had 
exceeded the permitted maximum mileage of 26,144 miles that was set out in the 
agreement by 7,269 miles and which would have led to an excess mileage charge of 
£1,221.19 - Land Rover Financial Services has offered to waive that charge;
it says that Miss T had made 48 monthly payments of £348.58 for the car (so a total 
of £16,731.84) and, based on a permitted mileage of 24,500 miles and a fair usage 
charge of 45p for each mile, she would have paid £11,025 so it offered to refund the 
difference between £16,731.84 and £11,025 (which is £5,706.84) to Miss T  and 
also to refund to her 25% of £11,025 (which is £2,756.25) for her loss of enjoyment of 
the car;
it also offered to pay her £1,500 for the distress and inconvenience that shes been 
caused;
our investigator said that Miss T had paid a deposit of £500 for the car which he 
recommended should be refunded to her with interest  and Land Rover Financial 
Services has agreed to that recommendation;
Miss T has provided receipts to show that she paid £1,104.93 for the issues with the 
car to be repaired and our investigator recommended that Land Rover Financial 
Services should reimburse her for those costs, with interest  and it has also agreed 
to that recommendation;
Miss T has paid a total of £17,231.84 for the car (her monthly payments of 
£16,731.84 and her deposit of £500) and Land Rover Financial Services has agreed 
to refund her deposit and £8,463.09 (which is £5,706.84 based on fair usage and 
£2,756.25 for her loss of enjoyment) and thats more than half of the total that she 
paid for the car  and its agreed to pay her interest on that amount, net of tax, of 
£1,535;
Miss T had the car for four years and was able to use it to drive more than 30,000 
miles  I consider that its fair and reasonable that she should pay for that use and I 
consider that Land Rover Financial Services offer to refund a total of £8,963.09  
which reduces the amount that she will have paid for the use of the car to £8,268.75 
is fair and reasonable in these circumstances (and its also agreed to pay her interest of £1,535, to waive the excess mileage charge, to reimburse her for the repair costs 
and to pay her £1,500 compensation for her distress and inconvenience); and
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Land Rover 
Financial Services to pay any more compensation to Miss T than was recommended 
by our investigator or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Land Rover Financial 
Services to waive any charge for excess mileage and to refund to Miss T her deposit of £500 
and a total of £8,463.09 (£5,706.84 based on fair usage and £2,756.25 for her loss of 
enjoyment). I find that it should also pay interest on that amount of £1,535 net of tax. I also 
find that it should reimburse her for the repair costs of £1,104.93 and that it should pay 
interest on her deposit and the repair costs. I find that it should pay Miss T £1,500 to 
compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that shes been caused.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss Ts complaint and I order Black Horse Limited, trading as 
Land Rover Financial Services, to:
1. Waive any charge for excess mileage.
2. Refund to Miss T the £500 deposit that she paid for the car.
3. Pay £8,463.09 to Miss T as referred to above.
4. Pay interest on that amount, net of tax, of £1,535.
5. Pay £1,104.93 to Miss T to reimburse her for the repair costs that shes incurred.
6. Pay interest on the amounts at 2 and 5 above at an annual rate of 8% simple from 
the date of each payment to the date of settlement.
7. Pay £1,500 to Miss T to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that 
shes been caused.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Land Rover Financial Services to deduct tax from the 
interest payment referred to at 6 above. Land Rover Financial Services must give Miss T a 
certificate showing how much tax its deducted if she asks it for one.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 February 2022.
