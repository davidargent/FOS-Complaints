The complaint
Mr H complains about a decision taken by National Westminster Bank Plc (Nat West) to
not refund a disputed payment to his current account (account) and about how it handled
his complaint in respect of the same.
What happened
On 31 July 2021 Mr H entered into a contract, with a company that I will call E, for the hire
of a car.
On 3 August 2021 NatWest debited the sum of £266.72 to Mr Hs account in respect of the
above.
On 7 August 2021 Mr H called NatWest to raise a dispute in respect of the payment he had
made to E of £266.72.
On 7 August 2021 Mr H called NatWest to complain about the service he had received from
it to date.
On 7 August 2021 Mr H called NatWest again to complain about the service he had received
from it to date. During this call NatWest logged a payment dispute for Mr H in respect of the
sum of £266.72 he had paid E.
On 10 August 2021 NatWest took the decision not to refund the sum of £266.72 Mr H had
disputed, or to pursue a chargeback against E for a refund. NatWest says this was because
the number of payment disputes raised by Mr H in the preceding 12 months.
On 12 August 2021 E agreed to refund Mr H £30.
On 16 August 2021 NatWest credited Mr Hs account £30 in respect of the above.
On 22 August 2021 NatWest issued Mr H with a final response letter (first FRL). Under
cover of this first FRL NatWest said (amongst other things):
it stood by its decision not to refund Mr H the disputed sum of £266.72 and to not
raise a chargeback against E for a refund
there had been a degree of poor service on its part and for this it had credited Mr Hs
account with £50
On 23 August 2021 NatWest credited Mr Hs account £50 in respect of the above.
On 31 August 2021 Mr H called NatWest (on more than one occasion) to complain about
(amongst other things) its decision to not refund the disputed sum of £266.72 and about the
service he had received from it to date.
On 4 September 2021 Mr H called NatWest to complain about (amongst other things) its
decision to not refund the disputed sum of £266.72 and about the service he had received
from it to date.
On 5 September 2021 NatWest issued Mr H with a final response letter (second FRL).
Under cover of this second FRL NatWest said (amongst other things):
it would, as a gesture of goodwill, reconsider his payment dispute of £266.72
there had been a degree of poor service on its part and for this it had credited Mr Hs
account with £50 and waived all charges and interest for August 2021
On 6 September 2021 NatWest credited Mr Hs account £50 in respect of the above.
On 7 September 2021 Mr H called NatWest to complain about (amongst other things) its
decision to not refund the disputed sum of £266.72 and to complain about the service he had 
received from it to date.
On 7 September 2021 NatWest issued Mr H with a final response letter (third FRL). Under
cover of this third FRL NatWest said (amongst other things):
it stood by its decision not to refund Mr H the disputed sum of £266.72 and to not
raise a chargeback against E for a refund
On 9 September 2021 NatWest confirmed (again) to Mr H that it stood by its decision not to
refund him the disputed sum of £266.72 and to not raise a chargeback against E for a
refund.
Mr Hs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that
having paid Mr H £100 for poor service NatWest need do nothing further, including refunding
the sum of £266.72 in dispute.
Mr H responded to the investigators view to say that he disagreed with it. In summary he
said:
[he felt the investigator hadnt] grasped the issue correctly
[NatWest] explicitly told [him] he would get the money back through the chargeback
scheme
NatWest advised him that any future chargebacks wouldnt be automatically rejected
due to amounts that have been done which are very few but NatWest are
automatically rejecting these and singling [him] out
The £100 compensation paid to him by NatWest is insufficient because nothing has
been addressed with the false promises and lies which have not been addressed
He wanted to complain about the amount of time for [his] complaint to be picked up
[by our service] and the adequacy of the investigation undertaken to date
The investigator considered Mr Hs response to his view but wasnt persuaded to change his
mind. However, he did expand on his view to Mr H and advised him that somebody would be
in touch in due course to address his complaint about the time taken for his complaint to be
considered by us and about the adequacy of our investigation to date.
Because the investigator wasnt persuaded to change his mind about Mr Hs complaint, it 
was passed to me for review and decision. I issued a provisional decision on this case in September 2022. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear Mr H has very strong feelings about this complaint and I can confirm Ive read and
considered everything he has submitted. However, I trust that Mr H will not take the fact that
my findings focus on what I consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in
considerably less detail, as a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every
point raised. The purpose of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for
reaching them.
I would also point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities. Im also not
considering in this decision Mr Hs complaint about our service, which has already been
addressed by one of our senior advisors under separate cover.
In this case, Im looking at whether NatWest acted fairly and reasonably in the way it
handled Mr Hs request for help in getting his money back. This will take into account the
circumstances of the problem and how E has acted, but also the chargeback card scheme
rules NatWest has to follow.
In certain circumstances the chargeback process provides a way for a bank to ask for a
payment a consumer has made to be refunded. Where applicable, the bank raises a dispute
with the supplier and effectively asks for the payment to be returned to the customer. While
its good practice for a bank to attempt a chargeback where the right exists and there is
some prosect of success, the circumstances of a dispute means it wont always be
appropriate for the bank to raise a chargeback. There are grounds or dispute conditions set
by the relevant card scheme and if these arent met a chargeback is unlikely to succeed.
Although NatWest initially declined to raise a chargeback against E on Mr Hs behalf (on the
grounds of the number of payment disputes he had raised in the previous 12 months), it later
agreed to review that decision.
Now I accept that Mr H didnt agree with NatWests decision (after it carried out a review of
its earlier decision not to raise a chargeback against E on his behalf) to still not do so. But
Im satisfied that this was an appropriate decision for NatWest to reach. I say this because
having considered (amongst other things) Es response to Mr H, after he had complained to
it directly, it was entirely fair and reasonable for NatWest to conclude that any chargeback
raised would be defended and would have no, or very little, prospect of success.
Mr H says NatWest, on one or more occasions, promised him that he would receive a refund
of the disputed sum of £266.72. However, Ive seen insufficient evidence to be able to
conclude that such a promise was ever made by NatWest.
I will now turn to what I accept is some confusion about what NatWest will, or will not do,
going forward should Mr H wish to raise any further payment disputes.Despite what NatWest may have told Mr H since August 2021, it has confirmed to our
service that it will consider any further payment disputes Mr H might want to raise  going
forward  but he will need to raise them by telephone and provide it with everything
reasonably requested of him. Mr H shouldnt raise any payment disputes online because
these, due to how its system operates, will automatically be declined.
Now I appreciate that Mr H might be unhappy with this, but in all the circumstances I think
this isnt an unreasonable stance for NatWest to take and it shouldnt, everything else being
equal, cause Mr H any material distress and inconvenience.
Notwithstanding what I say above, I agree that this whole matter could have been better
handled by NatWest. But taking everything into account I find that having paid Mr H £100,
NatWest need do nothing further in this respect.
NatWest responded to my provisional findings to say that it accepted them and had nothing 
further to add.
Mr H didnt respond to my provisional findings by the date I gave for a response.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given Mr H didnt respond to my provisional findings and NatWest confirmed it accepted 
them, I see no good reason to depart from those findings and I now confirm them as final.
My final decision
My final decision is that having paid Mr H £100, National Westminster Bank Plc need
do nothing further in respect of this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 November 2022.
