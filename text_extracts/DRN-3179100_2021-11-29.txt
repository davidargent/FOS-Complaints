The complaint
Mr C complains that when he checked out a purchase over £100, there was no option to
access the interest free offer he had with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA. And Mr C said
that when he asked PayPal to put the offer on, it wouldnt do so.
  
What happened
Mr C said when he made a large purchase, he expected to be offered 0% interest, in line
with an existing offer he had from PayPal Credit. But when he selected PayPal Credit as the
payment option, the only choice was an instalment plan that did incur interest. Mr C said he
assumed this was a glitch, and PayPal could sort this out once hed made his purchase. So
he went ahead.
But Mr C said that when he contacted PayPal, it said it couldnt change the funding source
for a purchase after it was made. It said that Mr C would have to cancel this purchase, and
buy it again later. Mr C said he couldnt do that, because the seller had already started to
despatch the item.
Mr C said he then tried to pay off the purchase without incurring interest, but it was very
difficult to get any information out of PayPal to tell him how to do this. The final response
letter he received contained no information about what had gone wrong. He was unhappy
about not being able to make his purchase without interest, and he was unhappy about the
service he then received from PayPal.
PayPal said Mr C had chosen to pay with an instalment plan. It said 0% interest offers arent 
always available. So it didnt think it had done anything wrong. When he paid off the 
purchase early, it paid him £1.50 for interest hed been charged, as a gesture of goodwill.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said that Mr C accepted he
had proceeded with the purchase despite not wanting the promotional rate he had chosen.
He said PayPal had explained that the 0% offer isnt available on all purchases. Broadly
speaking, promotional offers are something offered at a businesss discretion.
Our investigator also said that, whilst he thought PayPal couldve handled Mr Cs complaint
better, he didnt think PayPal had put any significant barriers in Mr Cs way. It had tried to
resolve the complaint within a reasonable time. And it had refunded the interest Mr C had
been charged. Our investigator said, although the final response letter didnt contain detail of
Mr Cs complaint, Mr C was given clear and concise information by the advisers he spoke
with via PayPals online portal. So our investigator didnt think PayPal had to do any more.
Mr C didnt agree. He sent us details of the offer hed signed up for with PayPal Credit, which
said he would be offered 0% interest on every purchase over £99. Mr C said that this was
why hed assumed that it must just be a flaw in the system that PayPal intended to charge
interest on this transaction. Mr C said that hed been financially disadvantaged because he
hadnt benefited from 0% interest on this purchase.
Our investigator said he would ask PayPal about this. But he said he was unlikely to change
his mind, because Mr C wasnt forced to proceed with the transaction on a rate he wasnt
happy with. Our investigator said Mr C should have notified PayPal of the issue before
committing to an agreement that he had understood meant hed pay 12.9% over six-months.
PayPal told our investigator that there was nothing wrong with its systems at the time. But
then it also said something new - that the problem lay in how Mr C had made his purchase.
PayPal said the terms of its instalment offers explain that it wouldnt always offer 0% interest.
But it said what Mr C was referring to, when he said he was entitled to 0% interest, wasnt an
instalment offer. It was a separate promotion with PayPal Credit, on his personal account.
PayPal said that what Mr C had done, was to select PayPal Credit on the merchants
website. That took him to merchant-specific offers, like the one hed selected, with
instalments over six months, at a stated interest rate.
PayPal said that what Mr C should have done, if he wanted to benefit from his personal 0%
interest rate, was to choose PayPal on the merchants website. Then hed be taken to
PayPals own site, where he could access his offers by selecting PayPal Credit as the
funding source.
PayPal said if Mr C had rung it, then it couldve helped him to make the payment with 0%
interest. But it couldnt change this once the purchase was made. PayPal still didnt think it
had done anything wrong.
Our investigator didnt change his mind, he still thought Mr C got the offer he had selected.
As no agreement was reached, this case came to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold it 
in part. This is what I said then: 
When Mr C made payment for his purchase, he selected an offer which was clear 
that interest would be payable. Like our investigator, I dont think that PayPal had to 
change this, after hed made that selection.
But I do think PayPal did something wrong here. Thats because when Mr C 
complained, it didnt explain to him what had gone wrong.
Mr C wanted to take advantage of a 0% offer, which he has on his PayPal Credit 
account. PayPal has shown us his statements, which make clear that hes made use 
of this offer a number of times before. And it has set out an explanation of what 
happened, which I think does show this is an issue likely to cause some confusion.
Because of that, when Mr C said that he was being charged interest that he didnt 
think he should have to pay, I think that PayPal should have realised what had gone 
wrong. And I think PayPal should have set out for Mr C then, what it has set out for 
us now, namely how he can access the 0% payment offer on his personal account.
Because PayPal didnt clarify any of this until after Mr C had complained to our 
service, and indeed after it had first set out how instalment plans work, for our 
investigator, I think that it has prolonged Mr Cs complaint. Ive explained that I do 
think PayPal should have realised what had gone wrong here earlier. And because it 
didnt do that, Mr C has been put to the trouble of complaining to our service, just to 
find out what had gone wrong and how he can avoid this in the future.I dont think Mr C should have had to do that. For that reason, Ill ask PayPal to pay 
Mr C £100 in compensation, to make up for the inconvenience of needing to pursue 
this complaint to our service, in order to find out what has gone wrong.
I think that provides a fair and reasonable outcome to this complaint.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr C said he was happy with my provisional decision. 
PayPal said it only wanted to add that Mr C hadnt called either before or directly after 
making this transaction. And if he had called, it could have told him how to get the interest 
free period that he wanted. 
I didnt uphold this complaint because of any incorrect advice that Mr C was given before this 
transaction. I noted in my provisional decision that Mr C selected an offer which was clear 
that interest would be payable, and I didnt think PayPal had to change this, after the fact.
But Mr C told PayPal that he thought this was a glitch, and PayPal just said it wasnt. It didnt 
tell Mr C what had gone wrong when he complained, and in fact this didnt become clear 
until quite some time after our service had started to look into the complaint. 
I set out in my provisional decision that I thought PayPal had prolonged Mr Cs complaint. I 
havent changed my mind about that, and I still think this complaint should be upheld in part.
Ill now make the decision I originally proposed.
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must pay Mr C £100.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 December 2021.
