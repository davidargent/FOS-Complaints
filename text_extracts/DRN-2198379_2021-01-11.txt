The complaint
Mrs H complains that a washing machine that she paid for using a credit agreement with 
Shop Direct Finance Company Limited, trading as very, wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mrs H bought a washing machine on buy now  pay later terms under a credit 
agreement with Shop Direct in January 2019;
she contacted the manufacturer in March 2019 because the machine was leaking 
and its engineer found that the door seal had been damaged and the seal was 
replaced at no cost to Mrs H;
she contacted the manufacturer in August 2019 about another leak and its engineer 
identified that there was a crack in the drum which had been caused by an Allen key 
that was found in the machine so wasnt covered under the warranty;
Mrs H complained to Shop Direct and then to this service but our investigator didnt 
think that there was enough evidence for him to ask Shop Direct to allow Mrs H to 
reject the machine;
Mrs H has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman and she says 
that the Allen key must have left in the machine when it was manufactured, that here 
have been further issues with the machine that shes paid to be repaired by an 
independent engineer and that Shop Direct has applied interest at an excessively 
high rate;
the manufacturers engineer found an Allen key in the machine and says that it has 
cracked the drum which is causing the machine to leak and Mrs H hasnt been able 
to provide a report from the independent engineer about the damage to the drum;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the Allen key was in the 
machine when it was bought by Mrs H and I consider it to be more likely than not that 
the machine has been damaged by an Allen key that has accidentally been put into it 
since March 2019 (if the Allen Key had been there when the machine was bought I 
consider it to be likely that it would have damaged the machine sooner than it did - 
but Mrs H didnt complain about that damage until about seven months after she 
bought the machine);
the door seal was replaced in March 2019 but the engineer says that the damage 
was caused by misuse but the door seal was replaced at no cost to Mrs H;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the washing machine 
wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was bought by Mrs H so I dont consider that it 
would be fair or reasonable for me to require Shop Direct to refund to Mrs H the cost 
of the machine or to reimburse her for the cost of the repair;
the rate of interest under the buy now  pay later terms is 39.99% and Mrs H had to 
pay the full price of the washing machine of £649.99 by February 2020 to avoid being 
charged deferred interest of £279.03  she didnt do so and Shop Direct charged the 
deferred interest and continues to charge interest to Mrs H;
I consider that Shop Direct has responded fairly and reasonably to Mrs Hs complaint 
and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it has applied the 
interest incorrectly or that its acted incorrectly in its dealings with her account; and 
I sympathise with Mrs H for the difficulties that shes experienced but I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Shop Direct to take any action in 
response to her complaint  but if shes experiencing financial difficulties she should 
contact Shop Direct about them and its required to respond to any such difficulties 
positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 February 2021.
