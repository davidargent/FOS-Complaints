The complaint
Mr S complains that Revolut Ltd recorded details about a transaction on his banking app 
incorrectly, causing him distress.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I won't repeat them again 
here. Instead, I'll focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
I agree that due to the nature of the business that was incorrectly recorded on Mr S's 
banking app, this did cause him unnecessary upset;
Whilst I understand Mr S's upset, this needs to be balanced with the fact he knew 
fairly quickly that the only issue was with merchant's name, particularly as the service 
being provided was recorded correctly. I can see when he contacted Revolut, he'd 
already identified who the correct merchant was;
Mr S says when his girlfriend saw the incorrect details on his banking app, this also 
caused him upset. But as this account was in his sole account I don't think this was a 
reasonably foreseeable consequence of Revolut's mistake, so I can't hold it 
responsible for this;
For all these reasons, I think the investigator's suggested settlement of £50, is fair.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr S's complaint against Revolut Ltd and award £50 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. As Revolut Ltd has already paid 
Mr S this compensation, it doesn't need to do anything further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 July 2020.
