K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that the sum he was required  to pay Santander Consumer (UK) Plc 
(Santander), when  he settled his conditional  sale (CS)  agreement with it early,  was more  
than it should  have been. The rate of interest  was quoted  as being 5.31% (flat) and 
9.9% (APR). The flat rate is applied to the original sum borrowed and doesnt take into 
account repayments whereas the APR does.
background
Mr B took out a CS agreement with Santander  in August 2016 for £52,000, repayable at 
£849.28 a month for 84 months.
Between September 2016 and May 2018  Mr B made a number of payments to his CS 
agreement totalling  £25,629.91.
In June 2018 Mr B settled  his CS agreement  with Santander early  by paying the sum 
requested of £34,869.35.
Mr B complained to Santander to say that he believed that the sum requested  of him of 
£34,869.35, and which he had paid,  was more than it should have been.
Santander responded to Mr B to say that it had indeed  requested  from him more  than it 
should have done because it had failed to correctly account for each and every payment he 
had made  between September 2016  and May 2018. It calculated that it had requested from 
Mr B £862.71 more than it should have done  which  it was prepared  to refund together  with 
interest at 6.4% a year simple (net) totalling  £32.12  a total of £894.83.
Mr B didnt agree with Santanders calculations saying that he believed  he was due more by 
way of a refund.
Mr Bs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded  that 
Santanders offer was, in all the circumstances, fair and reasonable. 
Mr B didnt agree with the investigators conclusion. He believed he was due a higher  refund 
than that offered by Santander. In support of his view, Mr B provided a number of 
calculations.
The investigator wasnt persuaded  to change his mind so his complaint  was passed to me 
for review and decision.
I issued two provisional decisions on this case, one in August 2019  and one in 
September 2019. In my second provisional  decision dated September 2019 I said, in 
summary:
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN06611062The amount  of a CS agreement payment is composed of a combination of interest 
and principle. Over the life of the CS agreement, the proportion of interest to principle  
will change.  Initially a consumers payment  will be primarily  interest,  with a small 
amount of principle included. As the CS agreement  progresses, the principle portion 
of the payment will increase and the interest  portion of the payment will decrease.  
This is because interest is based  on the current outstanding  balance  of the CS 
agreement, at the relevant point  in time,  which  decreases as more  principal is paid.
Had Mr Bs CS agreement run its full term, with him making all of the payments 
required of him (at the required time) he would have made 84 payments totalling 
£71,339.52  made  up of the £52,000 original advance plus £19,339.52 in interest.  
It can be seen from [a statement provided]  that between  September 2016 and 
June 2018 Mr B paid Santander £60,499.26, made  up of the £52,000 original 
advance and £8,499.26 in interest.
Ive reconstructed Mr Bs CS agreement (based on the actual payments he made) on 
the same  mathematical  basis as he applied in the calculations provided in response  
to the investigators  view.
[This reconstruction]  shows  that by making the payments he did Mr B paid Santander  
£1,094.28 (say £1,100) more than was due and owing under his CS agreement 
(based on no additional  interest  for early  settlement being applied  and calculating 
interest on a monthly  basis based on the previous months balance).
However on early settlement Santander  was entitled to charge Mr B a further  58 days  
interest. This right derives from the Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations 
2004.
Based on interest  accruing and charged  to Mr Bs CS agreement of £268.02  for May 
2018this equates to approximately £500. If this sum of £500 is deducted from the 
over payment of £1,100 this leaves  a net overpayment of £600.  Even  allowing for 
the fact that [my reconstruction]  includes  a small degree of interest overcharging 
(because payments  made are treated as being made at the end of each month, 
rather than the actual day they were  paid)  Im of the view that Santanders calculation 
that Mr B is due a refund of £862.71 to be accurate in all material respects.
Ive considered very carefully the calculations provided by Mr B. 
In [one calculation]  Mr B assumes that what Santander should have charged  him by 
way of interest was 5.31%  on £52,000 reducing  over time. 
In [another  calculation]  Mr B assumes  that what Santander charged him by way of 
interest was 5.31% on £71,339.52 (£52,000  capital  plus £19,339.52 interest) 
reducing over time - so involving a degree  of interest  on interest.
But both calculations are incorrect.  As I understand it what  Santander charged Mr B 
on his CS agreement, and correctly so, was 9.9%  on £52,000 reducing over time with 
no interest on interest being  charged.
Ref: DRN06611063So by way of example  what  Mr B was charged  in September  2016  was 
approximately £410 @ 9.9% on £52,000  and not £230.10 @ 5.31% on £52,000 or 
£315.68 @ 5.31% on £71,339.52. What Mr B was charged In September  2017 was 
approximately £320 @ 9.9% on an approximate balance of £40,650 and not £170.75 
on £38,588.50 or £260.99 on £58,980.31.
Mr B is wrong in his assumption that what Santander  should have charged him by 
way of interest was 5.31%  on £52,200 reducing  over time. The correct  rate to apply 
here isnt 5.31% but the APR rate of 9.9%. Using an incorrect interest rate of 5.31% 
overestimates how quickly  the loan reduces over time, whether overpayments  are 
made or not.
Mr B calculates that between September 2016 and May 2018 he should have been 
charged £3,846  in interest. This might be correct at an interest rate of 5.31%, but 
applying the correct rate of 9.9% (over the same period) equates to a sum closer to 
£7,000. 
The flat rate 5.31% is to be applied, when  calculating interest payable, not on a 
reducing balance  basis, but on the original sum advanced. So in this case 5.31% x 
£52,000 x 7 years = £19,328.40,  the same (allowing for rounding)  as 9.9% on a 
reducing balance  totalling £19,339.52.
Given what I say above Im satisfied that by paying  Mr B £862.71  Santander will 
adequately compensate Mr B for any errors  in its administration  of his CS agreement.
However I think its only fair that interest  is paid on this sum at 8% a year simple 
(gross) to the date of settlement. I also think that this matter has caused Mr B a 
degree of trouble and upset for which he should also be fairly compensated for. And 
taking everything into account, I think £200  represents an appropriate sum for 
Santander to pay in this respect.
Santander responded to say it had nothing further  to add.
Mr B responded to say that he still believed  he was due a larger refund from Santander, but 
provided nothing  materially new for my consideration.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that Santander says it has nothing further to add and given that Mr B has 
provided nothing  materially new for my consideration  I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional findings and I now confirm them as final. 
Ref: DRN06611064my final decision
My final decision is that Santander Consumer (UK) Plc must pay Mr B:
£862.31 as offered  under its final response letter
interest on the above sum of £862.31  at 8% a year simple (gross) from the date Mr B 
settled his CS agreement to the date of settlement
£200 for trouble and upset
HM Revenue & Customs  requires Santander  Consumer (UK) Plc to take off tax from the 
interest on £862.31. Santander Consumer  (UK) Plc must give Mr Y a certificate  showing how 
much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 November  2019.
