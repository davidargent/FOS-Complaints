The complaint
Mr T complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) rejected his claim for a 
cancelled hotel stay, under its buyer protection policy.
Mr T has, at times, been represented by his wife during this complaint. But for ease, Ill refer 
to Mr T only throughout this decision.
What happened
In August 2019, Mr T booked a hotel stay in Spain for a group of 20 people. He booked it 
directly through the hotels website, with PayPal chosen to facilitate the payment. The stay 
was to take place between 12 and 15 June 2020. 
Unfortunately, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the trip was cancelled. Mr T and the 
guests received a full refund from their flight operator. But, as the flights and hotel were 
booked separately, and because all the guests had paid Mr T, who then paid for the hotel 
stay himself, Mr T had to request a refund direct from the hotel provider. 
The hotel wouldnt agree to a full refund and were only prepared to offer Mr T a credit note 
for the full amount of the stay to be used the following year. This wasnt acceptable to Mr T 
as the trip wouldnt be going ahead in 2021 either, so he continued to ask for a full refund of 
the amount paid. 
As he wasnt getting any further with the hotel, Mr T approached PayPal in May 2020 to ask 
them to refund the payment. PayPal declined to do this. They told Mr T that his request had 
been made more than 180 days since the transaction date  and as such, it was outside of 
the time limits for PayPals buyer protection policy. 
Unhappy with this, Mr T brought his complaint to our service. While our investigator was 
looking into things for him, Mr T continued to liaise with the hotel. They told him that they had 
been prepared to offer a full refund but had received a chargeback request from PayPal. 
This invoked a term in their policy that meant Mr Ts payment was non-refundable. 
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He agreed with PayPal that Mr T had raised his 
dispute with them outside of the 180-day time limit explained in the buyer protection policy. 
Regarding the hotels claim that PayPal had raised a chargeback, PayPal confirmed that 
they hadnt and, indeed, couldnt raise a chargeback as this was only a facility available to 
Mr Ts bank. They maintained that Mr Ts dispute was declined purely because of the failure 
to bring it to their attention in time.  
Mr T didnt accept our investigators opinion. He said he was still out of pocket and it wasnt 
acceptable that no party involved were prepared to refund him. 
As Mr T didnt agree, its been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome reached by our investigator. Ill explain why. 
When Mr T created his PayPal account in November 2013, he was required to confirm he 
agreed with PayPals User Agreement. Part of this agreement was the terms that applied to 
PayPals buyer protection policy. 
These terms say the following:
To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:
-Have a PayPal account in good standing.
-Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.
-Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under 
PayPal Buyer Protection through the Resolution Centre.
-Respond to PayPals request for documentation and other information within the time 
requested. 
-Open a dispute in the Resolution Centre within 180 days of the date you sent the 
payment, then follow our online dispute resolution process.
The user agreement then goes on to explain how the online dispute resolution process 
works. The first step Mr T had to follow was:
Step 1: Open a dispute within 180 days of the date you made the payment.
As Mr T made the payment to the hotel in August 2019 and raised his dispute with PayPal in 
May 2020, Im satisfied he is outside of the buyer protection policy time limit for his dispute to 
be considered. The terms outlined by PayPal within the user agreement in relation to this are 
clear, so I cant say they have treated Mr T unfairly by declining to consider his claim. 
I understand Mr Ts strength of feeling about this, as its a considerable amount of money 
that is being requested. And Mr T has provided some social media comments that he 
believes confirm this isnt the only case in relation to this specific hotel. It could be that the 
hotel was confused between the chargeback process and PayPal raising a dispute for a 
refund  but Im satisfied that PayPal didnt attempt to raise a chargeback here. And its 
important to remind Mr T that I am not looking at the hotels conduct within this decision, that 
isnt within my jurisdiction  I can only look at PayPal and how they have handled Mr Ts 
dispute. And as Im satisfied theyve treated Mr T fairly in how theyve applied their buyer 
protection policy terms I wont be asking them to consider it further. 
Overall, I dont think Mr T has been treated unfairly or unreasonably by PayPal in this case. 
My final decision
For the reasons above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 April 2022.
