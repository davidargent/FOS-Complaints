K821x#15complaint
Mr T says Elevate  Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny)  irresponsibly lent 
to him.
background
This complaint is about seven instalment loans Sunny  provided  to Mr T between  January 
2018 and August 2018. Mr Ts borrowing history based on what Sunny provided is as 
follows:
Loan Date  taken Date  repaid Instalments Amount Highest  monthly 
combined repayment**
1 16/01/2018 30/06/2018 6 £200 £51
2* 24/01/2018 31/07/2018 6 £200 £108
3* 13/02/2018 31/07/2018 6 £200 £168
4* 20/02/2018 31/07/2018 6 £200 £225
5* 02/07/2018 29/09/2018 6 £250 £257
6* 31/07/2018 29/09/2018 6 £500 £249
7* 06/08/2018 29/09/2018 6 £250 £330
*these loans were  taken  while  Mr T had at least one loan outstanding, which  meant that the
highest repayment would be across all outstanding loans in a given month.
**these figures have  been  rounded up/down
Mr T has said Sunny provided irresponsible  lending and should have known Mr T could not 
afford to repay the loans. Sunny has said it conducted eligibility, creditworthiness and 
affordability checks for all the loans.  
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ts complaint in part and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed with our adjudicators  assessment  but did make 
an offer for loans  6 and 7. Mr T rejected  the offer from Sunny for loans 6 and 7. So the 
complaint has now been  passed  to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr T could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN97357322the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
Mr T hasnt  disagreed with our adjudicators opinion on loans 1 to 3 so I wont be looking at 
these any further  as there is no ongoing  disagreement about  them.  But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Mr Ts other lending. 
By the time loan 4 was taken, Mr T was paying  for three other  loans (loans 1 to 3) with 
Sunny at the same time. Loan 4 was taken in very quick succession after the first three loans 
and only a month after loan 1 was taken. While the amounts  hadnt  increased or decreased, 
Sunny should  have  been concerned with Mr Ts borrowing pattern by the time loan 4 was 
taken and should have realised that he was having  problems  managing  money. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ts case,  I think that this point was reached  by 6. 
Sunny has already agreed to uphold  loans 6 and 7 and has made  an offer in line with our 
approach. I think Sunnys  offer is for loans 6 and 7 is fair.  
Ref: DRN97357323So Im also upholding  the complaint about 4 and 5 and loans 6 and 7 and Sunny should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  4 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Ts credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 and 7 should be removed from   
Mr Ts credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ts complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 February  2020.
