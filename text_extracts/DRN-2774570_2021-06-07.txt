The complaint
Mr V complains that TransferWise Ltd closed his account and wont return funds held in the 
account to him.
What happened
Mr V had a business and a personal account with TransferWise. He has raised a complaint 
regarding both accounts. This decision will focus on Mr Vs personal account. Mr Vs 
complaint regarding his business account will be addressed separately.
In August 2020, TransferWise reviewed Mr Vs account. TransferWise that it would take 
around 60 days for it to complete its review. Whilst it conducted its review it blocked Mr Vs 
access to his account. This meant Mr v wasnt able to access funds in his account. At the 
time Mr V had around Â£30,000 in the account.
 
As part of its review, TransferWise asked Mr V for information about the activity on his 
account, which Mr V provided. On 17 December 2020, TransferWise let Mr V know that it 
hadnt yet finished its review and would update him as soon as it could. On 6 January 2021, 
TransferWise wrote to Mr V again to let him know it was still completing due diligence 
checks and wasnt able to release his funds to him.
  
Mr V complained to TransferWise about how long things were taking. He said not having 
access to his funds were causing him serious financial difficulties and causing him a good 
deal of stress and worry. TransferWise said it hadnt done anything wrong and were 
complying with its legal and regulatory obligations in conducting its review. It also said it had 
closed Mr Vs account in line with the terms and conditions. Unhappy with this response 
Mr V brought his complaint to our service.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Vs complaint. She said whilst TransferWises review 
had taken some time, she was satisfied that it had done so without any undue delays and 
had moved things along as quickly as it could. She also said TransferWise hadnt done 
anything wrong when it closed Mr Vs account. Mr V disagreed. He wants TransferWise to 
release his funds.
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, the investigator was right to point out that TransferWise has important legal and 
regulatory obligations it must meet when providing accounts to its customers. These 
obligations are ongoing, so do not only pertain to when an account is opened. To comply 
with its obligations TransferWise may need to review an account and/or restrict its 
customers access. If it didnt comply with its obligations it could risk serious sanction.
In order to meet these requirements TransferWise is entitled to ask a customer for more 
information about how they use their account, including payments which are made into an 
account. And its not for this service to interfere with the banks processes. Our role is to see 
if the bank has made any mistakes and then put the customer back in the position theyd 
have been in if the mistake hadnt happened.
Having looked at all the evidence, I dont believe it was unreasonable in the circumstances 
for TransferWise to block Mr Vs account and ask him for information about the activity on 
his account. TransferWise has explained that this was its standard procedure, and I accept 
that it was. And having looked at all the evidence, Im satisfied that TransferWise did so in 
order to comply with its various legal obligations. So, whilst I accept this caused Mr V 
inconvenience, I cant say TransferWise treated him unfairly when it blocked his account. 
The crux of Mr Vs complaint is that he says TransferWise have taken too long to complete 
its review. And he wants TransferWise to release his funds. I do accept that so far it has 
taken TransferWise a relatively lengthy period of time to review Mr Vs account. And that 
TransferWise have yet to release Mr Vs funds. But I dont consider that it would be right for 
me to conclude it shouldnt have taken in excess of any particular or specific timeframe. 
Because TransferWise is entitled  as a matter of principle  to do what it did in order to 
comply with its legal and regulatory obligations. Having looked at the information provided by 
TransferWise, Im satisfied that it hasnt been responsible for any undue delays and has 
been progressing its review as quickly as possible. 
I also note that TransferWise spoke to Mr V on more than one occasion about what was 
happening and explained to him that it was still completing its review and completing its due 
diligence.  I can see that the bank wrote to Mr V on at least three occasions about the 
review. So, I think TransferWise kept Mr V informed about what it was doing.  
I appreciate that Mr V has been inconvenienced by TransferWise closing his account. And 
hed like his account reopened. But TransferWise has acted within the terms and conditions 
of the account. So, it was entitled to close the account as its already done. And it wasnt 
required to give him a reason, as much as hed like to know. So, I cant say TransferWise 
has done anything wrong by not providing this information to Mr V. 
 
TransferWise can make commercial decisions about who it offers services to. They cannot 
unfairly discriminate against a customer. But they can say they no longer wish to do 
business with individuals. Thats because theyve got the commercial freedom to decide who 
they want to contract with. And having looked at all the information and circumstances of this 
case, Im satisfied that TransferWise has exercised its commercial decision legitimately 
when it decided to close Mr Vs account. So, I cant say TransferWise has treated Mr V 
unfairly.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2021.
