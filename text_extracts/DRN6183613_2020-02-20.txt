Miss M complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  irresponsibly  
lent to her. 
background
Miss M took out 37 loans with Sunny between September 2015 and January 2017. I have 
set out her borrowing in respect of the first ten loans only. It is enough  to say that the loans  
subsequent to loan 10 ranged between £50 and £950. Loan 37 was for £100 and taken out 
on 24 January 2017. It was repaid  in February 2017.

In her complaint to Sunny,  Miss M said that at the time of her borrowing, she was in a debt 
management plan.  She complained it had not checked her income correctly and when the 
repayments became  unaffordable, she had to borrow from other payday lenders to meet her 
commitments. 
Sunny said that it had conducted creditworthiness checks before it decided to lend to Miss M 
and concluded  that the repayments were affordable.  It said the checks it had carried  out 
were proportionate. It noted  there  was some  adverse information on her credit  file, which 
was reflected in the small amount it was prepared to lend Miss M. 
Our adjudicator thought the checks Sunny had done in respect of loans 1 to 5 were  
proportionate. However,  she didnt think it should have agreed to lend loans 6 to 37. Sunny 
then said it didnt think it should have lent loans 18 to 37 to Miss M and made  an offer to 
settle the complaint on that basis. Miss M didnt accept that offer. 
As the parties are not in agreement with our adjudicator, the matter has been  passed to me 
to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN61836132Our adjudicator said that she didnt think loans 1 to 5 should be upheld. Neither party  has 
disputed that. But for the same reasons as our adjudicator, Ive upheld the complaint from 
loan 6. By the time Miss M applied for this loan, I think Sunny should  have realised  that the 
lending history and the pattern of borrowing showed that continued lending was 
unsustainable. 
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ms complaint.  Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern 
of the lending history  with Miss M with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny 
should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. 
And so Sunny should have realised  that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ms case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 6. Loan 6 was the sixth loan Miss M had taken  out in just over two months. I can see 
that on the same day as she repaid  loans  2 and 3, Miss M took applied for loan 4. The 
amount she borrowed  was more than shed  applied for originally with for loans 2 and 3. 
Miss M then repaid loan 4 and took loan 5 out on the same day. Again, the amount she 
borrowed was the same - £200. Also, when Miss M applied for loan 6, she still had two loans 
running at the same  time.  
I think the timing of the loan 6 application  is important  as well. I can see that it was taken out 
on 24 November 2015. On this day, Miss M was due to make repayments towards her 
outstanding loans. On that basis, I think it should  have been  reasonably  clear  to Miss M that 
she was probably  struggling  to repay  her existing debts  and that further borrowing was 
unsustainable. It was most likely that Miss M was having to borrow more to cover the hole 
repaying her previous  loans had left in her finances.
I think that Miss M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number  of loans Miss M borrowed was likely to have had negative  implications on 
her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market  for these high-
cost loans.
Ref: DRN61836133So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 37 and Sunny must take action to put 
things right.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss M paid on loans 6 to 37;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 37 should be removed from 
Miss Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss M a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Miss Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited must  comply  with the above  putting things right section. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 March 2020.
