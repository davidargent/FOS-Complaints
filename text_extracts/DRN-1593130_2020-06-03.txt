The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has changed his account, 
which will result in overdraft charges.
What happened
Mr M says NatWest told him it was converting his student account into a normal account 
which would result in overdraft charges and interest. He says that is unfair and he should 
have been allowed a grace period when his student account ended before being liable for 
overdraft charges and interest.
NatWest says its records show that Mr M was a student between 2004 and 2007. It says on 
graduation it would have converted Mr M's account to a graduate account for three years 
before it would have become a normal account and liable for overdraft charges and interest.. 
NatWest accepts it made a mistake by not converting Mr M's account in 2007 but says Mr M 
has benefited from that and in line with account terms and conditions has given 30 days 
notice of the change to the account.
Mr M brought his complaint to us but our investigator didn't uphold the complaint. The 
investigator accepted a mistake was made but thought Mr M had benefited from it for about 
nine years and that NatWest Had given Mr M appropriate notice of the account change. The 
investigator didn't think it fair to ask NatWest to allow a longer grace free period.
Mr M doesn't accept that view and says he would like a longer interest and charge free 
period.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I have come to the same 
overall view as the investigator and for the same reasons.
There is no doubt here that NatWest made a mistake and ought to have converted Mr M's 
student account to a graduate account on 2007. But the effect of that mistake is that Mr M 
has had an interest and charge free overdraft facility since that time. So I think it would be 
unfair to order NatWest to increase that period any further and I think it ought to have been 
clear to Mr M that a mistake had been made. And if Mr M was concerned that NatWest could 
have ended the existing arrangement at any time, then I would have expected him to have 
spoken to NatWest about its mistake. 
I have looked at NatWest's account terms and conditions which say that an overdraft is re-
payable on demand and that it will give 30 days of any changes. I appreciate this account 
was opened in 1999 but I think NatWest has acted fairly by giving that notice and Mr M 
hasn't told me that he thinks that notice period is incorrect. So I think NatWest has not made 
a mistake or acted unfairly and is entitled inline with account terms and conditions to make changes to Mr M's account. 
I appreciate that Mr M did not receive the graduate account but I don't think there was any 
negative impact caused to Mr M as he was still receiving the benefits of the student account. 
And if Mr M did want his account converted into a graduate account then he ought 
reasonably to have told NatWest about its mistake and asked it for that type of account.
Overall I'm satisfied NatWest has acted reasonably and fairly, and so I can't order it to 
increase any grace period as Mr M would like.
My final decision
My final decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 July 2020.
