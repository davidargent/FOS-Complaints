Complaint
Mr C complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called PDL 
Finance Limited, trading at the time as Mr Lender. He says he was lent to irresponsibly and 
the loans caused him financial problems. 
To keep things simple Ill refer mainly to Mr Lender throughout this decision. 
Background
We know that Mr C took out 4 short-term instalment loans from Mr Lender between 
November 2016 and December 2017. Ive enclosed a summary of his borrowing, based on 
the information provided to us:
 
 
Loan

AmountMonthly
Payments
1 12/11/2016 28/02/2017 £500 £215
2 09/03/2017 31/07/2017 £750 £310
3 01/08/2017 29/12/2017 £1000 £434
4 29/12/2017 15/03/2018 £1000 £430
 
I issued a provisional decision (PD) about this complaint in May 2020, setting out why I 
thought it should be upheld in only respect of loan number 4. And I asked both parties to 
provide any further submissions or information to me by 27 June 2020 at the latest. That PD 
should be read in conjunction with this final decision.
In my PD I said that I wasnt intending to uphold the complaint about loans 1 or 2. For loan 
number 3, I acknowledged that Mr C had asked for more time to pay off loan a previous loan 
(number 2) and this could have implied there were money problems emerging. So Mr Lender 
ought to have been carrying out more enhanced financial checks at that point before lending 
to Mr C again. I cant see it did this. 
Nevertheless, as I explained in the PD, because theres no evidence before me showing Mr 
C was experiencing financial difficulties to such a degree that loan 3 wouldnt have been 
extended to him, I dont think Mr Lender would have rejected his application for it. I think it 
would have still thought it was appropriate to lend him the money. Therefore, even though 
Mr Lender probably didnt do everything it should have when considering the loan 3 
application, I wasnt minded to uphold this part of Mr Cs complaint either. For loan number 4, I noted we already had an offer from the business extended to Mr C to 
settle his complaint. Mr Lender said we would be willing to close the complaint at this stage 
by agreeing to refund loan 4 as outlined in your [adjudicators] assessment. 
My findings
Ive now thoroughly reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. But having done this, theres no 
reason for me to change the findings I set out comprehensively in my PD.
I havent had a response from Mr Lender or received any more arguments back from either 
party about loans 1 or 2, so Im not changing anything with regard to these. However, Mr C 
said he wanted it brought to my attention that hed also experienced payment problems with 
regard to loan 3, as well as those I had mentioned relating to loan 2. 
Im grateful for this response, but Im afraid this doesnt affect what I think. Thats because 
any payment problems he experienced after loan 3 had already been extended, arent 
relevant to the time before he was actually granted the loan. In short, I cant use hindsight to 
judge how Mr Lender assessed him at the point of the loan 3 application. The apparent 
money problems evident in paying loan 3 do, however, add some weight to the complaint 
about loan 4 being upheld.
Im sorry to disappoint Mr C, but as I said by most standards he earned a high salary. I 
understand thus far he has not accepted the offer from Mr Lender about loan 4. But its in 
line with our normal practice in that Mr Lender agrees to compensate him for the interest and 
charges.
To be clear then, I think this offer is fair in the circumstances. Im therefore intending to 
agree to the partial uphold for loan 4 (only), as proposed by Mr Lender. I dont uphold the 
complaint about loans 1, 2 or 3.
Putting things right
In order to put things right for Mr C, Mr Lender should:
refund all interest and charges Mr C paid on loan 4 only; 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges on loan 4 from 
the date it was paid to the date of settlement;
all adverse entries about loan 4 should be removed from Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. It must 
give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I partially uphold Mr Cs complaint and PDL Finance Limited should pay the compensation 
above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service I am required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 July 2018.
