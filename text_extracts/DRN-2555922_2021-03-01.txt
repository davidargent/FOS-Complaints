The complaint
 A company, which Ill refer to as D, complains about the way PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCA handled a chargeback claim from one of its customers. 
One of Ds directors, Mr P, brings the complaint on the companys behalf. 
What happened
D sold a personalised gift online for $114.99USD on 16 June 2019. On receipt of the item, 
the buyer complained that the goods they received werent as described  and sought the 
reversal of their payment through the chargeback process on 25 June 2019.
PayPal notified D and gave it the opportunity to submit a defence, which it did. PayPal 
relayed that the defence to the buyers card issuer on 30 June 2019. The transaction funds 
were debited from Ds account while the chargeback was under review, although they were 
still available as a provisional credit.
PayPal later wrote to D to advise that the chargeback had been decided in the buyers 
favour. PayPal says that it allows a period of up to 75 days to hear back from the buyers 
card issuer as to whether the defence is successful. So when it hadnt heard back about this 
claim by 13 September 2019, it proceeded to recover the funds from Ds account.
Mr P complained. He said D had provided robust evidence to counter the buyers claims and 
queried the lack of clarity on the reasons for the chargeback decision, which had only been 
described as other. He also thought that the claim ought to have been covered by PayPals 
Seller Protection Policy.
PayPal didnt uphold Ds complaint. It said it had tried to dispute the claim on Ds behalf but 
ultimately this was decided by the buyers card issuer, and it couldnt challenge this further. It 
also said its Seller Protection Policy didnt cover claims from buyers that goods werent as 
described. So Mr P referred the matter to us.
While the complaint was with us, PayPal wrote to D on 9 November 2019 to confirm that the 
chargeback had been decided in its favour and that the transaction funds would be 
reimbursed to its account. PayPal then told us this had been a mistake  but agreed not to 
reclaim the funds as a gesture of goodwill. It later reversed its position again, saying that the 
chargeback had been decided in Ds favour but that it didnt know the reasons for this.
One of our investigators then reviewed the complaint and thought it should be upheld. He 
agreed that the transaction wasnt covered by PayPals Seller Protection Policy as per the 
terms and conditions. But he thought PayPal couldve done more to support D in its defence 
of the chargeback, following up with the buyers card issuer or ultimately escalating the 
dispute to the arbitration process if necessary. He recommended that PayPal pay 
compensation of £100 to D for the inconvenience caused in having to chase things up while 
it was without the funds.
D accepted our investigators view but PayPal didnt. It said that the buyers card issuer was 
responsible for deciding the chargeback claim, as set out in its terms of use. And it still 
thought it had been correct to treat the defence as unsuccessful when it hadnt heard back 
with a change in decision from the buyers card issuer. 
So PayPal asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint, and it was passed to me to 
decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ds initial complaint was prompted by the fact that the buyers chargeback claim against it 
was successful. PayPal is right to say that isnt a decision it makes  in the first instance its 
made by the buyers card issuer, but ultimately it can be referred to the card scheme for 
arbitration. Its also right to say that the claim wasnt covered by its Seller Protection Policy  
as the terms and conditions of Ds account do exclude payment reversals on the basis that 
the goods arent as described, as was the allegation here.
PayPal has given us conflicting accounts of how the chargeback was decided. From what its 
told us most recently, I understand the claim was  eventually  found in Ds favour by the 
buyers card issuer. In any case, the transaction funds have now been returned to D, so its 
not suffered a loss as a result of this issue. 
But looking at the way in which PayPal handled things while the claim was ongoing, I agree 
with our investigator that it couldve done more to help D. Ill explain why in a little more 
detail.
In the first instance, Id expect PayPal to notify D of the chargeback, provide it the 
opportunity to provide a defence and then forward on such defence to the buyers card 
issuer. Theres no dispute that it took appropriate steps in this respect. But once that 
defence was submitted, it seems PayPal took the lack of a response from the card issuer as 
notification that the chargeback had been determined in the buyers favour. I dont think that 
was reasonable. PayPal couldve followed up with the card issuer for confirmation rather 
than simply close off the dispute. And taking PayPals most recent version of events as 
accurate, it seems the card issuer hadnt actually determined the dispute in favour of the 
buyer in September 2019  as it ultimately went on to find in Ds favour in November. So this 
leads me to think that PayPal acted prematurely in treating the claim as determined in the 
buyers favour.
The lack of information given in respect of the initial decision in September  which seems to 
be that of PayPals to close the claim down, rather than the card issuers to find in the 
buyers favour  has caused some understandable confusion. This was exacerbated when 
PayPal subsequently reimbursed the funds to D, only for it to then say that was an error  
causing Mr P to fear that they would be re-debited. PayPal then changed its stance again, 
confirming that the funds were reimbursed following the card issuers decision in Ds favour.
All of this has caused D some unnecessary inconvenience in having to follow up on a 
number of occasions with PayPal, ultimately by way of complaint. This can all be traced back 
to PayPals decision to close off the claim prematurely or follow up with the buyers card 
issuer. I agree with our investigator that £100 would be fair compensation for the 
inconvenience this caused D.I know Mr P still seeks some clarity as to the reason given (other) for the decision made in 
September. But based on what weve been provided with, all I can tell him is that I consider 
this most likely to be because it was PayPals decision to close down the claim based on the 
time that had elapsed with no response, rather than a finding against D in respect of the 
claim itself.
  
My final decision
 I uphold this complaint and require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay D compensation 
of £100. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 March 2021.
