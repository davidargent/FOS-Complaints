Mrs L says MYJAR Limited  lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Mrs L is represented by a third party and it says on her behalf  that she was not financially 
stable enough  at the time she applied for these loans to be able to afford the repayments  on 
them. It thinks that MYJAR failed to assess Mrs Ls financial  situation properly. 
MYJAR has provided us with summary details of the approved  loans and they are set out 
here in a table.  I plan to refer to the loans by the numbers in this table.

Loan 7 was structured to be repayable over three  unequal instalments the last being  the 
largest at around  £377. Loans 8, 9 and 10 were structured as three  relatively even 
repayments over three months. Loans 11 and 12 were six month instalment loans. 
MYJAR responded  to Mrs Ls complaint by offering to put things right for Loans 5, 7 and 10. 
It said that Mrs L did take out a loan relatively quickly  after paying  off her previous loan and 
we could have  done more  to assess why that was.  
Mrs L did not accept  that as it was offered in full and final settlement and she brought her 
complaint to this service.  
MYJAR has explained to us that Mrs Ls borrowing behaviours show  nothing  more than a 
consumer who used  our services to aid short term borrowing  needs  when required. MYJAR 
also said that we believe that three of the loans provided to [Mrs L] might  have  been  
unsuitable for her. And it repeated the offer made to Mrs L again through  us.
Two of our adjudicators have looked  at this. The first did not think  that Mrs Ls complaint 
should be upheld.  Mrs L did not agree and it was referred  back to an adjudicator.  He noted 
that MYJAR  had conceded and offered to refund interest and fees paid on Loans 5, 7 and 
10. He went on to consider the complaint. 
Ref: DRN01170942His view was that from the seventh  loan (already conceded) in the chain of twelve  between 
July 2014 and November 2016,  MYJAR ought to put things right for Mrs L. His reasons to 
uphold these related to the fact that 
by the seventh  advance  taken  in just over five months with no significant gaps 
in lending up to that point  then it had become unsustainable for Mrs L to take 
more loans; and 
the seventh loan represented  a significant  increase  in repayments expected 
from Mrs L because for Loan 6 the highest had been  £101  and for Loan 7 the 
highest had been  £376; and
it was the second  advance  in December 2014  and it was taken  one day after 
the previous loan had been repaid; and
the pattern  of borrowing  by this point showed that Mrs L had, in all likelihood, 
become reliant  on these payday  loans and may have been  facing  some  wider 
financial issues. 
MYJAR continued to approve loans for Mrs L after Loan 7 until November 2016 - a further  
two years.  
Mrs Ls representative did not disagree  with this second adjudicators opinion which I take to 
mean that Mrs L is satisfied with the fact that Loans 1 to 4 and Loan 6 were  not upheld.  
Loan 5 had been conceded by MYJAR already and so will be included as an uphold in this 
decision.  
MYJAR did not agree and has asked us to consider that in its view The information  provided 
seems to support  that the customer  could afford  to repay the loans from her disposable 
income. 
From this background  it seems that the unresolved loans are Loans 8 to 12.
The complaint has been passed  to me for a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mrs Ls complaint. 
Ive decided to uphold Mrs Ls complaint in part and have explained why below.
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs L 
could repay  her loans  in a sustainable  manner. 
The gaps in the lending were present but not significant and so I do think that this was one 
loan chain. 
From around December 2014 /January  2015  I have looked at the overall pattern  of lending. 
Im mindful here of the short-term purpose of this type of credit and of the relevant rules, 
Ref: DRN01170943guidance and good industry  practice  at the time. Ive looked to see if there was a point  at 
which MYJAR should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any 
further lending.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ls case, I think that this point was reached by 
Loan 7 for the same  reasons outlined by our second  adjudicator and set out above. And 
I explain further that:
the amounts  Mrs L was borrowing were generally increasing, and MYJAR ought to 
have realised it was likely her indebtedness was increasing unsustainably; 
Mrs L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed the lender.  Although  
her last two loans were  instalment  loans they were for very large  sums  and repayable 
over six months which meant  that the last two loans extended  her indebtedness  for 
an additional  12 months, where MYJAR  had already been  lending to her almost 
continuously since July 2014. 
Mrs L was in effect paying  large  amounts of interest to service the debt over an 
extended period.
I think that Mrs L lost out because MYJAR continued  to provide borrowing from Loan 7 
onwards because these loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ls indebtedness by 
allowing her to take expensive credit  over an extended period of time. And also because the 
sheer number of loans  Mrs L was being  approved for was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mrs Ls ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in the market  for 
these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Mrs Ls complaint about  Loans 7 to 12 (of which Loans 7 and 10 have been 
conceded by MYJAR) because the overall pattern of lending  increased her indebtedness  in 
a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and she lost out as a result.
Ref: DRN01170944putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs L paid on loans 5 and 7 to 12 inclusive; and 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about Loan 5 from Mrs Ls credit file;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 7 means any information recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  Loans 7 to 12 should  be removed from Mrs Ls credit 
file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mrs L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mrs Ls 
complaint. MYJAR  Limited should  do as Ive set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I need to ask Mrs L to accept or reject 
my final determination  on or before 27 March 2019.
