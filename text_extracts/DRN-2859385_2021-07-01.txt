The complaint
Miss R is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA, didnt honour her request for a 
reimbursement when the item she ordered from an online vendor wasnt received,  
What happened
Miss R ordered an item from an online vendor. The item initially didnt arrive for several 
months, and when an item was delivered by the online vendor, it was the wrong item. Miss R 
contacted the online vendor and requested a refund without success. 
Following this, Miss R raised a reimbursement request with PayPal under their Buyer 
Protection scheme. However, PayPal declined Miss Rs request. Miss R wasnt happy about 
this, so she raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Miss Rs complaint, but they noted that the request has been raised on the 
basis that the item hadnt been received, and that the vendor had been able to provide proof 
of postage which confirmed that an item had been delivered. So, they didnt uphold Miss Rs 
complaint.
Miss R wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that PayPal had been given the 
information necessary for them to have understood what had happened in this instance, and 
that PayPal should have reimbursed Miss R accordingly. So, they recommended that the 
complaint be upheld in Miss Rs favour, and that PayPal should reimburse Miss R the cost of 
the item as well as an additional £50 to compensate her for the trouble and upset this matter 
had caused. 
PayPal didnt agree with the recommendations put forward by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal have explained to this service that, because the reimbursement request was made 
by Miss R on the basis that the item hadnt been received, that they had contacted the 
vendor, and that the vendor had provided proof of postage which confirmed that an item had 
been delivered  which was why Miss Rs reimbursement request had been declined.
I can understand PayPals position here  to a degree. However, having reviewed all the 
information available to me on this case its clear that Miss R was in continuing discussions 
with PayPal such that PayPal were aware of the specifics of what had happened here  
namely, that the item hadnt been delivered for several months at first, but then that the 
vendor had sent an item which was different to the item that Miss R had ordered.
Its difficult therefore not to conclude that PayPal had ample opportunity to work with Miss R 
to ensure that her reimbursement request was correct and appropriate with regard PayPals 
requirements  and this is what this service would expect of PayPal in this instance. 
However, PayPal didnt assist Miss R in this manner, and instead followed a process which 
unfairly resulted in Miss R not receiving a reimbursement under their Buyer Protection 
scheme - which it is clear and obvious that she should have been entitled to, albeit under a 
different category of reimbursement request.
PayPal have suggested that Miss R should raise another reimbursement request under the 
title of item received significantly not as described and have further suggested that this 
request might be successful. However, I see no reason to prolong Miss Rs wait for a 
reimbursement, especially given that PayPal have already had an excellent opportunity to 
reach a fair and reasonable resolution to this ongoing matter but failed to do so.
It follows then that Ill be upholding this complaint in Miss Rs favour and instructing PayPal 
to reimburse the cost of the item to Miss R and to make a further payment of £50 to Miss R 
to compensate her for the ongoing upset and inconvenience this matter has caused.
I trust that PayPal will understand, given all that Ive explained above, why I have made the 
final decision that I have.  
Putting things right
PayPal must reimburse to Miss R the cost of the item in question.
PayPal must also make a further payment of £50 to Miss R to compensate her for the 
ongoing trouble and upset this matter has caused.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA on 
the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 July 2021.
