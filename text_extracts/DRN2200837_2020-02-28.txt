Before the complaint came to this service  Sunny said that it wasnt sure that approving loan 
1 was appropriate and it offered Mr B compensation. Mr B didnt accept this compensation. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. In addition  to the offer Sunny had already 
made she thought  that it was acting appropriately  when  it approved  loans 2 and 3. But that it 
shouldnt have approved loans 5 to 8. 
Mr B accepted the adjudicators opinion.  However, Sunny looked at the complaint again  
following what our adjudicator said. After doing  this it withdrew the offer it had made about 
loan 1. It made an offer of goodwill to repay the interest and charges on loans 5 to 8 but 
without adding interest for late repayment. 
Our adjudicator also looked at the sale of loan 1 and agreed that it was appropriate to 
approve this loan. But she also said that offer wasnt in line with what  she recommended 
because interest wasnt  added to the fees and charges being returned. 
Mr B didnt accept this offer. Mr B broadly agrees with the adjudicators  opinion.  But he did 
want to point out that he doesnt think Sunny shouldve been allowed to withdraw  its offer on 
loan 1. 
So as no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN22008372Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Bs complaint 
in part and have explained why below.
After some correspondence Mr B didnt  disagree with our adjudicators  opinion  about the 
merits of loans 1 to 4. And having  looked  at all the evidence, I dont think Sunny was wrong 
to approve this lending. So I wont comment further  about it. But it was part of the borrowing  
relationship Mr B had with Sunny.  So they are something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took.
Mr B doesnt  think that Sunny shouldve been allowed to withdraw the offer it has made in 
respect of loan one. But Sunny is free to try and resolve a complaint how it thinks  is 
appropriate until my final decision  is accepted.  So whilst I understand Mr Bs frustration with 
this, Im unable to uphold  his complaint  about this loan for this reason. 
Loan 5 was Mr Bs fifth loan in a short period of time. And the amounts he was borrowing 
were not decreasing. Mr B had, very shortly before taking this loan, fully repaid  the £1,150 
he had borrowed from Sunny in the months  beforehand. And he was making a commitment  
to make repayments for a further 24 weeks.  
I think this points to Mr B having some longer term financial problems rather than just using 
the loans to help with a temporary cash flow problem. Sunny shouldve  also become 
concerned about  whether it knew enough about  Mr Bs true financial situation.
I think that it wouldve  been proportionate  to fully review Mr Bs financial situation And I think 
that Sunny needed to verify the information it found  out where possible. This is to make sure 
Mr B was in position to make the repayments  sustainably.
Ref: DRN22008373I dont think Sunny did this. So I need to think about  what Sunny wouldve seen if it had 
carried out proportionate checks. 
Mr B has provided some  information about  his financial circumstances. This includes his 
bank statements. I accept  that this isnt exactly what Sunny wouldve seen at the time and it 
couldve verified the information another  way. But I think it wouldve found out similar  
information if it had made  proportionate checks, so I think its reasonable to rely on it.
This shows that Mr B was having problems managing  his money.  As our adjudicator noted 
his regular expenditure, and his credit expenditure was very high. And he was regularly 
borrowing and repaying significant amounts to and from other  short term lenders. 
And a substantial portion of Mr Bs income  was being spent on gambling.  And it seems  
reasonable to say that he was using  short  term lending to support this. So its unlikely  that 
Mr B would be able to sustainably repay his loans over time. 
I think that Sunny wouldve found  out this information if it had made proportionate checks.  
And I think Sunny wouldve seen  Mr B wouldnt have been able repay the loans  in a 
sustainable way. So I think that Sunny shouldnt have given loans 5 to 8 to Mr B and I think  
hes lost out as a result  of this. So Im upholding  Mr Bs complaint about loans 5 to 8. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 5 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 5 to 8 from Mr Bs credit file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr B a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Bs complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 March  2020.
