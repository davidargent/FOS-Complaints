K821x#15Complaint
Mr W complains Elevate  Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him 
irresponsibly. He also says that Sunny didnt assess any vulnerabilities or ask whether he 
had any mental health  issues when it lent to him.

*Loan 1 was a running credit facility (RCF)  and this is different to the instalment loans that 
Mr W took afterwards.  
The RCF allows a consumer to either request  funds  up to their agreed  credit limit in one go 
or take multiple  drawdowns up to their limit. Mr W initially  had a credit limit of £150  which  
was increased to £300 on 11 August 2014.  Each  drawdown could  be repaid via five monthly  
instalments. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think it was wrong  to agree the RCF initially, but thought  Sunny 
shouldnt have granted any further drawdowns from the 3 September 2014 or any of the 
instalment loans. 
Ref: DRN56902942Mr W hasnt replied to the adjudicators view. Sunny disagreed with what  the adjudicator said 
about allowing  drawdowns on the RCF after September  2014. Sunny has though accepted 
that something may have gone  wrong when it provided loans 2 to 19, so it agreed to refund  
interest on these loans together with 8% simple interest. It has also agreed to amend Mr Ws 
credit file by removing any relevant entries  to reflect its offer.
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed  to me for a final decision 
about the RCF drawdowns from September 2014.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr W says that Sunny  didnt assess any vulnerabilities or ask whether he had any mental  
health issues. I dont  think Sunny was specifically required  to ask whether Mr W had any 
mental health issues when it started to lend to him. But I would expect Sunny to have dealt 
with Mr W fairly had it been made aware  that Mr W was a vulnerable customer.  However, 
Mr W hasnt provided  us any more information about this part of his complaint, so based  on 
the information I have, I cant  see that Sunny did anything  in this regard.
Mr W doesnt appear to disagree  with our adjudicators findings that Sunny wasnt wrong to 
grant the RCF or lend the first nine drawdowns. It seems therefore  that this lending isnt in 
dispute and so I no longer think that I need  to make a finding about it. 
Ive also not considered whether Sunny shouldve lent loans 2 to 19 as it has already agreed  
something went wrong and made an offer to settle this part of the complaint. But for clarity 
Ive set out how Sunny should  update Mr Ws credit file for these loans.    
So instead,  this decision will focus on whether Sunny  did anything wrong when it granted 
drawdowns under the RCF from 3 September 2014 (the tenth drawdown  onwards) until the 
facility was closed.  But I have kept the other lending in mind when thinking  about the overall  
lending relationship between Sunny and Mr W. 
For the lending  that remains in dispute, Sunny had to assess  Mr Ws situation to check  if he 
could afford  to pay back the amounts  hed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do 
this in a way which was proportionate  to the circumstances.  Sunnys checks  could have 
taken into account  a number of different things,  such as how much was being  lent, the size 
of the repayments  and Mr Ws income and expenditure. With this in mind, I think in the early 
stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr W. These factors include:  
Mr W having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN56902943Mr W having a large  number of loans and/or  having these loans over a long period  of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr W coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing  had been  repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably make the RCF repayments   not just whether they were 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer 
could sustainably make  them.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
There was also an expectation  in September 2014, when the tenth drawdown  under the 
RCF was granted, that Sunny would review  and monitor how Mr W was using the RCF 
facility. CONC 6.7.2  says; A firm must  monitor a customers repayment record and take 
appropriate action  where there are signs of actual  or possible repayment  difficulties.  
So it wasnt  enough  for Sunny to just assess the further lending based  on what  it knew  when 
the RCF had initially been approved  in December 2013. It also needed to monitor how Mr W 
was using the facility - and then step in and provide help when or if it could see Mr W was, or 
was likely, having financial difficulties.
I can see that Mr W initially had a credit  limit under the RCF of £150, before it was increased 
to £300 on 11 August  2014. 
Mr W took the full credit  limit of £150 on 12 December 2013. Following regular payments in 
December 2013  and January 2014,  Mr W drew down £46.32 on 4 February 2014, taking his 
borrowing back up to the credit limit of £150. Mr W then developed a clear pattern of lending  
under the RCF. Between March 2014  and 11 July 2014, he took £150 each month. And in 
his monthly pay cycle he repaid each of these  drawdowns in full before borrowing again. He 
was in effect using the facility at this point as if it was a payday loan. 
Ref: DRN56902944Mr W repaid the drawdown  of £150 taken on 11 July 2014 towards the end of that month. He 
then borrowed a further £150  on 31 July 2014, which  he repaid the following day. Following  
an increase in the RCFs credit limit on 11 August  2014, Mr W took £275 on 17 August 2014.  
This was repaid  around two weeks  later, on 30 August  2014.  Four days  later,  Mr W took a 
drawdown of £300 on 3 September 2014,  taking his borrowing up to the increased  credit 
limit of £300.  So around 9 months  after the first drawdown, Mr Ws outstanding debt was 
twice as much as it had been initially.   
I think Sunny  should have  been aware  by this point (the tenth drawdown), that Mr W wasnt  
using his account as intended  or making  any headway  in repaying his loan. The way in 
which Mr W was using the facility,  was in my view a sign that Mr W was having possible 
repayment difficulties.  I think  its fair to say that Mr W was most likely needing to borrow  
further from Sunny in order  to fill a hole in his finances that was made by making  repayments  
to Sunny.  Mr W continued to drawdown between October and December 2014 through  four 
further drawdowns of £300. So he didnt make any real in-roads into repaying the capital he 
was borrowing. This isnt a sustainable form of borrowing and suggests  to me that Mr W was 
having problems  managing his money. 
In these circumstances, I agree with our adjudicator that Sunny couldnt  reasonably  have 
believed that Mr W would  have been  able to repay  drawdowns from 3 September 2014  
without undue difficulty or without the need to borrow again. So I dont  think  Sunny shouldve 
allowed any further  drawdowns from this date.
Sunny has agreed  that loans 2 to 19 shouldnt have been lent because Mr W was not, when  
looking at his loan usage overall,  using the credit  for short  term borrowing needs.  So it has 
offered to refund interest on these loans together with 8% simple interest. It has also agreed 
to amend Mr Ws credit file by removing  any relevant entries to reflect its offer.  As Sunny 
accepts that these loans shouldnt have  been lent, the issue for me to decide is whether the 
offer it has made is reasonable.  
This offer is in line with what this service  may have recommended had we decided  these  
loans 2 - 19 shouldnt have been given. So Im not intended to review  these loans  any 
further. 
So, Im upholding  Mr Ws complaint about his borrowing  from the tenth drawdown under the 
RCF (on 3 September 2014). And taken together with what  I think  is a fair offer by Sunny for 
loans 2 to 19, Ive set out what  it should  do to put things right as detailed below.
Ref: DRN56902945Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on drawdowns on the RCF from
3 September 2014 as well as all interest, fees and charges applied to loans 2 to 19;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  on Mr Ws credit file about the RCF from
3 September 2014;
remove loans 2 to 19 from Mr Ws credit  file entirely, this is because the period of 
time Mr W owed  Sunny money means that any information still recorded  about these 
loans is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr W a certificate  showing  how much  tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ws complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr W as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 May 2020.
