K820x#14complaint
Mrs D complains that a fixed sum loan agreement that was used to pay for a car was mis-
sold to her by The Just Partnership  Limited.  Her husband is also involved in her complaint.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car had been supplied to Mrs D under a credit agreement,  for which  the Just 
Partnership was the credit  intermediary,  in September 2015 but due to a change  in 
her circumstances she part-exchanged that car for a larger car in May 2016;
she signed a fixed sum loan agreement with a credit provider, for which the Just 
Partnership was again  the credit intermediary, in May 2016 under which  she agreed 
to repay  the loan by a payment of £363.96,  47 monthly payments of £264.96 and a 
final payment of £4,799;
Mrs D wanted to voluntarily terminate the agreement and approached a third party  
but says that she was told that she couldnt do so because  it was a loan agreement  
she then contacted the Just Partnership  and it says that it bought the car from her in 
February 2019 and settled the loan agreement with the credit provider  Mrs D paid 
£2,000 towards  that settlement;
she then complained to the Just Partnership, and this service,  that the loan 
agreement had been mis-sold to her because shed  been told that the car was being 
supplied to her on the same basis as her previous credit agreement;
our investigator thought that Mrs D had agreed  to enter into the loan agreement and 
that the Just Partnership hadnt  acted  unfairly;
the credit  provider has provided  a copy of the loan agreement signed by Mrs D, a 
copy of the offer of a personal loan letter that was sent to her, the signed direct  debit 
mandate, the pre-contact credit information and loan explanation that was prepared  
for her and a copy of the salespersons  confirmation  that the loan had been properly 
explained to Mrs D;
the credit  provider has also provided copies of the e-mails that were sent to Mrs D 
after shes signed the loan agreement in which it confirmed that the loan had been  
approved and explained how she could  access the loan agreement;
Mrs D says that she didnt receive a copy of the loan agreement but I consider it to 
be more likely than not that those e-mails were sent to her so she was given 
information about how to access the loan agreement  and, if she hadnt received a 
copy of the agreement, I consider  that it would be reasonable to expect her to have 
asked the credit  provider (or the Just Partnership) for a copy of the agreement;
Ref: DRN24667842the Just Partnership  says that the credit provider wouldnt supply the car to Mrs D 
under a credit agreement in May 2016 because of the negative equity under her 
previous agreement so it was only able to offer her a loan agreement;
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that the Just Partnership 
gave incorrect information about the loan agreement to Mrs D or that it 
misrepresented the agreement  to her;
the Just Partnership  has since bought the car from Mrs D and settled the agreement 
with the credit provider   and Mrs D paid £2,000  towards  that settlement  it says 
that it paid Mrs D £500 more than the part-exchange value of the car as a gesture 
goodwill because of its relationship with her  and I consider that it has acted fairly 
and reasonably; 
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  the agreement was mis-sold 
to Mrs D or that the Just Partnership has acted incorrectly in its dealings with her; 
and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require the Just Partnership to 
refund to Mrs D the £2,000 that she paid towards the settlement, to pay her any other  
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold Mrs Ds complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 February  2021.
