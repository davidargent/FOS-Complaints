The complaint
Mr B complains that London & Colonial Services Limited (L&C) caused unnecessary delays 
when he requested it transfer funds held within his Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) to 
another provider. And these delays caused him a financial loss.
In bringing this complaint, Mr B is represented by a third party, but for simplicity within this 
decision Ill refer to all actions and correspondence as being completed by Mr B himself.
What happened
Mr B held a SIPP with L&C. In November 2019 Mr B instructed L&C to transfer two 
investment funds he held within his SIPP, amounting to approximately £45,000 to a SIPP 
held with Royal London. These two funds were managed by businesses Ill refer to as [X] 
and [Y]. The completed discharge forms were received by L&C on 6 December 2019.
On 24 January 2020 L&C sent withdrawal instructions to [X] and [Y].
On 7 February 2020 [X] sent a closing statement to L&C confirming it had transferred the 
fund value, £21,486.02 to L&Cs designated account. (These funds were received by L&C on 
12 February 2020).
On 10 February 2020 [Y] wrote to L&C asking for further identification verification as it was 
unable to verify the signatures on the transfer instructions.
On 2 May 2020 L&C emailed [Y] to confirm if it had received the withdrawal request it had 
sent on 24 January 2020.
On 18 May 2020 Mr B complained to L&C about the fact that the transfer had still not been 
completed.
On 9 July 2020 L&C emailed [Y] again and attached a copy of the withdrawal request. 
[Y] responded the following day saying it couldnt verify the signatures on the instruction, and 
again asked for an updated signatory list to be provided.
On 13 July 2020 L&C issued its final response to Mr Bs complaint. It agreed that it had 
caused a delay of 30 days to the transfer, and said it would carry out a loss calculation. But 
Mr B wasnt happy with this response, so referred his complaint to our service.
On 19 September 2020 L&C asked [Y] for an update on the withdrawal. [Y] replied two days 
later to say it had already responded on 10 July 2020.
L&C sent [Y] the required updated signatory list on 22 September 2020 and the funds were 
received from [Y] three days later. L&C transferred the value of the funds from [X] and [Y] to 
Mr Bs new SIPP on 28 September 2020.
When our Investigator considered the complaint and the timeline of events, he thought L&C 
were responsible for more than 30 days of delays. He thought that [X] and [Y] had 
responded in a timely manner to all the requests from L&C, and where [Y] had asked for 
additional information, this request was reasonable in the circumstances. He thought that 
L&C ought to have been in a position to complete Mr Bs transfer instructions on 27 February 
2020. So as it wasnt completed until 28 September 2020, this was considerably more than 
the 30 days delay L&C had said it had caused. 
Given the Investigator thought L&C were responsible for delays in the transfer, he thought 
Mr B may have suffered a financial loss while his funds were not invested in his new SIPP. 
So he thought L&C should carry out a loss calculation, and set out the methodology that he 
considered fair in the circumstances. He also thought L&C should pay Mr B an additional 
£200 for the distress and inconvenience hed been caused. 
L&C didnt respond to the Investigators view, so the complaint has come to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
And having done so, I agree with the findings of the Investigator, for broadly the same 
reasons. Ill explain.
L&C has agreed that it caused unnecessary delays in facilitating the transfer of Mr Bs funds 
to his new SIPP. But what is in dispute is the extent of these delays, and the impact these 
may have had on both Mr B personally, and the value of his pension funds.
L&C has said it felt it was responsible for a delay of 30 days in the process. But I dont 
agree. Having considered the timeline of events, I am satisfied that L&C shouldve most 
likely been in a position to finally action the transfer to Mr Bs new SIPP by 27 February 
2020. 
There were two funds within Mr B SIPP that he had requested to be transferred to his new 
Royal London SIPP. These were held with businesses [X] and [Y]. I can see from the 
records that the requests made by L&C to both [X] and [Y] were actioned and responded to 
in a timely manner. [Y] required signature verification, but this is a reasonable request as it 
was unable to confirm the authenticity of the request, and it took this step to protect Mr Bs 
funds. But it was L&C who didnt respond to this request when it was made by [Y]. And it 
wasnt [Y]s responsibility to chase this up  it was something L&C had to do in order to 
facilitate Mr Bs request. 
I note that L&C has said that it hadnt received post sent to it by both [X] and [Y] that it said it 
needed. But Ive seen that the letters sent were sent and addressed to L&C at the correct 
street and town. And although the post code used was wrong, it was only the last two digits 
which were incorrect. So I think, on balance, that it is more likely than not that the letters 
were received by L&C.The funds held by [X] were transferred to L&C on 12 February 2020. So the wait for the 
funds from [Y] was all that was required for the transaction to be completed. The significant 
delay was caused by L&C not responding to the signature verification request made by [Y] 
which had been made on 10 February 2020.  And I can see that when this was eventually 
responded to on 22 September 2020, [Y] transferred the funds to L&C within three days.
So, allowing for a reasonable period of five working days to acknowledge and action 
requests, Im satisfied that had it acted in a timely manner L&C shouldve been in a position 
to finalise the transfer of Mr Bs funds into his new SIPP by 27 February 2020. And allowing 
for five working days from this point, I think it is reasonable to conclude that the funds would 
have been available for investment in Mr Bs new SIPP on 6 March 2020.
I cannot know for certain what investment choice Mr B wouldve made within his new SIPP 
had his funds been available in March 2020. But when he was able to access them in 
September 2020, he invested in the Governed Portfolio 7 fund. And I think it is most likely he 
would have done this by 6 March 2020 had he been able to. 
Putting things right
In order to put Mr B back as closely as possible in the position he wouldve been in had the 
delays not occurred, I require L&C to undertake a loss calculation as set out below.
Fair compensation
I take the view that Mr B would have invested his funds into the Governed Portfolio 7 earlier 
than he was actually able to do. Im satisfied that what Ive set out below is fair and 
reasonable and most likely reflective of his investment intentions when he requested the 
transfer of his funds.
What must L&C do?
To compensate Mr B fairly, L&C must:
Compare the performance of Mr B's investment with that of the benchmark 
shown below. If the actual value is greater than the fair value, no compensation is 
payable.
If the fair value is greater than the actual value there is a loss and compensation 
is payable.
L&C should pay into Mr B's pension plan to increase its value by the total amount 
of the compensation and any interest. The amount paid should allow for the effect 
of charges and any available tax relief. Compensation should not be paid into the 
pension plan if it would conflict with any existing protection or allowance.
If L&C is unable to pay the total amount into Mr B's pension plan, it should pay 
that amount direct to him. But had it been possible to pay into the plan, it would 
have provided a taxable income. Therefore the total amount should be reduced to 
notionally allow for any income tax that would otherwise have been paid. This is 
an adjustment to ensure the compensation is a fair amount  it isnt a payment of 
tax to HMRC, so Mr B wont be able to reclaim any of the reduction after 
compensation is paid.The notional allowance should be calculated using Mr B's actual or expected 
marginal rate of tax at his selected retirement age. For example, if Mr B is likely 
to be a basic rate taxpayer at the selected retirement age, the reduction would 
equal the current basic rate of tax. However, if Mr B would have been able to 
take a tax free lump sum, the reduction should be applied to 75% of the 
compensation.
Pay to Mr B £200 for the distress and inconvenience caused by the delays in the 
transfer process.
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If L&C deducts income tax from the 
interest it should tell Mr B how much has been taken off. L&C should give Mr B a tax 
deduction certificate in respect of interest if Mr B asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax on 
interest from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.

Actual value
This means the actual amount payable from the investment at the end date.
Fair value
This is what the investment would have been worth at the end date had it produced a return 
using the benchmark.
Any additional sum paid into the investment should be added to the fair value calculation 
from the point in time when it was actually paid in.
Any withdrawal from Mr Bs Royal London SIPP should be deducted from the fair value 
calculation at the point it was actually paid so it ceases to accrue any return in the 
calculation from that point on. If there have been a large number of regular payments, to 
keep the calculations simpler it is acceptable to total all those payments and deduct that 
figure at the end to determine the fair value instead of deducting periodically.
Why is this remedy suitable?
Ive decided on this method of compensation because Mr B would have most likely invested 
in the Governed Portfolio 7 sooner, had the delays not occurred.
My final decision
I uphold the complaint. My decision is that London & Colonial Services Limited should pay 
the amount calculated as set out above.
London & Colonial Services Limited should provide details of its calculation to Mr B in a 
clear, simple format. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 November 2022.
