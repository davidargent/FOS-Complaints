The complaint
Mr M complains about how NewDay Ltd went about helping him to recover money from a 
supplier. He also complains about it defaulting his account.
What happened
In June 2016 Mr M paid a supplier I will call N to carry out repairs on the electric windows 
of his car. Mr M was unhappy with the standard of the work and contacted N about this. 
There was some to and fro between Mr M and N, in which Mr M maintained that Ns work 
was substandard, and N suggested that there was nothing wrong with the work. This contact 
was mainly conducted via WhatsApp and ended with both Mr M and N suggesting theyd 
take legal action against each other. At this point Mr M turned to NewDay Ltd for help.
Mr M had used his NewDay Ltd credit card to pay for the repairs. On that basis NewDay Ltd 
had two possible routes it could have used to refund Mr Ms money, chargeback against N or 
a claim against NewDay Ltd under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (Section 
75). 
According to NewDay Ltds records, it tried to carry out a chargeback and sent out the 
relevant form to Mr M. But by the time he returned the form it was too late to continue as the 
relevant deadline had been missed. 
Moreover, again according to NewDay Ltds records, in order to progress Mr Ms claim under 
Section 75 NewDay Ltd needed further information. NewDay Ltd suggests it asked Mr M to 
provide this information, but he did not. But he did suggest if it needed hard evidence it 
could come and examine the car itself.
In the meantime, Mr M had not made any payments to his account. As a result the account 
fell into arrears. NewDay Ltds records show it told Mr M about the arrears and let him know 
that it would default the account and possibly sell it should he not pay off the arrears. 
However, it heard nothing further from him, at that time. As a result, in February 2017 it sold 
the debt to a third party I will call C. 
NewDay Ltd suggests the next time it heard from Mr M was March 2021 when Mr M 
complained that it had not progressed his claim under Section 75 correctly. Specifically, Mr 
M suggested NewDay Ltd had not told him what further information it needed to move on his 
claim. Mr M also complained about what had happened to his account, in particular he 
wanted to know why the debt was defaulted. Mr M also wanted an explanation for why he 
was being told that there could be court action against him to secure the debt on his home. 
In response, NewDay Ltd repeated that it had asked Mr M for specific information to support 
his claim under Section 75 and he had not provided it. On this basis it had not been able to 
continue looking into his claim. Moreover it suggested that in any event Mr M had paid a 
third party company who I will all D rather than N directly. According to NewDay Ltd this 
would have prevented it from upholding his claim under Section 75 in any event. 
Further, according to NewDay Ltds records, Mr M had not made payments to his account for 
more than 60 days. It had written to him to tell him what he needed to do if he wanted to 
keep the account open and avoid the default. It had told him he needed to clear the arrears 
and start making minimum payments, but he had not. Therefore, NewDay Ltd had sold his 
account to C. NewDay Ltd indicated that it could not comment about any legal action C 
might have taken to recover the debt from him. 
For all of these reasons NewDay Ltd did not agree it had done anything wrong and rejected 
Mr Ms complaint.
Dissatisfied Mr M complained to our service.
Once Mr Ms complaint was with us Mr M raised a new matter. He suggested that he had 
been treated differently and negatively by both N and NewDay Ltd due to the colour of his 
skin. Mr M also let us know that he had contacted a third party organisation who I will call O 
for advice. It appears that O s remit is to support consumers. He told us about the advice 
O had given him re his claim under Section 75. He wanted us to comment on this advice 
and explain why we were not holding NewDay Ltd to account in line with what O had told 
him.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ms complaint. She did not recommend upholding it.
NewDay Ltd appeared to accept this recommendation, Mr M did not. In summary, in 
rejecting the recommendation Mr M repeated that as far as he was aware he had provided 
NewDay Ltd with all the information it needed to look into his claim under Section 75. He 
also suggested he had contacted NewDay Ltd to check with it whether it needed anything 
further, but it had not responded to him. 
Mr M also reiterated that he had gone to NewDay Ltd looking for help and in his opinion it 
had not helped him. He added that we must be siding with NewDay Ltd if we could not see 
this. 
In addition, Mr M pointed out that from his perspective he had paid for something he had not 
got. He wanted to know if our investigator would pay for something she had not received. Mr 
M also wanted our investigator to ask all of her colleagues the question would they pay for 
something theyd not received. 
Further, Mr M told us that when he had originally contacted NewDay Ltd in 2016 he had sent 
it a video to demonstrate the problem with the electric windows. We asked NewDay about 
the video footage it said it had no record of ever having received it.
Mr M told us that NewDay Ltd had messaged him privately on WhatsApp and told him he did 
not need to make the payments towards his credit card account because he was disputing 
the transaction with N. Moreover Mr M indicated he had never seen the letters from NewDay 
Ltd asking for payment as hed been in hospital at the time. We asked him to provide 
information to demonstrate this. Mr M sent information showing he was in hospital, but this 
was before he engaged N to work on his car and before he stopped making payments to his 
card. Mr M responded that he had follow-up appointments, and this was what hed been 
talking about, but he did not have letters to show this. Instead he suggested we could talk 
directly to his surgeon to confirm the dates of treatment. Moreover, he added that the same 
surgeon had told his family specifically not to show him any letters about debts while he was 
under the surgeons care.
Mr M indicated that he wanted an ombudsman to take a fresh look at his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First, Im very aware that Ive summarised this complaint in far less detail than the parties 
and Ive done so using my own words. Im not going to respond to every single point made 
by all the parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on what 
I think are the key issues here. Our rules allow me to do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as a free 
alternative to the courts. If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive ignored 
it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual argument to be able to 
reach what I think is the right outcome.
Chargeback
As Mr M paid for the goods and services using his credit card and wanted a refund, Ive 
thought about whether NewDay Ltd dealt with his request fairly. The chargeback 
process is relevant in this case. This is a way in which payment settlement disputes are 
resolved between card issuers and merchants. They are dealt with under the relevant 
card scheme rules.
In certain circumstances the process provides a way for NewDay Ltd to ask for a payment 
Mr M made to be refunded. Those circumstances include but are not limited to where 
goods or services arent supplied or as described/misrepresented by the company Mr M 
paid. A chargeback doesnt guarantee a refund there are a number of hurdles to overcome 
to reach that result. For instance Mr M had to demonstrate that a valid chargeback reason 
existed moreover Ns bank could have put forward a defence to any chargeback claim. 
Mr M suggests he did return the chargeback claim form in time. But NewDay Ltds records 
do not support this. I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of its records on this point. 
There are set deadlines for the chargeback process which NewDay Ltd had to follow. 
Once these deadlines are missed there is nothing further NewDay Ltd is able to do using 
this process..
Additionally, Mr M talks about sending in video evidence. Even if he did send this what 
would this have shown? All it could have most likely shown was the windows not working 
properly. It would not show why and that is what would have been needed for the 
chargeback attempt. So whether Mr M did send the video evidence of not would not have 
made any difference to the chargeback, on balance.
Further, it is clear from the WhatsApp messages I have seen that N would have defended 
any chargeback and done so robustly.Based on what Ive seen Mr M would not have been 
able to provide evidence to overturn that defence, I think what would have been needed 
here is an experts report because Ns stance was there was no problem with the work it 
did on the windows. So even if the chargeback could have gone ahead, which I dont think 
it could have done, due to the deadline being missed, it is unlikely it would have been 
decided in Mr Ms favour for this reason.
For all of these individual reasons I have no proper basis for saying NewDay Ltd did not 
deal with the chargeback correctly. 
Mr Ms complaint about the handling of his claim under Section 75 
Mr M is not just relying on chargeback. Rather, he also relies on the rights he considers that 
he has under Section 75. 
Mr M is correct to suggest that because he used his credit card to pay N he may have the 
protection provided by Section 75. 
The general effect of Section 75 is that if Mr M has a claim for misrepresentation or breach 
of contract against the supplier he can also bring a like claim against NewDay Ltd provided 
certain conditions are met. 
I think its important to set out my role here. In considering a complaint about a financial 
services provider, Im not determining the outcome of a claim that a party might have under 
Section 75. Rather, in deciding whats a fair way to resolve Mr Ms complaint, I have to take 
account of relevant law, amongst other things. Section 75 is relevant law. Therefore, Ive 
taken it into account. But that doesnt mean Im obliged to reach the same outcome as, for example, a court might reach if Mr M pursued a claim for misrepresentation or breach of 
contract. Our service is an informal alternative to the courts and operates differently from 
them.
It follows though that if I found that there had been a breach of contract as Mr M suggests I 
would find it fair and reasonable that NewDay Ltd take responsibility for this.
I talked above about the qualifying conditions for a valid claim under Section 75. One of 
those conditions is that there must be a valid debtor-creditor-supplier relationship. This 
means that Mr M has to be the debtor, NewDay Ltd the creditor and N the supplier. NewDay 
Ltd says that this valid debtor-creditor-supplier relationship does not exist in this complaint 
because Mr Ms payment went to D rather than to N. This in itself does not mean there was 
no valid debtor-creditor-supplier relationship. For example, if D and N had such a close 
relationship that they were associates as defined under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 then 
there may have been a valid debtor-creditor-supplier relationship. I dont have sufficient 
information about this point to make a finding. But I dont need it because I dont think 
NewDay Ltd ought to have acted differently in any event, for the following reasons.
In order to establish if there had been a breach of contract NewDay Ltd needed more 
information than Mr M supplied. It needed information to show what N had contracted with 
Mr M to do, and to show that the work done was not done with the requisite degree of skill 
and care. The WhatsApp messages between Mr M and N were not enough to show this and 
neither was the video information. 
Mr Ms position is that NewDay Ltd did not tell him what it needed. But NewDay Ltds records 
show it asked Mr M for further information and told him why it was required, I have no reason 
to doubt the accuracy of NewDay Ltds records on this point. Moreover, I can see from the 
information I have that Mr M questioned the need for any further information, from his 
perspective he had supplied enough, and he expressed dissatisfaction that NewDay Ltd 
were not cracking on with what it had. Which suggests to me Mr M was not open to the need 
for providing more information.
Further, NewDay Ltd was under no obligation to come and look at Mr Ms car. It was his 
responsibility to provide the information to support his claim. In other words I dont agree that 
NewDay Ltd let Mr M down in declining to come out and examine his car in person.
This all leads me to find on balance that NewDay Ltd acted appropriately by asking for the 
information it reasonably needed to get on with things and Mr M did not supply this 
information.  Rather than that Mr M was left not knowing what more he had to send to 
NewDay Ltd despite chasing it to find out.
Default of the account
Mr M would have agreed to the terms and conditions of the credit card account when he 
opened it. Since he entered freely into the agreement I think it is both fair and reasonable 
that NewDay Ltd can rely on those terms and conditions.
It does not seem to be in dispute that Mr M did not make his minimum payments and was in 
arrears for at least 60 days. Mr M suggests NewDay Ltd told him via WhatsApp that he did 
not need to pay. But he has not provided copies of these messages. Moreover the terms and 
conditions of the credit card agreement are clear NewDay Ltd required minimum monthly 
payments. I therefore find it unlikely it would have waived this condition in this instance.
Given that I find that Mr M had not got a payment waiver from NewDay Ltd I find that 
NewDay Ltd acted fairly when it wrote to him to tell him that if he did not pay he arrears it 
would likely default his account and chase him for payment or sell on the debt.
Mr M suggests he never received the letters. But I find it likely that these correctly addressed 
letters were delivered to his address. Therefore I find it fair and reasonable that NewDay Ltd 
be able to rely on them.In any event, and this point contradicts what Mr M says about never receiving the letters, Mr 
M tells us his surgeon told his family not to show him letters about debt. That may be so, but 
I have no proper basis for saying because his surgeon did this NewDay Ltd cannot rely on 
the letters.
For all of these individual reasons I think NewDay Ltd acted appropriately in defaulting the 
account. 
The actions of C
It appears that C is now taking legal action against Mr M in relation to the debt, but C is a 
separate legal entity from NewDay Ltd and I cant hold NewDay Ltd to account for the 
actions of C. 
Neither can I look at what C may or may not have done as part of this complaint. That is 
because C is not a party to this complaint.
New matter
Mr M raised a new point about being discriminated against by NewDay Ltd by reason of his 
race. This is a new matter and therefore NewDay Ltd has not had an opportunity to 
investigate it or respond to it in its final response. Therefore I have no power to look at it in 
this complaint.
The advice from O
I dont know what advice O might have given Mr M and in what circumstances. I recognise 
Mr M thinks this service must follow the advice given by O. But this service is independent 
and must look at complaints using its own judgement and rules rather than following the 
advice given by third party organisations in response to queries from consumers.
Mr Ms question
Mr M suggests that we should ask all of our colleagues if theyd pay for something that 
theyd not received. That is not the test I need to apply here, and Ill look at this point no 
further on that basis.
impartiality
I recognise that Mr M feels strongly about his complaint. I well understand therefore why he 
might think that this service must uphold his complaint, and if it does not this is unfair. Id like 
to reassure him that I am not siding with NewDay Ltd just because I find it acted 
appropriately in the circumstances. I have set out my reasons for the findings I have reached 
which are based on all the evidence I have seen. Mr M might find it some comfort to know 
that I have looked at his complaint impartially.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 November 2022.
