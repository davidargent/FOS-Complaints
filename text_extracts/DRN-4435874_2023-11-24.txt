DRN-4435874
The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc doesnt always accept his voice identity 
and so his attempts to access his account are frustrated. Mr D also said that NatWests 
agents arent sufficiently patient on calls, and he received a lot of activation codes.
What happened
Mr D said he had experienced problems inputting his activation codes and customer number 
during phone banking calls. NatWest suggested that Mr D had input these incorrectly, but he 
disagreed and said it is a bank error. 
NatWest apologised to Mr D for the inconvenience he has suffered during phone banking 
calls and has paid him Â£30 as a gesture of goodwill and his call costs.
Mr D wasnt satisfied with NatWests response and wanted the problem resolved as soon as 
possible as it interfered with his banking, and he referred his complaint to our service. Mr D 
has let us know about his severe health problems.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint be upheld. She spoke to Mr D on 
several occasions to understand his struggles with NatWests system, but couldnt find any 
error by NatWest. The investigator said the voice activation can be removed by Mr D.  
Mr D said NatWest hadnt resolved the problem and he requested an ombudsman review his 
complaint. Mr D said if he removes the voice activation he will have a longer wait time and 
NatWests agents werent patient on his calls, and were very sharp. He said his PIN didn't 
work again on a call to NatWest and when he got put through to someone else it did work. 
Mr D says all of this is taking a toll on his already severe ill health. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have looked at the information NatWest holds about Mr Ds account to see if it has acted 
within the terms and conditions of the account and to see if it has treated him fairly.
I was sorry to learn about Mr Ds serious illness and the distress and inconvenience he has 
suffered through the difficulties hes experienced in accessing his NatWest account by 
phone. Mr D is sure there is a problem with NatWests system, and I have looked at its 
records about this and to see how it has handled his account. 
On 11 August 2023 NatWest advised Mr D of his customer number by phone to ensure this 
was correct on the system. Separately, NatWest issued Mr D two activation codes in August 
2023 and its records indicate that Mr D had input these incorrectly.
Having considered the available information, I havent seen anything to suggest there is a 
problem with NatWests system in relation to Mr D, or that it has made an error in its 
handling of his account. NatWest has said that Mr D provided the incorrect number on 
occasions, and has confirmed that he is on medication that makes his thoughts foggy. Mr D 
is certainly not confused about the problems he is facing with his account. 
From the lack of identifiable errors and the actions NatWest has taken to assist Mr D, I think 
NatWest has acted within the terms and conditions of the account and treated Mr D fairly. 
And so I cannot require it to take any further action towards him.   
I sympathise with Mr Ds wish for more patience from NatWests agents during phone calls. 
He is elderly and seriously ill and navigating a banks systems in order to access his account 
is likely to be stressful without feeling being hurried along. NatWest has given its staff 
feedback about this and so I hope Mr D will have a better experience in future. NatWest has 
also stated that Mr D can remove the voice activation feature if he wishes, however, I 
understand his reluctance about this.
NatWest has offered to assist Mr D by having all his contacts handled by a dedicated over 
60s line, where staff are expected to be more patient. And it is now making contact with Mr D 
from its Customer Protection Manager who is trained to assist where customers are 
experiencing difficulties. These are good ideas and should allow Mr D to explain problems 
and obtain assistance where he has ongoing difficulties.  
Since his initial complaint, Mr D said he has faced continuing difficulties in accessing his 
account by phone and has made a new complaint to NatWest. I hope NatWest will address 
his issues as effectively as possible by continuing to explore the practical assistance it can 
give him. This should include calling him with account information at the times arranged and 
not when he is resting, so as not to interfere with daily routine. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 December 2023.
