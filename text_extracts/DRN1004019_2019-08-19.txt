K820x#14complaint
Ms W complains about her problems accessing banking services  from National Westminster 
Bank Plc (NatWest).
 
background
Ms W said shes found it very difficult to use the banking facilities at her local branch. She 
has health problems.  So she finds  it difficult  to wait in long queues.  And she cant  always 
hear because of the background music.  Ms W says the banks staff is sometimes rude and 
lacks empathy.
Ms W said NatWest  threatened  to withdraw  her banking provision when she complained. 
And the person she then complained about dealt  with the response.  So she wants NatWest 
to explain how it supports vulnerable customers.  And why the person was tasked  with 
responding to her follow-up complaint.
NatWest said it could  see Ms W was very unhappy with the service  shed received. It said 
itd tried to set up branches to make banking accessible and easy. NatWest said it felt 
playing music in the branches enhanced the customer experience. And if Ms W needed  any 
assistance when  she visited a branch a member of staff should be able to help. 
NatWest said itd introduced a number of new ways to bank as customer  behaviour  changes. 
And use of online,  mobile, telephone and post office transactions  had increased  significantly. 
It was helping customers save time. NatWest apologised for the poor experiences Ms W had 
suffered. And it arranged  for a gift hamper to be sent to her address.
Ms W wasnt satisfied  with NatWests response. So she contacted our service and our 
adjudicator looked into the matter. She provided  some information to Ms W about NatWests 
procedures for assisting customers. But she explained she couldnt tell the bank how to run 
its business  that was the role of its regulator,  the Financial Conduct Authority. So the level 
of staffing and playing  music wasnt something she could  look at.
She could  see Ms W had complained about  having  to wait in long queues.  But she felt it was 
to be expected at busy  times. And she couldnt ask NatWest to do anything more about  this. 
She explained she wasnt able to look at certain  aspects of Ms Ws complaint. They were 
outside of our services  jurisdiction. So she wouldnt  be asking NatWest to do anything more.
Ms W didnt  agree. She felt the bank had no provision for customers with disabilities that 
werent immediately  apparent. So shes asked  for an ombudsmans final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our adjudicator has explained we are governed by rules about what  we can and cant  look 
into. So Ive concentrated on the areas of Ms Ws complain Im able to consider. I 
understand this must be very frustrating for Ms W. There are a number of things she is 
unhappy about. But Im only able to look at some of the problems Ms W has experienced.
Ref: DRN10040192As our adjudicator has explained  we cant tell NatWest, or any bank, how to run its business. 
And we cant interfere in the commercial decisions it makes on how its business  operates. 
The role of this service is to see if NatWest  has made any mistakes. And if it has what  it 
needs to do to put things  right. So Ive looked very carefully at everything Ms W and 
NatWest have said.
I can see how upsetting  this has been  for Ms W. She finds visits to her branch very difficult. 
And she uses other services whenever she can. The queues are often  very long and Ms W 
feels the branches are understaffed at times.  And not every customer can afford the 
equipment to access telephone or online banking.
NatWest said its working  to make its branches  more accessible for everyone.  And it tries to 
make reasonable adjustments to meet customer needs. NatWest  has produced guidelines 
for its staff when helping  customers  in vulnerable  situations. Ive seen a copy  of the banks 
procedures. But these  are internal  notes so unfortunately I cant  provide a copy  to Ms W. 
NatWest said other  information is available on its website.
I can see Ms W recently visited  her branch. And although the staff werent  unfriendly  she 
says they seemed unaware of the guidelines for helping vulnerable customers.  As the visit 
took place after Ms W raised  her complaint NatWest hasnt had the opportunity  to respond.  
So I cant comment on her most recent  experiences. 
But its clear Ms Ws previous visits are at odds with the level of service NatWest  is hoping to 
deliver to all of its customers.  Ms W has highlighted  the growing awareness of hidden  
disabilities. Other  organisations have started to make adjustments  to help people who might  
not always immediately  appear to need assistance.  And I hope this is something NatWest, 
and indeed other banks, will look at as part of its efforts  to improve the customer experience.
Im sure NatWest didnt mean to cause upset  when it responded to Ms Ws concerns. It feels 
theres been a breakdown in the relationship between Ms W and the bank. Customers 
whove used their bank for many years are sometimes finding the changes in services  and 
procedures unhelpful.  And I do sympathise with Ms Ws situation.  I hope she is able to 
restore an amicable relationship with NatWest.
But businesses have  to make commercial decisions about how they respond  to changing 
environments. Although I cant ask NatWest  to alter how it deals with customers  in branch 
Im sure the bank looks at every complaint it receives to see if it can improve things.
I know Ms W will be disappointed with this outcome. But based on everything Ive seen I 
cant really say NatWest has made  any mistakes. And I think the gift hamper was a 
reasonable response to the difficulties  Ms W experienced.  So I wont be asking NatWest to 
do anything more.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 September  2019.
