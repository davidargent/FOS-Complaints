The complaint
Miss S complains that CarCashPoint Limited (CarCashPoint) lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
In September 2021 Miss S took out a fixed sum loan with CarCashPoint for £1,060. The 
loan was repayable by way of 36 monthly payments of £135. The total amount payable 
under the agreement was £4,876.20. 
Miss S started getting into difficulty with meeting the repayments in May 2022. 
Miss S says the loan was made irresponsibly as she wasnt working at the time and the 
loan was unaffordable. 
CarCashPoint didnt agree. It said it had reviewed her income and expenditure when 
she made the application and had checked her credit file. And based on that the loan 
was affordable.
Our adjudicator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. He thought CarCashPoint 
didnt act unfairly or unreasonably by approving the finance agreement. 
But Miss S didnt agree and so the complaint has been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
CarCashPoint will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we 
consider when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. So, 
I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about our 
approach to these complaints is set out on our website. 
Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my comments on what I think is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on 
board and think about it but because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach 
what I think is the right outcome.
Before granting the finance, I think CarCashPoint gathered a reasonable amount of evidence 
and information from Miss S about her ability to repay. I say having noted the credit check it 
carried out. This showed that Miss S had a county court judgment in place. When she was 
asked about it, Miss S told CarCashPoint that she was in the process of disputing this and 
explained why. Ive also seen that Miss S had a default registered against her in 
August 2019 which is more than two years before CarCashPoint granted her the loan. 
CarCashPoint also had sight of bank statements. However, just because I think it carried out 
proportionate checks, it doesnt automatically mean it made a fair lending decision. So, Ive 
thought about what the evidence and information showed. 
Ive reviewed the information and evidence CarCashPoint gathered, as well as the 
information Miss S provided at the time she made her application for the loan. Having done 
so Im satisfied that the checks that were completed showed that the agreement was likely to 
be affordable to Miss S. I say this having noted that Miss S had told CarCashPoint that she 
was on maternity leave at the time and in receipt of state benefits of £1,500 per month. From 
what Ive seen the average level of benefits was higher than that. CarCashPoint, having 
checked her bank statements, took note of the level of benefits she was receiving prior to 
making her application and also her regular living expenses. Based on that and also her 
credit check, it calculated that Miss S had enough disposable income, meaning it looked 
very likely she could afford the monthly repayment. 
I therefore agree with our adjudicator that, having reviewed this information and taking into 
account Miss Ss level of income, her daily outgoings and the committed expenditure shown 
in the credit reports Ive seen, the loan was likely to have been affordable as she had 
sufficient disposable income to meet the monthly repayments. For these reasons, I dont 
think CarCashPoint acted unfairly when approving the finance application.
Ive seen that Miss S told our adjudicator that she would be struggling to meet her payments 
this year. Its not clear if she has since contacted CarCashPoint about this. But I would urge 
that CarCashPoint continues to exercise forbearance and takes all steps to explore available 
options with Miss G.
So whilst I realise this wont be the outcome Miss S was hoping for, I consider Ive seen 
enough evidence or information to show that this logbook loan has been made 
irresponsibly. I therefore dont think CarCashPoint needs to take any further action.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 March 2023.
