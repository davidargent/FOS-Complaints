The complaint
Mr D complains about what happened when he approached National Westminster Bank Plc 
for help in starting a holiday let business.
What happened
Mr D said that he wanted to start renting out what was then his home. He wanted to offer 
short term holiday lets there. He had bought the property with a mortgage from NatWest, so 
he asked NatWest for help. 
Mr D said that his experiences had been quite shocking, he said that NatWest didnt help 
and it wasnt taking him seriously. So much so that he had now given up this idea. Mr D said 
NatWest didnt understand what he wanted to do, and it never bothered to reply to enquiries 
he sent. 
Mr D said what he was proposing wasnt even slightly radical or risky. And NatWests 
repeated refusals to help had really knocked the stuffing out of him. 
NatWest sent Mr D a letter apologising for the problems hed experienced in opening a 
business account. It said it hadnt been proactive. It then referred him to its website for 
advice on starting a business, and said he make contact with its business growth enabler, 
through his local branch. But when Mr D complained to our service, NatWest said that it had 
just accepted what Mr D had told it about poor service. It didnt actually have any evidence of 
this, and Mr D hadnt yet opened a business account. 
Our investigator asked Mr D to tell us more about what had gone wrong, and to send us 
emails as examples of the poor service hed received. Mr D replied to say that he needed 
NatWest to give decent and factual information and proper mortgage advice. He said hed 
given up on his dream now, and just wanted to move house to be closer to work and family. 
He said that NatWest mortgages continued to fail to support him. 
Mr D said he needed to be appropriately compensated for the huge level of stress and 
anxiety, misinformation and conflicting information and the behaviour he had experienced 
and was still experiencing.
Mr D sent us correspondence hed had with NatWest. That included a letter NatWest wrote 
to him in 2019, saying that the person Mr D had been speaking to couldnt offer him a 
commercial mortgage, and signposting him to a different team. He sent us a letter 
responding to his complaint that he couldnt log in to his My Rewards profile, NatWest said it 
held a different email address for him, and told him how to change this. He sent us a more 
recent letter, dated April 2022, responding to Mr Ds complaint about the amount NatWest 
would lend him on a new property. 
Mr D also sent us an email exchange between himself and NatWest from early 2022, 
following the complaint response letter he originally asked us to look at. That exchange says 
Mr D has discussed his business proposal with NatWest, and hes very unhappy with the 
advice hes been given. Mr D said at first NatWests staff seemed to think that his business 
idea would be quite simple to organise, but then he was told this would be extremely difficult, 
and he would need a solicitor and an accountant. Mr D said that what he was doing wasnt 
radical, and the whole thing had been a total debacle. 
Mr D said his property was now under offer and he still couldnt get a straight answer as to 
whether he could carry his existing mortgage across to a new home, or any tangible help. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said NatWest had accepted 
that it provided poor service when Mr D was trying to open a business account, so what he 
had to do was see if the payment NatWest had made provided a fair and reasonable 
outcome to that complaint. Our investigator said that there was little in NatWests response 
to Mr D that detailed specific failures, but NatWest had accepted it let Mr D down. It sought 
to direct Mr D to help it could offer.
Our investigator listed the further correspondence that Mr D had sent us, and said that he 
couldnt see any wrongdoing by NatWest related to Mr Ds complaint. He said that our 
service couldnt usually look at events which were covered by complaint response letters 
sent more than six months before the complaint was brought to us, and the more recent 
issue of Mr Ds mortgage porting to a new property was a separate issue again. 
So our investigator said that the only thing he could see to support that NatWest had 
provided Mr D with poor service was its acceptance of this in its letter to him. On that basis, 
he said he couldnt say that the NatWests offer of £150 was unfairly low. 
Mr D said that NatWest had continued to give him breathtakingly inaccurate advice about 
holiday lets. And he wanted us to look into his complaint about the more recent issues with 
his upcoming move too. He said things with NatWest werent resolved, and he thought wed 
been dismissive, and were overlooking poor ethical practices by NatWest. 
Because no agreement was reached, this case was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
Although Mr D has sent us other correspondence since, the complaint that Mr D first asked 
us to look into was a lack of support from NatWest in turning his existing home into a holiday 
let business. Thats what Im considering here. 
Mr D has a residential mortgage with NatWest, or in other words, a mortgage for someone 
who lives in the property they have mortgaged. I understand that hes still in the early stages 
of this mortgage. An early redemption charge is payable if this mortgage is redeemed before 
August 2023, and I would anticipate that Mr D would have needed to change his mortgage 
type before he could let out the property hes currently living in. 
Most buy to let mortgages are not suitable for what Mr D wants to do, which is to offer his 
property for short term holiday lets. There are relatively few lenders who currently offer 
mortgages for this. I understand that NatWest isnt currently offering mortgages for buy to let 
properties which are going to be used as short term holiday lets, so it may not have been 
able to support Mr D with his business. If NatWest doesnt wish to offer this type of 
mortgage, it doesnt have to.Mr Ds complaint was that he wasnt offered help and support when he wanted to start a 
business. NatWest has said it hasnt got any evidence that it failed to support Mr D, but it 
accepted his version of events, that hed had a frustrating experience trying to find the 
people who could help him. And it paid him £150 for that, as well as signposting him to the 
support it could offer. I think that does provide a fair and reasonable outcome to this part of 
Mr Ds complaint. 
I understand that what NatWest has said since makes Mr D think its failing to support him, 
and making things unnecessarily complicated. But NatWest isnt primarily responsible for 
providing Mr D with business advice. And if the business he wants to start isnt one that 
NatWest is prepared to lend to, then the advice and support it can offer may be quite limited. 
Mr D says things arent resolved, because he now wants to move to a new property, and 
NatWest has said it wont lend Mr D more money to do so. I understand that Mr D considers 
these are all examples of the overarching poor service he feels he has received from 
NatWest. But NatWests decision not to lend Mr D more for a new residential property is 
much more recent, and I do think that this is a separate complaint to the one Mr D brought to 
our service in February of this year. So I wont address that here. I can see that Mr D has 
received a final response to his complaint on this issue, and he can ask our service to look 
into this separately if he would like. 
I know that Mr D will be disappointed, but I dont think the complaint he brought to us in 
February 2022, about NatWests failure to support his business idea, should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 August 2022.
