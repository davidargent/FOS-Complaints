K820x#14complaint
Miss J complains  that Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) was 
irresponsible to lend to her.
background
Miss J had five loans from Sunny between September 2017 and January 2018 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Due Max Repayment Repaid
1 25 Sep 2017 £100 6m 29 Mar 2018 £33.33 13 Dec 2017
2 2 Oct 2017 £100 6m 29 Mar 2018 *£66.22 13 Dec 2017
3 20 Nov 2017 £400 6m 31 May 2018 *£181.62 13 Dec 2017
4 5 Jan 2018 £250 6m 29 Jun 2018 £80.00 10 Apr 2018
5 15 Jan 2018 £100 6m 29 Jun 2018 *£110.30 10 Apr 2018
* Highest  repayment  due on all outstanding loans
Miss J says her pattern of borrowing should  have  prompted Sunny to do better checks. She 
says it would have  found the repayments  meant her expenditure exceeded her income.  She 
adds she was already  making repayments to other  loans and debt collection companies and 
her credit file wouldve shown a County  Court Judgement and multiple defaults. Miss J says 
she had to take out other loans to repay  Sunny and made repayments with her credit card.
Sunny says it carried out credit and affordability checks  and considered  it was responsible  to 
approve the loans.  It says it took into account  the adverse information on Miss Js credit file 
and, therefore,  offered  a small amount of credit relative to her income.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. She was satisfied that 
Sunny carried out enough  checks on the first two loans, but considered  it should  have  done  
better checks for the remaining loans. However, she found  that, had it done so, Sunny was 
still likely  to have found the loans to be affordable  to Miss J.
Miss J says she had to borrow money from family  members to avoid serious financial issues, 
so would like her complaint reviewed.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Sunny was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make sure Miss J 
could afford  to repay the loans before it lent to her. Those  checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Miss J was borrowing, and her lending history.  
But there was no set list of checks Sunny had to do.
Loans 1 and 2
When Miss J applied  for her first loan from Sunny, she told it her income was £1,489 and her 
monthly expenditure was up to £600. Sunny  says it acknowledged the adverse information 
on Miss Js credit file and approved a maximum of a £200 loan. Miss J originally  drew  down 
£100 of it, but, a week later, she borrowed the remaining £100. Based on the information it 
had, I cant conclude Sunny was wrong to approve  loans 1 or 2.

Loans 1 and 2 were  still outstanding when Miss J applied  for loan 3. Because of this, and 
because the loan requested was significantly higher than before, I consider a proportionate 
check should have  included asking Miss J whether she had any other  outstanding  loans. I 
cant see Sunny did this, so Ive looked at Miss Js bank statements to see what shes likely 
to have said.
At the time of loan 3, Miss J said her disposable income was around £960.  I can see she 
also had one outstanding short-term loan at the time, for which she needed to make  a 
monthly repayment of about £45. So Im satisfied  its likely Sunny would still have found loan 
3 to be affordable  if it had carried out further  checks.
Miss J had no other outstanding short-term loans when she applied for loan 4. Her self-
declared disposable income was now around £890 so, again,  I cant conclude  Sunny should 
have found loan 4 unaffordable.
Loan 5
When Miss J applied  for loan 5, the previous loan was still outstanding and this was her fifth 
loan in less than four months. Given that she was now declaring  her disposable income to 
be over £1,000, I consider this should have indicated to Sunny that this may not be a true 
reflection of her financial circumstances.  So I think  Sunny should have done a full review of 
her finances,  including verifying  the information  Miss J had declared.
Ive had a look at Miss Js bank  statements  from the time and Im satisfied that her income 
was in line with the £1,489 shed told Sunny. However her outgoings  were  significantly 
different to the £400 shed  declared.  Miss J was paying £350 for rent and bills and another 
£207 on direct debits, including those to debt management companies,  streaming  services,  
gym membership and life insurance. In addition to this she spent  about  £140 on mobile 
phone costs and a further £100 on credit card repayments. Taking Miss Js highest estimate 
for spend on food and travel adds a further £200  to her monthly expenditure bringing it to 
about £1,000. I can see Miss J repaid  £50 to a short-term loan company in early February, 
but that still left her with enough  disposable income to make  the £110  Sunny repayment that 
was due on loans  4 and 5.
So, I find that, even  with better checks,  its likely Sunny would still have  found  loan 5 to be 
affordable to Miss J.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 April 2019.
