K821x#15complaint
Mr D has complained Virgin Money plc wont refund money he paid for some  work to be 
completed to his home. Hes made a claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit  Act 
1974.
background
Mr D engaged a company  to build an extension involving  refurbishment  of the ground floor, 
and to build  a new loft to his house.  Ill call this supplier, C. Two sets of paperwork were 
provided to Mr D for the two separate contracts. These are both dated 27 October  2017.
The cost for the loft conversion was £25,028.  The price for the ground  floor extension and 
works was £29.470.  Mr D was confident both contracts were for less than £30,000. He paid 
for two deposits of £500 with his Virgin credit card to ensure he had protection under section 
75 of the Consumer Credit Act.
Mr D also made two online payments of £6,867  and £8,037 for the remainder of the deposits 
due on 11 November 2017.
C went into administration and no work was done  at all. Mr D went  to Virgin  for help in 
getting his money  back. His claim under section 75 was rejected by Virgin.  They  initially  
believed there  was only one contract  which exceeded £60,000. They  accepted Mr Ds 
evidence showing there were two contracts. However they still believed  one contract  
exceeded £30,000 as they felt the invoice  showed the price including VAT to be £33,859 
(which was not a figure quoted on the paperwork).  
Virgin arranged for Mr Ds credit  card payments to be repaid under  the chargeback scheme 
and offered him £6,870  for the deposit he paid for the contract under £30,000. This was 
repaid to Mr D.
Mr D brought his complaint to the ombudsman service. Our investigator reviewed the 
evidence. Initially she believed this complaint  fell under section 75a which  allowed for 
transactions over £30,000 to be covered. Virgin reminded us section 75a didnt apply where 
a credit card was used  as in Mr Ds complaint.  Subsequently she asked  Virgin to consider 
paying half of the deposit Mr D paid.  
Virgin didnt agree with this outcome.  They asked an ombudsman  to consider Mr Ds 
complaint.
I completed a provisional decision on 10 September 2020. I explained  why I was upholding 
Mr Ds complaint as I felt there was enough  evidence to show  VAT had been included in the 
original amount. Virgin had also made an error  in repaying the wrong  deposit  Mr D had 
originally repaid.
Mr D accepted these  findings but asked me to reconsider whether £250 compensation was 
sufficient. He also noted hed ended up paying £2,100 he wouldnt needed to have paid out 
for professional assistance if hed not been wrongly  advised by C.
Virgin also accepted  the outcome.
I now have all I need to complete  my final decision.
Ref: DRN14556402my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as I did in my provisional  decision. Ill explain why.
Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974  allows a customer to submit a claim for breach 
of contract  or misrepresentation by a supplier to their credit provider. This applies when 
customers use certain types of credit  to buy goods  or services.  In this case Mr D has used 
his Virgin  credit card to pay for part of the works he was hoping  to have done to his home. 
Specific terms apply to section 75. One of these states:
so far as the claim relates to any single item to which the supplier has attached a cash  price 
not exceeding £100 or more than £30,000.
Its worth  clarifying Im not deciding Virgins liability under section 75 of the Consumer Credit 
Act. We certainly  consider the relevant  law and that includes  section  75. But we decide 
cases by considering what is fair and reasonable, as statute requires us to do. What Im 
deciding is whether Virgin did enough  in considering  Mr Ds complaint. And if they didnt, 
what else should they now do.
If there was a misrepresentation or breach of contract in the supply of the goods then its fair 
to ask Virgin to put things  right. 
So firstly Ive considered  whether the contract to supply a new extension and refurbish the 
ground floor was priced at more than £30,000.
To help me decide this, Ive reviewed  the paperwork Mr D has given us along  with evidence 
provided by Virgin.  These all agree the total is £29,470. On a separate  line VAT is priced at 
£4,389. But Im satisfied  this doesnt  mean the price was £29,470  plus £4,389.
I say this for three reasons:
A bit of mathematics shows  20% of £29,470 doesnt work  out as £4,389  but 
considerably more (approaching £6,000);
Mr D paid a deposit of 25% as quoted on the paperwork dated 27 October 2017. 
25% of £29,470  is £7,367 which is what Mr D paid in two payments (£500 and 
£6,867). There is nothing  to suggest Mr D was being requested to pay 25% of 
£33,859 which Id have expected if £33,859 was the total price; and
Ive reviewed a number of other cases involving C and this is how they quote their 
price. I agree  this can be slightly misleading  but knowing what  I do of C, I suspect 
that may be deliberate.
Virgin has further noted that they believe C was charging 15% VAT on the amounts rather  
than 20%.  I appreciate  them  clarifying  this.
Ive seen Virgin paid Mr D a deposit back.  Unfortunately I believe this was for the wrong 
contract. Mr Ds agreement to have  a new loft built involved a deposit  of £8,537 so Virgins 
payment of £7,367 (£500  and £6,867) was £1,200 short. I believe this was a genuine 
mistake. A copy of Mr Ds bank statement showing two online payments and the paperwork 
Ref: DRN14556403as two different  pieces  of work  confirm which deposits apply to which  pieces of work.  Virgin  
doesnt dispute this.
I note Mr D accepted  the repayment for one project in full and final settlement. I have 
considered whether its fair and reasonable hes held to this despite an error being made by 
Virgin. I dont think this should be the case as Virgin has made  an error. I believe they would 
have paid the £8,037  due if theyd been aware of what had happened.
To avoid  any doubt, I also believe there were two distinct projects although I can see Virgin  
has already accepted this principle.  
Therefore Im satisfied  as each set of works  falls under  the £30,000 limit; Mr D should  
receive the protection offered by section  75. For the avoidance of doubt, Id just clarify as its 
clear C has gone into administration and no works were undertaken, there has been a 
breach of contract.
Ive considered Mr Ds request that Virgin also refund him costs he paid for a professional 
party wall agreement.  I note he feels this could have been  done informally. This is certainly  
possible but having an extension built can be tricky and when Mr D comes to sell his 
property, a formal  agreement is likely to stand him in good stead. So I dont believe this cost 
could be considered as an inconsequential  loss under section 75.
I think its fair to ask Virgin to refund the money Mr D paid to C. Hes had £7,367  and £500  
repaid. Ill be asking Virgin to repay a further £8,037.  Ill be adding  8% simple interest a year 
to this from the time it was made. I believe this was 11 November 2017.
Im afraid this resolution  involved a bit of simple  mathematics or common  sense so it 
appears to me Virgin had plenty of opportunity to get this right some time ago. Mr D said all 
along that the £29,470 included VAT. I can see they paid Mr D £150  after accepting  there  
were indeed two different  contacts. For the problems caused I think its fair and reasonable 
they pay Mr D a further £250.
Ive considered Mr Ds request that Virgin was trying  to avoid paying what  was due and 
therefore this added to his distress  and delay for nearly three  years. In fact Mr D will have 
been paid £400 in compensation (taking  into account the earlier £150 payment) so I think  
this is fair and reasonable overall.
Ref: DRN14556404my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is to instruct  Virgin Money plc to do the 
following to put things right:
Refund £8,037 for the payment Mr D made;
Add 8% simple interest a year to this from 11 November 2017 until the date of 
settlement; and
Pay Mr D £250 for the trouble caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 November  2020.
