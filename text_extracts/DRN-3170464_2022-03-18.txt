The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that NewDay Ltd wouldnt explain to him why a transaction hed attempted 
to make on his credit account had been flagged for a security check.
What happened
Mr S tried to make a transaction on his NewDay account. The attempted transaction was 
flagged by NewDays financial security system, which stopped the transaction from 
completing until NewDay could verify the legitimacy and authenticity of the transaction.
NewDay sent a message to Mr S advising that his transaction had been declined and that a 
security hold had been placed on his account. Mr S wanted to know why this had happened 
and what it was specifically about the attempted transaction that had caused it to be flagged. 
NewDay advised Mr S that they werent able to provide this information to him. Mr S wasnt 
happy about this, so he raised a complaint.
NewDay looked at Mr Ss complaint. They explained that it remained their position that the 
transaction hadnt been flagged in error but as the result of a genuine concern. NewDay also 
confirmed that they werent able to disclose the specific reason that the transaction had been 
declined.
Mr S wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also felt that NewDay werent 
obliged to provide the reason the transaction had been flagged by their security system as 
Mr S would like, and so they also didnt uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Mr S remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how it must have been frustrating for Mr S to have had his attempted 
transaction declined by NewDay on the basis of a perceived security issue, and to also then 
be told by NewDay that they were unwilling to explain to him the reason his attempted 
transaction had flagged NewDays security system as it had.
However, it wouldnt be expected that NewDay would provide the information to Mr S that he 
would like here. The reason for this is because if NewDay did disclose to its customers how 
its security system operated and what specific events or parameters might be flagged by that 
security system, the potential would then exist for customers to act on that information and to 
deliberately circumnavigate NewDays security system  which in turn would compromise 
the effectiveness of that security system.
NewDay have an obligation to have reasonable measures in place to protect their 
customers money, and security systems such as the type that NewDay employ arent 
uncommon in the credit provision industry. And I havent seen anything in the information 
available to me to suggest that the flagging of the transaction by NewDays security system 
wasnt fair and reasonable in regard to how such systems operate in this instance.
For these reasons, while I understand that Mr S might want to know why his transaction was 
flagged by NewDays security system, I wouldnt expect NewDay to provide this information 
to Mr S, or to any other NewDay customers or members of the public. 
While I appreciate that this might have entailed a degree of inconvenient for Mr S, its 
unfortunately the case that the reasonable employment of such security systems by credit 
providers such as NewDay can occasionally entail a degree of unavoidable but necessary 
inconvenience for account holders from time to time. And I dont feel that any form of 
compensation should be merited in instances, such as this one, where that degree of 
occasional necessary inconvenience has been incurred by a customer because of the wider 
obligation of that credit provider to have adequate security systems in place.
Finally, I also note that NewDay have been clear in their communications to Mr S of the 
steps he would need to take to have the security block removed from his account, and this 
consistency and clarity of communication in this regard is also what would be expected of 
NewDay in these circumstances. 
All of which means that Im satisfied that NewDay havent acted unfairly or unreasonably 
towards Mr S in how theyve managed this ongoing situation, and it follows from this that I 
wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NewDay to take any further action at this 
time.
I realise this might not be the outcome that Mr S wanted, but I trust that hell understand, 
given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 April 2022.
