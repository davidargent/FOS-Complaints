K820x#14complaint
Mr D complains that United National Bank  Limited  (UBL) delayed transferring his ISA from 
another ISA manager to UBL. 
Mr D wants compensation for the loss of interest  as a result  of the delay. He also wants 
compensation for the inefficient way that his complaint was dealt with by UBL.
background
On 19 April 2018, Mr D submitted an ISA transfer  form to UBL.  
UBL say that it is their practice to request funds from the ISA manager that the ISA is being 
transferred from on the same day as the completed  transfer form is received. UBL say that 
they sent a request by first class post. If there  is no response, UBL say that it is their practice  
is to send a further  request via recorded delivery. They  say they did this on 3 May 2018.  
UBL say that they received a cheque for the funds from the ISA manager on 11 May 2018.  
The letter enclosing it was dated 9 May 2018. Because the cheque  was received after 3pm,  
UBL say that they didnt process it that day. They  processed it on 15 May 2018 and it 
cleared on 17 May 2018. 
Mr Ds ISA with UBL started on 17 May 2018. 
On 31 May 2018, Mr D complained that the transfer had taken longer than the 15 working  
days that UBL say it will take. He wanted compensation. He contacted them again on 20 
June 2018 as he had heard nothing from them. 
UBL wrote a final response letter on 10 July 2018. They said that they had had to wait for the 
funds to open Mr Ds ISA. They were received on 15 May 2018 and the ISA opened on 17 
May 2018. They said this was within 15 days. 
A further  final response letter  was send by UBL on 3 September 2018.  UBL again said that 
they had chased up the previous  ISA manager for funds and these had only been received 
on 15 May 2018 which resulted in the ISA being opened for Mr D on 17 May 2018. They  said 
that they had opened  the ISA within  15 working days of receiving the funds. 
They gave Mr D £50 as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience caused  in handling his 
original complaint. 
Mr D wasnt happy with this outcome and so he came to us. 
Our investigator found that UBL had acted fairly in the time that it took to open the ISA. She 
also found that they had acted reasonably in offering Mr D £50. 
Mr D wasnt happy with this outcome so the complaint  has now come  to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN30736072Im afraid that Mr D wont  be happy with my decision. I think  that UBL did open the ISA for 
Mr D in good time. Also, I think that the compensation of £50 already given is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances. I will explain why. 
UBL have acknowledged that the whole process  of opening the ISA shouldve taken 15 
working days. They say that this 15 days runs from receiving the transfer form to opening  the 
ISA. The transfer  form was received on 19 April 2018 and the ISA was opened on 17 May 
2018. This amounted to 19 working  days for the process to be completed  clearly  longer 
than the 15 days  aimed  for. But, I dont think that the process took excessively longer than it 
shouldve. 
Also, I dont think that UBL were entirely responsible for the delay.  I accept that UBL sent a 
request for funds  on 19 April 2018  and a further  request on 3 May 2018 when they still 
hadnt received  a response. Their first letter mightve  got lost, but I cant  hold UBL 
responsible for this. 
When UBL eventually got the cheque on 11 May 2018, I accept  that it was received after the 
cut off of 3pm so they couldnt process  it that day. But, I think  that they shouldve  processed 
it on the next working day which  was 14 May 2018. Instead, they waited until 15 May 2018. I 
think that this is the only delay  that I can hold them responsible for. 
UBL say that they also failed to handle the original complaint in a timely manner. I agree. 
They didnt respond to Mr Ds complaint  when  they shouldve. Also,  I can see that there were 
errors in the letters that they did eventually send.  For example, they say that the cheque was 
received on 15 May 2018 when it was received on 11 May 2018. 
Mr D wants compensation for the loss of interest  on his account.  I can see why as the 
process to open  his account did take four working  days longer than expected. In fact, as the 
process shouldve  taken until 11 May 2018,  Mr D lost seven days  interest. 
But, as I have said, I dont  think that the delay was entirely UBLs fault. 
Regardless of this, I think that the compensation offered of £50 is reasonable. UBL has said 
that the daily rate of interest  on Mr Ds account is £0.48. So, seven days interest would be 
£3.36. I think that the compensation offered  is fair and reasonable for both the interest and 
the way in which the original complaint was handled. 
I know that this isnt the outcome that Mr D hoped for, but I hope  that I have explained my 
reasons for this decision.  
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I dont require  United National  Bank  Limited to do anything 
else. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 June  2019.
