The complaint
Mr W ran a business as a sole trader. Hes unhappy National Westminster Bank Plc have
closed down his business account.
What happened
In August 2019, NatWest wrote to Mr W letting him know they intended to close his business 
account and gave 60 days notice. Mr W is unhappy as he has been a long-standing 
customer with NatWest and doesnt think hes being treated fairly. Mr W also says he didnt 
receive the closure letter and only became aware of the account closure when he called 
Natwest. Mr W is also unhappy NatWest wont tell him why theyve closed his business 
account.
Mr W adds he paid to have an overdraft facility on the account. But now NatWest have
chosen to close his account, he says hes not been able to have full use of this facility. Mr W
is concerned this is going to affect his credit file and doesnt think its fair to pay the
outstanding overdraft amount.
Mr W also complains he was promised call backs from NatWest but that he didnt receive
them  and that the service in branch isnt as he expects.
NatWest say they made a commercial decision to end the relationship with Mr W and that
they take into consideration a number of factors when making this decision, including their
own risk appetite. And although Mr W wishes to know why NatWest closed his business
account, they say theyre not required to tell him this. NatWest also apologised for the poor
service Mr W received from an advisor who was abrupt.
Our investigator looked into this complaint. In summary, he said Natwest had closed Mr Ws
business account in line with its terms and conditions, so they didnt act unfairly or
unreasonably. Our investigator also said that NatWest are able to ask Mr W to repay any
outstanding overdraft amount and that hed had use of the overdraft facility. Mr W disagreed
and said it was unfair for NatWest to close his account. So the case has been passed to
me.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint setting out the following:
Closure of the business account
I can appreciate Mr Ws frustration and concern when he was told that NatWest would be
closing his business account. Especially as he says he was a long-standing customer with
NatWest.On occasion, a bank will decide they no longer want to do business with a consumer, as
NatWest did in this case. NatWest have sent me the terms and conditions from around the
time Mr Ws business account was closed and I can see this says the bank can close an
account, provided they give 60 days notice.
NatWest have sent us a copy of the letter they sent to Mr W informing him of the account
closure in August 2019. I can see the letter explains the 60 days notice and that Mr W was
required to repay any funds owed to the bank at the end of the 60 days. It also says unless
satisfactory repayment is received, his account may be reported to credit reference
agencies. So Im satisfied NatWest made clear to Mr W what would happen if satisfactory
payment wasnt received. I understand NatWest passed Mr Ws business account to their
collections team in November 2019.
I appreciate Mr W says he never received the 60 days letter from NatWest. But I can see
that the letter was sent to the address Mr W gave to NatWest to correspond with him about
this account. And I can also see from NatWests internal system notes that the letter was
sent. Why Mr W didnt receive it I cant say. But as Im satisfied NatWest complied with their
obligations by sending the letter, I cant reasonably say theyve done anything wrong.
NatWests terms and conditions say they can end a relationship with a customer as long as
they give 60 days notice. So whilst I can understand Mr Ws upset at finding out his account
was going to be closed, the accounts terms and conditions dont state that a reason has to
be provided. It follows that I dont think NatWest have done anything wrong in not providing
Mr W with a reason as to why theyve chosen to close down his business account.
I understand Mr W paid Â£150 for an overdraft service from December 2018. As Mr W has
had use of the overdraft, I dont think NatWest need to refund him this fee.
The service provided to Mr W by NatWest
Mr W has told us that when he goes in to his local NatWest branch, hes often having to wait
a while to be seen and that the bank machines arent always working. I can understand why
having to wait a long time would be frustrating for Mr W. But this is NatWests commercial
decision on how many people they may employ in branches, and actions required to fix
branch facilities, so this isnt something I can comment on.
Mr W says he was promised call backs from NatWest but that he never received them. Mr W 
also says he called NatWest every week in July 2019 and August 2019, but that NatWest
refused to discuss anything with him. I cant see a record of all of the calls Mr W says he
made, but NatWest say their systems show a request for a call back in August 2019 that
didnt happen. Theyve explained this wasn't done because Mr W had already been told they 
wouldn't share why they were closing down his account, so they didnt think the call would 
be productive.
Ultimately, based on what I've seen I don't think call backs would have been productive. It's
clear Mr W was extremely unhappy with NatWest and their actions - in one phone call I've
listened to, Mr W raised his voice and used expletives. Whats clear to me, is that the
relationship had broken down. So, while I think it would have been better customer servicefor NatWest to tell Mr W they wouldn't be calling him back, rather than promising him a call
back, I don't award Mr W any compensation for this.
Mr W also says that the accounts' terms and conditions say he should receive a call back
within 24 hours, but that this didnt happen. I cant see this in the terms and conditions, but
even if I did, I still wouldnt award Mr W compensation for the reasons Ive explained above.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest didnt respond to my provisional decision. But Mr W did and I note he doesnt 
accept my provisional decision.
I appreciate Mr W remains unhappy with my decision and feels strongly about how NatWest 
have treated him. However, I havent seen further evidence which persuades me to change 
or alter my decision. So its for this reason my provisional decision remains unchanged.
My final decision
My final decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 July 2020.
