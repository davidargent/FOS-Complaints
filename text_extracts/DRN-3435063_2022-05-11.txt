The complaint
Mr D complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire agreement with Lex 
Autolease Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint last month in which I described what had 
happened as follows:
A new car was supplied to Mr D under a hire agreement with Lex Autolease that he 
electronically signed in March 2021. He had some issues with the car and Lex 
Autolease accepted his request to reject the car in July 2021 and offered to return his 
initial payment of £6,014.84, to credit his two outstanding rentals and to pay him 
£200 for the inconvenience caused.
Mr D didnt accept its offer and complained to this service. He says that he would like 
to reject the car for a full refund of the deposit and the monthly payments and to be 
compensated for loss of enjoyment, fuel costs and time off work to travel to the 
dealer for the multiple breakdowns. Lex Autolease says that its offer to accept his 
rejection of the car is no longer available.
Our investigator recommended that his complaint should be upheld. She didnt think 
that the car was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr D and that he 
should be able to reject the car. She recommended that Lex Autolease should: end 
the agreement and collect the car; refund, on a pro-rata basis, the advance payment 
for spread rentals with interest; refund 15% of his rentals to cover any loss of use, or 
impaired use, of the car because of the inherent quality issues, with interest; pay 
£200 for any distress or inconvenience thats been caused; and, on receipt of the 
monthly payments owed, remove any adverse information from Mr Ds credit file.
Mr D says that Lex Autolease credited the June and July 2021 rentals to him but has 
since removed them and misled him  he says that hes made a separate complaint 
about that and that it has confirmed that it had agreed to credit them. He says that his 
financial status has been impacted so his credit file should be corrected. He says that 
the June and July 2021 invoices should be credited as Lex Autolease didnt provide 
him with a hire car and his deposit should be refunded. He also says that his monthly 
rentals should be refunded and that he should be charged for use of the car at a 
maximum of 45p per mile.
Lex Autolease says that the car was collected from Mr D in March 2022 so the 
agreement has been closed down but the mileage recorded at collection was 5,073 
and the pro rata mileage allowance was 4,167 so theres an excess mileage charge 
of £228.31 for the difference of 906 miles, but no charges have been raised in 
relation to the condition of the car. It says that Mr D owes rental payments for June 
and July 2021 and also October 2021 to March 2022 and that the total amount owed 
by him, including for the excess mileage is £4,906.55. It says that Mr D has already 
received a cheque payment for the £200 it had offered to him.
I set out my provisional findings in that provisional decision which were that Mr Ds complaint 
should be partially upheld for these reasons:
Lex Autolease, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr D - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the 
age and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr D was a new car for which he agreed to pay an 
initial rental of £6,014.84 and then 47 monthly rentals of £668.32 and I consider 
that it was reasonable for him to expect that it would be free from even minor 
defects;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components 
within the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly 
how long that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the roadside assistance reports show that Mr D required assistance with a 
suspension warning light in June 2021 and the software was updated and that he 
had issues with the cars air conditioning three times in June and July and the air 
conditioning pipes were replaced in July 2021 under the cars warranty;
there were also issues with the cars Bluetooth and aux system (which required 
an update to be released), the boot and the audio system and Mr D says that the 
car was scratched when it was delivered to him;
Mr D complained to Lex Autolease about those issues and it accepted his 
request to reject the car in July 2021 and offered to return his initial payment of 
£6,014.84, to credit his two outstanding rentals and to pay him £200 for the 
inconvenience caused;
Mr D didnt accept that offer and complained to his service - he says that he 
would like to reject the car for a full refund of the deposit and the monthly 
payments and to be compensated for loss of enjoyment, fuel costs and time off 
work to travel to the dealer for the multiple breakdowns;
I dont consider that it was reasonable to expect a new car to have so many 
issues within the first five months after it was supplied to Mr D and I consider that 
Lex Autoleases decision to accept his rejection of the car was fair and 
reasonable at that time  and I consider it to be more likely than not that the car 
wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr D;
the car was collected from Mr D in March 2022 and, although he says that he 
hasnt used it since December 2021 because he has another car, I consider that 
its fair and reasonable for him to pay the monthly rentals due under the 
agreement for the period that he had the car (less the deduction described 
below);
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Lex Autolease to refund to Mr D the 
initial rental that he paid for the car, on a pro-rata basis spread across the four 
year term of the agreement, for the time that he hasnt had the car- and that it 
should also pay interest on that amount  Im not persuaded that it would be fair 
or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to refund the full amount 
of the initial rental to Mr D;
the issues with the car will have affected Mr Ds use and enjoyment of it and I 
agree with our investigator that it would be fair and reasonable for Lex Autolease to refund to him 15% of his monthly rentals as compensation for that loss of use 
and enjoyment;
Lex Autolease offered to credit two monthly rentals to Mr D in July 2021 but he 
didnt accept the offer that it made at that time and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that Lex Autolease has acted incorrectly in connection 
with the June and July 2021 rentals  it has provided evidence to show that those 
rentals remain outstanding on Mr Ds account and that he also hasnt made any 
payments to the account since the September 2021 rental  Im not persuaded 
that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Lex Autolease to refund to 
Mr D the monthly rentals for June and July 2021 and I find that it would be fair 
and reasonable for the arrears on his account to be deducted from any payments 
due to him from Lex Autolease;
these events will have caused some distress and inconvenience for Mr D  Lex 
Autolease offered to pay him £200 compensation for that distress and 
inconvenience in July 2021 and it says that it has sent him a cheque for £200;
the agreement included an annual mileage allowance of 5,000 miles  but Lex 
Autolease says that when the car was collected from Mr D in March 2021 its 
mileage was 5,073 which exceeded the mileage allowance on a pro-rata basis of 
4,167 miles by 906 miles so theres an excess mileage charge of £228.31  I 
consider that its fair and reasonable for Mr D to pay for that excess mileage;
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Lex 
Autolease to refund to Mr D the full amount of his initial rental, more than 15% of 
his monthly rentals for his loss of use and enjoyment of the car or to pay him any 
other compensation for his fuel costs and time off work to travel to the dealer for 
the multiple breakdowns  nor am I persuaded that it would be more appropriate 
for him to pay for his use of the car at a rate of a maximum of 45p per mile;
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Lex 
Autolease to refund part of the initial rental to Mr D as described above and 15% 
of the monthly rentals as compensation for his loss of use and enjoyment of the 
call (all with interest) - but I find that it should deduct from that refund the 
outstanding rentals due from Mr D and the excess mileage charge of £228.31;
if Mr D hasnt cashed the cheque for £200 that it sent to him, I consider that it 
should cancel that cheque and add £200 to the payment to be made to Mr D as 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused;
I consider that Lex Autolease should provide Mr D with a detailed explanation of 
its calculation of each of these amounts; and
I find that Lex Autolease should also remove any information about the hire 
agreement that its recorded on Mr Ds credit file. 
Lex Autolease has accepted my provisional decision but Mr D says that he will not pay for 
having a faulty and unsafe to drive car. He says that Lex Autolease is aware of all of his calls 
and complaints including that the collection date was delayed by the excess mileage charge 
which he said that it needed to remove as the excess mileage was due to faults with the car 
and that it had confirmed that the invoices would be credited as he had been chasing for the 
car to be collected since December 2021. He says that hes ordered another car from Lex 
Autolease which has the same issues so its knowingly leasing faulty and unsafe cars and 
should be investigated for that.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not persuaded that I should change the findings that I set out in my 
provisional decision. I consider that those findings are a fair and reasonable outcome to 
Mr Ds complaint. 
This complaint relates to the car that was supplied to Mr D under the hire agreement in 
March 2021. If Mr D wants to complain about another car that its supplied to him, he should 
first complain to Lex Autolease (if he hasnt already done so) and then, if hes not satisfied 
with its response, he may be able to make a separate complaint to this service. 
We offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by customers 
about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances. We have no regulatory or disciplinary role over those businesses and arent 
able to investigate the way that any one of them conducts its business.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Lex Autolease to take 
the actions described in my provisional decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ds complaint in part and order Lex Autolease Limited to:
1. Refund to Mr D the amount calculated on the basis described in my provisional 
decision (which is set out above).
2. Remove any information about the hire agreement that its recorded on Mr D's credit 
file.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Lex Autolease to deduct tax from the interest payment to 
be made to Mr D. Lex Autolease must give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its 
deducted if he asks it for one.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 June 2022.
