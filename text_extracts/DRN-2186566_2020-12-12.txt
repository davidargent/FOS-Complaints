The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt refund his chargeback claims 
correctly. And the bank provided poor service. Hed like compensation for the inconvenience 
caused. 
What happened
Mr S has a bank account and a credit card with NatWest. 
On the 25 November 2019 Mr S contacted NatWest to dispute three payments made from 
his credit card to an online retailer, Ill call A. NatWest agreed to raise a chargeback for the 
three payments totalling £101.80. NatWest made arrangements to temporarily refund the 
payments on the 26 November to Mr Ss account. 
Unfortunately this didnt resolve the issue. And the payments were redebited from Mr Ss 
credit card on the 13 January 2020. Mr S contacted NatWest again to complain and the 
payments were temporarily refunded on the 21 January 2020 and then permanently credited 
to his credit card account on the 28 January 2020.
 
Mr S is also unhappy that the same retailer, A, took payments from his debit card without his 
authorisation. These were refunded by NatWest on the 21 January 2020 which was later 
than Mr S expected. 
Mr S complained to NatWest. He said the redebiting of the payments had caused him 
financial difficulty and hed asked NatWest to block payments to A so they shouldnt have 
gone through.  He was also worried that NatWests actions had negatively impacted his 
credit file.
 
NatWest partly upheld his complaint. The bank explained that all the disputes had now been 
refunded to Mr S, but they could have been clearer with Mr S that hed need to complete a 
chargeback form in case A defended the request. And they cant prevent payments from 
particular retailers without the retailers agreement, although they have tried to block this and 
cancelled both his cards. They paid Mr S £30 in compensation for the inconvenience 
caused. 
Mr S wasnt happy with NatWests response so complained to our service.
 
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ss complaint. Our investigator concluded that all the 
payments had been refunded to Mr S, but it was clear the service Mr S received could have 
been better, and they thought NatWest should increase their compensation by £50. 
NatWest accepted our investigators opinion, but Mr S didnt. In summary he said:
Hed spent over 40 hours on the phone to NatWest trying to resolve these issues  
and he should be paid more than £50 just because of this. 
Theyd never updated him regarding what was happening with the chargeback. 
They didnt prevent payments to A. 
He was embarrassed because he couldnt pay a taxi fare when NatWest failed to 
provide him access to his money.
Hes in danger of losing his home because of NatWests actions. 
As Mr S didnt accept our investigators view, its been referred to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive reached the same conclusion as our investigator for broadly the same 
reasons. 
Mr S accepts that hes been refunded for the disputed transactions to A on both his credit 
and debit cards. So Im left with considering the overall service Mr S has received from 
NatWest in relation to this issue. Im aware that Mr S has other open complaints with our 
service against NatWest so Id like to explain that Im only looking at NatWests service on 
this issue  and not his other complaints. 
NatWest accept that the service they provided could have been improved, and I agree with 
them here. I think NatWest could have been clearer when explaining to Mr S the process in 
relation to both his chargebacks for his credit and debit card. This led to Mr S having to 
phone NatWest on a number of occasions to explain his money hadnt been refunded or had 
been redebited from his account. I accept that this was frustrating and concerning for Mr S. 
But although it took longer than Id expect, overall Im satisfied that NatWest did follow their 
procedures and eventually refunded Mr S for both his credit and debit card.
 
Mr S has raised a number of other points about the service NatWest provided that hes 
unhappy about. These include the banks failure to prevent further payments to A. NatWest 
have explained that theyre unable to block payments to a particular retailer, and Ive not 
seen anything to refute this, so Im satisfied theres nothing further they could have done 
here. Mr S has also explained that NatWest caused him embarrassment by blocking his 
debit card and failing to provide him access to his money. The bank have explained they 
cant find any evidence that Mr Ss card was blocked, therefore I cant say theyve done 
anything wrong here.
When responding to our investigators view Mr S said hed spent over 40 hours on the phone 
to NatWest, and therefore he should get a higher level of compensation. Ive not seen 
evidence that in resolving these chargebacks Mr S has spent such a large amount of time on 
the phone. Our investigator recommended that Mr S should receive additional compensation 
of £50 on top of the £30 hes already been paid, therefore totalling £80. As Ive already 
explained Im satisfied that Mr S suffered inconvenience because of NatWests actions and 
looking at our trouble and upset awards Im satisfied that a total of £80 is fair compensation. 
My final decision
My final decision is I direct National Westminster Bank Plc to:
- Pay Mr S £50 in compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2021.
