The complaint
Mrs C complains that NewDay Limited (NewDay) failed to correctly process a Section 75 
claim relating to a payment made on her credit card . 
What happened
Mrs C has a credit card account with NewDay and requested they carry out a refund request 
on her behalf  as she was in dispute with a garage concerning repairs carried out on her car. 
Mrs C says that despite two requests NewDay failed to act on her request which caused 
extra costs, stress and upset given how long it was taking to resolve. Mrs C asked that 
NewDay write off her credit card account balance and close her account. 
NewDay admit  they did make mistakes but have apologised to  Mrs C and paid 
compensation, reversed interest charges and late payment fees which totalled over £146. 
NewDay says they required further information regarding Mrs Cs Section 75 claim before 
they could begin the process, but this hasnt been provided by her.  
Mrs C wasnt happy with NewDays response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the available information and upheld Mrs Cs complaint and 
asked NewDay to write off the outstanding balance on Mrs Cs credit card account and close 
the account. NewDay agreed to this and initially so did Mrs C. Mrs C subsequently told the 
investigator that because NewDay continued to ask for payments and hadnt closed the 
account, this was causing her further stress and asked for the case to be referred to an 
ombudsman .
NewDay says they accept the investigators view but have been unable to close the account 
as a further payment has been made by Mrs C into the account and they need her bank 
details to send the residual balance. 
Mrs C still wished the matter referred to an Ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision. 
I can see that Mrs C requested on two occasions for NewDay to carry out a claim under 
what is known as a Section 75 claim. To explain - Section 75 is part of the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974 (CCA). It allows, in limited circumstances, someone buying goods and/or services 
on credit to claim against -their credit provider over the actions of a third-party supplier. In 
this case Mrs Cs claim was against a garage who she felt had incorrectly charged her for 
repairs to her car.  
What happened here was Mrs C requested a refund from NewDay in February 2019 and 
when this wasnt actioned contacted them again in April 2019. On both occasions NewDay 
failed to carry out the claim on her behalf. In January 2020 Mrs C complained to NewDay 
and they responded requesting further information so they could progress the Section 75 
claim. NewDay says that Mrs C never provided the information they requested from her. 
Its worth noting that NewDay have accepted they made mistakes here and have apologised 
to Mrs C and paid £100 by way of compensation and also refunded interest and late 
payment fees totalling £46.75. 
Mrs C says the amount of compensation didnt recognise the fact she was struggling to 
make the payments to her credit card and was suffering from health problems, which must 
have been a worry to Mrs C. The investigator upheld Mrs Cs complaint and instructed 
NewDay to write off the balance of Mrs Cs credit card account and close the account. At 
that point I can see that both NewDay and Mrs C accepted the outcome. Mrs C has since 
come back to the investigator and says because NewDay havent carried out the 
investigators instructions and have requested further payments to her credit card she would 
like the case to be looked at again by an ombudsman. NewDay says the only reason the 
account hasnt been closed, as they have already written off the balance, is because Mrs C 
made a small payment into her credit card account and they require her bank details to 
refund these monies. 
My role is to look at the complaint Mrs C brought against NewDay and decide what has been 
offered to resolve this is fair. It doesnt extend to looking at how NewDay has tried to settle 
the complaint at the point Mrs C accepted it  thats something Mrs C needs to agree with 
NewDay.
I am satisfied that the outcome view of the investigator was fair and reasonable and from the 
information I have seen all that is needed to conclude this case is for Mrs C to provide 
NewDay with her bank details so a small residual balance can be paid to her  - I cant see 
that NewDay are being unreasonable in asking for this given this is the outcome Mrs C was 
looking for in her complaint to this service. 
While Mrs C will be disappointed with my decision, it follows that I wont be asking anymore 
of NewDay, beyond our original view for Mrs Cs credit card account to be written off and 
closed. If Mrs C wishes for the account be closed, she should contact NewDay so this can 
be arranged. 
Putting things right
I instruct NewDay to write off the outstanding balance on Mrs Cs credit card account and 
arrange for this to be closed.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint . 
I instruct NewDay Limited to write off the outstanding balance on Mrs Cs credit card account 
and arrange for the account to be closed. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 October 2020.
