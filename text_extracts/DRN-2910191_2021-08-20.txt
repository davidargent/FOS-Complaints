The complaint
Mr M complains that Interactive Investor Services Limited (II) provided him with incorrect 
information on a corporate action that affected an investment that he held. Mr M says that he 
suffered a financial loss based on this information.
What happened
Mr M held shares in a company that I will call Company A. On 29 July 2020, Company A 
announced a corporate action on the shares held by Mr M and this resulted in a share split. 
The effect of the share split was that for every share held, holders would receive an 
additional 0.5 shares.
The ex-entitlement date for the share split was 31 July 2020 which meant clients would need 
to hold the shares at this date in order to receive the share split. The pay date for the share 
split was 4 August 2020 which is when the new shares would be issued.
Mr M called II twice on 31 July 2020 to enquire about his shares in Company A. The first call 
was made at 14.46 and Mr M was looking for clarity over his book costs and the agent 
provided information on how this could be changed manually. Mr M also mentioned on this 
call that he knew investors in the United States were able to deal on their new share 
amounts following the stock split.
On this call, II said that if Mr M were to sell his shares then he would not receive the share 
split. This information was incorrect.
Mr M called later that day at 16.45 to discuss the share split and again asked about selling 
his shares and how investors in the United States were able to do this. Mr M stated on this 
call that they were able to sell the amount they were due to receive in the share split before 
4 August 2020 pay date. II said on the call that they werent sure how this was possible but 
would check with the relevant department.
Mr Ms holding in Company A was updated 4 August 2020 and his holding increased to 
2,750 shares. Mr M sold 1,100 shares in Company A on 18 August 2020 at a price of 
$4.201036.
Mr M complained to II saying that he had suffered a loss. Mr M said that he had received a 
quote showing a price of $11 per share on 31 July 2020.
II investigated the complaint and said that Mr M had received incorrect advice when he had 
initially called on 31 July 2020. The upheld this part of the complaint but didnt agree that Mr 
M had suffered the loss he said. They said that at the time of the call, the shares were 
trading between $6.99 and $7.00.
II said that as they could not evidence that Mr M would have traded at this time, they looked 
at the average closing price of Company A in the week of the call. They calculated the 
average to be $5.40 resulting in a loss of $3,078.86 which equating to a sterling figure of 
£2.434.70. II also offered Mr M £100 as a gesture of goodwill for the incorrect information 
that was provided.
Unhappy with IIs final response, Mr M referred his complaint to the service and one of our 
investigators investigated the complaint.
The investigator initially found in favour of Mr M as II did not provide any evidence on the 
complaint. After the investigator issued her view, II responded with more information.
The investigator reviewed this information and didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint. The 
investigator thought that II had acted fairly in attempting to resolve Mr Ms complaint.
Unhappy with the investigators view, Mr M has asked for an ombudsman to look at the 
complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to disappoint Mr M but I agree with the outcome reached by the investigator and I 
will not be upholding the complaint. 
When the service looks at a complaint it will see what has happened and if the business is 
found to be at fault, it will ask them to put the consumer back into the position they should 
have been in had the error not taken place.
II accept that Mr M was provided with incorrect information following his call on 31 July 2020. 
In order to resolve Mr Ms complaint, they have suggested a price based on an average 
closing price for the week of the call. Mr M says that he received a quote to sell at $11.
Ive listened to the calls made by Mr M on 31 July 2020 and I think that there is evidence to 
suggest that Mr M was looking for information on his shares with an intention to sell. What I 
need to establish is whether the amount suggested by II is fair and reasonable.
In their submission to the service, II has said that at the time Mr M called, shares in 
Company A were trading between $6.99 and $7.00. Mr M says that he received a quote of 
$11.
I have looked at the data supplied by II for prices on 31 July 2020. I note the following:
When Mr M finished his first call with II at around 15.09, I can see executed deals in 
Company A going through between $8.86 and $9.35
At around 15.21, I can see executed deals reaching $11
These executed deals were in sizes not unlike the number of shares that Mr M held at 
the time (1,100 shares). 
At 15.22, a trade for 1,100 shares was executed at a price of $11.08
In the investigators view, she felt that Mr M made the first call with an intention to sell but II 
provided incorrect information, so Mr M didnt proceed with selling. Having listened to this 
call, I agree with this view.
In IIs letter to Mr M dated 27 August 2020, they say that they had reviewed the international 
order book and have been unable to find any trades executed above $7.20. They said that the majority of trades completed over $7.00 were done outside of market hours and they 
dont trade outside of market hours.
I disagree with this assessment. The data that I have seen shows executed trades in excess 
of this price. I am basing this on the timestamps as being GMT.
II have admitted that Mr M was provided with incorrect information and have used an 
average of closing prices over the week that Mr M called. They calculated this average to be 
$5.40 per share but when they were assessing compensation to Mr M, II appear to have 
used a figure of $7.00 which they say was the price at the time of the call. 
II have calculated the loss to Mr M to be the difference in price that he received when he 
sold his shares and the price that was available at the time of his call on 31 July 2020.
Having reviewed the data sent by II, I think that Mr M could have achieved a price of around 
$11 per share but I recognise that when Mr M sold his shares on 18 August 2020, they 
would have been priced differently following the share split.
In their submission to the service, II have covered off this scenario. They say:
If we accept the hypothetical price of $11 to be achievable during the call on 31st July 2020, 
when he wanted to sell 100% of his shares, this would equate to $12,100.
We would then have to accept the hypothetical trade of 18th August 2020 where he should 
have sold 100% of his holding at $4.21, this would equate to $11,577.5. 
A hypothetical loss of $522.5. 
II have offered Mr M compensation of £2,434.70. Having looked at the information available 
to me, I am satisfied that II have acted in a fair and reasonable manner when trying to put Mr 
M back into the position he should have been had the error not occurred. Im not going to 
ask them to do anything else.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 September 2021.
