K821x#15complaint
Mr J says CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid irresponsibly  lent to him. He also 
complains about  how QuickQuid handled  the account after he informed it that he couldnt  
afford to make  the monthly repayments. He feels he was unduly pressured when this 
happened. 
background
I issued my provisional decision saying that Mr Js complaint should  be upheld  in part. A 
copy of the background to the complaint  and my provisional findings are attached and form 
part of this final decision. 
QuickQuid, and Mr J, confirmed that they had received my provisional decision. And no one 
had anything to add after theyd seen it.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
QuickQuid and Mr J didnt  raise  any new points after receiving my provisional decision. So 
Ive reached the same  conclusions I reached  before, for the same  reasons.
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
refund  all the interest and charges Mr J paid on his loans from 10 July 2014 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
pay Mr J £150 compensation
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid   
must give Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Js complaint. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 August 2019.

Ref: DRN72073302extract from my provisional  decision
This complaint is about  a running  credit account (known as a flex credit) that QuickQuid provided to 
Mr J on 11 December  2013.  This loan had a credit limit of £350.  The credit agreement shows that it 
was planned to be repaid  over 10 months and the highest repayment shown was just over £100. The 
agreement ended in July 2014. Mr J had problems  repaying this loan towards the end of it. 
Our adjudicator looked  at what Mr J and QuickQuid said. She thought Mr Js complaint should be 
partially upheld. She thought  that it had made proportionate checks  before lending. So she thought  
that QuickQuids decision  to lend was reasonable. 
But she also thought  that QuickQuid shouldnt  have continued to apply interest to Mr Js account 
when it was aware he was struggling to repay the loan and it had set up a repayment plan. She said 
QuickQuid should repay the last interest charge it added, plus interest,  because  of this. 
QuickQuid agreed with this. It made an offer of £21.85 to settle the complaint. 
Mr J didnt accept this offer.  He said it shouldve  been clear that he couldnt  afford  the loan from the 
start. And he again said that the QuickQuids actions when he was having financial problems were  
threatening and prevented  him from repaying the loan in full in a reasonable time.  
So as no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to 
decide. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr J could repay  the loans in 
a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of different things, such  as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
was QuickQuid right  to approve  the loan to Mr J
The running  credit was set up to run for just under a year. And whilst  the repayments werent 
scheduled to be a high proportion  of Mr Js recorded income of £900, it was a commitment for a 
reasonably long time. So I think that it wouldve been proportionate to find out about Mr Js normal 
monthly living costs  and regular  financial  commitments. In order to make sure Mr J was in position  to 
make the repayments sustainably over this length of time.
I dont think QuickQuid  did this. As far as I can see it only looked at Mr Js income  and some 
information from a credit reference agency. So I need to think about  what  QuickQuid wouldve  seen if 
it had carried out proportionate checks.  
Mr J has provided some information about his financial  circumstances and this includes his bank 
statements. I accept that this isnt exactly what QuickQuid wouldve seen at the time.  But I think  it 
wouldve found out similar information if it had made proportionate checks, so I think its reasonable 
to rely on it.
But having looked at these for the time just before the loan I havent seen anything that leads me to 
think that QuickQuid  wouldve seen any further information that shows it was likely that Mr J couldnt  
sustainably repay this loan. So I think the lending  decision was reasonable.   
Ref: DRN72073303So Im not planning to uphold  Mr Js complaint about QuickQuid irresponsibly approving this loan. 
did QuickQuid act correctly when  Mr J informed it about his financial problems towards the 
end of the loan
Mr J had problems making the loan repayments.  I can see a late fee was added on 11 June 2014. I 
can also see that that the email QuickQuid sent to Mr J at this time said that no fees or interest are 
accruing on these default  sums. 
QuickQuid then sent Mr J a number of notice of overdue payment emails.  And on 26 June 2014 it 
sent an email to Mr J about the payment arrangement  it, and Mr J, had agreed to going  forward. 
But at the same  time, Mr J also asked for information  about his outstanding  balance  so he could 
potentially repay the loan in full. This wasnt provided  straight away.  Mr J asked for this information a 
number of times and each  time he received what seems to be standard holding response alongside  
notices of overdue payments. 
On the 10 July and 18 July 2014 QuickQuid  added interest to Mr Js account which totalled £90.80.  
From what I can see the information  Mr J requested about his outstanding balance was provided on 
17 July 2014 and Mr J repaid the loan shortly afterwards. 
QuickQuid was required to treat Mr J positively and sympathetically when it knew he was having  
financial difficulties. And when he informed it that he was having repayment problems QuickQuid 
shouldve stopped adding interest to his loan and it seems to have told him that he had done this. So 
I think  QuickQuid shouldnt have added the last two interest  charges  to his account,  the ones I have 
referred to above. And Im planning to require  QuickQuid to refund these to Mr J.
I also think  QuickQuid shouldve provided the information Mr J asked for about  his loan balance.  It 
seems to have made  no reference to this request  for around three weeks.  Given  that it knew that Mr 
J was struggling I think it couldve done more to help him and I think this is likely to have caused him 
some trouble and upset.  I think £150 is a reasonable amount  of compensation for this.
