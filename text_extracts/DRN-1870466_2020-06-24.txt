The complaint
Mr F complains about time limits for crediting money to his current account with National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest).
What happened
In September 2019, Mr F was charged an unpaid item transaction fee by NatWest. Mr F 
accepts that this charge was applied correctly. 
But Mr F thinks its confusing that NatWest uses two different cut off times when reminding 
customers to credit their accounts. He thinks the bank should be consistent and use only the 
later of the two cut off times. 
NatWest explained that it had two different times to cover different scenarios. The cut off 
time of 2:30pm is for items that might not be paid because of a lack of funds. It said this was 
earlier in the day because the bank needs additional time to make decisions about these 
items. The cut off time of 3:30pm is for accounts that are in, or are going into, an unarranged 
overdraft. These measures are designed to help people avoid going further overdrawn and 
incurring more charges. It didnt agree it had done anything wrong, but refunded Mr Fs 
recent unpaid item charge as a gesture of goodwill. 
Mr F referred his complaint to our service and one of our Investigators considered it. He 
said, in summary, he didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly by using two different times. 
Mr F wasnt happy with the Investigators view. He said, although it was kind of NatWest to 
allow an extra hour in some circumstances, he still thought it was confusing for customers 
and that NatWest should adopt the 3:30pm deadline for everything. 
As Mr F didnt agree, the complaints been passed to me. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same overall conclusion as the Investigator. Ill explain 
why. 
Generally, it's for NatWest to decide how its accounts operate and this would include what 
time it requires customers to credit funds in order to avoid charges and exceeding limits. 
This service wont normally interfere with a business legitimate exercise of its commercial 
judgement.
DRN-1870466NatWest have explained why two different cut off times are used. I find that explanation 
reasonable and the decision to use two different times is a matter for NatWest. So I dont 
think its done anything wrong in applying those times to Mr Fs account.  
Mr F thinks its confusing for NatWest to have two different cut off times. But NatWest send a 
text message to customers setting out what time their payment must be made in order to 
avoid the item going unpaid or entering an unarranged overdraft. Mr F has sent us 
screenshots of these text messages which Ive considered. Having done so, I find its clear 
enough for Mr F to have known from those which of the time limits applied on each occasion. 
Mr F incurred an unpaid transaction fee around the time of his complaint, which he says he 
accepts as being fair because his credit paid in after the cut off time. And in any event, 
NatWest refunded that charge as a gesture of goodwill. So although he says its confusing, 
Mr F seems to understand the circumstances in which charges will be applied and the use of 
two cut off times hasnt disadvantaged him. 
Ultimately, it's up to NatWest to decide what cut off times it wants to use, although it should 
still treat customers fairly. As Im satisfied that the messages Mr F received about these 
were clear enough, I find NatWest has treated Mr F fairly.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2020.
