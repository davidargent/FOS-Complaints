The complaint
Mr H complains that Vacation Finance Limited, trading as VFL Finance Solutions, wont 
refund to him the money that he paid for some holiday club membership credits. Hes being 
represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr H had bought holiday products from a holiday club at least four times between November 
2009 and August 2014. He then bought 30,000 holiday club membership credits from the 
holiday company in July 2019. The membership price was £41,910, Mr H paid a deposit of 
£1,388 and he entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Vacation Finance for a loan of 
£40,522. He agreed to make 120 monthly payments of £526.57 to Vacation Finance.
Mr Hs representative made claims to Vacation Finance in January 2022 under sections 75 
and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the holiday company was in 
liquidation and couldnt provide the service sold so was in breach of contract. It also said that 
the membership credits were mis-sold to Mr H and, but for the misrepresentations made to 
him, he wouldnt have purchased them nor entered into the loan agreement. It also said that 
the terms of the agreement are so egregious as to be unfair, the payment of commission 
was hidden from view and the membership credits were marketed as an investment. It said 
that the membership credits were sold to Mr H under extreme sales pressure, a proper 
affordability check wasnt undertaken and Mr Hs relationship with Vacation Finance was 
unfair. 
Vacation Finance responded to those claims in detail and said that it hadnt seen or been 
presented with any evidence which would lead it to conclude that Mr H's product was mis-
sold or misrepresented to him at the time of purchase. It also said that it lent to him in a 
responsible manner and didnt uphold any of the claims. 
Mr H wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. His 
complaint form says that Vacation Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which 
wasnt declared to him; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of his 
ability to afford the loan; the holiday company unduly pressured him into entering into the 
purchase agreement and the loan agreement and used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure him; the product was misrepresented and the holiday company marketed and sold 
the product as an investment in breach of the Timeshare Regulations; the holiday company 
was in liquidation so was in breach of contract; and he wasnt provided with key information 
necessary for him to make an informed decision regarding the purchase; all rendering the 
loan agreement unfair under section 140A, and it said that the claim should also be 
considered under section 75.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Hs complaint should be upheld. She said that the 
purchase was for a single item with a cash price of £41,910 which wasnt within the limits for 
a claim under section 75 so section 75 didnt apply to this purchase. She said that she hadnt 
seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr H and Vacation Finance was unfair 
and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was 
unfair. She said that shed seen that no commission was paid to the holiday company by 
Vacation Finance in relation to this purchase and that she hadnt seen anything persuasive 
to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr H.
Mr Hs representative, on behalf of Mr H, says that Mr H doesnt accept our investigators 
recommendation and has requested that this matter be referred to an ombudsman for a 
decision. It has provided an addendum containing Mr Hs additional arguments which says, 
in summary and amongst other things, that: the product was sold to Mr H as an investment 
and he wouldnt have purchased the upgrades unless they were an investment; the holiday 
company represented to Mr H that trading-in his existing products for the membership 
credits was the only method of realising his investment on the 2014 and earlier purchases; 
the re-sale scheme would be open for members five years following the start of a 
membership but the holiday companys resale programme opened in 2015 and is now 
discontinued; the holiday company breached the Timeshare Regulations and 
misrepresented the membership credits as something that could be re-sold easily in the 
future; and, were it not for the representations, Mr H wouldnt have purchased the 
membership credits and traded-in his existing products.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Hs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr H says that hed bought holiday products from the holiday company in November 
2009, August 2012, August 2013 and August 2014 but Ive not been provided with 
any of the contractual documentation for those purchases and his complaint only 
relates to the purchase that he made in July 2019 and which he paid for, in part, 
using a loan provided by Vacation Finance;
Mr Hs representative says that Mr H traded-in those products in July 2019 for 30,000 
membership credits and he entered into a membership application agreement with 
the holiday company at that time for the purchase  the agreement shows that the 
membership price was £41,910 and that he paid a deposit of £1,388 but Ive not 
been provided with the terms and conditions that are referred to in that agreement or 
any of the other contractual documentation that its likely that Mr H would have also 
signed with the holiday company at that time;
Mr H also entered into a loan agreement with Vacation Finance in July 2019 for a 
loan of £40,522 and he agreed to make 120 monthly payments of £526.57 to 
Vacation Finance  and he also received pre-contract credit information about the 
loan from Vacation Finance;
Mr Hs representative made claims to Vacation Finance in January 2022 under 
sections 75 and 140A and a complaint was then made to this service  Mr H also 
provided a statement in support of his complaint;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
one of the criteria for a claim under section 75 is that section 75 doesnt apply to a 
claim that relates to any single item to which the supplier has attached a cash price 
not exceeding £100 or more than £30,000;our investigator said that the purchase price wasnt within the limits for a claim under 
section 75 as the membership application agreement shows that the membership 
price was £41,910 which would have exceeded the £30,000 limit  but the agreement 
also shows that Mr H was buying 30,000 membership credits so the cash price for 
each credit would be about £1.40 which would be less than the £100 limit  I dont 
consider that Mr Hs claim relates to a single item to which the holiday company has 
attached a cash price exceeding £100 but not more than £30,000 so I find that hes 
unable to make a claim under section 75;
although I cant make a finding in these circumstances on a breach of contract claim 
under section 75, I understand that the holiday company went into liquidation in May 
2020, but I also understand that a new management company has been appointed to 
provide the services in connection with the membership credits that Mr H had bought 
from the holiday company in July 2019 and that the membership credits are available 
for him to use;
Mr H says that there was an unfair relationship between him and Vacation Finance 
because it paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to him; 
the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the 
loan; the holiday company unduly pressured him into entering into the purchase 
agreement and the loan agreement and used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure him; the product was misrepresented and the holiday company marketed 
and sold the product as an investment in breach of the Timeshare Regulations; the 
holiday company is in liquidation so is in breach of contract; and he wasnt provided 
with key information necessary for him to make an informed decision regarding the 
purchase;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Hs claim under section 140A as only a court 
would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Vacation Finances 
response to that claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Vacation Finance says that it paid no commission to the holiday company and Ive 
not been provided with any evidence to show that it paid a commission to the holiday 
company in connection with Mr Hs loan;
Vacation Finance said in its January 2022 final response letter to Mr Hs 
representative that it followed its usual process and conducted an appropriate 
affordability assessment before the loan was made to Mr H and that he was up to 
date with all instalment payments which showed that affordability was clearly not an 
issue;
it hasnt provided any other information about the affordability assessment that it 
conducted but neither Mr H nor his representative has provided any evidence to 
show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr H when it was made to him in July 2019 
or that hes had any difficulty in making the monthly payments since then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for Mr H, that the loan was mis-sold to him or that Vacation Finance has 
acted incorrectly in connection with the loan;
Mr H says that hed bought holiday products from the holiday company in November 
2009, August 2012, August 2013 and August 2014 so I would expect him to have 
been prepared for the sales tactics that might be used by the holiday company before 
he went into the sales presentation in July 2019 and that, if he didnt want to buy the 
membership credits, he would have made that clear to the holiday company at that 
time;
Mr H had the right to withdraw from the membership application agreement and from 
the loan agreement within fourteen days without giving any reason but Ive seen no evidence to show that he contacted either the holiday company or Vacation Finance 
to withdraw from the membership application agreement or the loan agreement 
within the withdrawal periods;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr H was unduly 
pressured into buying the membership credits in July 2019 or entering into the loan 
agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptably aggressive commercial 
practices against him;
Mr Hs representatives January 2022 claim letter says that it was represented to 
Mr H by the holiday company before his July 2019 purchase that: his current product 
was unsellable as part of the re-sale scheme and that he was required to purchase 
the membership credits if he was to sell his product at a profit; the holiday company 
was ceasing to trade in timeshare apartments; the membership credits were 
available at a special price but only if purchased on that day; and the membership 
credits were marketed and sold to Mr H as an investment;
the claim letter says that those were false and misleading representations made to 
induce Mr H into entering into the membership application agreement but the letter 
doesnt include a detailed account of the circumstances in which the alleged 
misrepresentations were made, the conversations that took place or the information 
that was provided to Mr H before his July 2019 purchase;
Mr Hs complaint form says that the membership credits were misrepresented to him 
and he also provided a statement in support of his complaint in which he says: In 
July 2019 I purchased  30,000 [membership credits]  They didnt say that the 
[membership credits] would be easier to sell but I was told that the 30 000 
[membership credits] I had was the maximum you could ever get and it was worth 
£170 000 if I had bought these myself. I thought that after I used all of these 
[membership credits] I would be done with the membership, however I am now 
concerned that that is not the case. The maintenance fees have increased, this is 
something that I just had to accept. However, I do feel that for the amount of money I 
have spent with [the holiday company] over the years, I should have been treated as 
a more valued customer;
Mr Hs representative has provided an addendum containing Mr Hs additional 
arguments in response to our investigators recommendation which says that the 
product was sold to Mr H as an investment but neither Mr H nor his representative 
has provided a detailed account of the circumstances in which it was represented to 
Mr H that the membership credits were an investment, the conversations that took 
place, the information that was provided to Mr H before his July 2019 purchase or 
any documentary or other evidence to show that it was represented to him that the 
membership credits were an investment;
I understand that the membership credits can be used for accommodation and 
experiences and Mr H says: I thought that after I used all of these [membership 
credits] I would be done with the membership; Im not persuaded that its likely that 
the membership credits would properly be considered to be an investment and Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they were marketed or sold 
to Mr H as an investment; 
the addendum containing Mr Hs additional arguments says that the re-sale scheme 
would be open for members five years following the start of a membership but the 
resale programme opened in 2015 and is now discontinued  theres no reference in 
the documents that Mr H has provided from the time of sale to show that the holiday 
company had said that a resale scheme would be available after five years  and 
Mr Hs purchase was made in July 2019 so, on that basis, any such re-sale scheme wouldnt be available until July 2024  and Ive seen no evidence to show any steps 
that Mr H has taken to try to re-sell his membership credits;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
misrepresented the membership credits to Mr H in any other way, that they were mis-
sold to him or that he was induced into buying them by any such misrepresentations;
Mr Hs representative says that the terms of the agreement are so egregious as to be 
unfair  but it hasnt provided the terms and conditions or said which of the terms it 
considers to be unfair;
it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the terms in the 
agreements that Mr H entered into in July 2019 were unfair but I dont consider that 
the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is likely to mean that a 
court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship between a debtor and a 
creditor as the court would consider how the term operated in practice and whether 
the operation of that term caused the relationship to be unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr H and I consider it to 
be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the terms of the 
documents created an unfair relationship between Mr H and Vacation Finance;
Mr Hs representative has also referred to breaches by the holiday company of the 
Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 and 
the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008  and the addendum 
containing Mr Hs additional arguments says that the holiday company failed to 
provide the necessary information required by the regulations;
neither Mr H nor his representative has identified the information that it says was 
necessary for him to make an informed decision regarding the purchase but wasnt 
provided to him by the holiday company and I dont consider that theyve provided all 
of the documentation that would have been provided to Mr H at the time of the 
purchase;
Mr H says that hed made other purchases from the holiday company between 
November 2009 and August 2014 and I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect him to have been aware of the information that he needed before he made a 
decision to buy the membership credits in July 2019;
having considered all of the information and evidence that Mr H and his 
representative have provided, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that Mr Hs relationship with Vacation Finance was unfair and I dont consider it 
to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between 
Mr H and Vacation Finance in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr H for the issues that hes had with his credits but I consider that 
Vacation Finances response to his section 140A claim was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Vacation Finance to refund to Mr H any of the money that hes paid under the loan 
agreement, to cancel the loan, to pay him any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or reject my decision before 29 December 2023.
