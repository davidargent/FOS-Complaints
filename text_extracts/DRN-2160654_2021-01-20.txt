The complaint
Mr C complains that Tesco Personal Finance plc, trading as Tesco Bank, wont compensate 
him for the issues that he had with some accommodation.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr C used his Tesco Bank credit card in July 2019 to pay a total of £1,907.81 for four 
nights accommodation overseas that he was going to use the following month  he 
also paid a further £210.31;
there were some issues with the accommodation as there was a power failure on the 
first night which caused flooding and the air-conditioning didnt work for the 
remainder of his stay;
Mr C agreed a refund of about £400 with the accommodation provider which he 
clearly considered to be compensation for the first night of his stay  and when the 
issues continued he claimed further compensation of about £400 from the 
accommodation provider  he received a total of £400 so made a claim to Tesco 
Bank;
it made a chargeback claim for the £210.31 (which wasnt defended so that amount 
was credited to Mr Cs account) but it didnt consider his claim under section 75 of 
the Consumer Credit Act 1974 so it paid him £50 because of the poor service that 
hed received;
Mr C complained to this service and our investigator felt that there had been a breach 
of contract and that he should receive a further refund  she said that the £400 that 
Mr C received was a refund of the first nights accommodation cost and she thought 
that he should receive an additional refund of 20% of the cost of the remaining three 
nights accommodation - which she calculated to be £286.17;
Tesco Bank says that the compensation paid was intended to reflect the issues with 
the full stay, not a refund for one night, and it didnt think that the accommodation 
provider had been unreasonable in not refunding the full cost of the first night, as the 
accommodation that Mr C did receive had a value, regardless of the issues with it;
it explained its assessment of relevant accommodation values and said that it didnt 
agree that any further refund was due  but it accepted that the value of the 
accommodation was a subjective assessment;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Cs complaint about Tesco Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the accommodation 
provider and that Tesco Banks response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or 
reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Cs claim under section 75 
as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr C has provided details of his communications with the accommodation provider 
about the issues that he was experiencing and I consider it to be clear from those 
communications that he considered that he shouldnt be paying for the first night 
because of those issues and that he accepted a refund of about £400 on that basis;
the issues continued and the air conditioning didnt work for the rest of his stay  
which was during summer so its likely that it would have been very hot  so he 
claimed more compensation from the accommodation provider;
I consider that Mr C had booked accommodation which included air conditioning and 
the accommodation providers failure to provide air conditioning was a breach of 
contract which will have significantly impacted on Mr Cs use of the accommodation; 
and
Mr C has received about £400 from the accommodation provider, the chargeback of 
£210.31 and £50 compensation from Tesco Bank but I agree with the investigator 
that it would also be fair and reasonable for Tesco Bank to refund to him 20% of the 
cost of the remaining three nights accommodation as compensation for the breach of 
contract.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Tesco Bank to refund a 
further amount of £286.17 to Mr Cs account as compensation for the accommodation 
providers breach of contract  but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for 
me to require it to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Cs complaint and I order Tesco Personal Finance plc, 
trading as Tesco Bank, to refund a further amount of £286.17 to Mr Cs account.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 February 2021.
