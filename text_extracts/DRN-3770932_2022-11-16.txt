The complaint
Mr and Mrs C complain that GE Money Consumer Lending Limited has rejected the claims 
that theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in October 2022 in which I described what 
had happened as follows:
Mr and Mrs C entered into an acquisition agreement with a holiday company in 
November 2008 to buy some holiday club membership points. The purchase price 
was £15,407 and they traded in a trial membership which was given a trade-in value 
of £5,795 so the amount that they had to pay to the holiday company was £9,612. 
They also entered into a fixed some loan agreement with GE Money Consumer 
Lending for a total amount of credit of £12,532.20 which was the £9,612 and 
£2,920.20 to refinance their existing credit. They agreed to make 120 monthly 
payments of £233.61 to GE Money Consumer Lending. The loan was repaid in 2012.
Mr and Mrs Cs representative made a claim to GE Money Consumer Lending in 
October 2017 under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. GE Money Consumer 
Lending said that there were insufficient particulars of the misrepresentations, there 
was no debtor-creditor-supplier relationship and the claims were time-barred under 
the Limitation Act 1980. Mr and Mrs C werent satisfied with its response so a 
complaint was made to this service.
Our investigator said that Mr and Mrs Cs section 75 claim had been raised outside of 
the time period set out in the Limitation Act. He also said the evidence available 
didnt appear to support their section 140A claim that the relationship between Mr 
and Mrs C and GE Money Consumer Lending was unfair.
Mr and Mrs Cs representative has provided a detailed response to those 
recommendations in which it set out reasons that it considers that Mr and Mrs C have 
claims under sections 75 and 140A. It says, in summary and amongst other things, 
that it had supplied similar fact evidence showing that other customers had had 
similar experiences to Mr and Mrs C, that the membership was sold as an 
investment, there had been fraudulent misrepresentations by the holiday company 
and it referred to a judgment from an overseas court which commented adversely on 
the company structure of the holiday company.
I set out my provisional findings in that provisional decision and said: I agree with our 
investigator that this complaint shouldnt be upheld but for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr and Mrs Cs complaint is that GE Money Consumer Lending turned down their 
section 75 claim under the Limitation Act and I accept that they referred their 
complaint to our service within six years of that happening - but I need to consider 
whether the Limitation Act applies to that claim;
Im not determining the outcome of their section 75 claim in this decision as only a 
court would be able to do that, but Im considering whether or not GE Money 
Consumer Lendings response to their claim was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr and Mrs Cs claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented to 
them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them - 
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, GE Money Consumer Lending 
would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the 
time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr and Mrs C could have made a claim to the holiday company or GE 
Money Consumer Lending about the misrepresentations that they say induced them 
into buying the membership when they entered into the acquisition agreement in 
November 2008 as that was when they say that they entered into an agreement 
based on the misrepresentations of the holiday company and suffered a loss as they 
entered into the loan agreement with GE Money Consumer Lending;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the holiday company or GE Money 
Consumer Lending  but they didnt make a claim against GE Money Consumer 
Lending until October 2017, nearly nine years later which was outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that their section 75 claim is now time- 
barred;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that Mr and Ms C didnt become aware that they 
could make a claim to GE Money Consumer Lending until much later than November 
2008  but when they had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist them for the 
purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of 
that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the 
cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr 
and Mrs Cs claims;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr 
and Mrs C and GE Money Consumer Lending and section 140A gives a court the 
power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the 
debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship 
between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under section 140A is six years;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Cs section 140A claim in this 
decision as only a court would be able to do that, but Im considering whether or not 
GE Money Home Lendings response to the claims that had been made to it was fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Cs then representative sent a complaint letter in October 2017 which 
said that the representative was authorised to make a claim under section 75 and the 
letter described the section 75 claim - there was no reference in that letter to a claim 
under section 140A or to the relationship between Mr and Mrs C and GE Money 
Consumer Lending being unfair;
GE Money Consumer Lending responded to that section 75 claim in December 2017 
and there was no reference in its response to a claim under section 140A or an unfair 
relationship;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative sent a complaint form to this service which was dated 
in December 2017 (the day after the date of GE Money Consumer Lendings 
response) and what it called a position statement and was headed In the matter of 
a complaint under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974  that document 
referred to an unfair relationship and to section 140A  but no claim had been made 
to GE Money Consumer Lending that the relationship was unfair under section 140A;
our investigator considered whether the relationship was unfair but said that the 
evidence available didnt appear to support the claim that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr and Mrs C and GE Money Consumer Lending;
Mr and Mrs Cs current representative has made detailed additional points in 
response to our investigators recommendations, including about the unfairness of 
the relationship;
I dont consider that a claim under section 140A formed part of Mr and Mrs Cs claim 
to GE Money Consumer Lending so I find that I cant consider a complaint about its 
response to such a claim in this decision  if Mr and Mrs C want to make a claim to 
GE Money Consumer Lending under section 140A they should first complain to GE 
Money Consumer Lending about it and then, if theyre not satisfied with its response, 
they may be able to make a complaint to this service;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
I understand that Mr and Mrs Cs loan agreement ended in 2012 so they would have 
had six years from then to make a claim under section 140A so, although I make no 
finding on this point, it may be that any such claim is now time-barred under the 
Limitation Act; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs C for the issues that theyve had with their holiday club 
membership and the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require GE Money Consumer 
Lending to refund to them any of the money that they paid under the loan agreement, 
to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in response to their 
complaint.
Subject to any further representations by any of Mr and Mrs C, their representative or GE 
Money Consumer Lending, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend to uphold this 
complaint. GE Money Consumer Lending says that its provided this service with all relevant information but neither Mr and Mrs C nor their representative has made any further 
representations.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As none of Mr and Mrs C, their representative and GE Money Consumer Lending has made 
any further representations in response to my provisional decision, I see no reason to 
change the findings that I set out in that decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision before 14 December 2022.
