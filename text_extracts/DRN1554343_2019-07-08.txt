Late fee, default
* Maximum  monthly  repayment over the term of the loan
Mr R says he was reliant  on the lending and often gambled in an attempt to repay the loans. 
Mr R says he told QuickQuid he was in financial difficulties and offered a monthly repayment 
plan, but was told that wouldnt  be possible. He says the debt continued to increase and it 
was only a fortuitous  gambling win that enabled him to repay the money.
QuickQuid says it checked Mr Rs credit file and asked  about his income and expenditure. It 
says it found Mr Rs credit commitments from his credit file were significantly higher than the 
figure hed declared.  But it says it factored  that into its assessment and still found the loans 
were affordable. QuickQuid says it was satisfied that it wasnt irresponsible  to lend to him.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She said she hadnt seen 
enough evidence  to show that QuickQuid  shouldnt have provided the first three  loans, nor 
the initial loan 4 lending. But she considered proportionate checks  for the loan 4 top-ups  
would have shown  Mr R was having problems managing  his money as he had other 
outstanding short-term loans. She added that from loan 5 onwards,  Mr Rs pattern of 
borrowing itself suggested he was becoming  reliant on the loans and indicated the lending  
was becoming unsustainable. She recommended QuickQuid should refund interest and 
charges from the first top-up of loan 4 onwards (plus  8% statutory interest). She said it 
should also remove any negative information  from Mr Rs credit file about the loan 4 top-ups, 
and remove loans 5 and 6 from his credit  file entirely.
QuickQuid responded  to say, in summary, that it believed its checks  were proportionate and 
showed the loans were  responsibly lent. It added that Mr R did not incur  any late fees on 
loans 4 or 5 and both were repaid early.
Ref: DRN15543432my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has had loans (reflecting a risk that repeated  refinancing 
may signal  that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
Loans 1 and 2
Mr R told QuickQuid his monthly income was £2,600  and, from what  Ive seen  about  Mr Rs 
financial circumstances at the time, I cant conclude QuickQuid was wrong to approve  those 
loans. I say that because the repayments  were  a relatively small proportion of Mr Rs 
income, there was nothing to show he was in financial difficulty  and he repaid loan 1 on time.
Ref: DRN15543433Loan 3
There was a significant break in lending before Mr R applied for loan 3, but I can see Mr R 
declared his income  to be unchanged. Even  taking into account the additional credit 
commitments QuickQuid  found in Mr Rs credit file, I cant conclude this loan was 
unaffordable to him.
Loan 4 initial  lending
Based on the available information, Im satisfied  QuickQuid  did enough checks  to consider 
the original scheduled repayments  on loan 4 to be affordable.
Loan 4 top-ups 
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for the top-ups to loan 4 would  most  
likely have shown that Mr R:
oDid not have sufficient  disposable  income to afford the higher scheduled 
repayments;
oHad a number of other outstanding short-term loans;
oWas struggling to manage his money.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
5. I say this because:
From  loan 5 onwards  Mr R was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of settling a 
previous one. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr R 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Rs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid. Loan  6 was 
taken out over a year after loan 3. And it was for a larger amount. Mr R had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to QuickQuid over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr R lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and top-ups was likely to have had negative  implications 
on Mr Rs ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, as well as the loan 4 top-ups, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 5 and 6, and 
QuickQuid should  put things right.
Ref: DRN15543434my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) 
should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr R paid on the loan 4 top-ups and loans 5 and 
6;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about the loan 4 top-ups from Mr Rs credit file.
The number of loans  and top-ups taken from 5 onwards means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about loans 5 and 6 should  be 
removed from Mr Rs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 August 2019.
