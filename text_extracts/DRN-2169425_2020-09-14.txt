A statement of the last account from Oakam shows that Miss S repaid it and the loan 
account was closed on 20 September 2014. 
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that Loans 4 to 7 should be 
upheld. 
Miss S appeared to agree with this view and Oakam did not. It made several submissions all 
of which have been considered by me. The complaint remained unresolved and was passed 
to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about high cost credit - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. I fully appreciate that 
Oakam did not provide payday loans to Miss S. 
Oakam needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss S 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. 
 
But certain factors might point to the fact that Oakam should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include: 
where a customers income is particularly low; where the repayments are particularly high; 
and/or where the frequency of the loans and the length of time over which a customer has 
been given loans need to be looked at: repeated refinancing could signal that the borrowing 
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable.
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. Oakam was required to establish whether 
Miss S could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Office of Fair Trading Irresponsible Lending Guide (OFT ILG), applicable 
when Miss S loans were approved, defined sustainable as being the ability to repay without 
undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it 
follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss S complaint.
Miss S responded to the adjudicators view and knew that the complaint was being passed 
to an ombudsman. Miss S did not indicate that she disagreed with the adjudicators opinion 
and so on that basis I think that Loans 1 to 3 appear to be undisputed. So, I make no 
findings on those and have not reviewed them.
Similarly, Oakam has conceded in relation to Loans 5 to 7 inclusive. Oakams FRL to Miss S 
says: We also reviewed your loans taken on 30 May 2013, 17 October 2013 and 5 February 
2014. Upon this review, we do note that our usual affordability checks were carried out 
appropriately but were not processed within Oakams acceptable standards. As such, we 
would be able to uphold your complaint for these loans. The FRL went on to make Miss S a 
financial offer.
After the complaint was referred to this service, Oakams submissions to us include this: 
The loans taken on 30 May 2013, 17 October 2013 and 5 February 2014 have been upheld 
and Oakam had made an offer of £3696.34 to settle the claim. As we note this offer has 
been rejected, we would ask that all the loans be reviewed and Oakam can generate a new 
offer based on this review. In later submissions to us after it had received our adjudicators assessment, Oakam has 
altered its position radically by saying: Since reviewing your assessment, we have 
conducted a further analysis of the loans provided with a specific emphasis on the rules and 
guidelines applicable at the time the loans were provided. Based on this review, we do 
believe that loans 4  7 were provided in a responsible manner and in line with all the 
regulatory guidance at the time of each loan origination.
I appreciate Oakam has said it wishes all the loans to be reviewed but having read the final 
response letter and all Oakams submissions to this service then it seems to me that Loans 5 
to 7 are ones which require no further review. Oakams original conclusion was that these 
loans were not carried out to its acceptable standards. I find it unusual that a later review 
which it says focussed on and had a specific emphasis on the rules and guidelines 
applicable at the time (see Oakams submission set out earlier in this decision), led to its 
radical change in position for Loans 5 to 7. And I say this because, I would have expected 
that these rules and guidelines were adhered to when the loans were approved originally in 
2013 and 2014. And I would have expected that these rules and guidance underlaid 
Oakams decision to concede on these loans in the FRL sent to Miss S and when it was first 
sending submissions to us.  
The only reason Oakam has given to justify that it has altered its view about the approval of 
loans it had earlier conceded, is that it has carried out a review with specific emphasis on the 
rules and guidance which I would have expected it to have done before. So, I do not think 
that Oakam has provided any reasons or new evidence for me to reach a different 
conclusion now on those loans earlier conceded. So, I have not reviewed Loans 5 to 7 and 
my finding is that the adjudicators uphold on those  which dovetail with Oakams own 
concession on them  stand. The redress section below reflects that.
That leaves Loan 4 only as the disputed loan and it is that lending decision that I have 
focussed on and within the context of the overall lending relationship, having taken into 
account all that Oakam has said about its own reviews.
Having reviewed it all I think that Loan 4 was one which ought not to have been approved. 
Miss S application has an endorsement on it in red to Review budget against bank 
statements to check completeness. I have seen Miss S bank statements for the periods 
leading up to the Loan 4 application and my view is that I do not think Oakam carried out that 
review. If it had then I think it would have seen that Miss S was receiving large sums from 
multiple lenders for high cost short term credit and that the corollary to that was multiple 
payments out to those other lenders as well as to Oakam. I appreciate that Miss S had 
declared that she spent around £300 a month on other credit but the nature of the credit 
must have been an important factor for Oakam when carrying out a proper and thorough 
creditworthiness assessment within the meaning of the OFT ILG. 
By Loan 4 and after more than 16 months of continuous lending to Miss S then additional 
questions and reviews ought to have been done and even the application itself is endorsed 
with a Warning that the budget review ought to have been carried out. 
 
In addition to this, I have looked at the overall pattern of Oakams lending history with 
Miss S, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Oakam should reasonably have 
seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Oakam should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Miss S case, I think that this point was reached by Loan 4. I say 
this for several reasons, many of which interlink with each other. Miss S had been 
refinancing her loans into the next each time and Loan 4 was no exception. Using the 
statement for Loan 4 (ID ***768) I find these details:  
12/01/2013 Opening Balance - Transferred From Previous Loan (ID ***006) 
£1,370.40 
12/01/2013 Loan Disbursement £380.00
And I see from records that Loan 3 (ID ***006) was structured like this:
28/08/2012 Opening Balance - Transferred From Previous Loan (ID ***290) £874.24 
28/08/2012 Loan Disbursement £750.00
So, after repaying for Loan 3 from August 2012 to January 2013, Miss S had the balance 
transferred to the next Loan (ID ***768) which was Loan 4 and that balance was £1,370.40. 
So, Miss S was making little inroads into the debt owed to Oakam and still further advances 
were being made to her with new loans, fresh interest applied and further time to repay.
 
It was unreasonable for Oakam to provide further lending from loan 4. The refinancing had 
led to the compounding of charges and the previous loans balances and extended Miss S 
indebtedness. 
I think that Miss S lost out because Oakam continued to provide borrowing from Loan 4 
onwards (Loans 5 to 7 have been conceded already by Oakam and I have earlier given 
reasons as to why I consider those concessions stand) because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss S indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period; 
she was not reducing her overall indebtedness; and 
the number of loans and refinancing was likely to have had negative implications on 
Miss S ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about Loan 4 and Oakam should put things right for 
Loans 4 to 7 inclusive which includes the loans it has conceded on/already been upheld. For 
ease of reference I have included here all the loans 4 to 7 in this redress section below.
Putting things right  what Oakam needs to do
A)Oakam should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss S towards interest, 
fees and charges on Loans 4 to 7, but not including anything already refunded; and
B)Oakam should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss S 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss S originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled; and
C)Oakam should pay Miss S the total of A plus B.
D)The overall pattern of Miss S borrowing for loans 4 to 7 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so you should remove these loans entirely from Miss S credit file.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires you to deduct tax from this interest. Oakam should give 
Miss S a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss S complaint in part and direct that Oakam Ltd does as 
I have outlined above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept or reject my decision before 12 October 2020.
