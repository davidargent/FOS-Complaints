The complaint
Mr K is unhappy HSBC UK Bank Plc will not refund the money he lost as the result of an 
authorised push payment (APP) scam. 
Mr K brought his complaint through a representative, for ease I will refer solely to Mr K in this 
decision. 
What happened
As both parties are familiar with the details of the scam I will not repeat them in full here. In 
summary, Mr K started investing in June 2022 and lost a total of £79,613* from his HSBC 
account. He says he borrowed from friends and family to fund his investment. Mr K was 
contacted by a scammer after filling in an inquiry form online. Mr K says the scammer 
appeared professional and knowledgeable: they set him up with an account on its trading 
platform (and asked him to download AnyDesk so they could guide him) and he had to 
upload documentation to verify his identity and residency. He initially made smaller 
payments that he was able to withdraw which gave him confidence the opportunity was 
genuine.  
As the scam progressed Mr K was persuaded by the scammer to borrow money to fund his 
investment. He later paid tax to access his investment, and the returns, but the scammer 
then ceased all contact and Mr K realised he had been scammed. He reported this to HSBC 
on 3 October 2022. The relevant transactions are set out below. Mr K made bill payments 
when he moved the money to his Swissborg account and faster payments to his Revolut 
account.

*The payments listed total £82,613. On1/7/2022 Mr K withdrew £2,997 from his Swissborg account 
and paid £3,000 back into his HSBC account, via a bank account he held elsewhere.
HSBC said the money was moved to accounts in Mr Ks name that he had sole control of 
and it contacted Mr K to provide fraud warnings when he was setting up the payments. It had 
made no errors.
Our investigator upheld Mr Ks complaint in part. He noted HSBC had intervened on 2 July 
2022 at the time of payment 6. But he felt that intervention ought to have led HSBC to ask 
for more information, and that this would have prevented Mr K falling victim to the scam from 
this point onwards. He found, however, that Mr K was in part liable for his losses so he 
reduced the value of the refund he said HSBC must pay.
Mr K accepted this assessment. HSBC did not reply.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres no dispute that Mr K made and authorised the payments. Mr K knew who he was
paying, and the reason why. At the stage he was making these payments, he believed
he was transferring funds to invest in stocks and shares via a cryptocurrency account. I dont 
dispute Mr K was scammed and he wasnt making payments for the reason he thought he 
was, but I remain satisfied the transactions were authorised under the Payment Services 
Regulations 2017.
Its also accepted that HSBC has an obligation to follow Mr Ks instructions. So in the
first instance Mr K is presumed liable for his losses. But there are other factors that must be
considered.
To reach my decision I have taken into account the law, regulators rules and guidance,
relevant codes of practice and what was good industry practice at the time. To note, as the
payments were to accounts in Mr Ks name the principles of the Contingent Reimbursement 
Model (CRM) code do not apply in this case.
This means I think that HSBC should have:
been monitoring accounts and payments made or received to counter various
risks, including fraud and scams, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that
might indicate that its customers were at risk of fraud (amongst other things). This is
particularly so given the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years,
which financial institutions are generally more familiar with than the average
customer.
in some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, taken
additional steps or made additional checks before processing a payment, or in somecases declined to make a payment altogether, to help protect its customers from the
possibility of financial harm.
In this case, I need to consider whether HSBC acted fairly and reasonably in its dealings 
with Mr K when he made the transfers, or whether it could and should have done more 
before processing them. 
Did HSBC act fairly and reasonably in Mr Ks case?
HSBC made a direct intervention at the time of payment 6. I think this was appropriate as it 
took the amount of money Mr K had moved to his Swissborg account in four days to £5,000 
and this was out of character for his account. I note it had provided online investment scam 
warnings from the outset on 29 June 2022. 
I have listened carefully to the call between the parties on 2 July 2022. I am not persuaded it 
was as effective as it ought to have been. Whilst it seems a fraud prevention script was 
diligently followed, I think there were red flags that HSBC did not pick up on and at times it 
moved too rapidly onto the next question rather than reacting to, and thinking about, Mr Ks 
previous reply. As the investigator concluded, HSBC should have been concerned Mr K was 
using loan proceeds to fund his high-risk investment. And Mr K did not seem to have done 
any proper due diligence  only saying friends at work had taken advantage of the same 
opportunity. He also indicated he was feeling under financial pressure due to the current cost 
of living crisis. And that he had just started this kind of investing. 
I think had HSBC reacted differently to Mr Ks replies to its questions the scam could have 
been uncovered. For example, when it asked if Mr K had checked the investment firm was 
regulated Mr K didnt give a clear answer. He seems to say yes  but as he had read all of 
the information on the firms website. I think it ought to have concerned HSBC that he had 
not independently verified the firm. I appreciate Mr K had been coached to an extent by the 
scammer but there were simple questions HSBC ought to have asked (for example, what 
rate of return was Mr K expecting, why did he need to open a crypto wallet to invest in stocks 
and shares?) that Mr K would most likely not have been able to answer, and which should 
have led HSBC to more explicitly warn Mr K that this sounded like a scam. I have no reason 
to think Mr K would not have listened to a more assertive and bespoke warning given he was 
already worried about his finances.
By this time, banks had, or ought to have had, a good enough understanding of how these 
type of investment scams work  including that a customer often moves money to a crypto 
account in their own name before moving it on again to the scammer and that the scammer 
often returns funds early in the scam to generate confidence  such that it ought to have 
been able to identify the risk of harm from fraud here.
I am satisfied Mr K would have had second thoughts if HSBC had intervened effectively. I 
dont find it fulfilled its role as the expert on fraud prevention during its intervention.
Had it done so I think Mr K would not have gone ahead with payment 6, nor any subsequent 
payments.
Did HSBC do enough to recover Mr Ks funds?
I can see HSBC contacted Swissborg two days after Mr K reported the fraud to try to recover 
the funds but there were no funds available. Whilst we would expect this to have happened 
faster, as the money had already been moved to another wallet prior to Mr K reporting the 
fraud it would have made no difference. As the other payments were made to an account in Mr Ks name that he had moved on to invest, I do not find HSBC could have done anything 
to recover those funds. 
Should Mr K bear some responsibility for the overall loss?
Ive considered carefully whether Mr K should hold some responsibility for his loss by way 
of contributory negligence. I think he should, there are a few reasons for this:
Mr K carried out minimal checks on the investment opportunity  he now says he 
wasnt aware of the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) at the time but he did not 
disclose that on the call on 2 July 2022. He seems to have been willing to invest 
significant sums without an appropriate level of due diligence.
Mr K was willing to conceal facts from HSBC - he said he had set up the e-wallet on 
his own when he had in fact downloaded software to give the scammer access to his 
technology.
Mr K took out a loan for £18,000 during the scam and gave a false reason for this 
loan (home improvements).
I am therefore instructing HSBC to refund only 50% of Mr Ks losses, after first deducting 
50% of the losses he suffered by transferring money to Revolut to ensure the division of 
losses is equitable.
Putting things right
HSBC must refund Mr K £26,150.75. This is the sum of 50% of payments 6 to 12 
(£12,997.50) and 25% of payments 13 to 21 (£13,153.25). There is no interest award as    
Mr K has told us he funded the payments by borrowing from friends and family. As they are 
not party to this complaint I cannot award them compensatory interest. 
My final decision
I am upholding Mr Ks complaint in part. HSBC UK Bank Plc must put things right as set out 
above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 October 2023.
