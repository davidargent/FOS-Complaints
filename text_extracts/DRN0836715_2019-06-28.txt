Mrs V believes that CashEuroNet was irresponsible to lend to her. She says she says she 
needed to borrow  in order to make her repayments on other payday loans. And she was 
making payments  under a debt management plan at the time.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in part. In summary,  she 
thought that if CashEuroNet had carried out proportionate checks, it wouldnt have agreed to 
make loans 2, 3, or 6 to 9, and it wouldnt have allowed Mrs V to top up loans 5 and 9 either. 
So she recommended  that CashEuroNet refund all interest and charges that Mrs V paid on 
those loans, with interest  on the refund. And she said it should remove  any negative  
information about them from Mrs Vs credit  file.
After the adjudicator sent out her view of the complaint, CashEuroNet  wrote  off the 
outstanding principal balance of £900 on the final loan Mrs V took from QuickQuid and the 
outstanding principal balance of £1,045.41 on the final loan she took from Pounds to Pocket.
Ref: DRN08367152my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
CashEuroNet was required to lend responsibly.  It needed to make  checks  to see whether 
Mrs V could afford to pay back each  loan before it lent to her. Those checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mrs V was borrowing, and her lending history, 
but there was no set list of checks CashEuroNet had to do.
CashEuroNets told us about the checks it did before  lending  to Mrs V. Before each loan it 
asked her for details  of her income.  And it carried out a credit check  each time.
Throughout the period in which she was borrowing from CashEuroNet, Mrs V told it that her 
monthly take-home pay was £1,450. The highest  monthly repayment on the first loan was a 
relatively small proportion of Mrs Vs declared  monthly income. And I cant see that 
CashEuroNet should have been aware  of any adverse information on Mrs Vs credit file, 
such as defaults  or county  court  judgements. So I dont think it was at fault in agreeing to the 
loan without carrying out more detailed checks.
But Mrs V applied for loan 2 just a week after repaying loan 1. And the amount she applied 
to borrow more than quadrupled. The highest repayment on loan 2 was over £800  well 
over half of Mrs Vs declared monthly income.  In the circumstances, I think  CashEuroNet 
ought to have asked Mrs V more about her financial situation before  agreeing  to lend.  I think  
it should have  asked her for details of her regular monthly expenditure, credit commitments 
and any other short-term loans she had outstanding at the time. And it should have taken 
steps to verify the information  independently.
Ive looked at Mrs Vs bank statements  to see what its likely that proportionate checks  would 
have revealed. Mrs Vs average monthly expenditure was just under £2,600  at the time.  
Thats clearly significantly more than she earned, even taking account of the fact that she 
appears to have been earning £620 per month  on top of her regular salary at the time. 
I acknowledge that most,  if not all, of the expenses that Mrs Vs told us about were shared  
with her husband. But Mrs V wouldnt have had enough money to pay half the households 
monthly expenses once shed made the repayment  on loan 2. And even taking account of 
the fact her income,  combined  with her husbands at the time was around £3,500,  theyd 
have only been  left with around  £100 between them to meet any unexpected or one-off 
expenses in the month that the loan was due to be repaid. So, in the circumstances of this 
case, I think thered  have  been a real risk that theyd have  had to borrow further to repay the 
loan.
Taking everything into account,  I think that if QuickQuid had carried  out what I consider  to be 
proportionate checks when Mrs V applied for loan 2, it would have realised, as a responsible  
lender, that it was likely  that she wouldnt be able to repay the loan sustainably  in other 
words without having to borrow  further. So I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed to 
loan 2. And my conclusion - and the reasons for it - are the same as regards loan 3.
Ref: DRN08367153While loan 4 was for more  again  than the previous  loans, it was repayable  in eleven monthly 
instalments. Given that this was the fourth loan Mrs V had applied to CashEuroNet for in less 
than six months, I think that Pounds  to Pocket, should have asked Mrs V for up-to-date  
details of her regular monthly commitments,  and any other short-term loans she had 
outstanding at the time. But from what Ive seen,  even  if it had done  so, I think  Pounds  to 
Pocket could reasonably  have concluded that Mrs V would be able to afford the monthly 
repayments on the loan. So I dont think it was at fault in agreeing to loan 4. And even 
though she was still making monthly repayments on loan 4 when she applied  for loan 5, 
I think it would have  looked to QuickQuid as if shed be able to afford to repay loan 5 after 
meeting her share of the household expenses. So again, I dont think  QuickQuid was at fault 
in agreeing to loan 5.
But Mrs V applied to top up loan 5 eleven days after she took it out. By that time, shed been 
borrowing from CashEuroNet with only short breaks  for nearly eight  months. I think that her 
borrowing history ought to have prompted QuickQuid to wonder whether  she might have 
become dependent on short-term loans to get by. So I think  it should have asked Mrs V for 
details of her regular monthly expenditure, credit commitments and other  short-term  loans. 
And I think it should have  independently verified that information.
Ive looked at Mrs Vs bank statements  to see what its likely that better checks  would have 
shown QuickQuid. Having  done so, I think it would  have  been apparent  that Mrs V wouldnt 
have enough money left to make the increased  repayment on loan 5 after meeting her share 
of the household bills and the monthly repayment on loan 4, which  was still on-going.  And 
her husbands  income wasnt  enough to make up the difference. Whats more, QuickQuid 
would have seen  that shed been  taking regular substantial loans from another payday 
lender for several months. So taking everything  into account, I think  QuickQuid  would have 
declined Mrs Vs application to top up loan 5 if it had carried  out appropriately detailed 
checks. 
Mrs Vs situation hadnt improved materially  when  she took out the remaining loans. Ive 
noted that CashEuroNet believes loan 8 would have been affordable  to Mrs V, after taking 
her regular monthly expenditure into account.  But she already had a short-term loan 
outstanding with another lender when she applied for loan 8. And once the repayment due 
on that is taken  into account, Mrs V and her husband would have  been  left with less than 
£100 between  them to meet any one-off or unexpected expenses. So again,  given Mrs Vs 
circumstances, I think  that if it had carried out proportionate checks, QuickQuid would, as a 
responsible lender, have declined loan 8, in addition to the other loans from 5a onwards.
Ref: DRN08367154putting things right
I dont think CashEuroNet  (trading  variously  as QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket) should 
have agreed to make loans 2, 3 or loans 5a onwards Mrs V. So for each of those loans 
CashEuroNet should:
refund any interest and charges applied to the loans;
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per year to each of these amounts from the date they 
were paid to the date of settlement*; and
remove any negative information  about loans 2, 3 and 5a onwards from Mrs Vs credit 
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest. 
CashEuroNet must  give Mrs V a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks 
for one.
CashEuroNet may deduct the total principal  balance of £1,945.41 that it has written  off from 
the compensation due to Mrs V.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. I require CashEuroNet  UK LLC to put 
things right by doing as Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs V to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 July 2019.
