K821x#15complaint
Mr A has complained about two personal loans  Madison CF UK Limited,  trading  as 118 118 
Money, provided to him. He says 118 118 Money  acted  irresponsibly in lending to him 
because of the financial situation he was in at the time.
background
Mr As first loan with 118 118 Money  was taken in November 2015 and was for £1,000  to be 
repaid over two years. The total amount to be repaid was £2,416.32, with monthly  payments 
of £100.68.
Mr As second loan with 118 118 Money was taken in November 2017  and was for 
£1,260.75, including £260.75  to pay off the first loan. So Mr A received £1,000 into his bank 
account. The total amount to be repaid was £3,859.36, with monthly payments of £119.14.
In its final response,  118 118 Money accepted that it could have asked more questions  to be 
able to fully assess  Mr As circumstances when it provided the second loan. So it offered to 
refund the interest charged  on the second loan and remove it from Mr As credit  file.
Mr A wasnt  happy with 118 118 Moneys  response, so referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint and thought 118 118 Money  had acted 
irresponsibly in lending  to Mr A for both loans. 118 118 Money  disagreed so the complaint 
has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The relevant  rules and guidance say that businesses must act responsibly when lending to 
consumers. Businesses must  consider the potential for the lending  to adversely impact  the 
consumers financial situation and the consumers ability to make the repayments as they fall 
due over the life of the agreement.
Businesses must assess whether the consumer could  afford  to meet  the repayments in a 
sustainable manner,  without incurring financial difficulties or significant adverse 
consequences. This means the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments.
As part of its affordability check for the first loan, 118 118 Money carried out a credit search 
to check Mr As credit history and outstanding  debt. It also asked Mr A for details of his 
monthly income and outgoings and carried out a check to confirm  Mr As income  was 
correct.
The information 118 118 Money  got about  Mr As monthly income and outgoings showed he 
had a disposable income of over £1,000, after his living expenses and payments to other 
loans were taken into account. The credit search  showed Mr A had other loan or instalment 
balances of nearly £20,000,  credit  card balances of over £1,500 and that those credit card 
balances were 116% of his credit limits.  It also showed Mr A had taken out over £1,400 of 
cash advances in the last 12 months.
Ref: DRN46736752While Mr As income and stated outgoings show he had enough disposable income  to 
comfortably make the monthly  payments for the first loan, 118 118 Money was required to 
establish whether  he could  sustainably  make the repayments,  not just whether the 
repayments were affordable based  on a strict  pounds  and pence  calculation.
Mr A had significant outstanding balances, both with other  loans and with credit cards, and 
was over his credit  limits on his credit cards. These can both be signs that a customer  has 
difficulty managing  their finances.  Mr A had also taken out significant cash advances  on his 
credit cards in the last 12 months. And as this is a very expensive  form of borrowing, it can 
suggest a customer  is struggling financially. I also think  118 118 Money should have 
questioned why Mr A had such  significant outstanding balances,  was over his credit limits 
and wanted to borrow £1,000 if he genuinely had more than £1,000 in disposable income 
available to him each month.
Given this information,  I dont think it was reasonable for 118 118 Money to rely solely on the 
information it had to decide whether to provide  Mr A with the loan. So I dont think  118 118 
Money carried out sufficient checks before lending to Mr A. And I think it should have carried 
out further checks to satisfy itself that Mr A would be able to manage  his finances going 
forwards and that it would  be responsible to lend to him.
I cant say for sure what  more proportionate  checks wouldve shown. But Ive seen copies of 
Mr As bank  statements  from around the time and, in the absence of evidence to the 
contrary, I think its likely these statements give a good indication  of Mr As financial 
circumstances.
The bank statements show that Mr A was significantly overdrawn throughout the months  
before taking this loan,  that his salary  payments werent taking his account out of the 
overdraft and that the overdrawn  balance  wasnt decreasing over time. They also show  Mr A 
was spending  significantly more on certain outgoings than 118 118 Money had been told, 
had made  a significant number of cash withdrawals and had taken around £1,800  in payday 
loans in the two months  before this loan was taken.
I think these statements show Mr A was having  difficulty managing his finances and may 
have been reliant  on other  lending to meet his existing outgoings.  And I think  its likely more 
proportionate checks wouldve  shown similar information to this. So I think more  
proportionate checks would have shown 118 118 Money that it was unlikely Mr A could 
afford to meet the repayments in a sustainable manner and that it wouldnt be responsible to 
lend to him.
So I think 118 118 Money acted irresponsibly in providing Mr A with the first loan.
And 118 118 Money has already accepted that it could have done more  to fully assess 
Mr As circumstances when it provided the second loan.
As Mr A ended up paying interest and charges on loans he shouldnt have been given, I 
think he has lost out as a result  of what 118 118 Money did wrong.
Ref: DRN46736753putting things right
118 118 Money shouldnt have given  Mr A either of the loans.
a)118 118 Money should add together the repayments made by Mr A towards interest,  
fees and charges on both loans.
b)It should calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by Mr A 
which were considered as part of a), calculated from the date Mr A originally made  
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
118 118 Money should then refund the amounts calculated in a) and b).
c)118 118 Money should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr As credit file 
in relation to both loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires 118 118 Money to deduct  tax from this interest.  It should give Mr A a 
certificate showing how much  tax it has deducted,  if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I uphold Mr As complaint. Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 
118 118 Money, should put things right by doing  what Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 March  2020
