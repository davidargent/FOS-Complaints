The complaint
Ms P complains that MoneyGram International Limited has decided not to refund her for a 
disputed withdrawal.
What happened
Around August last year, Ms P was sent funds from a family member via MoneyGram. 
Initially when she tried to collect the funds, MoneyGram said it couldnt allow her to do so 
because the sender hadnt provided Ms Ps full name. Following this, the sender made the 
amendment, but before Ms P could collect the funds, it was withdrawn by an unknown third-
party. 
Ms P contacted this service and complained to MoneyGram. The business says the 
withdrawal of the funds was verified because it was collected by someone with all the 
required information. MoneyGram says whoever collected the funds wouldve provided the 
name of the sender and recipient, the relevant reference number for the payment and photo 
I.D. MoneyGram says its agent can only search for transactions using the reference number 
and that theres no other way to do so. 
The business adds that the only information it holds about the recipient is their name  so it 
has no idea what they look like and can only apply a reasonable evaluation when 
determining the legitimacy of the I.D thats provided. The business adds that it was obliged 
to release the funds as all the required information was provided.
One of our investigators looked into what happened and decided that MoneyGram had acted 
unfairly. MoneyGram shared a copy of the passport that was used to collect the funds and 
the investigator concluded that the business shouldve done more to verify whether the 
passport was genuine  given the one used wasnt Ms Ps actual passport nor did it contain 
her correct details. 
The investigator added that Ms P was unable to collect the funds on her first visit and that 
they felt the passport MoneyGram relied on appeared to be doctored  so the business 
shouldve been more diligent. Moreover, the sender provided MoneyGram with a copy of 
Ms Ps passport to assist in amending her name, so the investigator decided that the 
business shouldve relied on this when conducting its checks.
MoneyGram doesnt agree. It says it only had Ms Ps name on record and not a copy of her 
genuine passport. MoneyGram says that if the I.D appears genuine and matches the name 
on its system, and the other information provided is accurate  then it is obliged to release 
the funds. Because the business didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a 
final say on the matter.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im upholding this complaint and Ill explain why.
I understand why MoneyGram decided not to release the funds to Ms P the first time she 
attempted to do so. The sender had only included Ms Ps initial and surname, rather than her 
name in full. So I think MoneyGram acted reasonably when exercising caution before 
releasing the funds. 
Its unclear how a third-party obtained information about the transaction. The information Ive 
seen doesnt shed any light on how such details couldve been compromised. Im satisfied 
from what Ive seen that Ms P hasnt done anything to compromise information that would 
identify the transaction.
I agree that MoneyGram failed to carry out appropriate checks to ensure the person it 
released the funds to was the genuine recipient. MoneyGram sent us a copy of the passport 
used to withdraw the funds. This is clearly not Ms Ps passport. The passport uses her 
name, but all the other information is inaccurate. I appreciate that MoneyGram only had 
access to Ms Ps name, and I accept that it may not have kept a copy of her passport on its 
system when the sender sent it via a MoneyGram agent  given it was only provided to 
amend Ms Ps name.
However, having seen the information provided by the sender about the transaction, I can 
see it quite clearly sets out Ms Ps title as Miss. The individual that seemingly collected the 
funds and appears to have used their own passport to impersonate Ms P is clearly a male. I 
think its quite poor on MoneyGrams part that it was unable to identify an unauthentic 
passport. 
As I mentioned, all aspects of the passport used (other than the name) were different to 
Ms Ps genuine information. MoneyGram argues that it holds no other information other than 
the recipients name  so it wouldve been unaware of what Ms P looks like. Its not within 
my remit to tell MoneyGram what procedures it should implement. But where its procedures 
do not appropriately protect its customers, I can reach a finding on whether the consumer 
was treated fairly. In Ms Ps case, I find that for MoneyGram to have allowed a withdrawal 
based on a completely different passport was unfair.
Moreover, Ms Ps initial attempt at withdrawing the funds was made at a MoneyGram 
location based in London. She also returned to this location a few days later to withdraw the 
funds after her name had been amended on the recipient information. The funds were 
withdrawn by the third-party via a MoneyGram agent based in Sheffield. I think MoneyGram 
shouldve picked up on the fact that the withdrawal was being made at a location thats in a 
different region of England and several hundred miles away from where Ms Ps initial 
withdrawal attempt was made. Had MoneyGram exercised more caution and looked into 
why this was the case, I think its likely the business wouldve noticed something about the 
withdrawal request was untoward. 
In my opinion, MoneyGram failed to carry out adequate checks to prevent an unauthorised 
party from withdrawing funds intended for Ms P. So I find that it should refund the money to 
her. Ms P says the funds were for a specific purpose and that the sender was able to make 
another payment to her within a few days. So I dont consider Ms P to have been out of 
pocket  therefore, I dont find it reasonable for MoneyGram to include interest when making 
the refund.
Ms P says her husband had been experiencing health issues at the time and he was in 
hospital. Ms P was also caring for him. Understandably, this wouldve been a difficult time for 
Ms P. MoneyGrams failing wouldve only added further distress and inconvenience to Ms P, 
so I think the business should compensate her. I agree that £150 compensation is fair in these circumstances.
Ms P thinks a higher compensation figure should be awarded for the distress she 
experienced and points to a data breach on MoneyGrams part as her justification for this. 
However, theres nothing Ive seen that leads me to conclude that MoneyGram committed a 
data breach that led to Ms Ps funds being withdrawn by an unauthorised party. Moreover, I 
can see that the sender provided Ms P with the funds again a few days following the 
unauthorised withdrawal, so it seems likely to me that any further distress was mitigated by 
this. So Im satisfied that £150 compensation fairly reflects the level of distress Ms P 
experienced. 
Putting things right
MoneyGram unfairly decided not to refund Ms P for the disputed withdrawal. To put things 
right, it should refund her the disputed amount of £4,000. MoneyGram also caused Ms P 
unnecessary distress and inconvenience, so it should pay her £150 compensation.
My final decision
For the reasons above, Im upholding this complaint. MoneyGram International Limited 
should settle this complaint as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2024.
