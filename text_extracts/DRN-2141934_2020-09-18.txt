The complaint
Mr R complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as MoneyBoat) was 
irresponsible to lend him money he couldnt afford to pay back.
What happened
Mr R took out three loans with MoneyBoat - heres a table showing details:

Mr R said when MoneyBoat loaned to him he already had a mountain of debt, with payday 
loans from several companies, ordinary loans and credit cards that were maxed out. On top 
of that he had many recently closed payday loans in the last few months before Moneyboat 
gave him the loans it provided. 
Mr R didn't feel that MoneyBoat did enough checks before lending to him.
Our adjudicator felt that MoneyBoat shouldnt have provided any of the loans to Mr R given 
that the checks MoneyBoat did showed that Mr R was repaying multiple loans with other 
short-term lenders at the time. The checks revealed that his overall indebtedness ran into 
five figures  and he had around £5,780 owing in loans. 
MoneyBoat could also see that he had opened 52 accounts up to this point. So our 
adjudicator felt it wasnt likely that Mr R wouldve been able to sustainably repay loan 1  or 
any subsequent loans. 
Our adjudicator set out the steps he said MoneyBoat should take to put things right for Mr R. 
MoneyBoat mainly said it did proportionate checks  and that whilst we might say it 
should've looked at all the information it had, MoneyBoat said it was impractical to review 
every line of a credit file for every loan. MoneyBoat told us that in the early stages of a 
lending relationship its processes are automated.
MoneyBoat has asked for a review so this complaint comes to me to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income) 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
MoneyBoat was required to establish whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.MoneyBoat asked Mr R to provide details of his income and to tell MoneyBoat what he 
normally spent each month. Looking at what MoneyBoat knew about Mr Rs income and 
expenditure, Mr R appeared to have more than £700 of disposable income when he was 
applying for loan 1 and hed mentioned spending around £250 on other credit. 
But I think MoneyBoat could see that information looked to be at odds with the information 
shown on its credit checks that MoneyBoat sent to us. 
I think its fair to say that MoneyBoat could see that Mr R had been relying significantly on 
short term loans, including payday loans, for some time. 
And MoneyBoat could see from the credit checks it did that Mr R had multiple other short-
term high cost loans outstanding when he asked to borrow loan 1 from MoneyBoat. 
This type of borrowing is intended to provide short term financial help in the event of 
temporary money problems. So I think the information MoneyBoat had gathered about 
Mr Rs credit history shouldve made MoneyBoat realise that it looked like Mr R was having 
problems managing his money. 
Ive carefully considered what MoneyBoat has said about this. But I think that as it had 
gathered information that showed the extent of Mr Rs other short term borrowing this should 
reasonably have led MoneyBoat to the conclusion that the information Mr R had provided 
about his finances was highly inaccurate and that it was likely that Mr R was facing serious 
problems managing his money.
I dont think it was reasonable for MoneyBoat to conclude that it was likely that Mr R would 
be able to repay loan 1, or any subsequent loan, in a sustainable way. 
The fact that MoneyBoat declined a number of other loan applications made by Mr R doesn't 
mean that the loans it did provide were affordable and fairly loaned to him. 
For the reasons I've explained, I dont think MoneyBoat shouldve granted any of Mr Rs loan 
applications.
Putting things right
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr R towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 1  3, not including anything it has already refunded.
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr R which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr R originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Pay Mr R the amounts calculated in "A" and "B".
D. Remove all adverse entries from Mr Rs credit file for loans 1  3. * HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as 
MoneyBoat) to take the steps set out above to put things right for Mr R.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 October 2020.
