K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains about fees and charges applied to his current account by 
National Westminster Bank Plc.
background
Mr R had a current account  with NatWest without an overdraft facility. On 1 May 2018 
Mr Rs account went into an unarranged overdraft because there wasnt  enough money to 
cover direct debit payments and card transactions that were collected  that day. 
As a result of the unplanned overdraft  NatWest started charging Mr R £8 a day. But NatWest  
limits the amount  of charges it can apply each month so £80 of charges were added  to 
Mr Rs account for May 2018. 
Over the following months Mr R continued to be charged by NatWest for being overdrawn 
without an arranged overdraft facility. Mr R complained and NatWest  responded in 
November 2018.  
NatWest said that Mr R had been  charged  in line with his account  terms and didnt find it had 
made a mistake.  Mr R went on to refer his complaint to this service  and an investigator 
looked at what  had happened. They thought the charges had been  correctly applied  and 
didnt find any evidence  of an error  by NatWest  so didnt uphold  Mr Rs complaint.  
Mr R asked for his case to be appealed to its been passed  to me to make  a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Banks are allowed to charge customers if their account isnt being used in line with the 
agreed limits. In this case, Mr R didnt have an overdraft facility  on his account. But because  
direct debits and card payments debited his account  at the same time on 1 May 2018 his 
account entered into an unarranged overdraft. 
The terms and conditions  of Mr Rs account say that NatWest  can charge customers £8 a 
day (to a maximum of eight days in a month) for being more  than £10 overdrawn without an 
unarranged overdraft facility. The terms also say that NatWest wont charge  more than £80 
in any month  for being in an unarranged overdraft. 
Ive looked at Mr Rs account statements and I can see that the charges have been  applied 
in line with NatWests  terms  and conditions. As the charges have been correctly applied  I 
havent found grounds to tell NatWest to refund  them. 
NatWest has explained  that it didnt decline Mr Rs overdraft application in May 2018 
because he didnt fully complete it. The investigator also asked  NatWest  for any evidence  
that Mr R had called to discuss any financial difficulties he was experiencing around  this 
time. But NatWests notes dont show Mr R made contact  until October 2018 when he 
complained. 
Ref: DRN53261702Id expect a business to treat customers in financial difficulties  positively and sympathetically.  
But I think NatWest could  reasonably have expected Mr R to make  contact and discuss  any 
financial issues he was having.  NatWest wrote to Mr R about  his account throughout this 
period and asked  him to get in touch. Ive not seen anything to indicate NatWest  wouldnt 
have treated Mr R positively and sympathetically  if hed contacted it. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Mr R but as the charges were applied to his account correctly  and in 
line with the terms  and conditions I havent found  NatWest made an error. As I havent  found 
NatWest made a mistake  and Im satisfied its dealt  with Mr Rs complaint fairly  Im not telling 
it to do anything else. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  Under the rules of the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or reject  my decision 
before 13 April 2019.
