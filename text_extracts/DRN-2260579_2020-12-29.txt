The complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) recorded a late payment 
marker on his credit file which they are now refusing to remove. Mr S does not think the 
marker should have been placed.
What happened
Mr S holds a credit agreement with PayPal called PayPal Credit. He makes monthly 
payments on the credit account from his current account by direct debit. The direct debit was 
originally set up with on Mr Ss current account with bank A. In July 2018 Mr S started using 
a current account hes opened earlier in the year with bank B. 
Mr S told us that he tried to set up a new direct debit online with PayPal in June 2018 but it 
wouldnt work, so he rang PayPal to get the direct debit set up on his bank B account. He 
says the advisor agreed over the phone to set this up. Unfortunately, the direct debit was not 
set up and Mr S missed his August payment. At the end of August, PayPal placed a late 
payment marker was on his account for August 2018. 
Mr S complained to PayPal and asked for the marker to be removed. Mr S said that during 
the complaint process, PayPal told him the marker would be removed and offered him £50 
as a goodwill payment. 
However, when the final response came, PayPal said that they would not remove the marker 
because it was correctly placed. They said payment was late, and they could find no record 
of a call from Mr S about setting up the direct debit from his new account. They also said that 
there was no record of any staff accessing Mr Ss account at all. Staff would have had to 
access the account if Mr S had phoned in order to perform security checks.   
One of our investigators has looked into Mr Ss complaint. He asked Mr S for his phone bills 
to show the calls he had made. Mr S then told us that with hindsight he thought that maybe 
the call was inbound from PayPal rather than outbound, but he provided us with screen 
shots of social media conversations with PayPal about the direct debit and the subsequent 
complaint for the period July 2018 to December 2018. 
PayPal say that they would not speak to any customer on a call inbound or outbound without 
accessing their account to perform security checks, and there is no record of any access to 
Mr Ss account during the relevant time so there can have been no phone calls.  
Following the receipt of the additional evidence from Mr S, our investigator concluded that 
PayPal should remove the later payment marker, as all the evidence indicates that Mr S was 
trying to set up the direct debit to make the payments in August and again in September, 
and but for a combination of technical issues and poor communication, this would have 
happened.  
PayPal disagreed with our investigators view, and so the case has come to me to review 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have upheld the complaint, and I will explain why below. 
I note that in asking for a final decision, Paypal have said they feel that our view is unfair 
because we have given Mr S the benefit of the doubt, despite the fact that during the course 
of our investigation he has given slightly differing accounts of what he thought had 
happened. PayPal say that conversely, their own position has been consistent, and they 
have followed their processes correctly. 
I note what Paypal say, but I think that although there are differing accounts of the 
communications about setting up the direct debit in June and July, this does not impact on 
the decision I have to make. This is because both parties accept that the direct debit failed in 
August, and that is the point at which the problem started. I think that it is what happened 
after that which is important.  
Both Paypal and Mr S accept that Mr S had an obligation to meet his repayments under the 
terms of the agreement. The question here is whether Mr S took reasonable steps to try and 
sort out his repayments and whether Paypal acted reasonably in assisting him with this.  
Mr S has given me screenshots of social media conversations with PayPal in July, August, 
September and December, and Paypal have given me their contacts notes for the period 
July 2018 to February 2019. They do not completely match.  
I can see from the social media screenshots that there was contact made by Mr S about the 
direct debit on his PayPal account in July 2018, and then following the direct debit failing on 
3 August 2018, there were further contacts throughout August to December trying to sort it 
out. In his social media contact on 10 August 2018 Mr S refers to his earlier attempts to 
change his direct debit and is asking for PayPal to call him about this issue. PayPal agree to 
escalate the issue, and then after a delay, on 21 August 2018, they encourage him to open a 
formal complaint. I do think that PayPal could have done more following this initial contact on 
10 August to resolve the issue. Mr S was clearly trying to make contact to sort out his 
repayments and was not getting an adequate response. Asking him to lodge a formal 
complaint is not offering the resolution needed.  If PayPal had helped Mr S more at this point 
to sort out the direct debit and take a payment, there would have been no late payment 
marker applied at the end of August. 
Mr S makes further contact in September by phone and social media after a further late fee 
is charged. The contact notes from PayPal show that Mr S opened a further complaint by 
phone on 8 September 2018 and made further contact via social media on 10 September 
following being passed around on the phone with no resolution. Again, PayPal respond that 
they can help, and will escalate his complaint to a specialist, but nothing is resolved.  
The position with the direct debit is remedied in October with the first successful payment 
being taken in October, but the complaint about the late fees and the late payment marker is 
still ongoing with Mr S making further contacts throughout October, November and 
December via phone and social media. 
PayPal have since refunded the late payment fees for August and September and made a 
goodwill offer of £50 but have refused to remove the late payment marker as it was correctly 
applied following the failure of the direct debit.   Putting things right
Whilst I am satisfied that the late payment marker was correctly applied as the payment was 
not made by the due date, I consider that it is fair and reasonable for it to be removed in 
these circumstances. I can see that Mr S made genuine attempts to contact PayPal to 
resolve the issues with his direct debit, and I think PayPal could have done more at an 
earlier stage to resolve this with the customer and the marker need never have been 
applied. 
I think that the refund of the late payment fees and the offer of £50 that PayPal have made in 
respect of the inconvenience caused is fair in the circumstances. 
My final decision
My decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must remove the late payment 
information that it applied to Mr Ss credit file in August and September 2018. 
I also direct that the payment of £50 that was previously offered by PayPal Europe Sarl & 
Cie, SCA is paid if it has not already been paid.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 January 2021.
