LAH initially provided information that showed lending from 2007 onwards. But it has since 
clarified that the lending started in 2006. And when it, and Mrs W, refinanced earlier loans 
they kept the same reference number (as opposed to more recently where they are given a 
new reference number). Ive called the refinanced loans a to d where appropriate. And Ive 
taken this loan information from the account history information LAH supplied. Which is the 
same information the adjudicator used. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mrs Ws complaint and thought that any lending from 1 August 2007  
(loans 1c, 1d, 3a and b and loans 4 and 5) shouldnt have been given. They thought that 
LAH shouldve realised from 1 August 2007 that Mrs W was struggling to repay the lending. 
And from 27 February 2008 the pattern of lending itself showed that Mrs Ws indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably and so it wouldnt be right to continue to lend to her. 
LAH didnt agree with the adjudicators findings, but it didnt raise any further points. As no 
agreement has been reached the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending  including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that LAH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out proportionate checks to make 
sure Mrs W could repay her loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, there may come a 
point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that the 
lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same reasons.
I agree that by 1 August 2007 it was clear that Mrs W was struggling to repay her loans. 
Much of her lending had been refinanced by this time and she was still repaying the lending 
she had started earlier in 2006. And Mrs W seems to have borrowed a significant amount at 
this time across three different loan references. 
Ive also considered the pattern of lending up to 27 February 2008 and I think this lending 
history itself clearly demonstrates that further loans would likely to be unsustainable. The 
amounts Mrs S had borrowed had increased, and the lending showed no signs of ending or 
decreasing in the near future. So, I think LAH was irresponsible to continue lending after this 
point.
LAH hasnt raised any further points in respect to the adjudicators opinion. So I wont 
comment further on this. 
Putting things right
LAH shouldnt have approved any lending from W 1 August 2007.
A) LAH should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs W towards interest, 
fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything LAH has already refunded.
B) LAH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs W 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs W originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) LAH should pay Mrs W the total of A plus B.
D) LAH should remove any adverse information LAH has recorded on Mrs Ws credit file in 
relation to the lending from 1 August 2007. The overall pattern of Mrs Ws borrowing from 27 
February 2008 means any information recorded about it is adverse, so LAH should remove 
these loans entirely from Mrs Ws credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to deduct tax from this interest. LAH should give Mrs 
W a certificate showing how much tax LAH has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mrs Ws complaint. S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 October 2020.
