The complaint
Mrs C, through her representative, complains that Gain Credit LLC, trading as Lending 
Stream, lent to her irresponsibly. 
What happened
Mrs C took nine loans with Lending Stream from 12 December 2019 onwards. Here is a brief 
loan table. The grey colouring for loans 7 to 9 show that these are the ones which Lending 
Stream conceded in its final response letter. More detail is given in the main part of the 
decision.

Mrs C, through her representative, complained to it on 8 September 2022 and it responded 
with its final response letter on 27 September 2022. Lending Stream did not think it needed 
to put things right for Mrs C for loans 1 to 6 but it did think that it ought to refund her the 
interest and charges on loans 7 to 9. So, it made this offer of the refund (plus interest less 
tax) together with the removal of loans 7 to 9 from Mrs Cs credit file. 
Mrs Cs representative referred her complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service on 
27 September 2022. 
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that the offer for loans 7 to 9 
was fair and so did not review those loans. She reviewed loans 1 to 6. She thought that 
Lending Stream had not done anything wrong for loans 1 to 4. So, she did not uphold that 
part of the complaint.
Our adjudicator thought that for loans 5 and 6 it should have taken steps to build a more 
thorough picture of Mrs Cs financial situation before lending those two loans to her. As 
Mrs Cs representative had already sent to us the bank account statements which covered 
that period of the lending  July and August 2020  our adjudicator reviewed them. She 
could not see anything which should have prevented Lending Stream from lending to Mrs C. 
And our adjudicator also said:
I dont think that the number of loans [Mrs C] took, the amounts they were for or
the period of time she was borrowing meant her loan history, on its own, shouldve 
shown Lending Stream she mightve been experiencing underlying financial 
difficulty.
So that part of the complaint was not upheld either. 
Mrs Cs representative did not give any reasons  other than it disagreed - but it requested 
that an ombudsman review the complaint. 
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about this type of lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Lending Stream had to assess the lending to check if Mrs C could afford to pay back the 
amounts shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Lending Streams checks couldve taken into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, 
and Mrs C s income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks 
might have been proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Lending Stream should 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mrs C . These factors 
include:
Mrs C having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mrs C having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period 
of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing 
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mrs C coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mrs C . 
Lending Stream was required to establish whether Mrs C could sustainably repay the loans 
 not just whether she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having 
enough money to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mrs C was able 
to repay her loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without 
having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, 
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it 
follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and
thought about what this means for Mrs Cs complaint. I have not reviewed loans 7 to 9 in 
detail as Lending Stream has conceded in relation to these three loans.
Information from the Lending Stream records shows that Mrs C had declared an income of 
between £1,300 and £1,600 each month for the nine loan applications. The expenditure 
Mrs C had declared for each application was always much less than the income figure and 
so the disposable income ranged from £425 to £1,300 each month. So it would have 
appeared that Mrs C had enough money to afford the repayments which ranged from £39 to 
£91 each month. 
In addition, as the lending relationship progressed then Lending Stream was able to factor in 
Mrs Cs repayment history and I have seen from the loan agreements and the Statements of 
Account for each loan that all of them were repaid much earlier than the original schedule. 
The six month instalment repayments were often repaid in one or two months. And early 
repayments would have been noted by Lending Stream as being a positive factor for any 
future creditworthiness assessments. 
Lending Stream carried out a credit search before each loan was approved. We have had a 
summary of the results which are not entirely satisfactory because they are so brief, but it 
does appear that Lending Stream knew Mrs C had some adverse entries on that credit file  
such as a default for the first few loans (which likely would have been the same default 
registering for each loan application as they were close together), and some delinquent 
accounts. 
So I agree with our adjudicator that I think that Lending Stream carried out proportionate 
checks for loans 1 to 4, but at loan 5, when Mrs C was applying for the fifth loan in nine 
months then it ought to have made some further enquiries. 
One way to have done that would have been to ask for copy payslips, check on her 
expenditure and discover why it was she needed the loans. Another and convenient method 
would be to have reviewed copy bank account statements and I dont think Lending Stream 
did that. 
Mrs C has sent to us the copy bank account statements and from loan 5 and I have 
reviewed the month leading up to those applications through to early August 2020 and 
thought about what those statements would have revealed to Lending Stream if it had taken 
a closer look at Mrs Cs finances in 2020. 
I have seen that Mrs C had a credit facility which allowed her to draw on additional funds. 
And I have seen that Mrs C received child benefit payments. Ive seen that Mrs C also transferred money into and out from her savings accounts and had some credits into the 
account from a credit union.
But overall her account seems well managed and rarely went into overdraft and apart from 
Lending Stream and the credit facility (and credit union) she had I cannot see any other 
transactions such as payments to other high cost lenders which would have led Lending 
Stream to decide Mrs C was unable to afford the loans or to have refused the loans. 
So, I do not uphold Mrs Cs complaint about loans 1 to 6.
Loans 7 to 9 
Lending Stream has confirmed that the offer made in its FRL for loans 7 to 9 plus the 
removal of the loans from Mrs Cs credit file is still open to her. 
If Lending Stream has not already refunded Mrs C in line with that offer then it must do so. If 
it has already refunded Mrs C then I remind it that in the FRL Lending Stream said that it 
would remove loans 7 to 9 from Mrs Cs credit file. So that needs to be done too if not 
already done.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold the complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 August 2023.
