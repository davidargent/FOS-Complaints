DRN-1831660
The complaint
Mr W complains about the service that hes received from Eureka Leasing Limited in 
connection with a hire agreement for a car. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Eureka accepts that there have been some issues with the service that it has 
provided to Mr W so it upheld some parts of his complaint but said that hed suffered 
no material loss or damage so no redress would be offered to him;
the investigator considered each part of Mr Ws complaint in detail but concluded that 
Eureka didnt need to take any further action in response to his complaint;
Mr W says that the investigators conclusions are incorrect and that there have been 
oversights  but hes not explained what he considers to be incorrect or an oversight 
despite being asked to do so by the investigator;
there have clearly been issues with the relationship between Mr W and Eureka about 
the hire agreement and I can understand the upset and frustration that Mr W feels 
about those issues; 
Mr W signed the hire agreement with a third party in February 2019 and agreed to 
pay an initial rental of £1,500 and then 30 monthly payments of £399.98  but he 
says that he wants Eureka to either cancel the hire agreement and return his initial 
rental or to refund the difference between the amount that hes paying to hire this car 
and the lower cost that he says is available from other providers;
Mr W agreed to hire the car on the terms set out in the agreement and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the agreement was 
misrepresented or mis-sold to him by Eureka and the amount that Mr W is paying to 
rent the car is a commercial decision between him and the third party - this service 
wouldnt normally interfere with a commercial decision such as that and I see no 
reason to interfere with the commercial decision in these circumstances;
Im not persuaded that the service issues that Mr W has experienced have caused 
him a financial loss or that an award of compensation for the upset and frustration 
that he feels is justified in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Eureka to arrange for the agreement to be cancelled, to reimburse him for the any of 
the rental payments that hes made, to pay him any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 September 2020.
