K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains that Nationwide  Building Society  wont refund a cash withdrawal and retail 
transaction made with his debit card which he says he didnt make or authorise. Mr R also 
says Nationwide  unfairly placed a Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance  System  (CIFAS)  marker  
against his name. He wants Nationwide to remove the marker.  
background
Mr R had a current and savings account  with Nationwide.
current account
Mr R says that two fraudulent withdrawals totalling £2,204.86 were made from his 
Nationwide current account on 27 April 2018.  
The relevant  transaction  and online activity is:

app
On 27 April 2018 at 20:45 Mr R called Nationwide to say he didnt make the disputed 
transactions. And that he was at home  at the time they were carried  out. He told Nationwide  
that hed lost his bank  card. And that no one else knew his PIN. He couldnt provide any 
information about how his card was lost or stolen.
Ref: DRN56337222Nationwide investigated  and didnt accept Mr Rs disputed transaction  claim.  It said there 
was no evidence of fraudulent activity  and that Mr R had authorised  the transactions  or 
made them himself because:
Mr Rs genuine card and PIN was used for both disputed  transactions 
Mr R hadnt provided any explanation  as to how his bank card and PIN were 
compromised
additional identification was required for the £1,704.86 transaction  and a driving 
licence was provided
balance enquires  were carried out before  and after the disputed  transactions using 
Nationwides Touch ID mobile banking app 
the disputed  transactions  wouldve affected Mr Rs available  balance and took Mr R 
close to his overdraft  limit 
Mr R wouldve been aware  of the difference  in his available  balance  upon logging in 
to his mobile banking app
Mr R didnt report the fraudulent transactions until 20:45  on 27 April 2018
savings account
On 7 August  2018, £999.98 was credited  to Mr Rs Nationwide savings account. 
Following this at 16:10 £500 cash was withdrawn from the account using a cash  machine. 
And at 16:14  a £350 cash counter withdrawal was made  in a branch. On 8 August 2018, at 
09:36 £60 cash  was withdrawn from a cash machine. All three transactions were  made  using 
Mr Rs genuine card and PIN.
On 13 August 2018, Nationwide  were contacted by another  bank, which I will refer to as 
bank B. It said Mr R wasnt  entitled to the £999.98 payment made to his savings account  on 
7 August 2018.  
On 16 August 2018, Nationwide  spoke to Mr R about the payment.  During  the call 
Nationwide told Mr R that it had been  notified  by bank B that the funds  were  fraudulent.  Mr R 
didnt dispute  he wasnt entitled to the funds. And that hed spent the money. So Nationwide 
closed Mr Rs account and recorded a CIFAS marker against his name. Mr R didnt agree 
with Nationwides  decision. So he contacted  us and asked us to look into the disputed  
transactions on 18 April 2018 and the recording of the CIFAS marker. 
An investigator looked into Mr Rs complaint  but didnt uphold it. Having looked at the 
sequence of events, and Mr Rs online activity, he said it was more  likely than not Mr R 
authorised the disputed  transactions which were made on 27 April 2018. 
The investigator also asked Mr R some  additional questions about  the £999.98 payment 
made to his account in August 2018.  Mr R told the investigator  that the money was from the 
sale of goods  to a friend. The investigator  asked  Mr R to provide evidence  to support what  
hed said such as an invoice, and communications between him and his friend. But Mr R 
didnt provide anything. The investigator  noted  that Mr R hadnt provided  this explanation to 
Nationwide. And neither  had he disputed that he wasnt entitled to the funds when he spoke 
to Nationwide. So the investigator  said Nationwide hadnt  done anything wrong when it 
applied the CIFAS marker. 
Mr R didnt agree with the investigators view. He said he was at home at the time of the 
disputed transactions  on 27 April 2018,  which could  be verified by his online activity. So it 
Ref: DRN56337223wasnt him who carried out the transactions as he couldnt be in two places at once. And 
hes still upset Nationwide  recorded a CIFAS marker against his name. As no agreement 
could be reached  the complaint has come to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive decided not to 
uphold the complaint, for broadly the same reasons as the investigator.
disputed transactions
Nationwide is required to refund the amount of unauthorised transactions  if Mr R did not 
make or authorise them. The relevant regulations, to this effect, are the Payment Services  
Regulations 2017 (the PSRs 2017). Mr R says he didnt make  the point  of sale transaction 
and cash withdrawal. And hes seeking a refund of £2,204.86. So my primary concern is to 
come to a view about whether or not I think Mr R authorised the payments. 
Im satisfied from looking at Nationwides technical evidence that Mr Rs genuine  card and 
PIN were used to make the disputed  transactions on 27 April 2018. 
From looking  at the evidence, I dont  think  its unreasonable for Nationwide  to conclude  that 
Mr R authorised the transactions. I say this because:
Mr R says he hasnt disclosed his PIN to anyone one else.  And hasnt recorded it 
anywhere. So theres no convincing explanation for how an unknown third party  
would know Mr Rs PIN
Mr R hasnt offered any explanation  about  how his card was lost or stolen or how 
somebody else wouldve known  his PIN
additional photographic identification  was used to make  the £1,704.86  transaction 
Mr R hasnt disputed checking his account via Nationwides mobile  banking  app 
before and after the disputed transactions
Mr R didnt report the disputed transactions until several hours after the last disputed  
transaction yet I can see from Mr Rs account  activity that Mr R carried out balance 
enquires before and after the disputed transactions. So I find it unusual  that he didnt 
report the issue sooner 
even though Mr R says he was elsewhere  at the time of the disputed transactions, I 
havent seen any plausible explanation  as to how an unknown third party  couldve 
obtained his card and PIN without Mr Rs authority
So when I weigh everything up, I think its more  likely than not that Mr R authorised the 
transactions. I therefore think its fair and reasonable for Nationwide  to refuse him a refund  of 
the disputed transactions.
CIFAS marker
Ref: DRN56337224Nationwide says it applied  the CIFAS marker  because Mr R received fraudulent funds into 
his account. So Ive looked at whether  Nationwide  was fair to apply the marker, based  on the 
evidence it had, and the investigation  it carried out. And what  the rules say about applying 
such markers.
Having reviewed Mr Rs account  of events and the evidence Nationwide  provided,  Im 
satisfied that Nationwide have sufficient evidence  for the CIFAS marker  to be recorded  
against Mr Rs name.  In coming  to this view, Ive taken into account the following reasons:
Nationwide have  provided evidence to show the inward payment received on 
7 August 2018  was fraudulent
Mr R had an opportunity to alert Nationwide  hed received fraudulent  funds. But he 
benefited from the funds by making  cash withdrawals
Mr R didnt dispute the funds were  fraudulent  when he spoke to Nationwide  on 
16 August 2018  about the closure  of his account
Mr R provided  a different explanation to our investigator about  the source of the 
funds. But he hasnt  provided any evidence to support  this
Taking everything into account,  I find that Nationwide have met the burden of proof  required 
by CIFAS to add the marker.  So I think  its fair that it reported Mr R to CIFAS. And Im not 
going to ask Nationwide to remove the marker. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 September  2019.
