K821x#15complaint
Mrs H has complained NewDay  Ltd dealt with her fraud case  poorly.
background
In November 2017 Mrs H applied for a Debenhams card from NewDay. She was then away  
for a bit and when  she got back,  hadnt received her card nor PIN from them. She phoned to 
ask where these were. She was kept on the phone for a while but eventually told the card 
had already been activated and used. But NewDay would investigate  and get back  to her.
Mrs H received a statement in January for the fraudulent use of the card,  along  with a late 
payment fee. She called to see whether this could be put right.  Mrs H was upset at the 
implication she must  have used the card herself and needed to pay the bill. She wrote  to 
complain. She then received two letters from NewDay telling her they were  investigating  but 
nothing further.
Mrs H brought her complaint to the ombudsman service. NewDay gave Mrs H their final 
response. They accepted  the fraudulent transactions werent hers and wouldnt be asking 
her to pay for them. They paid her £20 in compensation for the delay in sorting out the 
problems shed had.
Mrs H remained  unhappy with this outcome  so wanted us to continue looking into her 
complaint. Our investigator felt the evidence was clear cut. NewDay admitted the fraudulent 
transactions werent Mrs Hs but it had taken them more than four months  to sort things out. 
She didnt  think £20 compensation was sufficient.  She asked NewDay  to pay Mrs H a further 
£50.
NewDay declined to do this. Mrs Hs complaint has been referred  to an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached roughly the 
same conclusion but am increasing the compensation on offer. Ill explain why.
Firstly theres  no debate here around  the fraudulent transactions. NewDay has accepted 
Mrs H never  received the card and PIN she applied for. Someone else intercepted  these and 
used them to make  fraudulent  cash withdrawals and a retail  transaction.  
The issue  Im considering is whether £20 is enough  compensation for the distress caused  by 
the delay in NewDay sorting  this out. And its hard to come to the conclusion that NewDay 
has treated Mrs H properly.
Mrs H contacted NewDay on 4 and 13 December 2017. Firstly to query where her card was 
and then to see what had happened  to the investigation. On the second  occasion NewDays  
staff member was concerned that Mrs H wasnt the genuine customer. Which seems  ironic.
On 22 January 2018 Mrs H phoned  NewDay again.  She was advised  to maintain minimum 
payments to her account whilst the fraud investigation continued. On 24 January NewDay 
credited all the fraudulent payments back to Mrs Hs account in line with regulations  covering 
what happens once  customers  report fraud.
Ref: DRN01953082Whilst Mrs H then wrote to NewDay on 28 January, she didnt receive anything from them. 
They did send her a final response in April 2018 but she never received this. NewDay  has 
told us theyre uncomfortable  confirming the outcome of a fraud investigation  by letter  as 
they felt the statement confirmed the outcome. They also told us Mrs H hadnt called them 
back as requested.
Mrs H has been unable  to open  the statements NewDay send her by email.  As shes  never 
had a replacement  card, she doesnt know the expiry date.  This information is needed to 
access her account statements.
It seems  to me Mrs H had to do all the running  here. I appreciate NewDays  concern about  
putting the outcome in writing but I dont think its fair to expect Mrs H to keep calling them. 
Whilst I agree NewDay arent  obliged  to tell Mrs H exactly  what  happened, I think it would 
have been fairer on her  particularly as she had genuine concerns about  being a victim of 
fraud and the potential  impact on her credit  record   to let her know what the outcome of 
their investigation  was.
Our investigator also noted originally NewDay asked Mrs H to continue  to make  minimum 
payments to her account. This was incorrect advice. Once a fraud is being investigated, the 
customer should be refunded the disputed funds in line with the Payment Services 
Regulations. Although NewDay eventually did this, they didnt do this immediately.
Our investigator awarded Mrs H an additional  £50. I was surprised NewDay didnt just 
accept this outcome   particularly as by that time Mrs Hs complaint had been open for over 
a year.  I contacted NewDay again  to see whether  theyd accept this outcome  but got no 
response. But in fact having thought about this afresh, I think an additional £100 would be 
the right amount to reflect the additional  distress caused to Mrs H by NewDays actions.
I know originally NewDay credited Mrs Hs Debenhams account  with £20, I think  its unlikely 
Mrs H will ever want to use this account and just wants  it closed  and done  with. NewDay  will 
need to contact Mrs H to pay her £120  in total either  by automated  payment to her account 
or by cheque, whatever  she prefers.
I note our investigator was able to confirm no adverse data had been placed on Mrs Hs 
credit record  about this account.  Once  this account is closed, I suggest NewDay  remove all 
data about the account  from Mrs Hs record.
Ref: DRN01953083my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is to instruct  NewDay  Ltd to:
remove any data from Mrs Hs credit record about the Debenhams account; and
pay Mrs H a total of £120 compensation to put things right.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 December 2019.
