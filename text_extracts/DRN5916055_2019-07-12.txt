K821x#15complaint
Miss R complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in the provisional decision I issued in 
May 2019. An extract from this is attached and forms  part of this final decision, so I will not 
repeat that information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to uphold some of the complaint. 
I invited both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. Miss R has not 
provided us with anything further. QuickQuid provided us with some comments. Although 
I am only summarising here what QuickQuid has said, I have  considered its entire response 
carefully before writing  this decision.
QuickQuid has said that Miss R taking top-ups on her later loans  doesnt  in itself 
demonstrate she was dependent on short term lending   the amounts it lent to her remained 
relatively stable. And Miss R had a sound  repayment record  that QuickQuid took into 
account when  deciding whether to agree the loans.  QuickQuid  doesnt agree that I should 
decide any loans  were unsustainable  without  evidence  that Miss R was struggling to honour 
her loan repayments.
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I cant agree  that the simple fact a consumer has made their loan repayments  on time is a 
clear indicator that they werent  facing problems managing their finances.  Those  loan 
repayments could  be made by a number of, unsustainable, methods including borrowing 
from other lenders.  And as I said in my provisional decision I think there may come  a point in 
a lending relationship where the history  and pattern of lending  itself clearly  demonstrates  
that the lending was unsustainable.
I remain of the opinion that this point was reached  in Miss Rs relationship  with QuickQuid 
when she asked for her fourth loan. So I dont think it necessary to forensically examine her 
bank statements from that time.  I think the very fact that Miss R used credit, that was 
specifically intended  for short term use, over such a prolonged period is in itself evidence  of 
the problems she was having managing her money  and the unsustainable nature of her 
borrowing.
It follows that I uphold  the complaint about  loans 4 and 5 and QuickQuid should put things 
right.
Ref: DRN59160552putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Miss R after, and including, the loan 
that she took on 12 March 2018  (loan  4). So for both of those loans QuickQuid should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken from loan 4 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  4 and 5 should be removed  from Miss Rs 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss R a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold some of Miss Rs complaint and direct CashEuroNet UK 
LLC to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 August 2019.

complaint
Miss R complains  that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) lent to her in an irresponsible 
manner.
background
Miss R was given five loans by QuickQuid between  July 2017  and May 2018.  Miss R topped-up  
three of her loans by taking some additional borrowing  shortly after the initial  loan. She needed  to 
defer her repayments on some of the loans  by paying  some additional  interest. And Miss R was late 
making some of her repayments, on loans 1 and 2. But all her loans  have been  fully repaid. 
A summary  of Miss Rs borrowing from QuickQuid is as follows;
Loan 
NumberBorrowing  Date Repayment DateLoan Amount  
(inc Top-Ups)
1 13/07/2017 29/09/2017 £ 150
2 02/10/2017 01/12/2017 £ 400
3 17/12/2017 08/02/2018 £ 150
4 12/03/2018 30/04/2018 £ 400
5 01/05/2018 31/07/2018 £ 500
Miss Rs complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. She thought that it had been 
reasonable for QuickQuid  to give the first two loans to Miss R. But she didnt think QuickQuid should  
have agreed  the remainder of the lending. So she asked QuickQuid to pay Miss R some 
compensation.
QuickQuid didnt agree  with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved informally,  it 
has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure that Miss R could  repay the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different  things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
Ref: DRN59160554the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish whether  
Miss R could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being  without undue  
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting  
other reasonable  commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. And it 
follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont 
be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments 
without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Miss Rs complaint.
Miss R appears to have  faced  some problems repaying her first two loans. She needed to defer the 
repayment of her first loan by a month and so paid some additional interest. And QuickQuid charged 
her a late payment  fee on both loans  1 and 2. So I think QuickQuid should have  taken great care to 
make sure that Miss R wasnt having problems  managing her finances.
QuickQuid has said that Miss Rs repayments were late because she had a new debit card. And when 
this card was updated on its systems Miss Rs payments were made  straight away.  So it says this 
isnt indicative of any financial problems.  On balance I think QuickQuid  did enough  here to reassure 
itself that, at that time, the late payments didnt indicate that Miss R wasnt in financial  distress.
So at the time of the first three loans, taking  account  of the amount Miss R was borrowing, what  was 
apparent about her circumstances at the time, and her history with the lender,  I dont think it wouldve 
been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask her for the amount of information  that would be needed to 
show the lending  was unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything in the information Miss R provided or the information QuickQuid  shouldve 
been aware  of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what she was saying.  
But looking  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids  lending  history with Miss R I think by loan 4 the 
lender should reasonably have  seen  that further lending  was unsustainable,  or otherwise  harmful. 
And so QuickQuid should have  realised that it shouldnt provide any further loans.  
I say this because:
Although there  had been a gap of just over a month between Miss R repaying loan 3 and 
asking to borrow again,  I dont think it would have been reasonable  for QuickQuid to conclude  
this was any indication that Miss Rs finances had moved on from whatever situation  had 
required her previous loans. 
By the time Miss R asked for loan 4 shed been borrowing from QuickQuid for a lengthy 
period and she wasnt making  any inroads to the amount  she owed the lender. By then 
Miss R had paid a considerable amount of interest to QuickQuid to effectively service a debt 
over an extended period.
Ref: DRN59160555When she repaid  loan 4, Miss R was given a new loan on the following day. A week later she 
topped that loan up, making this borrowing the highest  she had taken  to date. So QuickQuid 
ought to have realised it was more  likely than not Miss R was having to borrow further to 
cover the hole repaying her previous  loan was leaving  in her finances and that Miss Rs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
I think  that Miss R lost out because  QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Miss Rs indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number of loans  was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Rs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost  loans.
So Im intending to uphold  the complaint about loans  4 and 5 and QuickQuid should put things right.
