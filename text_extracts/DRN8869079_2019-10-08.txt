K821x#15complaint
Miss C complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent money to 
her that she couldnt  afford to repay.
background
Based on the information provided, Sunny provided Miss C with 26 loans between June 
2015 and August 2018.
Details of the first 10 loans are as follows:
Loan Date Repaid Instalments Amount
1 13/06/2015 02/08/2015 6 £200.00
2 11/07/2015 02/08/2015 6 £600.00
3 24/07/2015 02/08/2015 6 £100.00
4 17/09/2015 07/11/2015 6 £150.00
5 25/09/2015 07/11/2015 6 £50.00
6 14/10/2015 07/11/2015 6 £150.00
7 17/11/2015 19/12/2015 6 £100.00
8 25/11/2015 07/02/2016 6 £100.00
9 08/12/2015 06/02/2016 6 £150.00
10 08/01/2016 02/03/2016 6 £100.00
Miss C then took out a further  16 loans  with Sunny between  February  2016  and August 
2018.
Miss C says that the loans were unaffordable  and that she had to take out new loans  in 
order to make her repayments. She says other lenders wouldnt provide her with loans but 
Sunny kept on lending  to her. She says it was unclear to her the negative impact the loans 
would have on her credit file. 
Sunny says that before the loans were  provided  creditworthiness and affordability checks 
were carried  out. It also considered how Miss C was managing her other debts. It says that 
based on the information it received it was considered responsible  to lend to her. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think he had enough  to say that loans one to five shouldnt  have been 
lent. However, by the time of loan six was provided  he thought that Miss Cs overall pattern 
of borrowing  showed  she was persistently reliant  on short-term loans. He noted that there 
was a break in the lending between loans 17 and 18 given Miss Cs borrowing history he 
didnt think this was sufficient to break the lending chain. He recommended  that Miss Cs 
complaint be upheld in regard to loans six to 26. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Ref: DRN88690792Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Miss C 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower  a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss C could  sustainably repay  her loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Cs complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think there  was enough evidence to say that the first five loans 
shouldnt have been provided. I agree with this. 
However by the time loan six was provided  I think that Sunny should have been concerned 
about how Miss C was managing her money  and that she might have become dependent on 
short term borrowing. I say this because  the loan was Miss Cs sixth in around  four months. 
She was taking out new loans before previous  loans  had been repaid and the amount she 
borrowed wasnt significantly reducing and didnt over the rest of her borrowing.
There was a gap between loans 17 and 18 being  provided but given Miss Cs history  of 
borrowing I dont think, in this case, that this was enough to say that the lending chain had 
been broken.
Based on the above I uphold this complaint in regard to loans 6 to 26. 
Ref: DRN88690793my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans  six to 26. Elevate Credit 
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should: 
A)add together  the total of the repayments made  by Miss C towards interest,  fees and 
charges on loans six to 26, including payments made to a third party  where 
applicable, but not including  anything that has already  been  refunded.
B)calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Miss C which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Miss C originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C)pay Miss C the total of "A" plus "B".
D)the overall pattern of Miss Cs borrowing  for loans six to 26 means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so any information  about  these  loans should  be 
removed from Miss Cs credit  file. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny) to 
take off tax from this interest. It must give Miss C a certificate showing how much tax its 
taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 November  2019.
