complaint
Miss M complained through  third party about five loans CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading as 
QuickQuid). She has said QuickQuid lent to her when she couldnt afford to repay the loans.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in February 2019 and because I was reaching 
a different conclusion to the adjudicator, I gave both parties an opportunity  to provide  further  
comments before I reached a final decision.
In my provisional decision I set out in some detail the background to this complaint. Ive 
attached my provisional  decision  here as an appendix to this final decision.  The information 
QuickQuid provided  shows that it lent Miss M five loans between February 2012 and August 
2014. The loan amounts  varied from £100 to £950  and Miss M has repaid all her loans.
In my provisional decision,  I concluded  that QuickQuids checks  for loans 4a and 5 went  far 
enough but it should have  done more before agreeing to lend loans 1 to 3, 4b and 4c. And had 
QuickQuid carried out what  I consider to be reasonable checks its likely to have found that 
Miss M couldnt afford  loan 4c and wouldnt  have  lent it her.
Miss M accepted my provisional  decision but QuickQuid has provided  further  comments. In 
summary, QuickQuid has said:
It still believes its checks went far enough and it relied on information from third party  
agencies when  making its lending decisions.
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) didnt require a record of the consumers expenses  nor 
were they required  to get bank statements. And Miss M may not have provided  this 
information if it asked  and so it was reasonable for it to rely on what Miss M told it when 
deciding to lend.
Miss M had a strong  repayment history  and didnt incur any late payments which 
suggest the loans were  affordable  for her.
There were  breaks in lending between some  of the loans.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
QuickQuid needed  to carry out proportionate  checks to see that Miss M could sustainably 
afford to make her loan repayments  before agreeing  to lend.  Its checks  needed  to be 
customer focussed and could take into account things like the size and length of the loan 
and what it knew about the customer.
I agree  with QuickQuid  that the relevant regulations at the time of the loans werent  
prescriptive and there was no requirement  for it to obtain bank statements but it had to 
show that at the time it decided to lend,  it took reasonable steps to satisfy itself that Miss M 
was able to sustainably afford to repay  each  loan.
Ref: DRN8909925I used Miss Ms bank statement from the time of the loans to reconstruct her likely 
circumstances but Im not suggesting QuickQuid had to request bank statements. It couldve 
requested her pay slips or utility  bills for example. Of course,  I accept different checks might 
show different things. And just because something shows  up in the information  Miss M has 
provided, doesnt mean it wouldve  shown up in any checks QuickQuid mightve carried  out. 
But in the absence of anything else from QuickQuid,  I think its perfectly  fair and reasonable to 
place considerable weight  on it as an indication of what  Miss Ms financial circumstances were 
likely to have been at the time.
Given QuickQuid insists  that Miss Ms loans were responsibly lent, it ought  to know  and have 
explained  how it interpreted the information it gathered from third party agencies and how it 
led to a responsible  lending  decision being  made  in this specific case.  Without this explanation  
from QuickQuid, I cant  take it as read that this lending decision was fair. Id also point out that 
the use of industry  standard software  isnt in itself demonstrative of the fact that the lending 
decision was fair. 
From loan 1 onwards, I dont consider that QuickQuid took reasonable steps to satisfy itself 
that Miss M could sustainably afford  to repay  the loans. Taking into account  the repayment  
amount she had to make  compared to her declared  income. I think  there  was enough  within 
her known financial circumstances for QuickQuid  to be concerned about the affordability of 
loans 1 to 3, 4b and 4c. The circumstances  of these loans were  such  that QuickQuid needed to 
do more than it did for all the loans  in question,  I think  its reasonable for QuickQuid to have 
wanted to know  about what Miss Ms normal living costs were or at least get some idea of what  
reasonable financial commitments  she had that impacted her income. I cant  see that it did that 
here and I dont consider that it was reasonable in these circumstances to make the lending  
decisions without considering her living costs and regular  credit commitments.  And by the time 
of loan 4c, QuickQuid shouldve been looking the verify the information provided as Miss M 
was returning  for additional borrowing for second time on loan 4 without repaying any of the 
capital from the previous  advances.
And a detailed look at Miss Ms circumstances before agreeing to lend loan 4c would likely 
have shown QuickQuid  that she couldnt sustainably afford  the loan repayment. The fact that 
Miss M managed to repay the loans doesnt mean  she did so sustainably.  And as a responsible 
lender, it wouldnt  have given her the loan.
In my provisional decision,  I did consider  the breaks  that QuickQuid referred to and said that:
There  are number of gaps  around six months between some  of Miss Ms loans. Ive 
carefully considered  these  gaps and I think they were sufficient to lead QuickQuid to believe 
that Miss Ms circumstances may have changed  and that she may not have been  dependent 
on this type of borrowing.
 
I agreed that the gaps between loans 1 and 2, 3 and 4 and between the repayment of all of the 
borrowing on loan 4 and when the flex credit account started were significant  enough  to break  
the lending chain and I took those into account  when considering Miss Ms complaint.  But 
overall for the reasons  stated above and in my provisional decision, I still consider  that Miss M 
shouldnt have been given loan 4c and she has lost out as a result  of being given this loan. And 
QuickQuid needs  to put things right.
putting things right
QuickQuid needs:
 refund  all interest and charges Miss M paid on loan 4c taken on 21 December 2013;
 pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
 remove any negative information  about loan 4c from Miss Ms credit file;
* HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
Ref: DRN8909925must give Miss M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Miss Ms complaint in part and require CashEuroNet  UK LLC to put things right as 
stated above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 April 2019.

Provisional decision
complaint
Miss M has complained through  a third party about five loans CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as 
QuickQuid) lent to her. She has said that QuickQuid was lending to her when  she couldnt afford to 
repay.
background
Miss M took out four payday  loans and one flex credit  from QuickQuid between  February
2012 and August  2014.  From the information QuickQuid has provided, the loans were as follows:
loan number date taken Amount date repaid
1 08/02/12 £300 01/06/12
2 24/12/12 £200 05/02/13
3 16/08/13 £350 05/09/13
4a 08/12/13 £150 05/02/14
4b 13/12/13 £100 05/02/14
4c 21/12/13 £350 05/02/14
5 09/08/14 £950 05/11/14
Miss M topped  up her borrowing on loan 4 twice and although she could draw down up to
£950 on her flex credit  (loan 5) she only borrowed £100 from the facility. Miss M has now fully 
repaid all her loans.
When she complained to QuickQuid, it didnt uphold  her complaint.  It said from the checks  it carried out 
before lending to her were  sufficient and there was nothing  to suggest she was unable  to afford the 
loans.
Unhappy with QuickQuids response, Miss Ms representative referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our adjudicators looked at her complaint and said they didnt  think any of the checks  QuickQuid 
carried out were sufficient.  Our adjudicator thought sufficient checks would have shown QuickQuid that 
loans 1 and 4c were unaffordable for Miss M  and recommended that the complaint  about those  loans 
should be upheld.
QuickQuid partially  agreed with the adjudicators assessment, it said it thought  loan 1 was affordable  
and agreed  to refund  interest  and charges Miss M paid towards  loan 4c.
This complaint wasnt resolved and so it has come to me  an ombudsman to make a decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant  regulatory rules and 
good industry practice at the time the loans  were offered.
QuickQuid needed to carry out proportionate checks to see that Miss M could  sustainably afford to 
make her loan repayments before agreeing to lend. Its checks needed to be customer focussed  and 
could take into account  things like the size and length of the loan and what  it knew about  the 
customer.
Ref: DRN8909925There are number  of gaps  around six months between  some of Miss Ms loans. Ive carefully 
considered these gaps and I think they were sufficient to lead QuickQuid to believe that Miss Ms 
circumstances may have  changed and that she may not have been dependent on this type of 
borrowing.
QuickQuid has told us what  checks it carried  out. It has said it searched Miss Ms credit file before 
lending most  of the loans to her. QuickQuid  hasnt provided the full results of its search  and from what  
I can see from the credit file Miss M provided, there were no defaults or county  court judgements  
(CCJs) recorded on her file at the time of the loans.
QuickQuid also said it asked Miss M for her income  and before lending loan 5, it asked her for her 
regular expenses as well. QuickQuid has recorded Miss Ms income as £1,500 for all her loans and her 
regular expenses before  agreeing to lend loan 5 was recorded as a total of
£425. This included;
housing - £150
utilities - £150
transport - £50
food - £50
other expenses - £25
Having carefully considered what check QuickQuid has told us it carried out, I dont think the checks  
went far enough for loans  1, 2, 3, 4b and 4c, Ill explain why below.
Miss Ms first loan was for £300 which  she was due to repay in two instalments with a maximum  
repayment of around £388.50. This maximum  repayment  formed  more  than a quarter of Miss Ms 
recorded income  and I think this was a large part of her income.  Given this, I think  it would have 
been reasonable for QuickQuid to check her regular  monthly expenses  as well.
There was a six month gap between when Miss M repaid  loan 1 and when she took out loan
2. I can see that Miss M struggled to repay loan 1 and rolled it over twice  before making a
full repayment in June 2012. She asked  for loan 2 in December 2012  the loan amount was
£200 and including interest, Miss M had to repay around £259.  Again, I think  QuickQuid should have 
been asking Miss M about  her regular monthly expenses before lending  to her.
Although her income remained the same and the amount  she was borrowing  was lower than loan 1, it 
was still around 20% of her recorded income  at the time.
Miss M repaid loan 2 in February 2013 and in August 2013, she took out loan 3 for £350. For loan 3, 
she had to repay £453.25. This was a significant amount compared to Miss Ms income and before 
lending to her QuickQuid should have been looking to understand a bit more  about her normal living 
costs and any other payments she might have had pending
and was due to repay at the same time as this loan.
Miss M requested loan 4 in December 2013 for £150, I think given the low amount, QuickQuids  
checks went  far enough.  However, five days later she asked  to top-up the loan without making any 
repayments on the outstanding  capital. QuickQuid approved another
£100 which meant  that including interest Miss M now had to repay around £323,  I think by the stage,  
QuickQuid should have been checking her regular  expenses as well before agreeing this top-up. Nine 
days later, Miss M asked to top-up the loan again, this time QuickQuid lent her £350. Miss M hadnt 
repaid any of the outstanding capital from loans 4a and 4b and so by loan 4c, she was due to repay 
around £770   more than half of her declared income. This should have concerned QuickQuid.
Ref: DRN8909925Given the fact that Miss M was coming  back to borrow more within only a few days between the loans 
and that she hadnt  repaid any of the outstanding capital, QuickQuid  should have done more before 
lending loan 4c. I think by this stage, it should have been looking to get a clearer picture of her 
financial circumstances before agreeing  to lend. Beyond her regular monthly  expenses, it needed to 
check that there  wasnt  anything else she needed to pay when she was due to make her repayments 
for this loan such as other short-term loans, for example. And it ought to have asked her for some 
independent verification  of her income and expenses to satisfy itself that meeting  this loan repayment 
wasnt going to cause her difficulty.
Looking at loan 5, I think QuickQuids checks went far enough. By the time of this loan, Miss M hadnt 
borrowed from QuickQuid  for around six months. In addition to the credit search and income check, it 
also checked  Miss Ms regular expenses which  she declared as
£425. This suggested that Miss M had more than £1,000 left over in which she could comfortably 
repay the maximum amount  of £305  had she drawn down the maximum limit of £950 from her flex 
credit account.
what would sufficient  checks had shown?
Sufficient checks before lending loan 1 would likely have shown that Miss M could afford  to repay this 
loan, having tried to understand  Miss M circumstances  at the time of this loan, using her bank 
statements and credit  file, I can see that her regular  expenses  including  living costs and regular 
credit commitments around that time were around £889. Taking into account  her declared  income of 
around £1,500, Miss M had sufficient disposable income to repay this loan.
Miss M was in a similar position when  she took loan 2, her regular expenses were around
£668 and her income  remained around £1,500. From this, she had sufficient  disposable income to 
comfortably make the loan repayment of around £259.
By loan 3, I can see that Miss Ms regular living expenses appear to have  reduced to around
£474 but she was borrowing  from other short term lenders around this time. I can see that shed  
repaid around £500 to another short term lender and she had recently  borrowed around £385 from 
another lender  which was still outstanding at the time of this loan. Taking this into account,  I think  
Miss M was also in a position to comfortably repay this loan. It looks like after she repaid this loan,  
she would have been left with a sufficient  amount  of disposable income.
At the time Miss M took out loan 4b, her regular  monthly expenses were  around £855, her recorded 
income remained around £1,500. For loan 4b, she had to repay around £324 and from what I can see, 
Miss M was in a position to sustainably afford  to repay this loan.
However, a more detailed look into Miss Ms circumstances and had QuickQuid verified some of the 
information provided  before lending  loan 4c, its likely to have found that she was unable to afford  this 
loan. QuickQuid is likely to seen that Miss Ms regular  monthly  expenses  were  similar to what they 
were when she took loan 4b however, her income  was lower - around £1,397. The loan repayment 
was around £770 and represented more than half of her income. In these circumstances she couldnt 
afford to sustainably  repay this loan. 
Although I think QuickQuid  wasnt wrong  to lend Miss M loans 1 to 4b, I dont think  it should have lent 
loan 4c to her.
Ref: DRN8909925K821x#15putting things right
I think QuickQuid did something wrong  by lending Miss M loan 4c and she has lost out as a result.  
So to put things right, QuickQuid should:
refund all interest and charges Miss M paid on loan 4c taken  on 21 December 2013;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date they 
were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information about loan 4c from Miss Ms credit file;
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must  
give Miss M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
