K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that Stagemount Limited  (trading as Quidmarket) did insufficient checks 
before lending to him and the loans were unaffordable.
background
Mr C had ten loans  and rollovers from Quidmarket between May 2012 and February 2013 as 
follows:
Loan Date Amount Scheduled Repayment Repaid Status
1 9 May 2012 £150 29 May 2012 £192.75 £192.75 On time
2 13 Jun 2012 £200 28 Jun 2012 £257.00 £67 Rolled over

4 21 Dec 2012 £325 28 Jan 2013 £451.39 £136.39 Rolled over
4a 28 Jan 2013 £315 28 Feb 2013 £421.38 £116.38 Rolled over
4b 28 Feb 2013 £305 28 Mar 2013 £421.89 to pay
Mr C says the loans  were unaffordable and trapped him into a debt spiral. He says better  
checks and the number of rollovers should have indicated  he was in financial difficulties.
Quidmarket says it asked  Mr C for information about  his status, job, income and expenditure 
before approving the first loan. It also checked his employment  and bank details and carried  
out a credit search.  It says the first loan was approved based on the information  provided 
and that Mr C repaid  it in full on the due date.
A further  credit check was undertaken before approving loan 2 and Quidmarket says the 
only loan showing on Mr Cs credit file was the Quidmarket one hed recently repaid. On that 
basis, it says,  it approved Mr Cs second  loan and Mr C chose to roll it over four times before 
repaying it in October 2012.
Quidmarket says Mr C revised  his income  figure  upwards  when he applied for loan 3 and a 
credit check  revealed other  outstanding loans of £401. However, it says it took into account 
his repayment  history, the gap in borrowing  and the fact he was living with his parents before  
deciding the loan was affordable to him. Mr C repaid  this loan three  days early.
Mr Cs circumstances remained unchanged at the time of his fourth loan application, and 
Quidmarket was satisfied  the repayment was covered by his disposable income. It says Mr 
C chose to roll over this loan twice  before  contacting Quidmarket on 28 March 2013 to 
advise that a debt management company (DMC) was dealing with his debts.
Quidmarket says it received 13 monthly  payments of £11.98 between August 2013 and 
September 2014, but nothing after that date.
Quidmarket says it was entitled to rely on the information provided by Mr C and it was 
reasonable for it to have found  all the loans to be affordable. It added that Mr C stated on 
every application  that he was not in financial difficulty  and there was no available  evidence  
that indicated  anything different.
Ref: DRN87992322Our investigator recommended the complaint  should be upheld in part. He wasnt satisfied 
that Quidmarket had done enough  checks before it approved any of the loans, but found, 
had it done so, it was still likely to have found  loans 1 and 2 to be affordable. However,  our 
investigator found that Mr C owed  over £2,000 to other short-term loan providers at the time 
he took out loans 3 and 4 from Quidmarket. So he considered it would not have approved  
these loans if it had done proportionate checks at the time. He recommended  that 
Quidmarket should  refund the interest  charges  on these loans (plus 8% statutory interest) 
and remove any associated negative  information from Mr Cs credit file.
Quidmarket responded  to say, in summary, that it did ask Mr C for expenditure information 
and provided evidence in support of this. It maintained that it was entitled  to rely on the 
information provided by Mr C and that its checks were proportionate based on the 
information available at the time.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Quidmarket was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks to make sure Mr 
C could afford to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr C was borrowing, and his lending  history.  But 
there was no set list of checks Quidmarket  had to do.
Loans 1 and 2
When Mr C applied for these loans he told Quidmarket that his income  was £1,300.  As the 
scheduled repayments were a significant proportion of this, Id have  expected Quidmarket to 
have checked  his regular expenditure too. Quidmarket says it did this, although it no longer 
has this information  due to a system change. However, its now provided a note from the 
underwriter which says Mr Cs disposable income was £1,200. As Mr C lived at home  with 
his parents at the time, Im satisfied this was reasonable and that Quidmarket was entitled to 
rely on this information.
So I cant conclude Quidmarket was wrong  to approve loans 1 or 2.
Loan 3
By the time Mr C applied  for loan 3, Mr C had rolled over his second loan four times before 
repaying it. Because of this, the fact that this was his third loan in relatively quick  succession, 
and the scheduled repayment  was over £350,  Id have expected Quidmarket  to have asked 
Mr C about other short-term loans. I accept  Mr C said his income was now £2,500,  and 
Quidmarkets credit check revealed outstanding loans of £401,  but I cant see that it 
specifically asked Mr C about  short-term loans.
Ive had a look at Mr Cs bank statements to see what  Quidmarket is likely  to have found had 
it done so. At the same time as the repayment  on loan 3 was due, Mr C needed to make  
payments to seven other short-term loan companies  totalling over £1,800. Given that I can 
also see regular expenditure on rent, food and travel of at least £600  per month, I dont  find 
loan 3 was affordable to Mr C.
Ref: DRN87992323Loan 4
Loan 4 was higher still and, as he took it out the same day he repaid  loan 3, I again consider 
Quidmarket should  have specifically looked into other short-term  loans. Mr C again  declared 
his income to be £2,500 and, with regular expenditure of at least £600, this left him with a 
maximum of £1,900 of disposable income.
But Mr C was still reliant on other short-term lending and, in January 2013, he needed to 
make payments totalling over £3,000 to eight other lenders at the same time his Quidmarket 
repayment was due. Therefore I find Quidmarket was also wrong to approve Mr Cs fourth  
loan.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Stagemount Limited (trading as Quidmarket) 
should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr C paid on loans 3 and 4 and associated  
rollovers;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loan 4, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr C; 
Remove any negative  information about loans 3 and 4 from Mr Cs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Quidmarket  to take off tax from this interest. Quidmarket  
must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If 
Quidmarket intends  to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance,  it must do 
so after deducting  the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 March 2019.
