The complaint
Ms B complains that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) applied a default
to her loan account.
What happened
Ms B says 118 118 Money applied a default to her account even though she had a good
repayment record, was almost at the end of her loan and her difficulties were caused by the
pandemic. She says she was reliant on the governments self-employment grants at the time
and, because she was temporarily living at a different address, she did not receive the
default notice and no attempt was made to contact her on the phone.
Ms B says she requested a breathing space at the end of 2020 but did not realise this ended
at the end of January 2021 and was surprised a default notice was issued on 5 Feb 2021.
She adds that she only found the notice on her return home but says that 118 118 Money
told her the default could not be removed even though she had a repayment plan in place.
Ms B says she had tried to keep in contact to ensure her financial standing wasnt affected
long-term, but the default is negatively impacting her attempts to grow her business following
the pandemic.
118 118 Money says it told Ms B that having a repayment plan in place does not prevent a
default being applied. It says the default notice gave Ms B until 26 Feb 2021 to remedy the
account which was £830.97 in arrears. It adds that her repayment plan, of £40 per month,
would have added further arrears of £236.99 each month and was in place until 31 August
2021. 118 118 Money says that this made it much harder for Ms B to bring the account up to
date by the end of the loan term on 28 June 2021 and so it was satisfied the default was
correctly applied.
Our investigator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. She found that 
118 118 Money correctly issued a default notice following Ms Bs 60-day breathing space. 
She said that as Ms B did not repay the arrears, or resume contractual repayments, our 
investigator found 118 118 Money did nothing wrong by defaulting the account.
Ms B responded to say, in summary, that:
118 118 Money did not act fairly by requiring the repayment of the entire 
arrears within one month of being given a breathing space;
She explained that her expenditure exceeded her income at the time but 
was confident shed be able to earn money again once restrictions were 
lifted;
She could not respond to the default notice as she was not at home at the time;
A default should only be used as a last resort and she was not given adequate time 
to make payments.
Provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Ms B and to 118 118 Money on 29 September 2022. Ive 
summarised my findings below:
I couldnt see 118 118 Money did anything wrong by issuing a default notice when it 
did:
oWhen Ms B missed three payments it would have triggered 118 118 Moneys 
standard processes;
oIt appeared that Ms B was aware of the default notice before its expiry;
oThe contractual payment on 26 February 2021 wasnt enough to meet the 
terms of the default notice;
I found that Ms B received misleading information during the call on 3 March 2021 
when she was told a default could be avoided after the default had been applied;
I explained that even if I were to suggest that 118 118 Money should remove the 
default, I didnt think this would have avoided it being applied later than it was. I said 
this as Ms B did not keep up with the payments on her repayment plan anyway;
oAs a default stays on a credit file for six years, it would be detrimental to Ms B 
for the default to now apply from a later date as it would stay on her credit file 
for longer.
I did not uphold Ms Bs complaint about the default being incorrectly applied, however I did 
find she was given misleading and confusing information by 118 118 Money. As I found 
Ms B was told she was preventing a default being applied to her account when she entered 
into the repayment plan, I have no doubt this caused significant stress and anxiety when she 
discovered this not to be the case. For this I considered 118 118 Money should pay Ms B 
£100.
118 118 Money responded to accept the provisional decision.
Ms B did not respond to the provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As 118 118 Money accepted my provisional decision and neither party provided any 
additional information, I see no reason to depart from my provisional decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 
118 118 Money) should pay Ms B £100 for the above reasons.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 November 2022.
