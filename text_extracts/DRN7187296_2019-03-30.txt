K820x#14complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wont give him the information it used to 
make the decision to close his local branches. Mr A also complains that NatWest  didnt take 
his disability into account when making  its decision. Mr A has raised concerns over how the 
settlement fee of a personal loan was calculated. Mr A has another personal loan that 
remains open and is worried that an unfair settlement fee will be used if he repays  it.  
background
NatWest decided to close the two closest branches  to where Mr A lives.  Mr As told us he 
uses a wheelchair  and suffers from mental  health  issues so it was important for him to have 
a local branch available. Mr As explained he has £20,000 in cash  he wants to deposit but 
because of the distance to his nearest branch he hasnt been able to. 
NatWest said it made a commercial decision to close its branches.  As part of the closure 
process NatWest issued factsheets setting out the change in branch use over time and 
providing information about the closures. NatWest says it also wrote  to branch customers. 
NatWest closed the two closest branches to Mr A in June  2018. 
Mr A complained and NatWest has issued three  responses. NatWest  agreed Mr A was kept 
on the phone too long and paid him £10 plus call costs. NatWest  didnt  agree  that it had 
acted unfairly by closing  its branches and thought it had provided  workable alternatives for 
customers with disabilities. NatWest later paid Mr A a further  £100  to reflect the service  he 
received while trying  to get answers to his queries.  
Mr A remained unhappy  and referred his complaint to this service.  An adjudicator looked at 
what happened but said they thought NatWest had dealt  with the complaint fairly. Mr A 
disagreed so his complaints been  passed to me to make a decision.  
 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There are several elements to this case so Im going  to look at each  in turn. Mr A complains 
about NatWests  decision  to close his local branches and the information  its provided about 
its commercial  decision. Mr A is concerned NatWest hasnt taken customers with disabilities 
sufficiently into account. 
I can see that the adjudicators listed the various factors  NatWest has given for taking  the 
decision to close the Royal  Wootton Basset branch to him so I wont  recreate them here.  
NatWest issued similar information  about  the reasons  for its Swindon branch closure.
I know Mr A feels he hasnt been  given enough information about  NatWests commercial 
decision but it has issued  a detailed analysis of how branch use and visits have changed in 
recent years, including a reduction  in the number of customers visiting. I appreciate  that the 
information provided may not be as detailed  as Mr A would like but I think  its 
comprehensive. We cant force a business  to provide commercially sensitive information. In 
this case, Im satisfied  NatWest has given a clear explanation  of its decision. 
Ref: DRN71872962Mr A has asked  how customers with disabilities were considered as part of NatWests 
commercial decision to close  branches.  NatWest has told us it has new mobile  banking  
routes for customers whove been  affected and that the Post Office can also be used  for 
banking services. It can also arrange for qualified staff to visit customers  with additional 
needs to discuss  banking options. In addition, online and mobile  banking  facilities are 
available to customers. 
I understand that not all of these options work  for Mr A. Hes said his local Post Offices  arent  
suitable for wheelchair users and that the mobile banking  service doesnt visit his area. In 
addition the mobile banking  van used  isnt accessible for customers in wheelchairs. These 
points have been put to NatWest and its offered to arrange a meeting  with a local qualified 
member of staff to discuss adjustments it can make  for Mr As banking  arrangements.  
NatWests also said that the mobile  bankers can sometimes complete transactions outside  
of the vehicle, although I appreciate depositing a large amount of cash  in this way wouldnt 
be secure. 
I do appreciate Mr As concerns about how his banking  services with NatWest  have been 
affected by its decision  and I agree that removing  his local branches made making visits 
harder. Mr As explained that this issue is compounded by his disability. I wanted to get a 
better understanding of how the decision to close the Royal Wootton Basset and Swindon  
branches specifically  impacted  Mr A so I asked NatWest to give details of his branch visits in 
the 12 months leading up to June 2018.  
NatWest has provided bank statements that show Mr A didnt visit the Royal  Wootton Basset 
branch in the 12 months leading up to its closure.  In both July and August 2017 the Swindon 
branch was used  to complete deposits to Mr As account. I appreciate that the decision to 
close these branches  will have an impact  on Mr A. But as he doesnt appear to be a regular 
branch user and only made two visits to the branches in question in a 12 month period. As a 
result, I havent found that Mr A has been  unreasonably  impacted  by NatWests decision to 
close its branches.
Im satisfied NatWest was entitled  to decide  whether to continue to operate  its branches and 
to close them after providing reasonable notice. Ive thought carefully about whether 
NatWest has treated Mr A fairly  in light of his disability. Im sorry to disappoint  Mr A but I 
think the adjustments NatWest has made  are reasonable. 
Mr As raised concerns over the settlement charge  he paid when repaying a personal loan. 
Mr A has another personal loan that remains active and will have to pay another early 
settlement charge if he redeems it. Again, the adjudicator set out the formula NatWest  uses 
to calculate the early  settlement charge but, in brief, it equates to 58 days worth of interest. 
The early  settlement charge forms part of the loan agreement so its something  Mr A has to 
pay to repay  a loan early.  Mr A has said he feels the figure  he paid of £152  to redeem his 
last loan was plucked out the air but I havent  found that to be the case. Im satisfied the 
early settlement charge Mr A paid is correct and in line with his loan agreement. 
Mr As told us hes moving his banking  relationship  away from NatWest because  of the 
branch closures.  Its up to Mr A to decide whether he wants  to repay  his remaining loan, but 
if he does NatWest will be able to apply  an early settlement charge. 
Ref: DRN71872963Mr A has raised concerns over NatWests decision to stop offering an application  that can be 
used on his smart watch. But thats not something hes previously complained to NatWest 
about so I cant  consider  it under  this decision. If Mr A wants  to complain  about  this issue 
hell need to ask NatWest to look into it first. 
NatWest has paid Mr A a total of £128.90 in respect of call costs,  time spent on the phone 
and the service provided. Ive carefully  considered everything that Mr A and NatWest have 
provided and said in reaching  my decision.  Having  done  so, Im satisfied the £128.90 
NatWest has already paid is fair in all the circumstances.  As I think NatWest has dealt with 
Mr As complaint fairly  Im not telling it to take any further action. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint  beyond the compensation 
National Westminster Bank Plc has already paid. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2019.
