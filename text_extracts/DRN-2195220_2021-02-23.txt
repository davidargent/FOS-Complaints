The complaint
Mr Hs complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) relates to the service he 
received following a dispute he raised with them about an item he purchased in December 
2019.
What happened
On 12 December 2019 Mr H bought an item through an internet platform and used PayPal to 
pay for it. After making payment he became suspicious of the seller. He told the seller and 
PayPal that he wanted a refund. The item was delivered but it took longer than Mr H 
expected.
On 23 December Mr H filed a dispute with PayPal stating the item had not been received, 
even though it had. He has explained that the reason he did this was because there was no 
option on PayPals site to record a dispute for late delivery. 
PayPal looked into the matter and said the item had been delivered and provided a tracking 
number, and therefore closed the dispute in favour of the seller. 
On 16 January 2020 Mr H changed the dispute reason to unauthorised payment. He 
changed it again on 20 January to Item not as described. PayPal looked at the matter again 
and found that there had been no unauthorised payment, but did agree, as a matter of 
goodwill, to credit his account with the value of the transaction, which it did on 29 January. 
PayPal also agreed to give Mr H a £20 voucher but due to an administrative error he was not 
emailed an activation code. Accepting that error, PayPal offered a courtesy credit of £20 
saying it believed that to be fair and reasonable as it represented about half of the value of 
the item purchased.
Mr H was unhappy with PayPals final response and so approached this service to see if we 
could assist in resolving the dispute. Our investigator thought that PayPals offer of £20 in 
relation to the delay in refunding his account and poor service was fair. Mr H didnt agree 
and asked for the complaint to be passed to an Ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My summary of what happened is brief and I know the parties went into a lot more detail. Im 
going to focus on what I think the key issues are as our rules allow me to do this and it 
reflects the nature of our service as an informal alternative to the courts. So, if theres 
something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive ignored it, its because Im satisfied that I 
dont need to comment on every individual argument to be able to reach what I think is the 
right outcome.
Many of the facts to this complaint are agreed. The timeline here is important as it puts the 
entire complaint into better perspective. Mr H bought the item on 12 December. He raised a 
dispute on 23 December to say the item hadnt arrived. PayPal acknowledged the dispute 
that same day, advising they expected a response from the seller by 2 January. Mr H was 
told on 30 December by PayPal that it was reviewing the information provided by the seller, 
and on 16 January it told him his claim was denied because the item had been received, 
which it had.
Mr H changed his dispute reason that day to say his payment had been unauthorised, but 
when PayPal looked into it they found that there was no evidence to support that claim. They 
advised Mr H of this on 17 January.
Mr H then changed his complaint on 20 January to Item not as described which PayPal 
acknowledged and accepted that day. PayPal said they would fully refund Mr Hs account 
which it did on 29 January.
PayPal have also accepted that its £20 voucher wasnt successfully emailed to Mr H and 
have apologised for that. On 30 January PayPal offered to credit his account with £20, which 
Mr H rejected.
Mr H has consistently said that he believes he has been the victim of a crime and has been 
defrauded. I have seen no evidence of that. The history to this complaint shows Mr H 
became concerned about delivery of an item he had purchased prior to Christmas 2019, but 
the item was delivered, which is a fact he accepts. His complaint then shifted to one of 
dissatisfaction with the goods, and when he made a complaint about that, on 20 January, 
PayPal accepted it and issued a refund. That refund took until the 29 January to reach his 
account and it was for the full amount. Mr H has therefore been placed back into the position 
he was prior to making the purchase, albeit there was a delay of nine days in doing so. I 
cant see any elements of fraud here although PayPal have clearly accepted there were 
some issues surrounding quality, leading them to make a goodwill offer of compensatory 
vouchers.
PayPal has accepted that it didnt get things right when issuing the £20 voucher and 
because of that it offered Mr H a £20 credit to his account. This is clearly a different form of 
redress to the voucher, and in my view appropriate. 
Mr H didnt think that was enough to put matters right and has pointed to the amount of time 
he has spent in dealing with his complaint. But, a lot of that time spent was due to his 
incorrect reporting of his dispute. And more time has been spent in his attempts to get 
PayPal to increase their offer of compensation. That is different to the time spent regarding 
PayPals failure to issue the voucher code by email to him and chasing up the the refund. 
In dealing with this complaint I need to consider whether PayPal acted fairly and reasonably. 
Very clearly, PayPal acted extremely quickly when Mr H made a complaint about the quality 
of the goods. It also acted quickly and appropriately in dealing with his two earlier complaints 
which were rejected. They also demonstrated fairness in making a goodwill offer of the 
vouchers.
So, the issue boils down to what might the right level of compensation be here. There is no 
set figure of awards I can turn to, and given that each case is different, it is an exercise of 
looking at all the circumstances of the case and deciding what feels fair and reasonable 
when set against the impact upon the complainant. 
My view of this complaint is that there was a delay in refunding Mr H and that should have 
happened sooner. There is also the failure to issue the email with the voucher code. PayPal have argued that their offer represents about half of the value of the item purchased, but Mr 
H would prefer any compensation to be linked to the time he spent dealing with the 
complaint. I dont think it is helpful to try and calculate compensation by either of those 
methods, and I come back to the impact upon Mr H. That, I consider, to be the short delay in 
receiving the refund and a failed email and the associated trouble and upset.
So, after some further thought, I think what PayPal offered is in fact very fair and reasonable. 
It is not a large amount, but it is sufficient and in my view it is reasonable and reflects the 
trouble and upset caused.
So, although Mr H will probably be disappointed with my decision, I cant say PayPal has 
acted unfairly or unreasonably here and Im not upholding this complaint. 
My final decision
PayPal has already made an offer to credit Mr Hs account with £20 to settle this complaint, 
and I think that is fair and reasonable. So, my final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & 
Cie, SCA should pay Mr H £20.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 March 2021.
