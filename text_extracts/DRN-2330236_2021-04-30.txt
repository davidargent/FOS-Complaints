The complaint
Mr and Mrs F complain National Westminster Bank Plc closed their personal accounts 
unfairly. They also complain their accounts were suspended on different occasions and their 
debit cards were cancelled, which resulted in financial loss. They ask NatWest to reimburse 
them for their losses.
What happened
Mr and Mrs F were customers of NatWest for some time, holding a variety of different 
accounts. The subject matter of this decision relates only to the personal accounts they held. 
It does not concern accounts related to the businesses they had charge of or held as 
executors. Neither does it review what an ombudsman decided regarding their NatWest 
mortgage complaint.
In June 2019 NatWest sent letters to Mr and Mrs F, which gave 60 days notice that their 
accounts would close. Mr and Mrs F were unhappy about NatWests decision. They needed 
the accounts to make important payments, so asked for extensions to delay their closure. 
NatWest agreed to keep the accounts open for longer, but the debit cards were cancelled in 
in August 2019. On contacting NatWest, Mr and Mrs F were told this was an error. New debit 
cards were issued which were received in September 2019. NatWest offered Mrs F £200 
and said it might pay further costs on appropriate evidence being provided.
Mr and Mrs F provided further evidence. But NatWest said Mr and Mrs F transferred funds 
out of their accounts via online banking over the period their cards were cancelled. So, Mr 
and Mrs F did have use of their accounts. The balances on the accounts also werent 
enough to make the payments they say they would have made if their cards hadnt been 
cancelled.
Most of Mr and Mrs Fs accounts were closed in November or December 2019.
Unhappy with NatWests response, Mr and Mrs F brought their complaint to us. An 
investigator considered their complaint and decided not to uphold it. In summary, they found:
- NatWest could decide not to provide accounts to Mr and Mrs F. Our service generally 
would not consider it appropriate to interfere with a firm exercising its commercial 
discretion.
- NatWest followed the terms and conditions of the accounts when giving notice. But it 
did admit its error when closing the accounts in August 2019. Its offer of £200 was 
enough to make up for the trouble Mr and Mrs F were caused.
Mr and Mrs F responded and said NatWest agreed to refund third party costs as a result of 
its error in cancelling their cards, which it hadnt done. 
The investigator reconsidered the complaint but found NatWest didnt need to award further 
compensation. The losses Mr and Mrs F  were claiming werent caused by not having use of 
debit cards. Mr and Mrs Fs made online transfers and payments over the period in question, 
so they had access to their funds. And their account balances didnt show they could have 
made the payments even if their cards werent cancelled.
Mr and Mrs F disagreed. So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mr and Mrs Fs complaint. Ill explain why.
 
Mr and Mrs F say their issue with NatWest isnt about their accounts being closed. But I still 
find that NatWest applied the correct notice periods under the terms of their accounts. And I 
find NatWest werent obliged to tell Mr and Mrs F its reasons for reviewing its relationship 
with them and deciding to end the relationship. So, I am not going to reveal its reasons in 
answering this complaint.
NatWest admits to cancelling Mr and Mrs Fs cards prematurely. It agreed to extend the 
accounts closure notice period, so Mr and Mrs F expected to have use of their debit cards 
until their accounts closed. They were no doubt concerned when this didnt happen. I note 
Mrs F wasnt very well during this time, so this would have been an additional stress.
NatWest offered £200 to make up for its error. And I find this is a proportionate sum to 
remedy the inconvenience and losses Mr and Mrs F experienced. They still had access to 
their accounts, albeit online; and NatWest reissued new cards for them to use. So, they 
could still bank with NatWest during the notice period.
NatWest has important legal and regulatory responsibilities and can review accounts in line 
with them. This may mean customers access to accounts is limited and/or payments are 
blocked during reviews. I have considered the basis for NatWests review and its decision to 
close the accounts and, based on what I have seen, Im satisfied it was reasonable. While I 
accept NatWests actions may have contributed to Mr and Mrs Fs missing certain payments, 
this doesnt mean the actions were unwarranted.
Mr and Mrs F provided information on a number of debts and fines they say they were 
unable to pay during the time they were without cards and when their accounts were 
suspended. And I agree NatWest said it would consider third party costs if presented with 
evidence.
The debt Mr and Mrs F hold is significant. And on balance, I havent seen evidence to show 
it was more likely Mr and Mrs F could have serviced the majority of their debts if their cards 
werent cancelled or their accounts werent at times restricted. Instead, I find its more likely 
Mr and Mrs F couldnt make certain payments because of their ability to repay the debt they 
were being pursued for.
One debt Mrs F holds is as guarantor for a loan a former company took out with a third-party 
lender. NatWest held a business account for the company, and Mrs F says the guarantee 
would not have been called in had NatWest added the new company director to the account 
mandate. But our service cannot consider that complaint. Mrs F is no longer entitled to represent the former company. So, I cannot reach findings on whether NatWest are 
ultimately responsible for Mrs F being pursued for the debt or how reasonable NatWest 
actions in relation to the companys business account(s) were.
Several of the losses Mr and Mrs F claim are fines related to the use of a car, of which some 
relate to events which happened during the time their debit cards were cancelled. Mr F says 
he needed to use the car to get to work, so had no option but to incur the fines.
 
I have considered what Mr F said carefully, but ultimately it was a choice to incur charges he 
knew he couldnt pay by card. And I havent seen evidence to show what alternative options 
to make payment were discussed with the relevant authorities who issued the fines. So, on 
balance, Im not directing NatWest to refund those costs.
Mr and Mrs F say they didnt have third-party accounts where they could transfer funds. But I 
dont find they were prevented from opening accounts with third-party providers. The 
prospect of opening other accounts was something Mr and Mrs F knew they were going to 
need to do from June 2019. So, they had enough time to open personal accounts elsewhere 
which could have prevented future problems.
NatWest refused account switches, and this too may have caused some delays to 
payments. But NatWest were entitled not to agree to a switch, as it was exiting its 
relationship with Mr and Mrs F and their businesses. And refusing a switch on this basis isnt 
uncommon in the retail banking industry, so I dont think NatWest were wrong to decline    
Mr and Mrs Fs requests.
I am sorry to hear what a difficult time Mr and Mrs F are going through. I appreciate this must 
have had a profound effect on their well-being. But, I have decided not to uphold their 
complaint for the reasons I have given.
My final decision
I have decided not to uphold Mr and Mrs Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F and Mr F to 
accept or reject my decision before 28 May 2021.
