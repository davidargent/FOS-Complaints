The complaint
Mr C complains that the early settlement figure on his loan from Loans 2 Go Limited (L2G) is 
wrong.
What happened
In July 2019, Mr C took out a personal loan of £800 from L2G. The period was 78 weeks. 
And the APR was 1013.1%. The total payable was £3291.12. Payments were £182.84 a 
month. He ran into financial difficulty and paid the first five instalments, but reduced and 
varying amounts were paid from January 2020 to September 2020:
Date Repayment Amount Balance of Loan
Opening balance £3291.12
August 2019 £182.84
September 2019 £182.84
October 2019 £182.84
November 2019 £182.84
December 2019 £182.84
January 2020 £0
February 2020 £0
March 2020 £0
April 2020 £0
May 2020 £150.64
June 2020 £150.64
July 2020 £150.64
August 2020 £166.46
September 2020 £206.34
October 2020  present £0
Total paid £1738.92 (£1738.92)
Balance remaining £1552.20
 
In October 2020, Mr C asked for an early settlement figure. L2G quoted an amount to be 
paid - £1552.20 less rebate allowed (£168.50) - £1383.70.
Mr C complained. He couldnt see how the early settlement figure was so high  when he 
had already paid off £1738.92. So, when he added the early settlement figure of £1383.70  
he would still have paid £3167.62. So  almost as much as the original loan amount. So  
L2G must be wrong. He asked that the early settlement figure be explained and checked.
L2G said the early settlement figure was correct and had been calculated in accordance with 
the formula set out in the Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations 2004. They 
provided the formula. But  they offered to accept an early settlement figure of £691.85 
instead. 
Mr C brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said that it wasnt for our service to 
calculate the early settlement figure. The offer from L2G looked fair and reasonable. The 
way that L2Gs loan works was that interest was front loaded. The total interest was 
£2491.12  and the total to be paid was £3291.12. But the way in which the loan was repaid 
isnt as simple as simply deducting the monthly repayments from the starting balance  
which is what Mr C had done. 
Mr C didnt agree and asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our investigator is correct in saying that its not for this service to calculate the early 
settlement figure or to check L2Gs calculation. But I will try to explain whats happened here 
 so hopefully Mr C can see that L2Gs offer is a fair one. 
When Mr C took out the loan  he owed £3291.12. Thats what he signed up for when he 
took the loan. This was made up of the sum borrowed of £800, plus interest of £2491.12. 
The loan was to be paid in 18 instalments of £182.84.
Its important to understand that on fixed sum loans such as this, each instalment of 
£182.84 included some interest (of the £2491.12), and some capital repayment (of the 
£800). But the way in which the payments are made up  the early repayments comprise 
mostly interest, and little capital  whereas towards the end of the loan, the later instalments 
include less interest and more capital repayment. So  when a loan is settled early, but 
towards the end of the loan  the interest rebate is less than if the loan was settled near its 
start. So  the earlier the loan is settled, the higher the rebate of interest will be. The amount 
of the early settlement figure depended on how much interest was refunded. In Mr Cs case, 
he had paid about 10 payments out of 18  so he was about half way though. And  L2Gs 
interest rebate offered was only £168.50 (out of the total interest of £2491.12)  so this 
shows how the later payments on the loan wouldve been made up of mostly capital, rather 
than interest. So  in general terms, Mr C had paid mostly interest during the first half of the 
loan, but still owed a lot of the original amount of the capital amount borrowed of £800.
Looking at it another way  Mr C owed £3291.12. Hed paid £1738.92. So that left £1552.20 
to be paid. L2G said the figure to repay early was £1383.70  so in that case, Mr C wouldve 
paid a total of £3122.62  which was, as Mr C says, almost the same as he was originally 
asked to pay. But  L2G have made the offer to accept only £691.85  so Mr C wouldve 
then paid a total of £2420.77 (£1738.92 plus £691.85). And thats compared to the original 
cost of £3291.12. If Mr C looks at it that way, he may feel it looks OK. And in my view - it 
looks a fair offer.
And so  while I can see that Mr C feels strongly about his complaint, I think that L2G have 
acted fairly and I wont be asking them to do anymore here.
