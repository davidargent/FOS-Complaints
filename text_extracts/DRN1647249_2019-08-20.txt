Mrs W says that she wasnt  able to meet her essential expenses because  of the number of 
loans that she took out with Uncle Buck.
The adjudicator recommended that Mrs Ws complaint be upheld  in part. In summary he 
thought that Uncle Buck shouldnt have  agreed to lend any of the loans apart  from loan two. 
The adjudicator recommended that Uncle Buck refund the interest and charges that Mrs W 
had paid on loan one and loans three to 17.
The adjudicator recommended that Uncle Buck remove the negative information  about loan 
one and loans  three to five. The adjudicator  recommended  that Uncle  Buck remove loans six 
to 17 entirely from Mrs Ws credit  file.
Uncle Buck  didnt agree with the adjudicators  recommendation but it offered  to write off the 
outstanding balance in full and final settlement.  Mrs W didnt want  to accept this offer so the 
complaint has come  to me for a final decision.
Ref: DRN16472492My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that Uncle 
Buck should  fairly and reasonably have done  more to establish  that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that its important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  was required  to establish 
whether Mrs W could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. 
This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook  defines sustainable  as being without 
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, 
while meeting  other reasonable  commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet 
the repayments. 
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if they will need to borrow  
more money to afford the repayments.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ws complaint.
Ref: DRN16472493Loan one 
Before agreeing loan one, Uncle Buck recorded  Mrs Ws monthly income  to be £1,100 
against declared expenses of almost  £1,500. 
Although Uncle Buck  says that it would  have carried out additional checks  that allowed it to 
offer to lend, I dont  know what  these additional  checks were. On the face of the financial 
information that Uncle Buck has given to us, Mrs W didnt have any disposable income  with 
which to repay £270 to Uncle Buck.    
So I consider that its fair to uphold Mrs Ws complaint about this loan.
Loan two
Mrs W accepts  the adjudicators recommendation not to uphold her complaint about  loan 
two. As I dont think this loan is in dispute, I dont  think I need to say anything  further  about  
it.
Loans three to five
Uncle Buck  expected Mrs W to repay a substantial proportion of her declared monthly 
income each time for loans three to five. I consider that it was likely  that Mrs W would  have 
struggled to sustainably repay loans three  to five. I consider that Uncle  Buck should have 
realised this and not agreed to lend to Mrs W.
Loan six onwards
Having looked  at the overall pattern of Uncle Bucks lending history with Mrs W; I think  Uncle 
Buck should  reasonably have seen  that she was unlikely to have been able to make her loan 
repayments in a sustainable manner  by the time it provided loan six. 
I say this because  by the time that Mrs W applied for loan six shed been borrowing money 
from Uncle Buck for almost a year. Although there  was a small gap between  repaying loan 
five and applying  for loan six, Mrs W had taken out and repaid loan five on the same day.  
This was potentially concerning behaviour that I consider Uncle Buck  shouldve  taken 
account of when considering Mrs Ws application for loan six. 
When Mrs W applied  for loan six it was the largest amount that shed borrowed to date and 
she opted to repay the loan by instalments. In my view, this was a sign that Mrs W was 
struggling financially.
Although there was some fluctuation in the amount  that Mrs W was borrowing each time, the 
general trend was of an increasing level of debt.  For example, loan 10 was for twice  the 
amount of loan one. By loan 12, Mrs W was borrowing at least £500 each time. So Mrs W 
wasnt making any real inroads into what she owed Uncle Buck and her indebtedness was 
being prolonged. This meant that Mrs W had been  paying  large  amounts of interest  to, in 
effect; service a debt to Uncle  Buck over a long period.
Despite what Mrs W may have told Uncle  Buck about her financial circumstances, based on 
the frequency and level of borrowing, Uncle Buck ought to have realised  it was more likely 
than not Mrs W needed  the money to help with everyday living  costs,  rather  than one off 
Ref: DRN16472494expenses. I consider that Uncle Buck shouldve seen that Mrs W wasnt using the loans as 
intended and that her indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
I consider Mrs W lost out because Uncle Buck provided loans six onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ws indebtedness  by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the extended period of time she owed Uncle Buck money  was likely to have had 
negative implications on Mrs Ws ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept her 
in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Mrs Ws complaint about loans one, three  and six to 17. 
I understand that Mrs W still owes money on loan 17. As Mrs W has had the benefit of the 
money lent to her, it seems fair to allow Uncle Buck to apply the refund to the outstanding 
principal balance on loan 17 if it chooses.
To put things right,  Uncle Buck should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mrs W paid on loan one and loans three to 17;
 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;  
write off any unpaid interest and charges on loan 17; 
if it chooses to, apply the refund  against  any outstanding principal balance  on loan 17 
before paying  remaining balance (if there  is any) to Mrs W**; 
remove any negative information  about loan one and loans three  to five from Mrs Ws 
credit file; and
the number  of loans taken by the time of loan six means that any information  about loans 
six to 17 is negative. So all entries about loans 6 to 17 should  be removed from Mrs Ws 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mrs W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. If 
Uncle Buck  intends  to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding  principal  balance,  it must 
do so after deducting  tax.
**If after carrying out the above steps there is still an outstanding balance,  I remind  Uncle 
Buck of its obligation  to treat Mrs W reasonably and sympathetically if she puts forward  any 
repayment proposals.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Ws complaint in part. In full and final settlement I 
require Uncle Buck Finances LLP to take the steps  outlined above.
Ref: DRN16472495Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 September  2019.
