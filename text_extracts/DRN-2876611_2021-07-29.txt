The complaint
Ms A complains that some money she sent overseas using WorldRemit Ltd didnt get where 
it was supposed to go.
What happened
Ms A said shed used WorldRemit on 4 June 2020 to make two payments to relatives 
overseas. She said shed used the service successfully before, and she got all the usual 
notifications this time, but the first payment didnt arrive. Her relative wasnt notified of the 
payment, and it was only when Ms A spoke to her relative later that she learned the money 
hadnt got there. 
Ms A said she reported this to WorldRemit, and it asked for a mini statement from her 
relatives mobile money account so it could investigate further. Ms A said that she couldnt 
provide this, so she sent what she could. 
Ms A was very concerned about calls made to her relative by WorldRemits local agent. She 
said that WorldRemit had admitted no payment notification was sent to Ms As relative, 
perhaps because of technical issues, but it was sure the transaction was complete. 
Ms A said that she wanted the money to be traced, and returned to her.
WorldRemit said that Ms As transaction was completed on 4 June. It had repeatedly asked 
Ms A for a mobile money statement from the recipients mobile money account, so it could 
see if this transaction was shown. But Ms A hadnt provided this. WorldRemit said it had also 
discussed this payment with its local partner, who managed the mobile money account in the 
destination country. That partner confirmed the payment had been made, and said it had 
contacted the account holder to confirm this. But WorldRemit said that Ms A continued to 
insist the payment hadnt been made. WorldRemit said that there was no more it could do.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said that WorldRemit 
investigated by contacting the recipient partner in the destination country, and that business 
confirmed money had been received into the intended recipients account. WorldRemit then 
asked Ms A for a mobile money statement, so it could investigate further, but Ms A hadnt 
provided that. WorldRemit had explained that it couldnt do any more with what she had 
provided. Our investigator said that it looked as if the problem was with the recipient 
business, and she didnt think that WorldRemit could do any more. 
Ms A didnt agree. She wanted to stress that the company managing the mobile money 
wallet in the recipient country had said something very different  that for it to investigate the 
missing funds, WorldRemit needed to send it an email to kick start an investigation, but no 
email had been sent. And she said the company had refused to supply the statement that 
WorldRemit wanted. She expressed suspicions about why the mobile money company 
wouldnt provide this. 
Our investigator sent Ms A the email exchange between WorldRemit and the mobile money 
company. 
Ms A said WorldRemit had asked for a receipt, but what it received wasnt a receipt. And the 
name wasnt spelled right. Ms A was also angry that WorldRemit had told the mobile money 
company to call the recipient to tell her this transaction had been paid, when it hadnt. Ms A 
said that only WorldRemit could get the mobile money company to show what had happened 
to the money, and it wasnt doing this.
Our investigator asked WorldRemit about what Ms A had said. It said that the spelling of the 
name on the receipt is the same as on the instruction to pay it received from Ms A. The 
spelling of the name wouldnt affect whether a payment was received or not, and the 
recipient would not see the spelling Ms A had used.
WorldRemit stressed that the mobile money company that Ms A transferred the money to, is 
an entirely separate business to it. It can pay money into the accounts held with that 
business, but it has no control over the payment after that. 
Our investigator said it was important that WorldRemit had confirmed that it had no control 
over the money once it was sent, because the mobile money company was entirely separate 
to WorldRemit. The role of this service is to see what WorldRemit have done wrong, but our 
investigator said she couldnt see WorldRemit had done anything wrong. It had sent the 
money at Ms As request.
Ms A said she wanted her complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman.
Ms A said she only got involved with the mobile money company through WorldRemit. 
Previous payments had gone through, and she hadnt changed the name. 
Ms A said that as WorldRemits customer, she trusted it to ensure that the money it 
transferred arrived safely. She drew our attention to the mis-spelling of the name, and that 
the transfer notification wasnt received. Ms A said that cropped documents with hidden 
information, especially financial information, raises questions. She didnt think that 
WorldRemit had proved receipt, she thought there were doubts over the documentation it 
had provided. 
MS A said that because we were letting WorldRemit escape accountability, and that left UK 
customers using this service very vulnerable to scams. She said that UK money transfer 
agents could freely team up with overseas fraudsters, rip people off and successfully get 
away with it. 
This case then came to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
I think its important to start by setting out what I can look at in this case. 
I can consider what WorldRemit has done. I cannot consider the actions of the mobile money wallet provider, based overseas, that 
WorldRemit sent money to. So Im not able to look at whether that mobile money company 
has told Ms A something different to what its said to WorldRemit, and if so, why that has 
happened. 
WorldRemit has told us it made this transfer, to the account Ms A asked it to pay. Its shown 
us that it has double-checked with the mobile money company, to see if the money arrived 
with it, and was paid to the intended recipient. The mobile money company has said yes. 
The mobile company has also sent a partial screenshot, confirming the transaction. This has 
been sent twice, with each view adjusted to show different details. I dont think that 
WorldRemit should have been suspicious because the mobile money company has adjusted 
the screen to show different details on the two occasions it was asked to show proof of 
receipt. 
WorldRemit has told our service that any error in the recipients name wouldnt affect receipt, 
and wouldnt show up on the recipients mobile money wallet.
So I havent been able to see that any of the part of this transaction which WorldRemit is 
responsible for, has gone wrong. And I think WorldRemit has made reasonable efforts to 
check that the other part of this transaction, which it isnt responsible for, has been done. 
I know that Ms A says this part of the transaction hasnt been done, because her relative 
never got this money. But shes not been able to provide the mini-statement from the 
intended recipient, which would show whether or not this payment ever reached that person. 
I do understand that Ms A says that shes been prevented from getting this by the mobile 
money business  the same business which is responsible for making the payment. But that 
business isnt WorldRemit, and it isnt a business that our service covers. So our service isnt 
able to help Ms A with that part of her transaction.
I know that Ms A will be deeply disappointed by this, and Im sorry we arent able to help her. 
But, for the reasons Ive set out above, I dont think that WorldRemit has done anything 
wrong here, and that means I dont think that this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 August 2021.
