The complaint
Mrs B complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) didnt agree to her request for a 
refund for goods supplied by a third party she was in dispute with. 
What happened
Mrs B brought her complaint to us as she was unhappy when PayPal told her theyd closed 
her claim for a refund for a transaction made on 14 May 2021. Mrs B has contacted PayPal 
to ask for a refund on 13 June 2021 as the goods shed ordered hadnt arrived. The dispute 
was denied on 15 June 2021 as delivery was confirmed. But on 16 June 2021 the basis of 
the claim was changed to the goods being significantly not as described
PayPal told us theyd reached out to Mrs B and her sent her their final response to her 
complaint which theyd also sent to us. In that final response PayPal said after requesting 
information from both parties and completing a review, they initially denied Mrs Bs case on 
28 June 2021 as they didnt have enough information to confirm the item was significantly 
not as described. PayPal said they reviewed the case after Mrs B appealed their original 
decision and uploaded photos on 20 July 2021. PayPal said theyd again denied the claim 
on 22 July 2021 as, they thought, it was seen that item was properly described but didnt 
meet Mrs Bs expectations.
PayPal said theyd reviewed Mrs Bs account and the buyer dispute shed raised in line with 
their User Agreement and the matter raised in her complaint wasnt accepted. So, they said 
they werent in a position to offer her any form of financial redress.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He explained his role wasnt to comment on the 
dispute Mrs B had with the third party regarding their 30 day money back guarantee but 
rather to look at what Pay Pal did with regard to the buyer dispute. Having considered the 
evidence, in particular the PayPals User Agreement he thought PayPal had applied the 
guidance in their Buyer Protection Policy fairly and hadnt made any errors. So, he wasnt 
able to ask PayPal to do anymore.
Mrs B didnt agree. She asked for the matter to be escalated. She thought shed been the 
victim of a misrepresentation. She made a number of observations about the verbal and 
visual content of the advert for the goods, the quality of the goods and their delivery. She 
thought the situation was unfair for the buyer and told us she thought it was heart breaking 
that big companies got away with such behaviour.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive come to the view that this isnt a complaint which I can reasonably 
uphold. Ill explain why.
I realise that Mrs B is unhappy with the third party who sold her the goods. But, as our 
investigator has already explained what Im looking at is the dispute between Mrs B and 
PayPal, not that third Party. And, Im afraid, I dont think PayPal have acted unfairly or made 
any errors here.
Mrs B and PayPals responsibilities are set out in the User Agreement. The parts of the User 
Agreement that are relevant to Mrs B case - namely her request for a refund under the Buyer 
Protection Policy  have been set out by the investigator in his view, so I shant repeat them 
here. Im satisfied from the information Ive seen that PayPal have acted fairly and in line 
with the User Agreement. Theyve investigated her claim multiple times and each time 
considered the evidence she sent before responding. So, I dont think theyve made any 
mistakes in dealing with Mrs Bs request. So, I cant reasonably ask them to do anything 
further.
Given how strongly Mrs B feels about what happened she may want to pursue the matter 
further through other routes or against other parties. But my decision brings to an end what 
we - in trying to resolve her dispute with PayPal informally - can do for her. Im sorry if this 
disappoints Mrs B.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 January 2022.
