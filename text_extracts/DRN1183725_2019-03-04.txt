K820x#14complaint
Mr P complains that he was never told by Bank of Scotland  plc trading as Halifax that 
making payments  on the 28th of each  month  would count as a missed  payment on his credit 
file. To resolve his complaint  he would like Halifax to register  these as regular payments and 
not missed payments.  
background
Mr P has two secured  loans with Halifax. He previously struggled to keep the payments up 
but over the last couple of years  hes manged to keep up payments and clear the arrears. 
The loans are up to date.
Mr P was thinking of moving house and was advised  to check  his credit rating as he was 
refused a mortgage. The credit file showed numerous  missed  payments in the last 18 
months, about eight  or nine for each loan. He hadnt  missed any payments recently so he 
called Halifax to find out what was happening.
Halifax said the payments  had been set up as a standing order to come out on the 28th of 
each month. If this fell on a weekend or a short month then the payment might not reach 
Halifax until the 1st of the next month and be classed as a missed payment. 
Halifax said Mr P had set up the standing order so it was his responsibility.  Mr P says hes 
never set up payments himself. Halifax says it has always been over the phone. Mr P says if 
there was a risk of them  showing as missed payments Halifax  should have advised him of 
this. When he called  earlier in 2018  to make  sure he was up to date nothing  was mentioned 
about late or missed  payments.
Halifax didnt uphold  Mr Ps complaint. It said a standing order  was a manual instruction 
which a customer sets up to pay a bill or a person.  Halifax wouldnt set this up for him. Any 
form of manual payment was set up at the customers risk that the payment reaches the 
payee on the day the payment falls due. The only way to guarantee a payment reaches the 
account on the day it falls due is by setting up a direct debit. Halifax said it had a legal 
obligation to accurately report the way Mr Ps accounts were operating and it wouldnt be 
possible to remove any late payment indicators. 
Mr P brought his complaint to this service but our adjudicator  didnt recommend it be upheld. 
He thought Halifax had correctly reported the payments on Mr Ps credit  file.
The adjudicator had reviewed the statements for both loan accounts alongside Mr Ps credit 
report. 
On the first account  the adjudicator had looked  from November  2015 prior to which Mr P had 
no arrears. A payment of £141.93 was due on 25 November 2015.  Halifax received £145  on 
1 December 2015.
Another payment  of £141.93 was due on 25 December 2015 but Halifax received £1.45.  
Therefore, across November and December 2015  Mr P owed £283.86 but only paid 146.45, 
which left him one month in arrears. This was reported on his credit file for November and 
December. 
Ref: DRN11837252Another payment  of £141.93 was due on 25 January 2016 and Halifax received £1.45 on 
29 January 2016.  Therefore at this point Mr P was another month in arrears,  reflect  as a two 
on his credit file which  indicated he was two months  in arrears. This trend continued through  
to April 2018 at which point Mr P cleared the arrears and the credit file had a zero next to the 
payment status.
On the second  account the adjudicator had looked from November 2015, prior to which  Mr P 
was already three months  in arrears. £141.16  was due on 25 November 2015. Halifax 
received £150  on 1 December 2015.  The next payment of £141.16 was due on 
25 December 2015 but Halifax received only £1.50. This increased Mr Ps arrears by one 
month from three to four. This trend continued through  to May 2018 at which  point Mr P 
cleared the arrears. The maximum  showing on the credit file was six, indicating six or more 
missed payments.
Mr P had mentioned  that he wasnt responsible for setting up the standing order and this 
was always done  over the phone.  However,  a standing order  was an instruction of the 
account holder  to the bank. The bank would  follow the customers  instructions  when  setting 
up a standing order.
Halifax had written to Mr P on a number  of occasions to make him aware of the arrears 
resulting from his payments not reaching  Halifax on time. It had also sent statements on 
various occasions, which outlined when Mr Ps payment was due and when it was being 
received. Therefore the adjudicator thought Halifax had made  a reasonable effort  to keep 
him informed  about the status of his payments.
Mr P didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to look at the case.  He said his complaint 
was that he was never told by Halifax that making  payments on the 28th of each month 
would count as a missed  payment on his credit  file.
The adjudicator had said:
Looking at [second]  loan account . from November 2015, prior to which  you were already 
three months in arrears. CMP of £141.16 was due on 25 November  2015;  your payment of 
£150 was received on 1 December 2015. The next CMP of £141.16 became due on the 
25 December 2015, however you only paid £1.50 which  falls below your CMP, therefore 
increasing your arrears by one month  from three to four. This trend  continues  through to May 
2018 at which point you cleared your arrears 
But Mr P said this wasnt true. The last time he changed the amount  to £1.50 per month was 
when he was having difficulties in late 2015. He wouldnt  choose to do this to himself   
Halifax chose not to mention it to him. He was locked into these high interest loans with 
Halifax and he thinks thats the way Halifax would  like to keep it.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the statement on the second  account  for the period  1 January 2015 to 
15 August 2018,  which was enclosed with Halifaxs letter to Mr P dated 16 August 2018. The 
first payment  of £1.50 was on 30 December 2015, and there were five more  payments of this 
amount, the last on 29 October 2016.
Ref: DRN11837253Mr P says his complaint  is that he was never  told by Halifax that making payments on the 
28th of each month would count as a missed  payment on his credit file. But it wasnt up to 
Halifax to tell him that. A direct debit is the only payment method which a lender sets up and 
arranges. There was no duty on Halifax to oversee the operation  of Mr Ps standing  order.
Mr P knew  or should have  known from Halifaxs letters and from the statements that his 
standing order payments werent  always reaching  Halifax on time. It had also sent 
statements on various occasions, which outlined when Mr Ps payment was due and when it 
was being received.
I cant see that Halifax has done anything wrong here.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2019.
