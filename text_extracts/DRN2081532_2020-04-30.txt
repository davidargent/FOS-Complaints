K820x#14complaint
Mrs T complains that Barclays Bank UK Plc, trading as Barclaycard, wont refund to her the 
money that shes claimed for a holiday.  
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
In certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the 
supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit  if theres  been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier. To be able to uphold  Mrs Ts complaint about 
Barclaycard, I must be satisfied that theres been  a breach of contract or misrepresentation 
by the holiday  company  and that Barclaycards  response to her claim under section 75 
wasnt fair or reasonable.  Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Ts claim under section 75 
as only a court would be able to do that.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mrs T paid £858.69 to the holiday company  using her Barclaycard in November 2018 
for a holiday and transfer for herself, her mother and her daughter  she made  a 
separate payment for some flights;
there were some issues with the seating  arrangements for the gala dinner which  
Mrs T said led to them  missing  out on the meal so she claimed £400 compensation 
from Barclaycard for that and other issues (including  having  to buy bottled  water,  no 
kettle being available and the excursions being  different  to, and more expensive  
than, those shown  in the brochure);
the holiday company  had apologised  for the issues with the gala dinner and 
Barclaycard credited  Mrs Ts account with £150  as a goodwill gesture;
Mrs T was clearly  upset by the issues at the gala dinner and shes referred to her 
humiliation, distress and disappointment, particularly  as her mother  suffers  from a 
disability  and I sympathise  with her for all of that;
the total cost of the holiday for three  people for seven days  on a half board basis was 
£823.76 and Barclaycard has credited £150  to Mrs Ts account  (which is about 18% 
of the cost of the holiday) and she received the accommodation, the other meals and 
the other facilities that the hotel offered;
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that theres  been  a breach 
of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company  about  having to buy bottled 
water, the availability  of a kettle or the excursions that were available  (the excursions 
werent included  in the holiday  package  that Mrs T had bought  from the holiday 
company);
Ref: DRN20815322I consider that the £150 that Barclaycard has credited to Mrs Ts account is fair and 
reasonable compensation for the issues that she had with the gala dinner and Im not 
persuaded that the distress and inconvenience that she was caused by those issues 
justifies a higher award of compensation (or that the £400 compensation that Mrs T 
has claimed would be appropriate in these  circumstances); and
I consider that Barclaycards response to Mrs Ts complaint has been  fair and 
reasonable so I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable  for me to require it to pay 
any further compensation to Mrs T  or to take any other action in response to her 
complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ts complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 May 2020.
