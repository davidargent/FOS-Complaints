The complaint
Mrs B complains that MBNA Limited has allowed her to do multiple balance transfers which 
has meant her credit limit was exceeded. This in turn has affected her credit history. 
What happened
Mrs B had a credit card with MBNA. Her credit limit was £2,300.  In September 2018, Mrs B 
made some balance transfers into her account. The MBNA's records show the below:
20 September 2018 - £850 transfer and £25.41 fee
21 September 2018 - £1,100 transfer and £44 fee
24 September 2018 - £1,100 transfer and £44 fee reversed as it had been sent to the 
wrong sort code.
28 September 2018 - £1,100 transfer and £44 fee
2 October 2018 - £3,000 credit to the account
4 October 2018 - £2,100 transfer and £84 fee
4 October 2018 (later in the day) - £3,000 credit reversal request. 
As a result of the final credit reversal Mrs B's account was left with a balance that exceeded 
the credit limit. Mrs B asked for a credit limit increase on 4 October 2018 and 26 November 
2018 both of which were declined. And in December 2016 MBNA withdrew the credit facility. 
Mrs B let it know she was suffering financial difficulties. It temporarily halted over the limit 
fees and arranged for her account to be manager by its specialist support team. 
In May 2019 Mrs B complained about being allowed to exceed her credit limit. MBNA agreed 
there had been errors on its part and arranged for £150 to be paid into her account. But Mrs 
B didn't think that was sufficient so asked us to look into her complaint. 
When sending its file MBNA said it hadn't actually done anything wrong, as Mrs B had asked 
for the £3,000 credit to be reversed after she had made another transfer, and it was the 
reversal which meant she was over the limit. But it agreed to honour the compensation it had 
already paid. 
Our investigator concluded MBNA hadn't done anything wrong. He was satisfied that Mrs B 
was over limit because of the £3,000 credit being reversed from her account. And because 
he was satisfied the account was correct, he didn't find MBNA was wrong to report 
information to credit reference agencies about that. 
Mrs B asked for the matter to be reviewed as she recalls being told in a call that two 
transfers of £1,100 would be reversed and that a transfer of £2,100 would be manually 
completed for her. As there was already a transfer of £850 this meant she was over the limit. 
She says this was why her complaint was upheld originally.   What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I have come to broadly 
the same conclusions as the investigator. 
According to MBNA's records only one transfer for £1,100 and the associated fee was 
reversed - due to the wrong sort code being used. There is nothing in the records to indicate 
the later transfer of £1,100 and associated fee (carried out on 28 September) should also 
have been reversed. 
The next transaction on the account (aside from some everyday spending) was a credit of 
£3,000.  This meant that the balance had, in effect, been cleared. Not only that, but the 
account was actually in credit. It wasn't until after this credit that Mrs B arranged another 
transfer of £2,100 and associated fee. So I disagree with Mrs B that this transfer alone, in 
addition to the first transfer, meant she was over her limit. 
Later that same day, and after the £2,100 transfer, Mrs B asked for the £3,000 credit to be 
reversed. It was this reversal which meant Mrs B was over her credit limit, as it meant her 
initial transfer of £850 (and fee) and later transfer of £1,100 (and fee) were no longer paid. 
MBNA can't have known when it allowed the £2,100 transfer that Mrs B was going to reverse 
the credit into the account. 
Although MBNA initially thought it had done something wrong, I'm not persuaded the 
available evidence shows it did. I therefore don't require it to take any action in relation to 
this, or any adverse information it has recorded about this against Mrs B.  
My final decision
For the reasons given, my final decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 April 2020.
