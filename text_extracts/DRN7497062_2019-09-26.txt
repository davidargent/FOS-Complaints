K822xcomplaint
Mrs L is unhappy with the increases in premiums  on her home  insurance with 
Lloyds Bank  General Insurance Limited (Lloyds).
Mrs L has been represented throughout her complaint by her son Mr L.
background 
Mrs Ls insurance policy with Lloyds started  in 2009  and cost £259.64  for the year. For 2016 
the renewal quote  was £635.89. At this time, Mr L arranged for Mrs Ls policy to be amended  
 removing some elements of the cover. This brought the cost down to around  £220. 
Because of this Mr L thought Lloyds  had taken advantage of Mrs L by unfairly increasing the 
cost of the policy every year. He says Mrs L was charged too much and she should be 
reimbursed for the extra she had paid over the years. 
Lloyds offered to refund  some  of the cost of the insurance for the 2014  premium onward. It 
offered £215.68  as a refund of some of the premiums and £41.56  as additional  
compensation for Mrs L being out of pocket of that money. Our adjudicator thought the offer 
was a fair way to resolve things.
Mr L disagreed and didnt think the offer was fair. He thinks  Mrs Ls insurance should have 
cost around £150  per year  and so says she has overpaid on her insurance by 
approximately £1,500 from 2009-2015. Mr L says Mrs L would settle  for £1,000  as resolution 
to her complaint. 
While the complaint was waiting  for an ombudsmans  decision,  Lloyds explained  it would 
offer a further  £200 (on top of its original  offer) as compensation for the trouble Mrs Ls been 
caused.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont have the power to tell a business  what its insurance should  have  cost.  I would be, in 
effect determining  or telling a business how it should  operate  and thats not my role. But I 
can look at whether Lloyds has treated Mrs L fairly throughout the period she held her 
insurance policy. 
If I find that Lloyds hasnt treated Mrs L fairly, I will look to see what  compensation would be 
fair and in this case whether I think what Lloyds has offered is fair.
When Mrs L took out her policy in 2009,  it cost £259.64 for the year.  I understand there was 
an introductory discount. This isnt uncommon and policies may well initially  be priced lower 
to attract  new customers. I dont think its unfair for an insurer to seek to recoup that cost 
over the first few years. 
It appears that Mrs L did speak to Lloyds about the cost of her policy  in 2010  which 
resulted in 2011s premium receiving a discount.  But I can see that after this Mrs Ls 
premium continued  to increase each year and she didnt engage with Lloyds further. 
Ref: DRN74970622Mr L says that Mrs L simply trusted  that she was being charged a fair amount and wouldnt 
have thought that anything was amiss. And it wasnt until Mrs L asked her son Mr L to get 
involved at the 2016 renewal that the cost was challenged.
If Lloyds should  have realised Mrs L wasnt the type of person who shopped around for 
cheaper insurance regularly, and it increased  the price  just because she didnt engage at 
renewal, that wouldnt be fair. 
Lloyds has offered to refund some  of the costs  of the insurance premiums from 2014  
onwards. 
Lloyds has offered to keep Mrs Ls premiums after 2013 at the same amount she was 
charged in 2013   so £412.88.  So it will refund  the difference on the payments she made on 
her 2014  and 2015 premiums. For example, Mrs Ls premium  in 2014 was £485.26.  Lloyds 
has offered to refund the difference between the 2013 and 2014  premiums, plus interest.  
And its done this for every yearly  premium after 2013. Lloyds total offer is £215.68 plus 
interest of £41.56.  
Mr L says because he was able to reduce the cost of Mrs Ls policy in 2015  by around £400, 
Mrs L was overcharged  from the beginning and is therefore owed a lot more in 
compensation. I disagree.
The policys  price was reduced for 2016  because Mrs Ls policy  was amended.  
Accidental Damage and Personal Belongings Cover were  removed from the policy.  So it 
was a different  policy providing different cover. 
Lloyds has also said that, as it was in essence  a new policy being set up (due to the 
amendments), Mrs L also received a new business discount on the premium cost as well.
So it wouldnt be fair for Lloyds to use this different policy cost when  working out its offer.  
Having considered Lloyds offer, I think its fair. It makes sure Mrs L hasnt lost out if Lloyds 
did increase the price  just because she didnt engage at each renewal.
I also think Lloyds additional  compensation offer of £200, that it made  later on for the trouble 
caused to Mrs L, is fair.
Ref: DRN74970623my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Lloyds Bank General Insurance Limiteds offer to refund some 
of the costs of Mrs Ls policy from 2014  is fair.
Lloyds Bank  General Insurance Limiteds additional  compensation  offer of £200 for the 
trouble caused  to Mrs L is also fair. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 October  2019.
