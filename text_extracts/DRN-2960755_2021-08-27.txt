The complaint
Mr B complains about the service he received from National Westminster Bank plc following 
his request to discuss taking a new interest rate on his mortgage.
What happened
Mr B took out his mortgage with NatWest in 2014. When the initial interest rate ended in 
2019, he took a new two-year fixed rate. That was due to end on 30 June 2021.
In late March 2021, Mr B got in touch with NatWest to arrange an appointment at a branch to 
discuss taking a new rate. NatWest told Mr B he could only have a phone appointment. He 
then had to complete some forms, and his appointment was changed to a video call. Mr B 
says he was uncomfortable with this but felt he had no choice but to agree. He also says 
NatWest phoned him during working hours, and he had to take an hour off work for the 
appointment. Mr B says NatWest then wouldnt give him a new rate, its staff were abrupt and 
unprofessional, and it sent him the wrong form when he complained.
NatWest said its adviser had given Mr B the right information during his mortgage 
appointment in April 2021  that is, that he would need to apply for consent to let the 
mortgaged property before it could recommend a new interest rate deal. It apologised for 
sending Mr B a card application form instead of registering his complaint.
Our investigator thought NatWest hadnt done anything wrong in asking Mr B to apply for its 
consent to let the property. She also said it had been reasonable in arranging for meetings to 
take place remotely where possible, rather than at its branches, in the light of the Covid-19 
pandemic and the resulting restrictions. NatWest had apologised for its mistake in sending 
Mr B a form, and she thought that was enough to put things right.
Mr B didnt accept that. He said his complaint is about the poor service he received from 
NatWest and he wanted a review.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First of all, I dont consider NatWest was unreasonable in arranging remote appointments 
where it could for its customers in late March / early April 2021. Various government 
restrictions in response to the Covid-19 pandemic were in place at that time. Ive noted what 
Mr B has said about having felt pressured into agreeing to a video call, but I think it was for 
him to tell NatWest if he was uncomfortable with going ahead on that basis.
I also dont find NatWest did anything wrong in phoning Mr B about his appointment 
beforehand. If Mr B couldnt take calls because he was at work, he could have called back at 
a more convenient time. 
Mr Bs appointment didnt conclude as he had hoped, with a new interest rate agreed. 
NatWest said it couldnt proceed with a recommendation because Mr B told it he was letting 
the mortgaged property, so it required him to apply for its consent to let first. I think that was 
reasonable, and it is provided for in the mortgage terms.  
Mr B had several conversations with NatWest in the course of trying to arrange a new rate, 
and Ive considered what he has said about the standard of service he received and the time 
he spent on the matter, alongside NatWests submissions. NatWest has said sorry for 
sending him a form by mistake, and it invited him to apply for consent to let so it could look 
at a new rate for him. I think that was a fair and reasonable response, and that Mr B might 
reasonably have expected discussing his mortgage arrangements to take time. Having 
considered all the circumstances, I make no order or award.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 September 2021.
