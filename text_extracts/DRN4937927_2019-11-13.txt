Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Rs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 3 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Piggybank disagreed and the complaint was passed to me. Our 
adjudicator also thought  that Piggybank wasnt wrong to contact Mr R about his outstanding 
balance in the way that it did but thought that Piggybank was wrong to continue  adding 
interest to the balance  after it became  aware  that Mr R was struggling  financially.
Ref: DRN49379272my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Piggybank needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Piggybank should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Piggybank was required to establish  whether Mr R could sustainably  repay  his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to do so 
without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
Looking at the circumstances around  loans 1 and 2, I dont think Piggybank  irresponsibly lent 
those loans. Our adjudicator didnt recommend that those loans should be upheld and Mr R 
hasnt disagreed with that finding.
Ref: DRN49379273Piggybank agrees that it shouldnt have  lent Mr R loans 6 to 15 and as it has made  an offer 
in line with what this service recommends in relation to those loans, so those  loans are no 
longer in dispute.
Loans 3 to 5 remain in dispute and from what I can see, Piggybank shouldnt have lent Mr R 
those loans. Ill explain why below.
Piggybank says it checked Mr Rs monthly  income  and expenses  before lending to him. It 
also says it searched Mr Rs credit file and it has provided the results from its search. And I 
think the results of its search  from loan 3 shouldve concerned Piggybank about Mr Rs 
ability to repay that loan and any subsequent  loans.
The results  of the search for loan 3 show that Mr R had three defaults on his file  including 
a recent  one. Mr R had also been borrowing  from other short term lenders and at the time of 
loan 3, he had two other short term loans  outstanding. I can also see that Mr R deferred 
repaying loan 2 when it was due. I think that taking all these factors together  Piggybank 
shouldve reasonably been  aware that Mr R was unlikely  to sustainably repay loans 3 to 5 
and it shouldnt have  lent to him.
 
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 3 to 5 and Piggybank  should  put things right 
on loans 6 to 15 as well.
Mr Rs financial  difficulties
Mr R has said Piggybank  didnt treat him fairly when he fell into financial difficulties. 
Piggybank in its final response  letter  says it put Mr Rs account on hold for more than 80 
days.
I can see that Piggybank  contacted Mr R when the repayment on his loan (loan 15) was due 
in December 2017 and as it didnt  receive  payment or hear from Mr R, it sent several  emails  
and text messages  reminding Mr R about  his outstanding balance. Mr R contacted  
Piggybank to say he had an accident  and would repay the loan on his next pay day. 
I can see that Piggybank  put his account  on hold but didnt receive  payment  or contact from 
Mr R as agreed. Piggybank again  sent several emails and text messages about  the arrears  
but it didnt hear from Mr R until 22 February  2018 when he said he was in financial 
difficulties.
Piggybank placed his account on hold again but as Mr R didnt contact Piggybank  to agree a 
payment plan, the account came off hold and the interest charges were back  dated and 
Piggybank continued to try to contact Mr R.
I can see that Piggybank  was unable to reach Mr R until he complained  about  his loans.
Having thought about how Piggybank treated Mr R when it was aware he was in financial 
difficulties, I dont think Piggybank was wrong in its attempts to contact  Mr R in the way that 
it did and from what I can see, it was willing to work with Mr R when he kept Piggybank  
updated on his circumstances.  
But I think it was unfair  for Piggybank to backdate  and continue to add interest to the loan 
after 22 February 2018  when it was made  aware that Mr R was in financial difficulties. The 
redress Ive set out below takes  this into account and should put things right in that regard.
Ref: DRN49379274putting things right  what Piggybank needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 3 to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
as theres an outstanding balance on loan 15, Piggybank should remove all interest 
and charges added and treat any payments Mr R made as payments towards the 
principal. If theres  still an outstanding balance after this, Piggybank  may use the 
redress for other loans  to offset  the balance. Piggybank may only offset any 
outstanding balance if it still owns the debt;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 to 5 from Mr Rs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 15 should be removed from 
Mr Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Piggybank to take off tax from this interest.  Piggybank 
must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. DJS (UK) LTD should  
pay Mr R compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 December  2019.
