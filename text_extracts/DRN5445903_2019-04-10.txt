K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs H complain that National  Westminster  Bank Plc (NatWest) has treated them  
unfairly. 
In particular, they said NatWest has unfairly offered lower  interest  rate mortgage products to 
new customers than it offers to existing  mortgage customers.
background
In late 2018 NatWest wrote to Mr and Mrs H. It said that their two year fixed rate mortgage 
product was due to end shortly. 
Mr H says he looked at the new fixed rate products available to existing mortgage 
customers. As existing  customers  one of the products  Mr and Mrs H were eligible for was a 
rate of 1.90% fixed for two years.
Mr H felt the rates offered  by NatWest were higher than those offered by other  lenders. He 
also noted that NatWest  would  have  offered a two year fixed rate of 1.54% if he was a new 
mortgage customer.
Mr H felt this was unfair and complained. He said he didnt think  NatWests policy met with 
the Financial Conduct Authoritys  (FCA) requirement  to Treat customers fairly.
NatWest didnt uphold  Mr Hs complaint. It said that it is entitled to make  a commercial 
decision to offer lower  mortgage rates to attract new customers.  It noted  that new customers  
would incur additional charges including survey and legal fees if they wanted to take out a 
mortgage with NatWest. But existing customers could transfer to a new mortgage product 
without incurring these  costs.
Mr H wasnt satisfied with NatWests response and brought  his complaint to this service. He 
explained that Mrs H was unwell. He said this meant  they felt pressured  into accepting  a 
new mortgage product  from NatWest,  rather than re-mortgaging with a different lender.
Our adjudicator sympathised with Mr and Mrs Hs situation. But he said NatWest  was 
entitled to offer lower rates to new customers.
Mr H wasnt satisfied with our adjudicators  view.  He reiterated that he didnt feel NatWest 
was meeting the FCAs requirement to treat customers fairly (TCF).  He also provided  
information that showed if he applied  for a NatWest mortgage product via an intermediary he 
would be able to apply for a lower rate than if he applied directly.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I am sympathetic to Mr Hs position  and I can see that he feels strongly about this matter.  
But I dont think this complaint can be upheld. Ill explain why.
Ref: DRN54459032As our adjudicator has explained,  lenders are entitled to make  commercial decisions on 
which products to offer, and which groups of customers to make  certain  products available  
to. 
The information Mr H has provided also shows that NatWest offers lower interest rate 
products to customers with a lower loan to value.  And it offers  lower  interest  rate products to 
owner occupiers  than it offers  to buy to let customers. 
These are commercial decisions that NatWest is entitled to make. Likewise it is entitled to 
offer lower  interest rate products  to new customers.
I appreciate that Mr H feels this is unfair. But he does not have to apply for any of the rates 
offered by NatWest and he can choose to move  his mortgage elsewhere  if he is unhappy 
with the products available  to him from NatWest.
I note Mr H has said Mrs H is unwell and this has meant he feels pressured into taking out a 
new mortgage product  with NatWest, rather than re-mortgaging  with a new lender. If Mr and 
Mrs H are experiencing financial difficulty I would encourage  them to discuss this with 
NatWest. 
I can only uphold Mr Hs complaint if I think NatWest has done something wrong or treated 
Mr and Mrs H unfairly.  Although I am sympathetic to Mr Hs position I cant  reasonably say 
that NatWest is not allowed to offer different mortgage rates to different groups of customers.
my final decision
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision  before  10 May 2019.
My decision  is that, for the reasons I have set out above, I do not uphold this complaint.
