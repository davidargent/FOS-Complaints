The complaint
Mr H had complained that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has limited his account.
What happened
The details of the complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead, I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the investigators opinion for broadly the same reasons. I will 
explain why.
PayPal has provided evidenced to show that Mr H has two accounts with PayPal. The first 
account, PayPal blocked due to Mr H having a negative standing. Mr H then proceeded to 
open a second account, and this account too now has a negative standing. Having reviewed 
PayPals user agreement, which Mr H would have had to agree to in order to open an 
account states that PayPal is able to limit, restrict or terminate accounts or use of its services 
if money is owed  on account. As such, I cant reasonably conclude that PayPal has acted 
unfairly in relation to placing a limit on Mr Hs account. 
However, I have also considered the fact Mr H did try to contact PayPal via its online 
message portal to enquire about paying his outstanding balance, as he no longer had 
access to his account. It appears this conversation was closed without a response from 
PayPal. I appreciate PayPal has explained that Mr H was aware of his outstanding debt on 
his previous account and had been paying the outstanding balance using a monthly debt 
management service. However, Mr H was enquiring how to pay his new outstanding balance 
and given the fact Mr H had reached out to ask PayPal how to do this, I think it would have 
been good service to have either provided him with an answer, or at least advise him that he 
needed to call the customer service number. Instead Mr H was left wondering why his 
question and concerns had been ignored. 
Putting things right
With that in mind I do think PayPal could have provided more support and a better service in 
relation to this for Mr H. As such, I think it is reasonable to conclude, that Mr H was left 
confused about how to move forward with his account. As such, I agree with the investigator 
that PayPal should pay Mr H £40 for the inconvenience it has caused. However, in regards 
to the limit on Mr Hs account, I can see that PayPal has now provided Mr H with a contact 
number to call, as such I wont be asking PayPal to do anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and require PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
to pay Mr H £40. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 May 2022.
