*combined repayments on overlapping loans
Miss O complained she found it difficult to keep up with the Sunny loan repayments, and she 
had to borrow from other lenders. Miss O told us that she was spending more than she was 
earning, and she would repay and reborrow loans, which led to a cycle of dependency.
When Sunny looked at Miss Os complaint, it first of all said that it had carried out full 
affordability checks on all the loans and it didnt uphold Miss Os complaint.
Miss O was unhappy with this response and she brought her complaint to us.
Our adjudicator didnt feel that hed seen enough to say it was unfair for Sunny to provide 
loans 1 - 4 to Miss O. But he thought that loan 5 onwards shouldnt have been lent to her  
and he explained how hed come to this view. 
Our adjudicator also gave some detailed instructions about the way he thought Sunny 
should settle the complaint. 
Sunny didnt agree with everything in our adjudicators view letter  but it said that after 
reviewing this complaint it now believed it wouldve been prudent to have done things 
differently after Miss Os 11th loan. And Sunny offered to uphold the complaint from loan 11 
onwards. Sunny sent details showing how it had worked out the refund it was willing to pay 
Miss O in settlement of her complaint. 
We passed this information on to Miss O  but shes told us she doesnt want to settle the 
complaint on this basis and shed like a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss O could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Miss O could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the  relevant regulations define sustainable as being without 
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, 
while meeting other reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Os complaint.
For loans 1-4, Ive looked at what it appears Miss O told Sunny about her financial 
circumstances and the repayment amounts she had to make. Taking this information into 
account, and bearing in mind that this was early on in her lending relationship with Sunny, 
I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for Sunny to ask Miss O for the amount of 
information that would be needed to show the lending was unsustainable before agreeing 
these loans. 
These loans all looked comfortably affordable for Miss O, based on what shed said to Sunny 
about her finances - even taking into account the combined monthly repayments. So I agree 
with our adjudicator that there isnt enough information for me to be able to say that Sunny 
shouldnt have lent Miss O any of the first four loans. 
Like our adjudicator, I dont agree it was reasonable for Sunny to provide loan 5. At this 
point, I think Sunny shouldve realised that it was clear from looking at Miss Os borrowing 
history that she was likely having money problems. 
I say this because by the time she asked for loan 5, Miss O already had three other 
outstanding short term loans with Sunny  and now she was asking for further borrowing. 
This suggests to me that Miss O was finding it hard to get on top of her money problems and 
her financial difficulties were likely ongoing  and escalating.  
So although the loan mightve appeared affordable, I think that Sunny shouldve realised that 
Miss Os borrowing record painted a picture of someone struggling with debt and despite 
what shed told Sunny about her finances, it showed that Miss O was having serious 
problems managing her money. So Sunny shouldve seen that the indications were that 
loan 5  and any further lending, wasnt likely to be sustainably affordable for Miss O. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss O, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. Given the particular circumstances of Miss Os case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
Miss O wasnt managing to repay her loans sustainably - she had taken out six loans 
in around fourteen months
whilst she had repaid some loans early, she was taking out new loans shortly after 
repaying previous loans and she had overlapping loans
the loan amounts went up and down  but the overall the amount of Miss Os 
borrowing was going up
I think this suggests she needed to borrow to meet her repayments and ongoing 
costs. 
 
I think that Miss O lost out when Sunny provided loan 6 because:
this loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Os indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time. 
the number of loans Miss O borrowed was likely to impact adversely on her ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept Miss O in the market for high-cost loans. By 
loan 6 any further borrowing was likely to be detrimental to Miss Os credit rating. 
 
So I dont think that Sunnys offer to uphold the complaint from loan 11 onwards goes far 
enough to put things right for Miss O and Im upholding Miss Os complaint about loan 5 
onwards.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do 
 A) add together the total of the repayments made by Miss O towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 5 - 14, but not including anything already refunded
 
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss O which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss O originally made the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled
 
C) pay Miss O the total of A plus B
 
D) remove any adverse information Sunny recorded on Miss Os credit file in relation to 
loan 5. The overall pattern of Miss Os borrowing for loans 6 to 14 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans entirely from Miss Os 
credit file. 
 
*HMRC requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. If Miss O asks Sunny for a 
certificate showing how much tax has been taken off, Sunny should provide this. 
My final decisionFor the reasons given above, Im upholding Miss Os complaint about loans 5 - 14. 
Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) should take the steps Ive set out 
above to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss O to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 April 2020.
