The complaint
Mr S complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as MoneyBoat) was 
irresponsible to lend him money he couldnt afford to pay back.
What happened
Mr S took out a loan with MoneyBoat as follows:

amountLoan amount

When Mr S complained to MoneyBoat, it didnt agree that it had done anything wrong, but it 
offered to remove the interest due on his outstanding loan as a gesture of goodwill. 
MoneyBoat said this would reduce the outstanding balance from £422.70 to £247.17 and so 
help Mr S reduce his outstanding debt quicker. It allowed him a short space of time to agree 
to this offer - failing which it said it would pursue the full amount owing. 
Mr S didnt feel this offer went far enough to resolve his complaint  he wanted a refund and 
compensation as he said hed been made unwell with depression and hed had to see his 
doctor as a result. So he brought his complaint to us and one of our adjudicators 
investigated.
Our adjudicator felt that MoneyBoat shouldnt have provided the loan to Mr S given that the 
checks MoneyBoat did showed that Mr S was having problems managing his money. He 
said MoneyBoat saw that Mr S was borrowing from other short-term lenders and already had 
a number of outstanding short-term loans. Our adjudicator felt that in these circumstances, 
MoneyBoat ought to have realised it was unlikely Mr S would be able to sustainably repay 
this loan.
Our adjudicator set out the steps he said MoneyBoat should take to put things right for Mr S. 
MoneyBoat disagreed with our adjudicators view. It mainly said it did proportionate checks 
and that whilst we might say it should've looked at all the information it had, it was 
impractical for it to review every line of a credit file. MoneyBoat told us that the early stages 
of lending were automated.
MoneyBoat has asked for a review so this complaint comes to me to make a final decision. 
We havent heard anything further from Mr S in response to our adjudicators view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S 
could repay the loan in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income) 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
MoneyBoat was required to establish whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. 
But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is because the relevant regulations 
define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should 
be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, as well 
as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
MoneyBoat asked Mr S to provide details of his income and to tell MoneyBoat what he 
normally spent each month. It carried out credit checks and boosted his expenses figure to 
allow an extra safety margin when assessing what Mr S could afford to repay. After doing this, looking at what MoneyBoat knew about Mr Ss income and expenditure, 
Mr S appeared to still have around £378 of disposable income  after spending around £250 
on other credit. 
But I think MoneyBoat could see that information looked to be at odds with the information 
shown on its credit checks that MoneyBoat sent to us. Mr S had a total of 47 accounts 17 of 
those had been taken out within the previous 6 months  and 15 were active when he 
applied for this loan.
I think its fair to say that MoneyBoat could see that Mr S had been relying significantly on 
short term loans, including payday loans, for some time. 
And MoneyBoat could see from the credit checks it did that Mr S had multiple other short-
term high cost loans outstanding when he asked to borrow this loan from MoneyBoat. 
This type of borrowing is intended to provide short term financial help in the event of 
temporary money problems. 
So I think the information MoneyBoat had gathered about Mr Ss credit history shouldve 
made MoneyBoat realise that it looked like Mr S was having problems managing his money. 
Ive carefully considered what MoneyBoat has said about this. But I think that as it had 
information showing the extent of Mr Ss other short term borrowing this should reasonably 
have led MoneyBoat to the conclusion that what Mr S said about his financial situation was 
highly inaccurate and that it was likely that Mr S was facing serious problems managing his 
money.
I dont think it was reasonable for MoneyBoat to conclude that it was likely that Mr S would 
be able to repay this loan in a sustainable way. 
The fact that MoneyBoat declined a number of other loan applications made by Mr S doesn't 
mean that the loan it did provide was affordable and fairly loaned to him. 
I think thats borne out by the fact that MoneyBoats contact notes show that before even his 
first payment was due, Mr S cancelled the arrangement hed set up for this and contacted 
MoneyBoat to say he couldnt afford that weeks payment. 
And he didnt ever manage to pay the contractual monthly repayments  the biggest single 
repayment he managed was for just £20. 
As far as I am aware, unless the information I've seen has since been updated, it looks like 
he hasnt paid more than about £74 in total towards this loan.
For the reasons I've explained, I dont think MoneyBoat shouldve granted this loan to Mr S.
I think it is fair and reasonable for Mr S to repay the principal amount that he borrowed 
because he had the benefit of that lending. But he has had to pay interest (and possibly 
charges) on a loan that shouldnt have been provided to him  so thats unfair. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress MoneyBoat should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened if it hadnt provided lending to Mr S, as Im satisfied it ought to have.Clearly there are a great many possible and all hypothetical answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mr S may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere. 
If this wasnt a viable option, he may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or 
relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, he may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). 
But even if he had done that, the information that would have been available to such a 
lender and how they would (or ought to have) treated an application which may or may not 
have been the same is now impossible to reconstruct accurately. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and 
substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Mr S in a compliant 
way at this time. 
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mr S would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. 
So it wouldnt be fair now to reduce MoneyBoats liability in this case for what Im satisfied it 
has done wrong and should put right.
If MoneyBoat has sold the outstanding debt it should buy it back before doing what I have 
outlined below.
If MoneyBoat isnt able to buy the debt back then it should liaise with the new debt owner to 
achieve the following: 
A. Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on the loan and treat any 
repayments made by Mr S as though they had been repayments of the principal. 
B. If this results in Mr S having made overpayments then these should be refunded with 
8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the 
overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 
C. If there is still an outstanding balance owed in respect of the loan then the amounts 
calculated in "A" should be used to repay this. Any surplus should be paid to Mr S. 
And if (as seems likely to me) there is still an outstanding balance then MoneyBoat 
should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr S - bearing in mind the 
need to treat him positively and sympathetically in those discussions if he still needs 
further time to pay. 
D. Remove all adverse entries from Mr Ss credit file for this loan once it is repaid - and 
ask the debt purchaser to do the same if MoneyBoat sold this loan. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decisionI uphold this complaint and direct Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as 
MoneyBoat) to take the steps set out above to put things right for Mr S.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2021.
