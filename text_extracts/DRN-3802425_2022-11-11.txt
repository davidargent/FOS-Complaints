The complaint
A company Ill refer to as U complains that National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) 
blocked and closed its account, without warning and without explaining why.
U is represented by its director, Mr T.
What happened
Mr T says Us account was blocked on 14 September 2020 then closed shortly after, and 
that NatWest didnt release the funds in the account until 5 January 2021. He said being 
denied access to the funds in the account damaged his business severely. He said it left him 
with only a credit card and another account with a modest balance, and that he couldnt pay 
salaries and couldnt trade. He also said Us account continued to accrue bank charges for 
services it didnt receive.
NatWest didnt uphold Us complaint, so Mr T came to our service. Our investigator accepted 
NatWest was entitled to block and close the account, but she didnt think it had acted 
promptly in releasing the account balance to Mr T. She said it should pay interest at a rate of 
8% on the account funds for the period during which she felt it had unfairly retained the 
funds. And that it should pay U £250 for the inconvenience caused to U as a result of the 
delays.
Mr T didnt accept our investigators findings. He said the compensation didnt reflect the 
impact that the block and account closure had on his business. He asked for an ombudsman 
to review matters afresh.
On 31 October 2022, I issued a provisional decision. In it, I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Account closure
Just as a customer may close an account with a bank, a bank is entitled to close an account 
with a customer. But when it closes the account, it must do so in a way which complies with 
the terms and conditions of the account.
Having considered the information NatWest has provided, Im satisfied it acted in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of Us account when it closed the same. It doesnt 
have to explain the reasons to U, so I cant say it treated U unfairly by not disclosing the 
reasons for its decision. I hope Mr T can take some comfort knowing that an independent 
third party has reviewed NatWests actions, but Im afraid I cant reasonably share the results 
of my investigation with Mr T, save to say that Im satisfied NatWest acted fairly in all of the 
circumstances.
NatWest has provided our service with a copy of the letter it issued, and Im satisfied it did 
write to U with notice that its account would close in 7 days. It might be that Mr T didnt 
receive the notice, but Im satisfied NatWest correctly dispatched the letter and I dont hold it 
responsible for a failure for the letter to be delivered, if thats what happened. And in any 
event, Im satisfied that NatWest would have been entitled to close the accounts with no 
notice, so even if it didnt send a letter, I wouldnt uphold this part of Mr Us complaint.
I can see that U took out a Bounceback Loan (BBL) in May 2020. But Im satisfied NatWest 
didnt take any action in relation to the BBL that it wouldnt have taken if it hadnt blocked and 
closed Us account. The BBL repayments are now in arrears, but NatWest has offered U 
repayment options in line with what I would expect so Im satisfied it hasnt treated U unfairly 
in that regard.
Mr T also complained that he didnt receive notice that NatWest would be blocking Us 
account. But, given the nature of the regulations with which NatWest must comply when 
reviewing accounts, it wouldnt be appropriate to forewarn customers of impending blocks. 
So, its not unfair that NatWest didnt warn Mr T. I recognise this impacted his business and I 
dont dispute that it would have impacted his ability to trade day to day. Ive listened to what 
Mr T has said about the impact the block had on his business, and I understand why hes 
unhappy with NatWest.
But I cant ask NatWest to compensate U for the impact its actions had on U, given Ive said 
Im satisfied it was acting in accordance with the terms and conditions of the account, as well 
as in line with its legal and regulatory obligations. Ultimately, NatWest was entitled to take 
the actions it did so I cant fairly say it did anything wrong. 
Access to funds
Before a bank releases funds held in a customers account, its entitled to carry out checks to 
ensure its complying with its legal and regulatory obligations. And banks will follow their 
internal procedures before they release funds.
Mr T has confirmed he received the correct account balance, but hes not happy at the time 
it took NatWest to release his money. NatWest has explained why there was a delay in 
releasing the funds, but Im not persuaded it couldnt have acted more quickly. It received 
Us signed funds release form on 12 October 2020 but delayed until 18 December 2020 
before releasing the funds. And I havent seen justification from NatWest that persuades me 
the delay was reasonable.
Because this complaint is brought by U, a limited company, and because the contract was 
between NatWest and U, not NatWest and Mr T, I cant award compensation for any distress 
experienced by Mr T. But I can award compensation for the inconvenience U experienced as 
a result of NatWests actions.
Im satisfied U experienced inconvenience as a result of the delay, given it was unable to 
trade normally, and given its director was diverted away from his usual duties. So, Im 
minded to tell NatWest to pay £250 in recognition of the inconvenience caused. And 8% 
simple interest to make up for U being deprived of the use of its funds.
Charges
Mr T did originally complain that NatWest applied charges to his account while it was 
blocked (i.e. that he was charged for services he didnt receive). NatWest appears to have 
refunded at least some of the charges, and Mr T told our investigator the charges were no 
longer in dispute when she contacted him to discuss the point. Given Mr T has asked our 
service to focus on the other points of his complaint, and not to look into the charges any 
further, I wont make any findings on this point. But Mr T can make representations in response to this provisional decision if he wishes to change his mind.
I understand why Mr T is upset at NatWests actions and I have sympathy for the position he 
found himself in. I recognise it impacted his business and it is of course understandable that 
he wants to know why NatWest did what it did and that he feels he should have been given 
advanced notice. But for the reasons Ive set out above, I cant reasonably say NatWest 
acted unfairly. It complied with its legal and regulatory obligations, as well as the terms and 
conditions of the account, so I cant hold it responsible for any losses suffered as a result.
With that being said, I do think it should have released the account balance more quicky. 
And I accept the delay in releasing funds caused inconvenience to U, and deprived it of 
funds it could have used to carry our business activities. To put matters right, it should 
compensate U for the inconvenience caused, and for depriving U of access to its money
I asked both parties to submit any further evidence or arguments they wish me to consider 
by 7 November 2022. NatWest didnt have anything to add and Mr T didnt respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Because neither party made further submissions, I see no reason to change my provisional 
findings.
My final decision
Im not persuaded NatWest treated U unfairly by blocking and closing Us account, but I do 
think it should have released the account balance more quickly.
So, to put things right NatWest must pay U:
1. £250 for the inconvenience its delay caused U; and
2. Simple interest at a rate of 8% on the account balance from 12 October 2020 to 18

Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask U to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2022.
