K821x#15complaint
Miss G and Mr B say OneSavings Bank Plc (trading  as Kent Reliance) mis-sold them a 
mortgage payment  protection insurance (PPI) policy.
background
This complaint is about a regular premium  PPI policy taken out with a mortgage  in 2004.   
The policy gave Miss G and Mr B protection in case of accident, sickness or unemployment.
Our adjudicator upheld  the complaint. OneSavings Bank disagreed with the adjudicators 
opinion.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Miss G and Mr Bs case.
Ive decided to uphold Miss G and Mr Bs complaint because  I dont  think  its likely 
OneSavings Bank gave  Miss G and Mr B clear enough information about the PPI.
Miss G and Mr B were  told by OneSavings  Bank, they had to take PPI, to get the mortgage. 
This was because of their level of borrowing. They had the option not to take the mortgage. 
But, if they wanted this particular mortgage, they had to have PPI. So, I think it was even 
more important that OneSavings Bank  made the terms  and conditions of the PPI clear  to 
them, given the circumstances they found themselves in.
OneSavings Bank says the leaflet Miss G and Mr B wouldve been given set out the 
important features of the PPI. But I dont think this information was enough. 
Mr B was self-employed at the time PPI was taken. To make a successful claim for 
unemployment benefit Mr Bs business wouldve had to involuntarily  stopped  trading, been  in 
the process of being wound  up, or put in the hands  of an insolvency practitioner.  He 
wouldve also had to declare this to the Inland  Revenue, and registered for Job Seekers 
Allowance. So, I think it was much harder for Mr B to make  a successful claim for 
unemployment benefit, under the policy, than it was for an employed  person. 
I dont think Miss G and Mr B would have  bought  the PPI if theyd had enough information 
about it. I dont think  they wouldve thought this product  right for them if Mr B may not able to 
make a claim for everything he thought he was covered for under the policy.  So, I think they 
have lost out because of what  OneSavings Bank did wrong.

OneSavings Bank Plc should put Miss G and Mr B in the position theyd be in now if they 
hadnt taken out PPI. The policy should  be cancelled,  if it hasnt been  cancelled already, and 
OneSavings Bank should:
Pay Miss G and Mr B the amount they paid each month for the PPI.
Add simple interest to each payment from when they paid it until they get it back.  The 
rate of interest is 8% a year.
If Miss G and Mr B made a successful claim under  the PPI policy,  OneSavings Bank  can 
take off what they got for the claim from the amount it owes them.  
If OneSavings Bank has already repaid any commission amount to Miss G and Mr B that 
relates to this PPI sale, that sum can be deducted by OneSavings Bank from the redress 
shown above.  
 HM Revenue  & Customs  requires OneSavings Bank to take off tax from this interest.  
OneSavings Bankmust give Miss G and Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken 
off if they ask for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I uphold Miss G and Mr Bs complaint. OneSavings Bank  Plc 
should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss G and Mr B 
to accept or reject my decision before 27 April 2019.
