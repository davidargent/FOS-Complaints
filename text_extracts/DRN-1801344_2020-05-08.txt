The complaint
 Mr R complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) acted 
irresponsibly when it gave him unaffordable loans.                         
What happened
This complaint is about loans Sunny provided to Mr R between August 2014 and November 
2017. The amounts borrowed ranged between £50 - £400  with most of Mr Rs borrowing 
falling in-between. 
Mr R first opened a running credit loan  an account that allowed him to borrow when he 
wanted to up to an agreed credit limit. Each time he made a withdrawal on the account he 
had to pay back that borrowing in 5 months. This account ran from August 2014 to March 
2015. 
Around 7 months or so later, Mr R started borrowing from Sunny again  this time he took 
out a number of instalment loans (sometimes with long gaps in-between loans). These loans 
were due to be repaid in 14 monthly repayments  although all were repaid early.

Our adjudicator investigated and came to the overall view that up until loan 10 Sunny hadnt 
been wrong to lend to Mr R, but that the pattern of lending itself showed that from loan 10 
onwards the borrowing was unsustainable  so Sunny shouldnt have given Mr R loan 10 
and loan 11. Our adjudicator set out the steps he felt Sunny should take to put things right 
for Mr R.
Sunny hasnt responded to our adjudicators view so the complaint comes to me to make a 
final decision. 
What I've decided - and why 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income) 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet 
repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
Like the adjudicator, I think the gaps in lending after the running credit account closed and 
between loans 3 and 4 and loans 4 and 5 were long enough for Sunny reasonably to think 
that Mr R mightve put his finances in order as it looked like he hadnt been dependent on 
high cost short term loans during those periods. This meant that when his borrowing began 
again, it looked like Mr R was effectively starting over. So I think it was fair for Sunny to treat 
his applications for loan 2, loan 4 and loan 5 as the start of new chains of borrowing and 
assess his lending requests accordingly. 
I agree with what our adjudicator said about the loans Sunny provided to Mr R before it gave 
him loan 10 in October 2017. And as it seems Mr R hasnt objected to what our adjudicator 
has said about these loans, then I don't think I need say more about them.  
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr R, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think by loan 10 Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was likely to be unsustainable and it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. I say this because at this point Sunny ought to have 
realised:
Mr R was not managing to repay his loans sustainably. Since April 2017 he had 
taken out 6 loans in around 6 months 
 
although he repaid his loans earlier than the agreed term, successfully repaying his 
loans doesnt mean Mr R managed to do so in a sustainable way. And borrowing and 
repaying this number of loans early suggests to me that Mr Rs finances were not in a 
stable position.
 
the loan amounts went up and down  but overall Mr R wasnt making any real 
inroads into the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 10 was for four times the amount hed 
borrowed when he took out loan 5 at the start of this chain of borrowing - and he was 
still also paying loan 9 
 so it wasnt reasonable of Sunny to think his situation had improved and Mr R was 
now asking to borrow because of a new need for a short term loan - rather this 
pattern of borrowing suggested he had ongoing money problems 
 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely that Mr R was borrowing further to 
cover the hole repaying previous loans was leaving in his finances and that Mr Rs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
 
I think that Mr R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 10 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time. 
 
the number of loans which Mr R borrowed was likely to have negative implications on 
Mr Rs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans. Mr R had already borrowed six loans in a row. And any further 
borrowing was likely to be detrimental to his credit rating.
 
So Im upholding the complaint about loan 10 and loan 11 and Sunny should put things right. 
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr R towards interest, fees and 
charges on loan 10 and loan 11, not including anything it has already refunded.
 
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr R which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr R originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
 
C. Pay Mr R the total of "A" plus "B".
 
D. The overall pattern of Mr Rs borrowing from the point of loan 10 means any 
information recorded about loan 10 and loan 11 is adverse. So all entries about 
loan 10 and loan 11 should be removed from Mr Rs credit file.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Rs complaint about loan 10 and loan 11. 
Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) should pay Mr R as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 June 2020.Susan Webb
