The complaint
Mrs D complains about the way Ikano Bank AB (publ) dealt with a late payment on her credit 
card account.
What happened
Mrs D had a credit card - branded with the name of a high street retailer - which was issued 
by Ikano. As Ikano is ultimately responsible for this complaint, Ill refer to it throughout.
The details of this complaint are well known to the parties so Ill only provide a summary 
here.
Mrs Ds credit card fell into arrears and Ikano sent her a letter to let her know 
She contacted Ikano and said she hadnt received any statements showing a balance 
outstanding
Ikano told her it moved to emailed statements some time before and had advised its 
customers accordingly
It became apparent the email address it had on file for Mrs D was an old one so she 
hadnt received the statements
She cleared the balance on the card and asked for the account to be closed
Shortly after, she received a letter which said shed entered into a payment plan and 
gave her the address of debt management and emotional support charities
Mrs D says she was very distressed by this letter and worried the payment plan 
would affect her credit file
She complained to Ikano and it apologised, explaining it was a standard letter and 
confirmed the debt was repaid and there wouldnt be any impact on her credit file but 
Mrs D remained unhappy
Our investigator said she thought Ikano should pay Mrs D £50 for the distress its 
letter caused her but Ikano disagreed and asked an ombudsman to make a decision
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive not seen anything to suggest Ikano made an error when using the email address 
it did to let Mrs D know about the move to emailed statements
Ikano says the letter sent to Mrs D about the payment plan - after the debt has 
already been paid - was an automatic part of its process
If it wasnt sent, it says Mrs D would have been subject to further calls and letters 
asking her to clear the debt
While I acknowledge what Ikano says here, it seems strange and counter intuitive to 
me that having cleared the debt, Mrs D would be sent a letter saying shed entered 
into a payment plan
I understand why this would have upset her particularly given the apparent 
seriousness of the letter with details of the charities mentioned above
I also understand why she was worried her credit file may have been affected and 
while the issue was resolved quickly, I think Ikano caused trouble and upset when it 
sent this letter to Mrs D
Putting things right
Im satisfied £50 is a fair and reasonable amount for Ikano to pay Mrs D to reflect this trouble 
and upset.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct Ikano Bank AB (publ) to pay Mrs D 
£50 trouble and upset for the reasons Ive explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 May 2021.
