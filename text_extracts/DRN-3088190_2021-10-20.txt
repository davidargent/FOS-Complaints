The complaint
Mrs P complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) wouldnt provide a refund 
for a purchase. 
What happened
In March 2021, Mrs P bought an item from a seller in Italy for EUR435.76 and paid by 
PayPal. It was the incorrect item for what she wanted. She opened a case with PayPal for its 
return on 31 March 2021. On 1 April 2021, PayPal asked Mrs P to send the item back to the 
seller. She despatched the item to Italy. She gave the tracking number to PayPal. On 16 
April 2021, Mrs P was advised that the item was held in customs in Milan. PayPal declined 
her claim for a refund. On 23 September 2021, Mrs P received the item back from Italy.
Mrs P complained. Shed made a Significantly Not As Described claim with PayPal. She 
said shed done everything that PayPal asked of her  as she provided proof of postage and 
marked the package Returned Cargo - as instructed by PayPal. It wasnt her fault that the 
package had got stuck in customs. She paid the return postage as asked by PayPal.
PayPal said theyd declined Mrs Ps claim in line with their User Agreement  which said that 
theyd provide a refund where the buyer provides proof of delivery back to the seller. In this 
case, Mrs P had only provided proof of postage  so hadnt complied with what was needed. 
In this case, the customs house was in Milan  780 kms from the sellers address, so the 
seller couldnt be expected to collect it.
Mrs P brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said PayPal hadnt acted fairly. Mrs P 
had done all she could to return the item to the seller. He could see that PayPals terms and 
conditions quoted that there must be proof of delivery (not just proof of despatch)  but in 
this case, he felt that PayPal should refund Mrs P with the cost of the item.
PayPal didnt agree. They said theyd acted in line with their User Agreement  and Mrs P 
hadnt provided proof of delivery. They asked that an ombudsman look at Mrs Ps complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of Mrs Ps complaint is that she returned the item to the seller in Italy and provided 
proof of despatch. But because it was held at customs, it wasnt delivered to the seller. So  
there wasnt proof of delivery. 
Theres no doubt here that PayPals User Agreement asks for proof of delivery  for them to 
give a refund. It says If you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a 
seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the Resolution Centre 
to pursue a claim under PayPal Buyer Protection The steps you must follow are described 
below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:
Step 4: Comply with PayPal's shipping requests in a timely manner, if you're filing a 
Significantly Not as Described claim. PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the 
item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to 
provide proof of delivery...
Proof of Delivery Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:
Date of delivery and delivered status
An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or zip/postal 
code (or international equivalent).
So  PayPal acted in line with their User Agreement in declining Mrs Ps request for a 
refund.  So, we have a situation here where PayPal have followed their normal processes. 
There are valid arguments on both sides  from both PayPal and Mrs P. But while PayPal 
has followed their processes here, strictly following a procedure or process can lead to an 
unfair outcome for a customer in the individual circumstances of their situation. I think thats 
whats happened here.
Mrs P returned the item to the address of the seller  so she did all that PayPal asked of her 
and followed their instructions accurately. It wasnt her fault that the item got stuck in 
customs, or that the customs house was a long way from the sellers address. So, in fact, it 
wasnt possible for her to give proof of delivery.
And so, on balance, I think that PayPal should refund the amount paid by Mrs P.
Putting things right
PayPal should refund Mrs P the cost of the purchase of the item  this was EUR435.76. The 
amount refunded should be the GBP amount that Mrs P paid for the item in March 2021. 
This is so she doesnt suffer a loss on the exchange rate if rates have moved against her in 
the meantime.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must:
Refund the amount paid by Mrs P from her PayPal account on 21 March 2021  the 
GBP equivalent of EUR435.76
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 November 2021.
