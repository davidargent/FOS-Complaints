K821x#15complaint
This complaints about a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy taken out with a credit  
card in 1998. Mr L says NewDay Ltd mis-sold  him the PPI.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Ls case.
Having done so, Ive decided the policy wasnt mis-sold. Ill explain why. 
I dont have a copy of the credit agreement Mr L signed, which  isnt surprising given  how 
long ago the sale took place.  However,  NewDays provided a copy  of a sample  
agreement it says Mr L would  have seen. Overall, on balance  I believe the PPI was 
presented to Mr L as optional and that he likely decided to take it out. 
I dont believe NewDay recommend the PPI to Mr L so it didnt have to check  if it was 
right for him. But it did have  to make sure Mr L got the information he needed to decide if 
it was right for him. 
Its possible the information NewDay gave Mr L about the PPI wasnt  as clear as it 
should have been.  But I think he likely chose to take out the PPI  so he wanted this type 
of cover.  Based on what Ive seen of his circumstances at the time it doesnt look like he 
was affected by any of the exclusions to, or limits on, the PPI cover  so it would have 
been useful for him if something  went  wrong. It also looks  like the PPI was affordable.  I 
dont think better  information  about  the PPI would  have  put him off taking out the cover, 
despite the employer benefits and family help he says hed have received. 
This means NewDay doesnt  have to pay back all of the cost of the PPI to Mr L.
But NewDay  will pay back some  of the cost of the PPI to Mr L because: 
NewDay got a high level of commission and profit  share (more than 50% of the PPI 
premium)  so it should have told Mr L about that. Because NewDay didnt  tell Mr L, that 
was unfair. 
To put that right, NewDays  basically offered to pay back  the amount of commission and 
profit share that was above 50% of the PPI premium  and I think  that offers  fair in this 
case.
Ive thought about everything Mr Ls said  but these points dont change my decision and, 
for the reasons set out above,  I dont  think the PPI was mis-sold.
what the business needs  to do
NewDay has to pay back to Mr L any commission and profit  share it got that was more than 
50% of the PPI premium, if it hasnt already done  so. NewDay should also pay back to Mr L 
any extra  interest  he paid because of that.
Ref: DRN75461682NewDay should re-work the credit card account  and pay back  to Mr L the difference  between 
what Mr L owes and what he would have  owed if the commission  and profit  share it got 
hadnt been over 50% of the cost of the PPI. NewDay should also pay Mr L 8%* simple 
interest if he paid off his credit card at some  point.
*Businesses have to take basic rate tax off this interest. Mr L can claim  back  the tax he doesnt pay tax.
my final decision
The PPI policy wasnt mis-sold  so NewDay Ltd doesnt have to pay back all of the cost of 
the PPI to Mr L.
But NewDay  Ltd does  have to pay back to Mr L any commission and profit share it got that 
was more than 50% of the PPI premium,  if it hasnt already done so. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 August 2019.
