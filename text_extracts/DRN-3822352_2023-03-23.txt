The complaint
Mr I complains that Oplo PL Limited wont refund to him the money that he paid for a holiday 
product using a loan from a finance provider. Hes being represented in his complaint by a 
legal adviser.
What happened
Mr I and his wife entered into a membership application agreement to buy 5,000 credits for a 
holiday product in May 2018. The purchase price of the credits was £14,250 and Mr I also 
entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with a finance provider for a loan of that amount. 
He agreed to make 179 monthly repayments of £145.47 and a final payment of £143.66 to 
the finance provider. 
Mr Is representative made claims to the finance provider in October 2019 under section 75 
of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 that the credits had been misrepresented to Mr I and under 
section 140A of that Act that Mr Is relationship with the finance provider was unfair. It also 
said that the finance provider acted irresponsibly in making the loan to Mr I as no 
consideration was given to the affordability of the loan for him or to his anxiety and 
depression which has been exacerbated as a result of the stress that hes been caused. 
The finance provider said that the holiday company had handled the sale of the product and 
the loan fairly. It said that Mr I and his wife had meetings with a compliance manager over 
two days to ensure that they fully understood the purchase, had received and read all the 
documents, and had the opportunity to raise any questions or concerns. It said that Mr I and 
his wife had the right to cancel the agreement within the withdrawal period. It also said that a 
full affordability assessment was undertaken and that no health issues were raised by Mr I. 
Mr I wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service and his 
representative provided detailed particulars of the complaint and a witness statement from 
Mr I and his wife. Mr Is wife has sadly passed away since then. The loan was transferred to 
Oplo in August 2022.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Is complaint should be upheld as he didnt think 
that the finance providers decision to turn down the claims under sections 75 and 140A for 
breach of contract, misrepresentation and an unfair relationship was unfair or unreasonable. 
He described in detail why he didnt consider that the credits had been misrepresented to 
Mr I and his wife and he wasnt persuaded that they were sold as an investment. He said 
that the holiday company had entered liquidation but a different management company was 
running the membership so the services were still available to those customers who had 
kept up with their maintenance fee payments  and he didnt think that the holiday company 
had breached the contract agreed between it and Mr I. He said that he hadnt seen enough 
to suggest that the relationship between Mr I and the finance provider was unfair and he 
wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. 
He thought that the lending was affordable for Mr I at the time of sale and that the finance 
provider had carried out reasonable and proportionate checks to ensure that the loan could 
be repaid sustainably. He said that he appreciated that Mr Is personal circumstances had 
changed and he suggested that he should explain that to the finance provider. 
Mr Is representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. Mr I then appointed a different representative to represent him in this complaint 
and the new representative provided detailed further comments about Mr Is complaint. It 
says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
Mr I and other consumers were subjected to high pressure selling by the holiday 
company and the sales involved practices which are psychologically manipulative, 
use misleading information and unfairly exploit vulnerable and elderly consumers;
that led to those consumers taking out very expensive borrowing commitments which 
they cannot afford and no affordability checks were carried out;
Mr I believes that due to his health condition he was vulnerable at the time of the sale 
and was subjected to a pressurised sales process, as a result of which he ended up 
with a timeshare and related loan, which his family cant afford;
Mr I was offered alcohol during the sales presentation and wasnt given enough 
information in order to make an informed decision;
he wasnt advised about the cost of the maintenance fees and was given inaccurate 
and insufficient information about a critical point that was important for him and his 
wife and non-payment of the maintenance fee may lead to confiscation of the 
timeshare;
the credit intermediary wasnt authorised to offer the loan;
an undisclosed commission was paid by the finance provider to the holiday company; 
and
Mr I has completed new income and expenditure forms but, when assessing the 
application for credit, the finance provider should have considered not only Mr Is 
current situation but also forecast any future changes in his finances.
Mr I has also provided more information about his mental health issues.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Is complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Is first representative summarised the misrepresentations that it says were made 
to Mr I and his wife in the claim letter that it sent to the finance provider in October 
2019 as follows:
othey would be investing in their holidays by securing future holidays that 
would be significantly cheaper than would be available on the open market 
and that purchasing the timeshare would enable them to facilitate and/or have 
access to cheaper holidays worldwide through exchange companies;
othere was a ready re-sale market for each of the timeshares purchased 
pursuant to the agreements which meant that Mr I and his wife would be able 
to sell on the timeshare and that they were accordingly purchasing an asset 
that not only had an intrinsic value but had good prospects of increasing in 
value;
othe price was only available, at a rate significantly below market value, for a 
very limited period - namely during the course of the sales presentation and Mr I and his wife were told that if they did not purchase there and then the 
offer would no longer be available;
othey could gift their credits to their grown-up children or could sell them to 
friends and family and it would be financially beneficial for Mr I and his wife to 
invest in the product - it was stressed that it was an investment and that is 
what Mr I and his wife were most interested in due to their finances being low 
at the time; and
othey would only have to pay for flights as the number of credits they owned 
would cover them for their holidays - they would be cheaper than purchasing 
holidays on the open-market, saving them money and the resorts were 
exclusive to members only and were not open to the general public;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Is claims under sections 75 and 140A as only 
a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not the finance 
providers response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr I and his wife signed documents in May 2018 including the membership 
application agreement, the terms and conditions, an exchange contract, a separate 
standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given, a standard information 
form and a finance calculator  Mr I also acknowledged receipt of the pre-contract 
credit information and electronically signed the loan agreement;
Mr I and his wife have provided a detailed witness statement in which they describe 
the way that the credits were sold to them and the misrepresentations that they say 
were made to them  Mr Is first representative has also provided evidence from 
other purchasers of similar holiday products about the way that the sales were made 
to them - but theres no other documentary evidence from the time of the sale to 
show that the holiday company misrepresented the credits to Mr I and his wife;
Ive seen no reference in the membership application agreement, the membership 
club rules or any other document from the time of the sale which refers to the credits 
being an investment or as likely to increase in value;
the standard information form that was signed by Mr I and his wife says: The resale 
facility for [the credits] for new members  will be available five years following the 
start of membership  There are no third party resale companies which may 
undertake this service on your behalf ; and Ive seen no documentary evidence 
from the time of sale to show that Mr I was told that there was a ready re-sale market 
for the credits;
I consider that the documents provided from the time of the sale show that the credits 
were a way to obtain holiday accommodation and similar activities and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr I and his wife were told that 
the accommodation would be significantly cheaper than would be available on the 
open market or that the credits were misrepresented to them in any other significant 
way;
I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that Mr I and his wife were 
induced into buying the credits by misrepresentations made by the holiday company;I understand that the holiday company has stopped trading but a new management 
company has been appointed to provide the membership services and Mr I kept all of 
his contractual rights (provided that he continued to pay the fees due for his credits) 
and the new holiday company continues to offer a full service for members  I 
consider that to be an appropriate remedy for any breach of contract arising from the 
holiday company stopping trading and I dont consider that Oplo would have any 
further liability to Mr I under section 75 arising from the holiday company stopping 
trading;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any other 
significant breach of contract or applicable laws or regulations for which Oplo would 
be liable in these circumstances; 
the particulars of complaint set out the basis on which Mr Is first representative says 
that there was an unfair relationship between Mr I and the finance provider which are:
othe credits were misrepresented to Mr I and his wife;
othe loan was used to buy an investment which was highly risky, had little 
prospect of generating a capital return and sale to repay the loan;
oMr I and his wife have to pay maintenance fees and the holiday company has 
the benefit of a foreclosure clause if the fees arent paid;
othere are a number of clauses contained within the club rules which give rise 
to a significant imbalance in the rights between the parties; and
oits believed that the finance provider paid a secret profit or commission to the 
holiday company;
Ive explained above why I dont consider that the credits were misrepresented to 
Mr I and his wife or that the loan was used to buy an investment;
I consider it to be clear from the terms and conditions and the significant information 
form that management fees were payable and Mr I and his wife had signed the 
membership application agreement in which they confirmed that theyd read and 
understood the terms and conditions;
the terms and conditions say: The Purchaser agrees to pay the Annual Membership 
Renewal Fee and where applicable any applicable Accelerated Usage Fee  in 
accordance with the Club Rules. Failure to pay Annual Membership Fees or 
Accelerated Usage Fees when due will lead to suspension of rights and may lead to 
the cancellation of Membership;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms relating to 
those fees are unfair or that other clauses in the club rules give rise to an unfair 
relationship between Mr I and the finance provider;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid 
by the finance provider to the holiday company but, from what this service has seen 
across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less than 
10% and Im satisfied that the finance provider wouldnt have breached any duty in 
making any such payment  nor was it under any regulatory duty to disclose the 
amount of any commission paid in these circumstances - and I dont consider that the 
level of any commission that was normally paid in this type of situation was 
sufficiently high to mean that the finance provider should have appreciated that not 
disclosing any commission to Mr I risked the relationship being unfair under section 
140A;
Mr Is first representatives October 2019 letter to the finance provider said that the 
finance provider acted irresponsibly in making the loan to Mr I as no consideration was given to the affordability of the loan for Mr I or to his anxiety and depression 
which has been exacerbated as a result of the stress that hes been caused;
Mr I and his wife provided information to complete a finance calculator which they 
signed in May 2018  it showed that Mr I had an annual income of £36,000 and a 
monthly disposable income of £657.37 and that his wife had an annual income of 
£32,000 and a monthly disposable income of £548.29;
I consider that it was reasonable for the finance provider to conclude, on the basis of 
that information, that Mr I could afford a loan with monthly repayments of £145.47;
Mr I said in his witness statement that his annual income was £36,000 and that his 
wife was then earning £33,000 each year and he provided information about their 
income and expenditure which showed that they had a joint net monthly income of 
£4,663 and expenditure of £3,395 which is broadly consistent with the information 
contained on the finance calculator;
Mr Is financial position has now deteriorated as hes earning less and he no longer 
has the benefit of his wifes income and hes provided another set of income and 
expenditure figures which show that they had less disposable income in May 2018 
than the information that theyd previously provided;
the finance provider was required to assess the affordability of the loan for Mr I at the 
time that it was made to him and there was no requirement for it to take account of 
any future changes in his finances as they wouldnt have been known at that time;
the finance provider has provided a copy of a video recording of the meeting at which 
Mr I signed the loan agreement in which he and his wife said that they intended to 
repay the loan early and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr I in May 2018 when it was made to him;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr I told the holiday company or the finance 
provider about his mental health issues and Ive seen no evidence to show that they 
knew, or ought reasonably to have known, about those issues before the loan was 
made to Mr I - and theres no indication that I could see in the video recording which 
ought to have made them aware that Mr I was suffering from mental health issues 
when he signed the loan agreement;
the finance provider was made aware of Mr Is financial difficulties in July 2020 and it 
agreed to a two month payment holiday  his loan has now been transferred to Oplo 
and, if he hasnt done so already, I suggest that Mr I contacts Oplo to give it 
information about his current situation  its required to respond to any financial 
difficulties that hes experiencing positively and sympathetically;
Mr Is representatives have described the high pressure selling techniques that they 
say were used by the holiday company and his new representative says that Mr I 
was offered alcohol during the sales presentation;
when Mr I and his wife signed the documents there was an issue with the electronic 
signature facility so Mr I was unable to sign the loan documents  he returned later 
with his wife to sign those documents and theres no indication that I could see in the 
video recording to show that Mr I was intoxicated or that his judgement was impaired 
and Im not persuaded that the holiday company acted incorrectly in offering an 
alcoholic drink to Mr I  I consider that it would be for him to decide whether or not to 
accept such an offer;
Mr I and his wife appeared to be in good spirits and were keen to sign the 
agreements - Mr I was given time to look through the loan documents and he can 
clearly be seen to be reading them before completing the documents as required  he didnt like the electronic signature that was generated so the holiday companys 
representative showed him how to change the signature;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr I and his wife were 
unduly pressurised into entering into the membership application agreement, that 
Mr I was unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mr I and his wife had signed the separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that 
could be given and if they didnt want to continue with the purchase for any reason 
they could have given notice to withdraw from the agreements  but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that they contacted either the holiday company or the finance 
provider during the withdrawal period about withdrawing from the agreements;
Ive seen no evidence to show that a complaint about the authorisation of the credit 
intermediary was made to the finance provider but Mr Is new representative says 
that the credit intermediary wasnt authorised to offer the loan;
three credit intermediaries were identified in the pre-contract credit information that 
was provided to Mr I but a company related to the holiday company was identified as 
a broker in the initial disclosure document and I consider it to be more likely than not 
that that company acted as the credit broker for Mr Is loan;
it was authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority at the time that Mr I entered into 
the loan agreement so Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
the credit intermediary wasnt authorised to offer the loan  Mr Is new representative 
has made further comments about the credit intermediary but I dont consider that the 
concerns that its raised are relevant to its authorisation to arrange Mr Is loan;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Is relationship with 
the finance provider was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr I and the finance provider 
in these circumstances;
I consider that the finance providers response to Mr Is claims was fair and 
reasonable and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it has 
acted incorrectly in its dealings with him about the loan;
I sympathise with Mr I for the loss of his wife, the mental health issues that hes 
suffering, the financial difficulties that hes experiencing and the issues that hes had 
with the holiday company and his credits, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Oplo to refund to him any of the 
money that he and his wife paid for the credits, to pay him any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Is complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2023.
