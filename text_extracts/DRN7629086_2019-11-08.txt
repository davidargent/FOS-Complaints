K820x#14complaint
Mrs D complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest) closed  her account without 
notice which  meant she couldnt access her wages.
background
Mrs D says NatWest  closed  her account without  notice.  She says her employer had paid 
money into that account which  then went missing. Mrs D says she spent a considerable 
amount of time trying  to sort matters out and finding  out where her money  went. She would 
like to know why the account closed and her money traced. She would also like NatWest  to 
pay her compensation  and for it to be fined.
NatWest says it acted in line with the account terms and conditions by closing  the account 
without notice. It accepts  that Mrs D should  have been allowed to make a complaint over the 
telephone. NatWest says the account was closed with a nil balance but has now decided  to 
allow Mrs D an account.
Mrs D brought her complaint to us but our investigator didnt  uphold  it. The investigator  
thought NatWest, in line with the account  terms and conditions,  was entitled to close an 
account without  notice and without providing a reason.  The investigator thought it was up to 
NatWest to decide whom  it wanted  as a customer and it was up to Mrs Ds employer to 
explain where her money was.
Mrs D doesnt accept  that view and has asked that the investigators  view be looked  at by an 
ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall view as the investigator for the same reasons. I realise Mrs D will be disappointed by 
my decision.
Ive looked at the NatWest account  terms and conditions  which  I think Mrs D would have 
agreed to when the account was opened.  And Im satisfied that NatWest is entitled to close 
an account without  notice in certain  circumstances and without providing  a reason. So I dont  
think NatWest has acted  unfairly here or made a mistake. 
I appreciate any decision  to close an account will cause some  inconvenience. And I accept 
that Mrs D was caused inconvenience  in trying to find out why NatWest closed the account 
and what happened  to her wages. I also accept  that Mrs D would have been frustrated by 
the decision to close the account.  But for the reasons Ive explained  Im satisfied NatWest 
was entitled to make the decision it did.
Im satisfied that the account closed with a nil balance  so I dont think NatWest  is responsible  
for what happened to Mrs Ds money  and think that is something she will need  to take up 
with her employer and or its bank.
I can see that NatWest has now opened an account  for Mrs D. I have no doubt that Mrs D 
would be confused by that decision.  And I think it would  have  been  appropriate  for NatWest 
to have asked  Mrs D first if she wanted  the account  taking into account what had taken 
place. But I dont think that justifies any compensation.
Ref: DRN76290862Overall, as I dont think NatWest has made a mistake or acted  unfairly in respect  of Mrs Ds 
main complaint, I cant fairly order NatWest to pay her the compensation she would like. And 
as we are not the regulator of banks and building societies, I dont have the power  to fine a 
business as Mrs D would like.
I accept Mrs D is unlikely to accept  my decision but Im satisfied that brings  an end to what 
we in trying  to sort out this complaint  informally can do. I can see that Mrs D is considering 
taking another  course of action in any event.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 December 2019.
