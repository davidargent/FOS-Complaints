K820x#14complaint
Miss M says Lloyds Bank  PLC (Lloyds) mis-sold her a Silver packaged bank account in 
2009. Shes used  a Claims Management Company (CMC) to make her complaint.
background
Our adjudicators looked at Miss Ms complaint and didnt think  Lloyds had mis-sold the 
account. The CMC  disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Miss Ms complaint. 
Having carefully looked  at everything  provided,  Im not upholding Miss Ms complaint. Id like 
to explain the reasons  for my decision.  I think Miss M chose  to take the account.  She 
appears to have had an identifiable need for some of the main benefits and it was up to her 
to use them.  
So overall I dont  think that clearer information wouldve changed Miss Ms decision to 
accept what looks to have  been  a fair recommendation made by Lloyds. And, in these 
circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Miss Ms complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 May 2019.
