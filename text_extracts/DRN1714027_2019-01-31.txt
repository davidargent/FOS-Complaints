K821x#15complaint
Mr D complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) have refused to reimburse  
him, under their buyer protection scheme,  for a payment he made  to a company for goods  
that Mr D says are counterfeit.
background
In April 2018 Mr D purchased a bag for US$85.01, paying with his PayPal account. When he 
received the bag he thought it was not authentic. So he raised  a dispute with the seller 
asking for a refund but the seller only offered him US$20, which he declined.  
He then asked  PayPal to refund his payment under their buyer protection scheme on the 
basis that the bag was significantly  not as described  (SNAD). PayPal initially  agreed to do 
this, provided he returned  the bag to the seller. But Mr D said he couldnt do this. He 
provided information that he said showed  that the country to which hed need  to return  the 
bag prohibited the import of counterfeit goods.  And he also provided  information showing 
that the UK carrier he wanted to use to return the goods also wouldnt accept counterfeit 
goods. Mr D had also provided photos of the authentic item and the item he received, which 
he said showed the goods were  counterfeit. And he offered  to destroy  the item and provide 
proof hed done  so. 
In late May 2018 PayPal  refused his claim,  on the basis  that he hadnt provided proof that 
the carrier wouldnt ship that particular item. 
Very shortly thereafter, Mr D complained to PayPal about their handling of the claim. Over 
the next few months there were a great many communications  between  Mr D and PayPal. 
PayPals position  was that it wasnt satisfied  that the item was counterfeit,  based on 
information about the seller. And it also didnt  think that the law prohibited  the return of the 
goods for the purpose of pursuing consumer rights. Mr D disagreed, and brought  his 
complaint to us. 
Our investigator upheld  his complaint.  On the balance of probabilities, he thought the bag 
was counterfeit.  And he thought Mr D had provided  enough evidence  to show  that he 
couldnt return the bag without a breach  of the law. He thought  PayPal should refund the 
cost of the bag under  its Buyer Protection Scheme. 
PayPal didnt agree and asked for a decision from an ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
I can see that PayPal  feels very strongly that it shouldnt have to reimburse Mr D what he 
paid for the bad. But Im going  to tell PayPal to do so. Ill explain why.
PayPals User Agreement includes a Buyer Protection scheme.  It provides that a buyer  may 
make a claim for reimbursement if, among other things,  goods are significantly not as 
described. This includes goods  that are advertised as authentic but are not authentic:  see 
13.8 of the User Agreement.  It can ask for evidence before it makes a decision. 
Ref: DRN17140272Under 13.1 of the User Agreement, PayPal  is entitled to make the final decision on its Buyer  
Protection Scheme  at its sole discretion. But in my view this doesnt  mean  it can do whatever 
it likes. It has to use its discretion fairly. 
PayPals position  is that Mr D didnt provide valid documents  to prove the item was 
counterfeit and he didnt  provide any concrete evidence that the shipping  company refused 
to ship that particular item based on its authenticity. But I think  Mr D did enough. Ive looked  
very carefully at the photos  provided  by Mr D. In my view they show that the bag provided  is 
not authentic -  the position of the stripe  in relation to the brand name is clearly different. 
PayPal says it relied on evidence from the seller other than the physical item itself;  
information concerning the sellers business and track record. But in my view the starting 
point must  be the physical  item itself, in this case, the bag. And as Ive said, I think that on 
any reasonable view there is a sufficient difference for a layperson to form a view that the 
bag purchased isnt authentic. I dont think evidence as to the sellers track record makes a 
difference to this  it turns on each item. For the same reason, I dont think  that the request 
for independent  evidence  was reasonable, or necessary. The photos  were enough. 
I also think Mr D provided enough evidence showing that a major UK carrier wouldnt ship 
counterfeit items.  PayPal insisted that it needed evidence that a carrier wouldnt ship that 
particular item. I think that is an unreasonable request  in circumstances where  there is 
evidence (the photos) from which it can be determined that the item is not authentic. PayPal 
was effectively asking  Mr D to deceive  the carrier,  in order to return the bag, as Mr D was of 
the view that it was counterfeit, and he knew the carrier wouldnt ship counterfeit  goods. I 
dont think that is fair. 
Mr D offered a reasonable alternative, which was that hed destroy the bag and provide 
evidence hed done so. This is something  that PayPals User Agreement itself provides for at 
13.6(c). So I dont  think it was fair of PayPal to say that Mr D wanted to keep the bag, and be 
reimbursed for it. For the above reasons, Im going to tell PayPal to reimburse Mr D for the 
cost of the bag. 
my final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA must reimburse  Mr D US85.01.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019.
