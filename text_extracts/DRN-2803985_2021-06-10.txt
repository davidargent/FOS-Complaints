The complaint
 Mr T complains that NewDay Ltd (trading as Marbles) irresponsibly increased his credit 
limit.
What happened
On 3 July 2015 NewDay approved Mr Ts credit card application, giving him a credit limit of 
£250. 
Mr T says he was struggling with other debts and financial commitments but kept up with his 
account payments until October 2015 when NewDay increased his credit limit from £250 to 
£1,250. Mr T didnt request this increase.
After the increase Mr Ts account balance remained over his credit limit. 
In January 2016 Mr T entered a debt management programme and NewDay accepted 
reduced repayments of £12.16 a month.
In July 2016 NewDay passed Mr Ts debt to a third party, and a default was later registered 
against him.
In June 2020 Mr T complained to NewDay. He said it had given him this credit card even 
though he had a poor credit history. And it had increased his credit limit even though he was 
already in debt. 
NewDay partially upheld Mr Ts complaint. Whilst it didnt think it had acted irresponsibly 
when it accepted his initial credit card application, it said that it shouldnt have offered him 
the credit limit increase in October 2015. To put things right it refunded over limit fees and 
proportionate interest from this point, totalling £101.50. 
Mr T wasnt happy with this response so he brought his complaint to our service. He wants 
NewDay to remove adverse information relating to this account from his credit file. Hed also 
like it to refund the difference between the £250 limit he was given when he first took out the 
credit card, and the increased £1,250 limit he was given in October 2015. 
Our investigator looked into what had happened. He didnt think NewDay had acted 
irresponsibly when it gave Mr T the credit card. But agreed that it shouldnt have increased 
his credit limit from £250 to £1,250. 
The investigator asked NewDay to remove adverse information from Mr Ts credit file. And to 
pay Mr T £100 compensation for the trouble and upset hed experienced as a result of the 
matter. However, he felt it was fair that Mr T should repay the balance of his account. And 
was satisfied that the amount of interest and fees already refunded by NewDay was fair. 
Mr T accepted these findings, but NewDay didnt. It said it had reviewed the case again and 
the credit limit increase it awarded Mr T was in line with its lending policy at the time. It also 
said it had an obligation to report accurate information to credit bureaus and declined to 
amend Mr Ts credit file. So the case has been passed to me to make a final decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our investigator set out the checks NewDay undertook before approving Mr Ts initial credit 
card application in July 2015. So I wont repeat this information in detail here, other than to 
say that Im also satisfied that these checks were reasonable and proportionate to the credit 
offered. I dont think NewDay had any reason to think that a low limit of £250 might be 
unaffordable for Mr T. And indeed Mr T managed his account well at this level. 
The outstanding matters for me to decide are whether NewDay acted irresponsibly or 
unreasonably when it increased Mr Ts credit limit from £250 to £1,250 in October 2015. 
And, if it did, what it should do to put things right.
NewDay previously seemed to uphold this part of Mr Ts complaint. It said in its final 
response letter that it shouldnt have increased his credit limit. And it told us that the increase 
was proportionally high and noted that Mr Ts account was consistently over the credit limit 
for the three months after the increase took place. 
NewDay has now said that the credit limit increase was offered in line with its lending policy, 
and that it partially upheld Mr Ts complaint based on the information it knew now. Not 
because it made an error at the time. 
I know NewDay will be disappointed by my decision but Ive reached the same conclusions 
that our investigator did here. 
NewDay has explained that this type of credit card account is intended to help customers 
looking to rebuild their credit history. Mr T met its acceptance criteria and in July 2015 was 
offered a low limit of £250 that NewDay says it considered appropriate to his circumstances. 
Ive not seen or heard any evidence to suggest that Mr Ts circumstances changed 
significantly between July 2015 and October 2015. And Mr T gave NewDay income and 
expenditure details in January 2016 that would suggest they hadnt. 
I accept Mr T managed his account well for the short period he had it prior to 14 October 
2015 when NewDay increased his credit limit. I can also see that Mr T was told about this 
increase in advance and could have acted to opt out of it. And I note NewDay has told us t 
Mr T met its lending criteria when it offered him this increase. 
However, in the circumstances, I still cant see that NewDay has provided suitable 
justification for increasing Mr Ts credit limit by as much as five-fold, within just over 3 
months of him opening the account. I havent seen any evidence to suggest it asked him for 
any updated information about his income, or for details of his monthly expenditure. And 
given what it knew about him, I think this would have been a reasonable and proportionate 
step for it to take before giving further credit.
I say this given Mr Ts past credit history which I understand included 3 defaults, most 
recently within 18 months of his application. And the fact NewDay identified at the time of his 
application that he had a high level of indebtedness. I can also see NewDay had stated that 
Mr T had a low income. Mr T has only been able to give us limited information about his circumstances at the time. 
But I can see in July 2015 NewDay recorded he had 8 other active accounts, and debt of 
£11,800 against an annual income of £17,000. These figures are similar to those Mr T gave 
to NewDay in January 2016 when it recorded he had a monthly disposable income of £126. 
Mr T has also explained his wife was unemployed, and they had two young children. So Im 
satisfied that if NewDay had carried out more detailed checks its unlikely it would have 
found that a credit limit of £1,250 was affordable for him.
I note that during in his application Mr T also told NewDay he had access to other household 
income of £10,000. But again there are no signs NewDay asked about where this came 
from. Or about any expenditure commitments other household members may have had.
Whatever the information showed at the time - Mr T clearly struggled following this credit 
limit increase. His account balance stayed over the limit before he agreed a reduced 
repayment arrangement through a third party in January 2016. I think this further supports 
Mr Ts claims that the credit limit increase was unaffordable for him. And NewDay has also 
made reference to this. 
Putting things right
NewDay has already refunded charges and proportional interest accrued on Mr Ts account 
after October 2015, which I think was fair. And I think its reasonable for Mr T to continue to 
repay the remaining principle balance on his account as he has had the benefit of spending 
the credit. 
I accept NewDay has a duty to report on accounts accurately. It feels the credit history and 
default recorded is a fair reflection of Mr Ts management of his account.
However, Ive found that NewDay acted irresponsibly when it increased Mr Ts credit limit 
from £250 to £1,250. Up until this point Mr T managed his account well and made the 
payments required. And it follows that I dont think it would be fair for Mr Ts credit file to 
reflect the negative impact of NewDays actions. So NewDay should seek to remove any 
adverse information recorded after 14 October 2015.
Our investigator also asked NewDay to pay Mr T £100 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience its actions caused him and the difficulties Mr T has had trying to move to a 
new house, which he has told us are due in part to the adverse information recorded on his 
credit file. I think this was a reasonable request in the circumstances.
 
My final decision
 For the reasons explained above, I am upholding this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to:
Remove any adverse information recorded after October 2015 from Mr Ts credit file 
Pay Mr T £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused by this 
matter. This compensation should be paid to Mr T directly. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 July 2021.
