The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA did not uphold his complaint for a 
refund for goods he paid for but did not receive.
What happened
(A claims management company has assisted Mr B in bringing this complaint, and also in 
contacting the relevant parties, but to keep things simple I will describe their actions as if 
they were his.)
In June 2018 Mr B bought some goods and paid for them as a guest through PayPals 
website. They never arrived. He spent several months trying to contact the seller about this, 
but they never replied. Eventually, in April 2019, he raised the matter with PayPal. He says 
that PayPals communication was not helpful. Because of that, and also because PayPal did 
not give him a refund, he complained to PayPal in August. In September PayPal told him 
that as he had not raised his dispute with the seller within 180 days of the purchase, he was 
not covered by PayPals buyer protection policy. Meanwhile, in July 2019, he had brought 
this complaint to our Service.
Our investigator did not uphold this complaint. She said that as Mr B had not acted within the 
180-day time limit, PayPal had not done anything wrong. She thought that time limit was a 
reasonable time frame, and that as it was in PayPals terms and conditions PayPal had 
made him aware of it.
Mr B did not agree with that decision. He said he had not known about the time limit, and 
that PayPal had not done enough to inform him about it. He had used up the time trying to 
contact the seller in good faith, and he should not be penalised for it. He asked for an 
ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I accept that Mr B didnt know about the 180-day time limit on the day he made the 
purchase. But PayPal did inform him about it at the time, because it is in the terms and 
conditions of its buyer protection policy. (I wont quote it here, because our investigator has 
done that already.)
I understand why Mr B didnt read the terms and conditions on the day of the purchase, but 
that doesnt mean that the time limit does not apply, or that PayPal should be obliged to 
waive it. I dont think it is PayPals fault that Mr B waited more than 180 days to ask PayPal 
to help him. He spent all of that time chasing a seller who did not reply to him, and that is a 
long time to persist at an entirely fruitless course of action.
I was sorry to read about Mr Bs predicament. He has lost a lot of money. But I dont think it 
would be fair and reasonable of me to order PayPal to refund him for the misconduct of a 
third party in circumstances where its policy does not require it to do that. PayPal was 
entitled to rely on the time limit, and so I cannot say that PayPal has done anything wrong.
I think it would have been helpful if PayPal had explained this to Mr B earlier than it did. But 
its failure to do that did not affect the outcome of his claim, and while it may have been 
annoying I dont think that error is serious enough to merit financial compensation. (In 
coming to that conclusion, I have taken into account the fact that I cannot award 
compensation to the claims management company that was acting on his behalf, for any 
inconvenience that was caused to it.)
My final decision
So my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 October 2020. But if we dont hear from him, then we will 
assume that he rejects it.
