The complaint
Mr W is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA have refused to remove a default from 
his credit file as a result of his bankruptcy in 2018.
What happened
Mr W was declared bankrupt on 22 May 2018. The debts listed in the bankruptcy order 
included an amount owed to PayPal. 
Before the date of the bankruptcy order, PayPal had written to Mr W regarding his account. 
They said that he was in arrears with his payments and asked for this to be paid. Letters 
were issued in March and April 2018.
On 11 May 2018 PayPal issued a Notice of Default to Mr W and the account defaulted on 11 
June 2018. This was registered on his credit file at the credit reference agencies
Before that, on 6 June 2018, PayPal were told that the Insolvency Service were acting on 
behalf of Mr W. This is normal in bankruptcy proceedings.
On 11 July 2018, PayPal confirmed Mr Ws insolvency from the insolvency register. So, they 
marked this against his account in their records.
Mr W was discharged from bankruptcy on 22 May 2019, one year after the bankruptcy order. 
He checked his credit file at the credit reference agencies. Mr W saw that an amount 
outstanding to PayPal was recorded as a default. He thought that the debt should be 
removed from his record under the bankruptcy order.
Mr W said that he emailed numerous complaints to PayPal asking them to update his record. 
He said that these were ignored. So, Mr W decided to bring his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators has looked at the circumstances of Mr Ws complaint. He said 
PayPal needed to do more here. He didnt think it was correct that PayPal leave the debt as 
it is. He also said that PayPal shouldnt ask for repayment if Mr W decided to use their 
service in the future. He said that PayPal needed to:
clear the outstanding Balance on Mr Ws account which was included on his 
bankruptcy order.
submit an amendment to the credit reference agencies to reflect the account as 
settled.
Amend the default date to 22 May 2018 at the credit reference agencies.
Having reviewed Mr Ws complaint, I reached a different outcome to that of our investigator. 
Because of that, I issued a provisional decision on 10 March 2021 giving both Mr W and 
PayPal the opportunity to respond to my findings before I issued a final decision.
In my provisional decision I said: 
A bankruptcy order lists the debts of the person named in it. The order sometimes doesnt 
detail all those outstanding. But it will still apply to any debts from before the date of the 
order, even if they werent listed. There are statutory exclusions, but none of these apply 
here. The debt with PayPal was listed in this case.
The current ICO/SCOR guidelines say that in normal circumstances lenders will be notified 
when the debt that is owed to them is to be included in a bankruptcy. So, a default should be 
filed as being no later than the date of the insolvency order. In circumstances where the 
lender is not immediately aware, the default can be filed at that point in time. If evidence of 
the insolvency date is provided, the default date recorded at the credit reference agencies 
will be aligned.
I have seen evidence of Mr Ws credit file. This shows that the debt to PayPal has a 
Defaulted status. It also confirms a Default Date of 11 June 2018. This needs to be 
aligned with the bankruptcy order. The only exception would be where the debt was created 
after the date of the bankruptcy order. It wasnt here.
Part of the Official Receivers role is to arrange the payment of Mr Ws debts from the sale of 
his assets  where possible. When its not possible, there may be no payment. In Mr Ws 
case, the debt he had with PayPal was not paid by the Official Receiver.  
The ICO/SCOR guidelines say that any debt record with a credit reference agency should be 
closed and marked as partially settled where:
The lender accepts final settlement of the account for less than the balance 
outstanding, or
The account is included in an insolvency such as a bankruptcy which is discharged 
and less than the full amount is paid.
Mr W was discharged from his bankruptcy on 22 May 2019, but the debt wasnt repaid. So, 
PayPal must update the credit reference agencies to show that the defaults have been 
partially settled.
PayPal said that the debt isnt written off and will remain in their systems. They also said that 
the debt will need to be paid if Mr W wants to use their services again. This is PayPals own 
policy. Its not the role of the service to question this. But its important that PayPal shouldnt 
continue to report any debt, pre-dating Mr Ws bankruptcy, to the credit refence agencies. Its 
also important that PayPal dont make legal attempts to recover a debt that pre-dates the 
bankruptcy order. Under the terms of the bankruptcy order, Mr W doesnt have to pay this.
Mr W said that he made several attempts to ask PayPal to update his credit file. He wants 
PayPal to compensate him for time spent trying to deal with this.  I have seen an email dated 
9 July 2020 in which PayPal acknowledge receipt of Mr Ws certificate of insolvency. They 
go on to confirm amounts owed and that they have ceased further contact from their 
collections department.
PayPal apologised for delays in responding to Mr W in a further email dated 31 August 2020. 
They say that PayPal Credit is a regulated product and that they have taken the correct 
actions. They also say that the status of the account is automatically reported to the Credit 
Bureau.
Overall, I agree that PayPal need to do more to make sure that Mr Ws credit file shows the 
correct information. But I wont be asking them to cancel the debt from their own records. 
This is their own company policy. 
Its clear that Mr W has asked PayPal to correct his credit file on a number of occasions 
without success. Im sure that this has not only been time consuming, but also frustrating 
and worrying for Mr W and he should be compensated for this. So, I think it is fair to reflect 
this in my decision.
So, I said that I believed that PayPal needed to do more here. I said that in order to comply 
with ICO/SCOR guidelines, PayPal would need to make corrections to the information theyd 
reported to the credit reference agencies. I also believed that it would be fair to reflect the 
additional distress and inconvenience caused to Mr W.Mr W responded to my Provisional Decision. He said that hed submitted a complaint to the 
Information Commissioners Office (ICO) about PayPals processing of his personal 
information. In the ICOs reply, they said that there is more work for PayPal to do. They 
explained that Mr Ws issues would be raised with the Data Protection Officer, explaining 
that they want them to work with Mr W to resolve any outstanding matters. So, Mr W said 
that he wants PayPal to pay compensation of £5,000.
PayPal responded to my provisional decision and confirmed that they dont intend to 
challenge the decision proposed. They also confirmed that theyd amended Mr Ws credit file 
to show the debt as partially settled to the dates Id suggested. They also asked for specific 
account details to enable them to pay to Mr W the compensation proposed.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision, I said that I thought that PayPal needed to make corrections to 
the information theyd given to the credit reference agencies. My thoughts are supported by 
the findings of the ICO following Mr Ws complaint to them. The ICO also said that an 
individual may go to court to claim compensation for damage or distress caused by an 
organisation if they have breached the Data Protection Legislation but the Information 
Commissioner cannot award compensation. I was pleased to hear that PayPal have 
confirmed that theyve now corrected the information detailed in Mr Ws credit file.
Its important to recognise that our role is to provide a fair and impartial service to help settle 
disputes. Its not a regulatory one. Neither is it our role to penalise financial institutions where 
they make a mistake. Where a mistake has been made, we can award an amount that we 
consider fair compensation to ensure that a customer has not lost out financially. We may 
also consider awards to reflect distress and inconvenience.
With all of this in mind, I remain of the opinion that its fair to reflect the distress and 
inconvenience caused to Mr W. But Ive not been provided with any information that 
persuades me to award the level of compensation that Mr W seeks. I do understand that Mr 
W will be disappointed by my decision. But I dont think a higher compensation amount 
would be fair here. I believe that the amount of £100 proposed is appropriate. Its in line with 
what I would expect to see in these circumstances.
So, the requirements set out in my provisional decision remain appropriate. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold Mr Ws complaint.
To comply with ICO/SCOR guidelines, I require:
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to align any default date recorded with the credit 
reference agencies with that of the bankruptcy order (i.e. 22 May 2018)
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to update the status of any default to Partially 
Settled.
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must not include any debt created before the 
bankruptcy order (i.e. 22 May 2018) in any monthly account status reports to the 
credit reference agencies after the date of the bankruptcy order.
I also require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay to Mr W compensation of £100 to 
reflect any distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or reject my decision before 25 May 2021.
