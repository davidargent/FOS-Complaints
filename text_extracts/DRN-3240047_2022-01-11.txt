The complaint
Mrs C complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has treated her unfairly when dealing 
with a dispute she raised over goods shed bought using its services.
What happened
In July 2020 Mrs C told PayPal that she bought a pair of sun loungers but never received 
them. She said that instead, the seller sent her a ring, and failed to respond to her 
subsequent correspondence. She sent PayPal screenshots of her order and the item 
received, and her attempts to resolve the issue with the seller. PayPal indicates that it raised 
a query with the seller, who offered a partial refund. Mrs C was unhappy with this offer and 
sought to pursue the matter.
PayPal sent Mrs C an affidavit form to complete and return, to confirm the nature of the 
dispute. It gave her 10 days in which to respond. PayPal says that because Mrs C failed to 
complete and return the affidavit, it was unable to assist in recovering what shed paid. 
Mrs C is unhappy with PayPals position and feels it ought to have done more to help.
Our investigator noted PayPals user agreement set out the terms for eligibility under its 
buyer protection scheme. One of the requirements was that the buyer should respond to 
document and information requests within the timescale given.
Although Mrs C hadnt replied to PayPals request for an affidavit, our investigator was 
satisfied PayPal already had the information it needed to progress the claim. He considered 
PayPal hadnt acted fairly towards Mrs C in handling the dispute. Noting that the user 
agreement suggested PayPal would usually settle claims in the buyers favour where items 
received were different from those ordered, he thought PayPal should compensate Mrs C. 
He proposed that PayPal pay Mrs C £100 to cover both the money shed paid and the 
difficulties shed experienced due to its handling of matters.
PayPal didnt accept the investigators conclusions. It considers that, as it acted in line with 
the user agreement, it followed the correct process and fairly declined Mrs Cs claim. Our 
investigator wasnt persuaded by PayPals response, so the matter has been passed to me 
for review and determination.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think, in light of PayPals submissions, that it would be useful to make clear that the mere 
fact a respondent business follows its own processes or acts in line with an agreement it has 
drafted does not determine the question of whether it has treated its customer fairly. These 
are relevant factors, but I would expect a business to fully consider the circumstances at play 
in a case.
Here, Mrs C had already provided PayPal with the all the information it was asking for. It had 
details of the item ordered and the item received. It would have been sufficiently clear to 
PayPal that there was a significant difference between garden furniture and jewellery. In 
addition, the seller appears to have acknowledged  albeit belatedly  that Mrs C hadnt 
received the goods shed bought. PayPal hasnt offered any evidence that the seller was 
seeking to argue it had supplied Mrs C with the ordered items, though it has said the seller 
was looking to provide a partial refund.
With this in mind, Im left to wonder what purpose was served by PayPal asking for a 
declaration from Mrs C stating information shed already told it. There was no further 
information specified on PayPals request. The only effect asking for the information again 
had was that when Mrs C failed to respond PayPal declined her claim. It did so despite the 
prima facie evidence that suggests it should have found in her favour.
I dont consider that was a reasonable approach for PayPal to take. Even if PayPal 
considered it necessary to ask for the declaration (and in this situation, Im not persuaded 
this was necessary), treating Mrs C fairly should have involved reviewing the evidence 
PayPal did have, to see whether it had enough to decide the claim.
Because PayPal didnt do this, I take the view that it didnt treat Mrs C fairly, as required 
under core regulatory principles. To put things right, I think its correct that PayPal refunds 
Mrs C the payment she made to the seller. I also share the investigators view that PayPal 
should compensate Mrs C for her distress and inconvenience arising from the way it handled 
her request for assistance.
In considering suitable compensation, Ive taken into account the impact on Mrs C. Shes 
upset that PayPal treated her as if it didnt believe her. This came at a time when she was 
experiencing serious health concerns. Thats not to say PayPal bears responsibility for those 
health concerns  its simply that the distress she experienced came on top of an already 
difficult situation. Having considered matters carefully, I find £200 an appropriate sum in 
compensation, rather than the amount the investigator proposed. 
My final decision
My final decision is that to settle this complaint, PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA should pay 
Mrs C a total of £233.84, representing the compensation Ive set out above along with the 
sterling equivalent  as of todays date  of the payment she made to the seller.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 February 2022.
