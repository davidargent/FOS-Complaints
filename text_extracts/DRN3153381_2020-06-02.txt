K820x#14complaint
Mr D complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
First Response Finance Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality. 
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
adjudicator - so I wont repeat them again here.  Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.  
First Response Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible  for ensuring that it was 
of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr D. Whether or not it was of satisfactory 
quality at that time will depend on a number of factors,  including the age and mileage of the 
car and the price  that was paid for it. The car that was supplied  to him was nearly eight years 
old, had been  driven for 95,846 miles and had a price of £6,315. Satisfactory  quality also 
covers durability which means that the components within the car must be durable and last a 
reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long that time is will depend on a number of 
factors. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the adjudicator for these reasons:
Mr D complained to the dealer a few days after the car was supplied to him about  
chips in the windscreen, a rattling noise and a missing wheel cap  and it dealt with 
those issues at no cost to him and he accepted the repairs;
the car broke  down a few weeks later and the breakdown report identified a loose 
wheel bearing  bolt;
Mr D had the car inspected later that month and it was found that: lower wheel 
bearing bolt insecure  and damaged on the hub and wheel  bearing, bolt hole 
elongated. would recommend hub, wheel bearing and possible abs sensor ;
the dealer  inspected  the car in April 2019 but said that no fault could be found so 
First Response Finance arranged for the car to be inspected  by an independent   
expert;
the independent experts report concluded  that: the vehicle was found to be fault 
free and in a condition commensurate to its age and recorded mileage; and: repairs 
had been carried  out to a commercially  acceptable  standard and as such  the vehicle 
can return to service ;
the dealer  dealt  with the issues about  the windscreen, a rattling noise and a missing 
wheel cap that Mr D had reported, a loose  bolt was tightened after the car broke 
down and the independent expert  says that there are no faults  with the car and its in 
a condition consistent with its age and mileage;
I understand that Mr D didnt  collect the car from the dealer and stopped making 
payments to First Response Finance so the car was sold at auction in July 2019 and 
Ref: DRN31533812the proceeds of sale were  credited  to his account   which left £8,477.52 owing from 
him;
it was his choice  to leave the car with the dealer and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence  to show that the car was faulty at that time or that he had the right 
to reject the car;
nor am I persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me 
to require First Response  Finance  to accept Mr Ds rejection of the car, to reduce (or 
waive) the amount  that he owes to it, or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint; and
Mr D hasnt paid for the car and I suggest  that he contacts First Response  Finance to 
agree an affordable  repayment arrangement for the outstanding amount of his 
account  if he doesnt do so, I consider  it to be likely that it will take further  action to 
recover the amount  that he owes it.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 July 2020.
