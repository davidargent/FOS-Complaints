K821x#15complaint
Miss Q says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny irresponsibly lent to her. 
She says her borrowing spiralled out of control due to her circumstances. She thinks  Sunny 
shouldve made  better  checks  and not lent to her. 
background
This complaint is about 13 payday  loans  Sunny  provided to Miss Q between June 2017 and 
January 2018.  Miss Qs lending history is as follows:

Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Qs complaint and thought the loans from 6 onwards shouldnt 
have been given. 
Miss Q accepted what our adjudicator said in principle. Sunny also accepted what the 
adjudicator said.  However, when  it looked at the how the compensation should  be calculated  
it said it didnt need to make a payment  to Miss Q. This is because  she owed more on the 
loans she hadnt  been able to repay  than the refund of interest and fees would amount to. 
Because of this Sunny offered to write  off the remaining balance that Miss Q owed on her 
loans. 
Our adjudicator thought this was a fair way to resolve the complaint. Miss Q thought  she 
should be paid a higher  amount  of compensation due to the hassle  that Sunny had caused 
her. She said that she had paid almost  £1,000  to Sunny. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN59473312Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it shouldve carried  out proportionate  checks to make sure Miss Q could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Qs complaint.
Both Miss Q and Sunny have accepted our adjudicators opinion about  the lending.  So its 
now been agreed that Sunny was acting reasonably when  it approved  loans 1 to 5 but it 
shouldnt have approved loans 6 to 13. I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  
which loans it wasnt right to approve. So I wont reconsider this aspect  of the complaint. But 
I will consider  if the compensation Sunny has offered is fair and reasonable. 
The purpose of any compensation  should be to put Miss Q back in the position she wouldve 
been if Sunny not lent to her irresponsibly. So, I think its fair, in principle, that Miss Q 
receives a refund for any interest and charges she paid, as she wouldnt have paid them.  
But I also think its reasonable that Miss Q repays the principal  that was lent. Because if 
Sunny hadnt  lent to her she wouldnt have had this money. So it follows that Miss Q is only 
due any compensation on any lending if she has paid more than the capital amounts she 
borrowed. 
The information Sunny  has provided  shows that, over loans 6 to 11, Miss Q hasnt paid more  
than the capital she borrowed.  As she notes she has paid around £1,000 but she borrowed 
£1,200. So I dont think it would be fair to refund any interest and charges Miss Q paid 
because of this. 
Sunny has offered to write of the remaining balance that she owes on her loans. Given all of 
the circumstances of this complaint I think this is a fair way to resolve  this complaint and it 
adequately compensates  Miss Q for the irresponsible lending. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny should  write off the balance Miss Q owes on loans 10 to 13. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Qs complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss Q to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 July 2019.
