The complaint
The estate of Mr D complains that Phoenix Life Limited (trading as SunLife) has not paid its 
claim on Mr Ds Guaranteed Over 50 Plan. This complaint is brought by the estate of Mr D, 
which is represented by his wife, Mrs D.
What happened
Sadly, Mr D passed away in January 2020. Mrs D contacted SunLife to make a claim on 
Mr Ds policy, believing he held two Over 50s plans which should pay a sum assured to her.  
SunLife paid the sum assured on one of the policies, but said the second policy had lapsed. 
Mrs D complained about this. In its final response of 28 July 2021, SunLife confirmed Mr D 
had held two policies with it:
1. A policy ending 3254 which was taken out in January 2012 with a sum assured of 
£1,670. The last premium was paid on 30 December 2019 and SunLife paid the 
sum assured.
2. A policy ending 4670, which was taken out in February 2008 with a sum assured 
of £2,095. The policy lapsed after the last premium was paid in July 2012.
SunLife said:
 It wrote to Mr D about the policy ending 4670 on 14 January 2013 to inform him that 
it hadnt received the monthly premiums from 7 August 2012 to 7 January 2013. 
SunLifes records showed that the direct debit held with his bank had been 
cancelled. SunLife told him that if it did not receive the payment within fourteen days, 
it would be forced to cancel the policy.
 SunLife wrote again on 12 February 2013, referring to its previous letter about his 
premiums and notified him that his policy ending 4670 had no value and was 
subsequently cancelled. It confirmed that no benefits would be paid out if a claim 
was made and the life cover had ceased. 
 It received a phone call from Mr D on 12 February 2018 about the cancelled policy, 
and it explained to him that as the policy had already lapsed, it had no value.
 On 23 February 2018, SunLife sent Mr D copies of its letters of 14 January and 
12 February 2013.
 Mr D contacted the financial ombudsman service, so it sent a final response to his 
complaint about the cancelled policy on 11 June 2018. 
Because of the above, SunLife said it wouldnt pay the sum assured on the policy ending 
4670 as it lapsed in 2013. It said the terms and conditions of the policy state that if a 
customer stops paying their premiums when due for any reason, the plan will be cancelled 
and they would not get any money back.
Unhappy with this response, Mrs D asked our service to investigate her complaint. She said 
she needed the sum assured from the policy ending 4670 to pay for her husbands funeral 
and couldnt afford to do so without it. SunLife contacted us to say it didnt consent to our 
service considering its final response to Mr Ds complaint, dated 11 June 2018 because it 
didnt appear Mr D got back in touch with us within the relevant time limit. But SunLife did 
consent to our service considering the contents of its final response to Mrs Ds complaint, 
dated 28 July 2021
One of our investigators reviewed Mrs Ds complaint but didnt uphold it because the policy 
lapsed in 2013, and SunLife wrote to Mr D to confirm this. And as the policy wasnt live when 
Mr D passed away, SunLife wasnt obliged to pay the policys sum assured. Mrs D said it 
wasnt her husband who cancelled the policy, so SunLife should pay the sum assured. Our 
investigator said that even if SunLife had made a mistake and it cancelled the direct debit, it 
still wrote to Mr D before the policy was cancelled explaining the premiums werent being 
paid and let him know what he needed to do to continue the policy.  
Our investigator also explained to Mrs D that if Mr D had continued paying for the policy 
beyond 2013, he would have paid an additional £2,340, approximately. But the policy would 
only have paid £2,095 after his death. This means Mr D would have paid a lot more for the 
policy than it would have paid out. So Mr D was not financially worse off because the policy 
had lapsed. And the investigator wouldnt expect SunLife to pay the policys sum assured 
without the missing premiums being paid  as the premiums were more than the sum 
assured, SunLife still wouldnt owe any money on the policy and it could be Mrs D who 
would owe SunLife money. Mrs D remained unhappy, reiterating her financial difficulties and 
belief that her husband didnt cancel the direct debit instruction for the policy ending 4670. 
So this has come to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive not upheld this complaint. I realise my decision will disappoint Mrs D, 
and Im sorry to do so given she has lost her husband and finds herself in difficult financial 
circumstances.
Mr Ds policy ending 4670 was cancelled in 2013  Ive reviewed the letters SunLife sent to 
Mr D before the policy was cancelled in 2013 and have no reason to doubt they were sent. It 
appears Mrs D wasnt aware the policy was cancelled but I note SunLife spoke and wrote to 
Mr D in 2018, so this was the latest point he was aware this policy was cancelled. Taking 
into account the evidence available, Im satisfied SunLife took sufficient steps to let Mr D 
know his policy would be cancelled in 2013, and discussed the cancellation with him in 2018.
The terms of Mr Ds cancelled policy set out clearly that it has no cash-in value at any time, 
so if the premiums werent paid, the policy would be cancelled and Mr D would get nothing 
back. Im satisfied the policy was cancelled in line with the policys terms in 2013 so I dont 
think SunLife was under any obligation to pay the policys sum assured after Mr Ds death in 
2021.
I accept Mrs D says her husband didnt cancel the direct debit for the cancelled policy. But I 
dont think it would make a difference to the outcome of this complaint regardless of who 
cancelled the direct debit  SunLife, Mr Ds bank or Mr D himself. Even if SunLife made a 
mistake and cancelled the direct debit, it still took reasonable steps to fix the situation by 
writing to Mr D in 2013 and letting him know he needed to fill out a new direct debit mandate. 
And when this didnt happen, it was entitled to cancel the policy.
And if I thought SunLife had made a mistake in cancelling the direct debit, I would likely ask 
it to put Mr Ds estate back in the position it would have been in had the mistake not 
happened. This means the premiums that should have been paid since the policy was cancelled would need to be paid by Mr Ds estate  from 2013 until the time of his death. Our 
investigator has already explained this would have meant Mr D should have paid more in 
policy premiums than the policy would have paid out upon his death  so he would have lost 
out financially in this situation.
Whilst I sympathise with Mrs D, I dont think SunLife is under any obligation to pay the sum 
assured on Mr Ds policy ending 4670.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr D 
to accept or reject my decision before 14 December 2021.
