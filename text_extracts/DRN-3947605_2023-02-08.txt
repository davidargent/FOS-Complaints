The complaint
Mr W complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money irresponsibly lent to 
him. He says at the time he had a gambling addiction and had borrowed three loans before 
118 118 Money approved his loans.
What happened
118 118 Money lent Mr W two loans, the first in August 2020 and the second in April 2021. 
From the information provided, the loan details are as follows:
Loan 
number Start dareLoan 
amount (£) TermRepayment 
amount (£) End date
1 05/08/2020 4,000 36 months 178.28 12/04/2021
2 20/04/2021 5,000 36 months 225.91 outstanding
Mr W complained to 118 118 Money about both loans, but it didnt uphold his complaint. It 
said it hadnt done anything wrong by offering Mr W both loans. Mr W then referred his 
complaint to this service where it was looked at by one of our adjudicators.
Our adjudicator thought 118 118 Money wasnt wrong to lend loan 1 but thought it shouldnt 
have lent loan 2 and so she recommended redress for loan 2 only. 118 118 Money accepted 
the adjudicators view and has offered to put things right.
Mr W didnt accept this view, he said he wanted the lending circumstances around loan 1 to 
be reviewed by an ombudsman.  So, the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice 
at the time the loans were offered.
Before lending money to a consumer, a lender should take proportionate steps to 
understand whether the consumer could repay without borrowing further or suffering 
significant adverse consequences.
A lender should gather enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance and rules themselves didnt set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account before agreeing to lend. The 
key thing was that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different things, including things such as how much was being lent and when what 
was being borrowed was due to be repaid. A business should also take into account and 
react appropriately to what it knew about the consumer at the time it made its lending 
decision.
118 118 Money accepts it shouldnt have lent Mr W loan 2 and has offered to put things right 
on that loan in line with this services recommendations, so as there isnt a continuing 
dispute on this loan, Ive focussed my decision on the lending of loan 1.
Loan 1 was Mr Ws first loan with 118 118 Money and so he had no previous borrowing 
history with it. 118 118 Moneys checks showed Mr W earned £3,023 monthly and he 
declared living expenses of around £1,081  it included things like his housing costs, food 
and insurance. At the time, I can see Mr W declared that he lived with his parents.
118 118 Money also searched Mr Ws credit file and the results of the search did show he 
had credit with other providers, and it showed hed been managing repaying these well. For 
example, I can see that he was below the limit on his credit cards and in most months, was 
repaying more than the minimum amounts.
I can also see that Mr W had some historic defaults on his account, but these had been 
settled and I wont have expected 118 118 Money to have declined lending to him simply 
because of these historic defaults.
Given that this was Mr Ws first loan, and the repayment amount represented such a small 
portion of his declared income and I cant see that there was anything in the results from 118 
118 Moneys credit search that should have concerned it, I think the checks went far enough 
and those checks showed Mr W had sufficient income to repay the loan over the term 
without the need to borrow further.
I appreciate that Mr W has said he had a gambling addiction at the time and I can see that 
this is reflected in the bank statements hes provided, but as stated above, I think 118 118 
Moneys checks went far enough. The gambling addiction wasnt something Mr W told 118 
118 Money about and this wasnt something that it found from what I consider to be 
reasonable checks in the circumstances.
In the circumstances, I dont think 118 118 Money was wrong to lend loan 1. It has accepted 
that it shouldnt have lent loan 2 and it needs to put things right for Mr W on loan 2.
Putting things right
remove all interest and charges applied to loan 2;
treat all payments made by Mr W as payments towards the capital amount of the 
loan;
as theres still a balance outstanding, 118 118 Money should come to a suitable 
repayment arrangement with Mr W.
remove any negative information about loan 2 from Mr Ws credit file; HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 Money 
must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mr Ws complaint in part and direct Madison CF UK 
Limited to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2023.
