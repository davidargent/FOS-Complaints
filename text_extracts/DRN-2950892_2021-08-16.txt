The complaint
Mr P is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, approved him for a credit account which 
he feels was unaffordable for him at that time. 
Mr P is also unhappy that NewDay increased the credit limit on his account on several 
occasions, which he also feels was unaffordable for him at those time. 
What happened
Mr P applied for a NewDay credit account in March 2018. Mr Ps application was successful, 
and he was approved for a credit account with an initial credit limit of £1,200. In August 
2018, NewDay increased the credit limit on Mr Ps account to £2,000. Further credit limit 
increases were implemented by NewDay in February 2019, May 2019, and March 2020, the 
last of which increased the credit limit to £4,750.
In early 2021, Mr P raised a complaint with NewDay on the basis that he thought that the 
credit account had, at all times, been unaffordable for him. NewDay looked at Mr Ps 
complaint, but they felt that theyd undertaken reasonable and proportionate checks into Mr 
Ps financial position, both at the time of the initial account application and at the times of the 
later credit limit increases, and that there had been nothing resulting from these checks that 
should have given them cause to consider that the credit account might be unaffordable for 
Mr P at those times. So, they didnt uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Mr P wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but they also felt that NewDay had 
undertaken reasonable and proportionate checks and that those checks hadnt 
demonstrated that the credit account might be unaffordable for Mr P. So, they also didnt 
uphold the complaint.
Mr P remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a business to decide whether they will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how much 
and on what terms. What this service would expect would be that the business would 
undertake reasonable and proportionate checks to confirm that any credit being offered to a 
customer  or any increase in the limit of existing credit  is affordable for that customer at 
that time.
NewDay say that they did that here. When Mr P applied for the credit account in March 
2018, NewDay took information about Mr Ps income and expenditure so as to be satisfied 
that he would be able to afford any potential repayments due on the account. This included 
that Mr P was employed with an annual income of approximately £25,000. 
Additionally, NewDay also obtained information from a credit reference agency so as gain a 
better understanding of Mr Ps wider financial position. This confirmed to NewDay that Mr P 
didnt have any outstanding defaults and had no existing credit accounts in arrears. Because 
of this, Im satisfied that it was reasonable for NewDay to have concluded that Mr P wasnt in 
any financial difficulty at that time and that he could afford the credit account that he had 
applied for.
NewDay also advise that, regarding the credit limit increases, in each instance they reviewed 
Mr Ps management of the account in the months leading up to the credit limit increase and 
obtained updated information from a credit reference agency to clarify their understanding of 
Mr Ps wider financial position.
NewDays actions here are in-line with what this service would expect, and Im satisfied that 
they do constitute reasonable and proportionate checks into Mr Ps financial position. And, 
having reviewed the information that NewDay obtain here myself, Im also satisfied that there 
was nothing resulting from these checks that should have given NewDay cause to consider 
that the credit being offered might not be affordable for Mr P at those times.
For instance, with regard the first credit limit increase in August 2018, while it was the case 
that shortly after opening the credit account Mr P took the account balance slightly over the 
credit limit of £1,200, and incurred an over-limit fee as a result, there then followed a period 
where Mr P made payments to reduce the outstanding balance down to around £700  well 
within the credit limit at that time  and no further charges were incurred on the account.
 
Additionally, the information which NewDay obtained from the credit reference agencies at 
that time appeared to confirm that Mr P continued to not be in financial difficulty, including 
that Mr P appeared to be meeting his other credit commitments without incident, so I dont 
feel that it was unreasonable for NewDay to have offered the credit limit increase it did at 
that time.
Similar pictures of the affordability of the credit for Mr P present themselves with regard the 
other credit limit increases. And while I acknowledge that Mr P did maintain the balance of 
his account near the credit limit available to him, it must be noted that at no time did Mr P 
exceed the credit limit and that no over-limit fees were applied. Furthermore, the reports that 
NewDay received from the credit reference continued to support the view that Mr P wasnt in 
any financial difficulty at those times.
Of course, this isnt to say that Mr P wasnt in financial difficulty, and I acknowledge that this 
may have been the case. But I dont feel that I can fairly or reasonably say that NewDay 
ought to have know that Mr P was in financial difficulty, given the information they used for 
their assessments of Mr Ps financial position which, as previously stated, Im satisfied it was 
reasonable for NewDay to have used.
Its notable that when Mr P did contact NewDay in October 2020, to advise that he was in 
financial difficulty, he confirmed to NewDay at that time that this was as a result of a 
reduction in household income because Mr Ps wife had been furloughed due to Covid-19. 
While I can sympathise with Mr P for the difficulty he faced here, I cant conclude from this 
information that the credit limit increases hed accepted before this point werent affordable 
for him. Rather, it appears that it may have been the case that the unforeseen change in 
household circumstances was the catalyst for the previously affordable credit account no 
longer being affordable for him.
Im aware that Mr P feels that NewDay should have undertaken a more thorough check of 
his full credit file, rather than just relying on information sent to them by a credit reference agency, and that if they had it would have been apparent to NewDay that the credit limit 
increases being considered werent affordable for him at those times. 
I can appreciate Mr Ps position here, but Mr Ps management of his NewDay account had, 
until October 2020, been without significant incident, and so I dont feel that a full 
examination of Mr Ps credit file by NewDay would have been a proportionate check for 
NewDay to have taken at those times. It also must be noted that this service has requested 
a copy of Mr Ps full credit file from Mr P, so as to confirm what information might have been 
available from a check of Mr Ps full credit file, but that Mr P hasnt provided a copy to us.
All of which means that, while I sympathise with the financial position that Mr P finds himself 
in, I find it very difficult to conclude that NewDay have acted unfairly or unreasonably here. 
And I say this because Im satisfied that NewDay did undertake reasonable and 
proportionate checks into Mr Ps financial position and that there was nothing resulting from 
these checks that should have indicated to NewDay that Mr P might not be able to afford the 
credit he was being offered.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that Mr P wanted here, but it follows from this that I 
wont be upholding this complaint or asking NewDay to take any further action at this time. I 
hope that Mr P can understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision 
that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 September 2021.
