DRN-3227404
The complaint
Mr K complains about HSBC UK Bank Plc (trading as First Direct)s handling of his account. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
First Direct have made a commercial decision to migrate their cards to Mastercard.  
Our service has the power to direct a business to take action in relation to an 
individual. But we cannot interfere in how a business operates generally
Mr K said he has lost a service previously offered to him because his new card 
doesnt work in the machines in his local bank  and it no longer offers counter 
service.
But this bank, and its machines, are not controlled by First Direct. And I can see Mr K 
also has the option to make a payment through Post Office branches, which he has 
been doing. 
So while I appreciate not being able to use the machines as he did before is 
inconvenient, he hasnt been prevented from paying in money.
So for these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ks complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 April 2022.
