The complaint
Mr H has complained that when he tried to use the breakdown cover which, was part of a 
Platinum account that he took out with National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest), he was 
told by the breakdown provider that it did not have any records of him being covered. He 
therefore had to pay for the cost of the breakdown recovery himself.
What happened
Mr H attempted to make use the breakdown cover which he held as part of his Platinum 
account. He was informed by the breakdown cover provider that it did not have records of 
him being covered. 
Mr H contacted NatWest and was informed it was an issue at NatWests end that caused the 
breakdown provider to be unaware that he had cover in place. 
NatWest apologised and paid Mr H £655 in total for the costs that he incurred and to reflect 
the distress caused by this issue. Mr H also wanted some of the fees that he paid for the 
Platinum account since 2016 refunded and therefore he referred his complaint to this 
service.
One of our adjudicators looked into this complaint and he concluded that whilst NatWest had 
made an error, the compensation that it had paid was fair and reasonable. Mr H did not 
agree and therefore his complaint was passed to me to issue a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained our approach to complaints about packaged bank accounts on our website 
and Ive used that to help me decide this complaint. 
It is clear that NatWest had made an error and neither party disputes this. Therefore, I need 
to consider whether the offer that NatWest has made is sufficient given the overall 
circumstances of this complaint. 
Mr H has said that when he phoned the breakdown cover provider, he was told that he was 
not covered and so he should get a portion of his Platinum account fees back as, after all, if 
he was not being treated as a Platinum account holder what was he paying the account fee 
for. I understand Mr Hs reasoning on this. But our role is to generally put a consumer back 
into the position that they wouldve been in had NatWest not made an error. 
In this instance asking NatWest to refund any the Platinum account fees would mean that Mr 
H would be in a position where he didnt have any breakdown cover  but he did eventually 
get his cost of his breakdown claim refunded. So refunding any of the Platinum account fees 
would essentially place Mr H back into a position more advantageous than if nothing had 
gone wrong. So I cant reasonably ask NatWest to refund any of the fees Mr H paid.
When considering the level of an award, I need to consider how long it took to rectify the 
matter and cases that share similar features. In this instance, I recognise that it wouldve 
been distressing for Mr H to be told that he didnt have breakdown cover when he knew he 
did. But NatWest did accept it was at fault and tried to resolve matters by offering to pay an 
award to reflect the fact that Mr H was inconvenienced by its error and paid the costs that Mr 
H incurred. So considering all the circumstances, I think that the £655 paid by NatWest is a 
reasonable award and in line with what I would have recommended, had it not already made 
such an offer. So I think what NatWest has agreed to do is fair and reasonable.
Overall and having considered everything, its not in doubt that NatWest has done something 
wrong, but I think what it has already done to put matters right is reasonable.
My final decision
My decision is that a do not uphold this complaint as NatWest Bank UK PLC (NatWest) has 
already paid appropriate compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 October 2023.
