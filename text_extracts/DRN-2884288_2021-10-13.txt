The complaint
Mr S complains about NewDay Ltd and their decision to approve two separate credit card 
applications. Hes also unhappy with the credit limit increased applied to one of these 
accounts. 
What happened
In July 2016, Mr S applied for a credit card with NewDay. Ill refer to this as account one. 
The application was approved, and Mr S was given a £300 credit limit. This limit was 
increased to £900 in January 2017 and then £1,500 in May 2017.
In July 2017, Mr S applied for another credit card supplied by NewDay, under another 
trading name. Ill refer to this as account two. This application was approved again and Mr 
S was provided with a credit limit of £450. This limit was never increased.
In April 2018, Mr S made NewDay aware he was experiencing financial difficulties. Initally, 
NewDay completed an income and expenditure check which suggested Mr S was able to 
afford the monthly repayments. So ,they didnt agree to a repayment plan. But shortly after, 
this was re-calculated and a repayment plan was agreed for both accounts. In August 2018, 
NewDay sold Mr S debt.
In 2020, Mr S complained to NewDay. He was unhappy that NewDay had increased his 
credit limits, and approved his application for account two, in 2017 when he felt his financial 
situation showed hed be unable to maintain the repayments. So, he wanted the interest hed 
paid on both accounts refunded to him and he wanted any negative information removed 
from his credit file.
NewDay didnt agree. They thought they had completed reasonable and proportionate 
checks when deciding to approve Mr S applications and his credit limit increases. They felt 
Mr S failed to make them away of his financial difficulties until after this and the information 
they had at the time suggested the credit cards were affordable. So, they didnt think they 
needed to do anything more. Mr S remained unhappy with this response, so he referred his 
complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and upheld it. She agreed with NewDay that 
theyd approved account ones application fairly and that the £300 limit was reasonable. But 
she thought Mr S use of the card shouldve led NewDay to complete further checks before 
offering Mr S a credit limit increase. And she thought if NewDay had completed further 
checks, in this case requested to see Mr S bank statements, they wouldve realised Mr S 
was placing significant sums of money on gambling transactions and that he was in financial 
difficulty. So, she didnt think the credit limit increases on account one were fair.
And she didnt think NewDay were reasonable to approve the application or account two. 
She thought at the time of application, Mr S debt had increased as well as the number of 
accounts he had open. She thought this, alongside Mr S use of account one, shouldve 
prompted NewDay to complete further checks. And again, she thought if they had, theyd 
have recognised Mr S gambling and declined the application.
So, she thought NewDay should buy the debt back and re-calculate account one to remove 
any fees and charges applied after the first limit increase. If Mr S still owed an amount, she 
thought NewDay should arrange a suitable repayment plan or if Mr S was left with an 
amount owed to him, that this was paid to him plus 8% statutory interest on the 
overpayments from the date the account wouldve been paid off. She also thought NewDay 
should remove any negative information from Mr S credit file for this account. And our 
investigator though NewDay should do the same for account two, from the date the credit 
card was opened.
NewDay didnt agree. They didnt think it was fair to ask them to buy the debt back or pay 
interest on any amount owing to Mr S under the outcome suggested by our investigator. 
They maintained their view that the checks they completed were proportionate and that they 
had no obligation to request bank statements nor did Mr S use of account one suggest they 
needed to request these. And they didnt agree Mr S credit file should be amended, as they 
thought they had a duty to accurately report the way hed managed his account.
Our investigator replied explaining her outcome remained the same. But she changed the 
actions she though NewDay should take. For account one, she thought NewDay should do 
the following:
- Refund all interest and charges applied to {account one} above the £300 credit limit and
rework credit card account. Any refund due, should be applied to reduce the outstanding 
balance
- Remove any adverse credit information from his credit file relating to balances over this 
amount.
And for account two she thought NewDay should do the following:
- Refund all interest and charges applied to Mr S' account and rework the credit card 
account. Any
refund due, should be applied to reduce the outstanding balance.
- Remove any adverse credit information from his credit file relating to this card
Mr S accepted this outcome. But NewDay maintained their view that theyd acted 
responsibly when lending to Mr S. As NewDay didnt agree, the complaint has been passed 
to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
When considering Mr S complaint about NewDays decision to lend, there are two main 
tests I need to think about. The first of these is whether the checks NewDay completed were 
proportionate to the initial credit limit, and subsequent increases, that Mr S was provided. 
There are no set amount of checks NewDay are obliged to complete but Id expect the 
checks to consider the limit provided to Mr S against his declared income and provide 
enough information to satisfy NewDay that the credit was affordable and able to be repaid in 
a sustainable way. The second test is to consider the information these checks provided and 
whether I think NewDay assessed this information fairly to ensure their decision to lend was reasonable. And having considered both these tests, I dont think NewDay have acted fairly 
on this occasion. And Ill explain why.
Ive first though about account one, as this was opened first. I can see that Mr S declared his 
annual income as £24,000 and that he was living in rented accommodation. And Ive seen at 
the time NewDay approved the application, Mr S had one other active card, with a total 
unsecured balance of £100. His credit file did show Mr S had three active defaults, but the 
most recent was applied 59 months previously. And the file showed Mr S had been able to 
maintain his accounts well recently with no late payment markers. Having considered this, 
NewDay approved Mr Ss application and provided him with a £300 credit limit. I think this 
was a modest limit compared to Mr Ss declared annual income and I think it was fair, given 
the information NewDay had available. So, I dont think they did anything wrong at this point.
NewDay then decided to increase Mr Ss credit limit to £950 in January 2017. NewDay have 
confirmed they dont consider a customers credit file in the same way they do when initially 
approving an application. And that the increase was based on Mr S use of his card over the 
previous six months as they advertise as lender for customers with lower credit ratings who 
want to improve that. And I recognise this is their business model.
But I also think that a credit limit increase of over 200% within six months of the initial 
application approval is high. So, Ive thought about whether Mr Ss use of the account 
warranted that increase. And from what Ive seen, Mr S used his card for mainly cash 
advances rather than the usual retail spending. While I recognise Mr S was able to use his 
card in any way he wished, I think the Mr S using his card in this way shouldve suggested to 
NewDay that Mr S may have been suffering from financial difficulties elsewhere, due to his 
need for the cash advances that came with a charge. And Ive seen in the month before 
NewDay applied this increase to Mr S account, he exceeded his credit limit. So, at the very 
least, I think NewDay shouldve completed further checks before providing the limit increase.
And Ive seen Mr S statements from the same time, which showed a large number of 
gambling transactions. I think, if NewDay had completed further checks, they wouldve 
recognised Mr S gambling and I dont think they wouldve provided the credit limit increase. 
Because of this, I dont think the first increase to Mr S limit was reasonable. And so, it 
follows that the second limit increase in May 2017 was also unreasonable as Mr S shouldnt 
have been in a position to spend more on his account in the first place. 
I recognise NewDays comments about their lack of awareness surrounding Mr Ss gambling 
and I dont dispute they werent aware of this. But I think NewDay shouldve done more to 
ensure the limit increases were sustainable considering the information they had from the 
way hed used his card previously. And my decision is that, if they had, they wouldve 
become aware of Mr S gambling and I think its reasonable for me to assume the limit 
increases wouldnt have been provided at that point due to the increased risk. So, I think 
NewDay allowed Mr S greater access to credit which in turn placed him in a worsened 
financial position. Ill discuss the actions I think NewDay should take later in the decision.
Ive then thought about account two, approved in July 2017. Mr S declared his annual 
income as £26,800 so slightly higher than before. His personal situation had changed to co-
habiting, meaning his household income had increased. But Mr S credit file also showed 
that his number of active accounts had increased from one to seven, with a total unsecured 
debt rising from £100 to £2800. And Ive seen NewDays underwriting criteria, which stated 
Mr S as having high indebtedness, compared to low in the previous application.
So, I think Mr S situation had changed significantly in the year between the first and second 
application. I think Mr S credit file showed a sudden need for credit, with the number of 
searches completed and accounts opened in a relatively short period of time. And Ive seen Mr S use of account one, which continued to be used to make large cash advances and 
again, I think signalled potential financial difficulties. Account one also went over the £1500 
credit limit in the month account two was approved, which I think again showed Mr S 
reliance on credit. Because of the above, Id have expected NewDay to complete further 
checks to understand why this was and ensure Mr S was able to afford another credit 
account. And in this situation, I wouldve expected NewDay to ask Mr S for recent bank 
statements to gain and better understand of his financial understanding.
If NewDay had done so, NewDay wouldve seen that Mr S had spent significantly on 
gambling transactions between his application for account two. And because of this, I think 
its reasonable for me to assume NewDay wouldve rejected Mr S application, due to the risk 
this wouldve shown and the instability of Mr S finances. So, I think NewDay acted unfairly 
when approving account two.
Putting things right
As I think NewDay have acted unfairly, Ive then thought about what I think they should do to 
put things right. Any award or directions I make are intended to place Mr S back in the same 
situation he wouldve been, had NewDay acted fairly.
In this situation, I think NewDays initial approval of account one, with a £300 limit, was fair. 
But I think the limit increases in January and July 2017 were unreasonable and Mr S 
shouldnt have received these. I recognise Mr S received the benefit of the capital amount 
these increases provided and because of this, he should pay this back. But I dont think it 
would be fair for NewDay to charge interest or fees on account amount over the initial £300 
limit. So, I think NewDay should refund any interest and charges applied to account one on 
amounts over the initial £300 limit. If this results in Mr S account being settled, and a refund 
being left owed to him, the refund should also include 8% statutory interest from the date the 
interest and charged were applied. NewDay should also remove any negative information 
reported to Mr S credit file relating to balances over the £300 limit.
And for account two, I dont think Mr S wouldve been provided with the credit if NewDay had 
acted fairly. Again, I recognise Mr S made use of the capital amount and he should pay this 
back. But I think NewDay should refund Mr S any interest and charges applied to this 
account. And if this refund settles this balance, any amount left owing should be paid to Mr S 
plus 8% statutory interest from the date they were applied. And as I dont think Mr S should 
have been provided with the account, I think a negative credit information relating to this 
account should be removed from Mr S credit file.
I recognise NewDays comments surrounding the amendments of Mr S credit file and their 
belief this should be reported to allow other lenders to calculate risk accurately. But as Ive 
explained, I dont think Mr S shouldve had access to the additional credit on account one 
and account two entirely, so I dont think its fair for Mr S ability to obtain future credit to be 
impact by mistakes NewDay made.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I uphold Mr S complaint about NewDay Ltd and direct them 
to take the following action:
For account one, refund Mr S all interest and charges applied to the account about 
the initial £300 credit limit. If this leaves an amount payable to Mr S, this refund 
should include 8% statutory interest from the date the interest and charges were 
applied; andRemove any negative information from Mr S credit file relation to any balance over 
the £300 limit.
For account two, refund Mr S all interest and charges applied to the account. If this 
leaves an amount payable to Mr S, this refund should include 8% statutory interest 
from the date the interest and charges were applied; and
Remove any negative information from Mr S credit file relating to his account.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 November 2021.
