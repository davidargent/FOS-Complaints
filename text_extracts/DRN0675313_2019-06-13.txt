K821x#15complaint
Mr O says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 19 payday  loans  QuickQuid provided to Mr O between  August 2014 
and October 2018.  14 of the loans were  topped  up and 5 of the loans were re-financed.  
There is a summary of Mr Os lending history from QuickQuid in the appendix.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Os complaint in part and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. QuickQuid disagreed so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr O 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr O could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
Ref: DRN06753132as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Os complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
QuickQuid needed  to do more when it approved loan 1 and 2. And whilst it should have 
carried out more  checks for loan 3, it doesnt seem  that better information would have made  
a difference to the lending  decision.  So I dont think QuickQuid was wrong to give loans 1 to 
3 to Mr O.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of QuickQuids  lending history with Mr O, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Os case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
4 which  was taken  out in May 2015.  I say this because:
From  loan 4 onwards  Mr O was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of settling a 
previous one. And he had needed to extend  loan 3 before repaying it suggesting he 
was struggling to repay  it. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised  it was more likely 
than not Mr O was having to borrow  further  to cover the hole repaying his previous  
loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Os indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
Mr O was provided with loans for a fairly unbroken period of over four years. So not 
only was he not making any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid his 
indebtedness was increasing. Loan 19 was provided 50 months after Mr Rs first  a 
period which  cant  be described as the short-term timeframe payday loans are 
supposed to help consumers out for. Mr R had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Quick  Quid over an extended period.
I think that Mr O lost out because QuickQuid  continued to provide borrowing  from loan 4 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Os indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Os ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 to 19 and QuickQuid should  put things right. 
I have considered QuickQuids response  to our adjudicators view, including  its point that 
Ref: DRN06753133Mr O repaid a number of his loans early showing he wasnt experiencing financial difficulties. 
But this doesnt  change my conclusion. Mr Os repayment behaviour  doesnt  alter my finding 
that loans 4 to 19 unfairly extended  Mr Os use of high cost short term credit.  It might, in 
different circumstances, be reasonable to conclude  that the early repayment of a loan 
indicates an improvement in financial  circumstances. But I disagree that was the case here, 
as shown by Mr Os subsequent level of repeat borrowing.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr O paid on loans 4 to 19;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 4 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 4 to 19 should be removed from 
Mr Os credit file.
I understand the outstanding balance on loan 19 was waived  on 29 April 2019.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr O a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Os complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) should pay Mr O compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 July 2019.
