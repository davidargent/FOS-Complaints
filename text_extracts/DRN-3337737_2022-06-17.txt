One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that because of the repeat 
nature of the lending and the pattern of borrowing, Morses ought not to have approved loan 
4 for Mr F.
Morses disagreed, and no response has been received from Mr F or his representative. 
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide and I issued a provisional decision on 
1 June 2022 in which I gave reasons as to why I considered that Morses had done nothing 
wrong. The main part of that provisional decision is set out in a later part of this decision and 
to differentiate it, the provisional decision is in smaller type. 
Each party was given time to respond and not having heard from either party despite 
reminding Mr Fs representative, I have decided to issue my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr F 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early 
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult 
to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.
The industry regulator defines sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in 
particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
My provisional decision findings from 1 June 2022
The combination of Morses disagreeing with the outcome on loan 4, and Mr F not disagreeing with 
our adjudicators opinion (as we have not heard from him or his representative) means that in my view 
the only loan in dispute is loan 4.
So, I wont be reviewing loans 1 to 3 and loans 5 to 9 in much depth in this provisional decision. And 
Ill go further and say that with absolutely no evidence about income or expenditure from either party 
for loans 1 to 3 (and loan 4) then, realistically, I dont consider that I can make any findings at all.And, in relation to loan 4 on current evidence I do not know enough about Mr Fs financial situation to 
be able to consider it in any more depth. Especially as it appears Mr F has not disagreed with our 
adjudicators view.
Plus, I do not agree with our adjudicator on loan 4, as I do not consider we have enough information 
about Mr Fs financial situation to know if the repetitive lending up to that point was enough to have 
caused him harm and that the repayment of £10.50 a week was unsustainable for him.
I do maintain that by that stage, Mr Fs application for loan 4, additional checks by Morses may well 
have been justified. It was the fourth loan and it was for a 50 week term which I consider justified 
additional checks to ensure Mr F could afford loan 4 for that term.
However, I have read what Mr Fs representative has said but I have no evidence to substantiate his 
employment or financial position at the time it was approved in 2012. And so, without more, I have no 
evidence I can review which would tell me what Morses were to have seen even if it had carried out 
additional checks for that date.
In respect of loans 5 to 9 I do have more information as Morses has been able to submit information it 
had gathered from 2017 onwards, including a credit search result report for August 2017. And so, 
considering Mr Fs apparent agreement with the outcome for loans 5 to 9, I have reviewed them 
briefly. On the evidence I have now, I am planning not to uphold loans 5 to 9.
So, on current evidence I am planning not to uphold his complaint.
How did each party respond?
We have not heard from either party. In the absence of any further representations or 
evidence, then I see no reason to depart from the provisional findings I made in my 
provisional decision. 
For the same reasons as set out earlier, I do not uphold Mr Fs complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Fs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2022.
