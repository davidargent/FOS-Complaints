K821x#15complaint
Mr W says Active Securities Limited trading as 247Moneybox lent to him irresponsibly. He 
says he was stuck in a cycle of payday  lending and he needed to borrow  again to cover  the 
repayments he had made to earlier  loans.  
background
This complaint is about 52 payday  loans  247Moneybox provided  to Mr W between  
March 2013 and May 2018. There is table that shows  some of the information 247Moneybox 
has provided about the loans at the end of this decision. 
Our adjudicator upheld  the complaint. 247Moneybox disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
247Moneybox needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that 247Moneybox should  fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
Ref: DRN79430082to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. Ive decided  to uphold  Mr Ws 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Before approving loans 1 to 6 I think its likely 247Moneybox either had, or shouldve had, 
information that showed Mr W was having problems managing his money. 247Moneybox 
hasnt been unable to provide the information it relied on before approving the first loan. But 
the credit  check information it obtained  before the second loan showed that Mr W had very 
recently been unable to pay some  of his other creditors  and he was in receipt  of a county 
court judgement about this. I think a proportionate check  before loan 1 would also have 
shown this. 
Whilst I dont have  all of the detail of this judgement it does show  that, in the recent past, 
Mr W had financial  problems that were  significant  enough to result in a court  action. I think 
this was a reasonable indicator that Mr W couldnt  sustainably repay any further credit,  as he 
couldnt repay the credit he already had. 
So Im upholding  Mr Ws complaint about loans 1 to 6. 
And I havent thought about individual, proportionate  affordability  checks for loans 7 to 52 
because I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall  pattern of 
247Moneyboxs lending history with Mr W, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which  
247Moneybox should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so 247Moneybox should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
up to loan 7 the amounts Mr W was borrowing had increased. Loan 1 was for just 
over £100, but the borrowing amount had risen to over £600 by loan 5. And going 
forward Mr W was provided with a new loan within days  of settling a previous one 
So 247Moneybox ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Mr W was having 
to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ws indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed 247Moneybox. Loan  52 
was taken out over 4 years after Mr Ws first. Mr W had paid large  amounts of 
interest, I understand  this was over £10,000,  to service a debt to 247Moneybox. 
This is a very long time to use short term high cost credit  and it is a clear indication  
that Mr W had longer term problems than a temporary need for cash  - if indeed the 
county court judgement did not show this already 
I think that Mr W lost out because 247Moneybox continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
Ref: DRN79430083the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ws 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 7 to 52 and 247Moneybox should put things 
right for Mr W.
putting things right  what 247Moneybox needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 1 to 52;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative payment  information about loans 1 to 6 from Mr Ws credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 52 should be removed from 
Mr Ws credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 247Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 
247Moneybox must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ws complaint.
Active Securities Limited should put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr W to accept 
or reject my decision before 23 October  2019.
