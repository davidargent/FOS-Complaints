The complaint
Ms C is unhappy with the way that NewDay Ltd, trading as Opus, managed her credit 
account.  
What happened
Ms C had a credit account with NewDay with a credit limit of £7,800. In October 2015, 
NewDay increased the credit limit on Ms Cs account to £10,150. In August 2016, NewDay 
increased the credit limit on Ms Cs account again, this time to £11,700.
In 2020, Ms C raised a complaint with NewDay about how theyd managed her account. 
NewDay looked at Ms Cs complaint, but they felt that theyd undertaken reasonable and 
proportionate checks into Ms Cs financial position before offering the credit limit increases, 
and that there had been nothing resulting from those checks that had caused them to 
consider that the credit limit increases being offered werent affordable for Ms C at those 
times. So, they didnt uphold Ms Cs complaint.
Ms C wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that the credit limit increases 
offered to Ms C had been of significant amounts, and that this had meant that NewDay 
should have undertaken more robust checks into Ms Cs financial position at those times. 
Our investigator also felt that if NewDay had undertaken more robust checks, that it was 
likely that they should have concluded that the credit limit increases under consideration 
shouldnt have been offered to Ms C, because they werent affordable for her at those times. 
So, they recommended that the complaint be upheld in Ms Cs favour and that NewDay 
should take corrective action accordingly.
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendations put forward by our investigator, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms Cs initial complaint to this service had a broader scope than has been described in the 
preceding section. However, our investigator correctly surmised that a portion of Ms Cs 
initial complaint fell outside the remit of what this service can investigate, due primarily to the 
length of time that has elapsed since the events being complained about taking place. This 
meant that the only aspects of Ms Cs complaint that this service could investigate were the 
two credit limit increases referenced above. Both Ms C and NewDay accepted our 
investigators position on this matter, and I also concur. As such, I have limited my review to 
the credit limit increases accordingly. 
Its for a business to decide if it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how much and on 
what terms. What this service would expect would be that the business would undertake 
reasonable and proportionate borrower focusses checks to ensure that any credit being 
offered, including any increases to previously existing credit, are affordable for that customer 
at that time.
NewDay say that they did that here. Before they offered the credit limit increases to Ms C in 
October 2015 and August 2016, they reviewed the information that they held on Ms C, 
including information about her income and expenditure, and they also reviewed Ms Cs 
recent management of the credit account. 
NewDay also confirm that they obtained information from credit reference agencies to 
enable them to get a better understanding of Ms Cs wider financial position at those times. 
And NewDay have reiterated to this service that there was nothing resulting from those 
checks that caused them to consider that the credit limit increases being offered to Ms C 
might not have been affordable for her at those times.
I can appreciate NewDays position here  to a degree. But Im not convinced that the 
checks that NewDay undertook here were reasonable, proportionate, and borrower 
focussed, such that NewDay were able to arrive at a clear understanding of Ms Cs financial 
position at those times.
One of the reasons I say this is that Ms C has confirmed to this service that shed written to 
NewDay earlier in 2015 advising that her personal circumstances at that time were deeply 
traumatic  such that its reasonable that NewDay should have considered Ms C as being a 
vulnerable customer at that time - and that she was struggling financially as a result. And this 
appears to be corroborated by Ms Cs management of her credit account around that time, 
when Ms C regularly exceeded her credit limit and incurred charges because of this.
In addition, I feel that the credit limit increase that NewDay offered Ms C in October 2015 -  
from £7,800 to £10,150  should be considered as being a significant increase, especially 
given that NewDay had obtained information from Ms C in January 2015 at which time shed 
declared her annual income as £40,000 - but also that she already at that time had 
unsecured debt of over £36,000. This meant that Ms Cs unsecured debt was approaching 
her stated yearly income, and it must be noted that Ms C confirmed that she also had a 
significant mortgage balance outstanding at that time.
So, while I can appreciate that the standard checks that NewDay undertook at the time of 
the October 2015 credit limit increase might have provided NewDay with the impression that 
the credit limit being offered to Ms C would have been affordable for her, I feel that the 
severity of Ms Cs recent personal and financial struggles, and the size of the new credit limit 
amount being offered to Ms C, should have given NewDay cause to undertake more robust, 
borrower focussed checks into Ms Cs financial position - so as to be certain that they had a 
correct understanding of Ms Cs financial position at that time.
And, had NewDay undertaken such additional checks  which I feel should have included 
direct conversation with Ms C and possibly a request to asses Ms Cs recent current account 
statements  its difficult not to conclude that NewDay should have determined that Ms Cs 
financial position remained perilous at that time, such that the credit limit increase under 
consideration shouldnt have been offered.
With regard the second credit limit increase, from £10,150 to £11,700 in August 2016, given 
that I Im satisfied that the earlier credit limit increase shouldnt have been offered to Ms C, 
its difficult not to conclude that this later credit limit increase also shouldnt have been 
offered, for similar reasons.
Furthermore, Ms C had another credit account administered by NewDay at that time, and on that other account, in the months leading up to the second credit limit increase in August 
2016, Ms C regularly made late payments against the other account and incurred fees as a 
result. And it must be noted that NewDay have themselves acknowledged, on the other 
account, that Ms Cs financial circumstances were such that they shouldnt have increased 
Ms Cs credit limit on that account  which they did in April 2016, not long before the August 
2016 credit limit increase on the account in question. And NewDay have upheld a complaint 
in Ms Cs favour on that other account and taken corrective action as a result.
I realise that this might not be the outcome that NewDay were wanting here, but it follows 
that Ill be upholding this complaint in Ms Cs favour on the basis that I dont feel that the 
credit limit increases offered to Ms C in October 2015 and August 2016 were affordable for 
her at those times.
I can appreciate that NewDay did undertake checks at the time of those credit limit 
increases, but I as I have explained above, I dont feel that these checks were reasonable or 
proportionate in consideration of Ms Cs circumstances at that time, of which I feel NewDay 
ought reasonably to have been aware, and that NewDay should have undertaken more 
robust checks to ensure the affordability of the credit limit increases being offered to Ms C. 
Finally, I consider that had NewDay undertaken more robust checks and had obtained a 
more accurate position of Ms Cs financial position at those times, NewDay should have 
concluded that the credit limit increases under consideration werent affordable for her.
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse all interest, fees, and charges incurred or accrued on the account 
for any balance above £7,800 from the time of the credit limit increase in October 2015 
onwards.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance on the account in Ms Cs favour, NewDay 
must pay this amount to Ms C along with 8% simple interest.
NewDay must also remove all adverse information relating to this account from Ms Cs credit 
file from October 2015 onwards.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd, trading as Opus, on the 
basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 August 2021.
