The complaint
Mr P complains that esure Insurance Limited mishandled his claim on a motor insurance 
policy. 
What happened
The subject matter of the claim and the complaint is a hatchback car, made with a powerful 
engine by a premium-brand car-maker and first registered in late 2013.
For the year from late May 2022, Mr P had the car insured on a comprehensive policy with 
esure.
Any claim for theft was subject to an excess of £400.00.
In late April 2023, Mr P reported that someone had stolen the car.
On about 18 May 2023, esure said the car was a total loss and its pre-theft market value had 
been £10,968.00. Mr P complained to esure that it was under-valuing the car.
By a final response dated about 22 May 2023, esure turned down the complaint. It said it 
had seen trade guide valuations as follows:
CAP £10,670.00
Parkers £11,064.00
Glasss £11,170.00
Cazoo £13,178.00
The final response said that esure regarded the Cazoo figure as an anomaly, so esure had 
taken an average of the other three figures, £10,968.00. The final response said esure had 
sent Mr P a cheque for £10,568.00, which he could accept without affecting his complaint.
Mr P brought his complaint to us straight away.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. The investigator 
obtained a further trade guide valuation as follows:
Autotrader £13,007.00
In her first opinion, the investigator thought that we dont usually use Parkers and we should 
discount CAP as an outlier and take an average of the remaining three (that is £12,451.00).
The investigator recommended that esure should pay Mr P:
1. the difference between £12,451.00 and the settlement offered; and
2. 8% interest on the difference from the day of settlement; and
3. £50.00 for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Mr P agreed with the investigators opinion.
On 4 August 2023, the investigator asked esure to respond to the opinion by a final deadline 
of 7 August 2023. On 7 August 2023, esure accepted the investigators recommendation.
On 18 August 2023, our investigator gave a second opinion. She thought that the higher two 
valuations were more accurate. So, we should be asking esure to pay an average of these 
two. 
She recommended that esure should pay Mr P the difference between the settlement offer 
provided and the average of Cazoo and Auto Trader which is £13,092.50. She said that if 
the settlement had been paid, esure was to include 8% interest from the date the settlement 
was paid.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr P  
and to esure on 22 November 2023. I summarise my findings:
I was minded that the figure of £10,968.00 was unreasonable. Thats because esure 
agreed the investigators recommendation to increase the valuation to £12,451.00. 
So Mr P has a reasonable expectation of further payment.
Subject to any further information either from Mr P or from esure, my provisional decision 
was to uphold this complaint. I intended to direct esure Insurance Limited to pay Mr P:
1. in addition to its payment of £10,568.00, a balance of £1,483.00 for his lost car; and
2. simple interest at a yearly rate of 8% on the balance of £1,483.00 from 22 May 2023 
to the date of payment. If esure considers that its required by HM Revenue & 
Customs to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr P how much its 
taken off. It should also give him a certificate showing this if he asks for one, so he 
can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Mr P and esure each accepted the provisional decision.
I see no reason to change my view. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Ombudsman Service expects an insurer to value a used vehicle by reference 
to the retail figures in certain trade guides. We find such figures persuasive as they are 
based on extensive research of likely selling prices.
We will look at any relevant evidence. But, compared to the trade guide figures, we usually 
find advertisements less reliable because they contain only asking prices that may be 
negotiated downwards.Typically, each trade guide will give a different figure, so that there is a range of figures. If 
one figure is out of line with all the others, then we may disregard it as an outlier. Otherwise, 
we often say that any figure in the range is a fair figure.
In Mr Ps case, Ive noted the make, model, age, specification, condition and approximate 
mileage of the car. Ive checked the trade guide figures.
I dont regard the CAP figure as so out of line (for example with the Glasss figure) that I 
should disregard it as an outlier. Similarly, I dont regard the Autotrader figure as so out of 
line (for example with the Cazoo figure) that I should disregard it as an outlier.
But I wouldnt usually consider the Parkers figure. So I regard the other four figures as 
forming two distinct ranges (CAP and Glasss on the one hand and Cazoo and Autotrader on 
the other). So Ive looked at what other evidence is available.
Mr P has told us that he saw advertisements for similar cars, including one at the lowest 
price of about £15,495.00. But I dont consider that he has provided enough advertisements 
or other evidence to support a valuation at that level.
The other evidence also includes the Parkers figure. As I recall, we stopped using that guide 
because it was less reliable when used retrospectively months after the loss. However, 
esure has shown us that it obtained the Parkers figure shortly after the theft. Im aware that 
Parkers often produces a figure similar to CAP. 
Nevertheless, in the absence of any stronger evidence, I consider that its fair to say that the 
Parkers figure supports the figures from CAP and Glasss.
Therefore I could find that esures figure of £10,968.00 wasnt an unreasonable valuation.
However, I consider that the figure of £10,968.00 is unreasonable. Thats because esure 
agreed the investigators recommendation to increase the valuation to £12,451.00. So Mr P 
has a reasonable expectation of further payment.
Putting things right
Therefore I find it fair and reasonable to direct esure to increase its valuation to £12,451.00. 
That will require further payment of a balance as follows:
agreed valuation £12,451.00
less excess £     400.00
sub-total £12,051.00
less paid £10,568.00
balance £  1,483.00
Ive thought about distress and inconvenience and about interest.
I consider that the theft and the need to make a claim were bound to cause Mr P some 
distress and inconvenience. Also, some of Mr Ps distress and inconvenience has been to do 
with esure keeping him out of money. Interest is a form of compensation for that. So I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct esure to pay Mr P compensation for distress and 
inconvenience.
Within a month of the theft, esure told Mr P he could accept the cheque for £10,568.00. So I 
dont find it fair and reasonable to direct esure to pay interest on that. But I find it fair and 
reasonable to direct esure to pay interest at our usual rate on the balance of £1,483.00 from 
22 May 2023 to the date of payment. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct esure Insurance Limited to pay Mr P:
1. in addition to its payment of £10,568.00, a balance of £1,483.00 for his lost car; and
2. simple interest at a yearly rate of 8% on the balance of £1,483.00 from 22 May 2023 
to the date of payment. If esure considers that its required by HM Revenue & 
Customs to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr P how much its 
taken off. It should also give him a certificate showing this if he asks for one, so he 
can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 January 2024.
