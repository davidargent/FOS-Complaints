The complaint
Mr S complains that Nationwide Building Society lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr S had two current accounts with Nationwide. From December 2016 Mr S had an 
overdraft facility on the first account of £1,000. This was increased in June 2017 to £1,500 
and then a year later in June 2018 to £2,750.
 
In March 2018 acquired a £1,000 overdraft facility on his second account. This was 
increased to £2,000 on 13 June 2018 and to £2,750 about ten days later.
Mr S got into financial difficulties and in November 2018 Nationwide wrote to Mr S to explain 
that it was cancelling his overdraft facility on the first account. Mr S paid the overdraft sum 
back in the same month. Nationwide did not remove the overdraft facility for the second 
account. 
Mr S says he couldnt afford the credit. He says he was very unwell at the time of the lending 
and so he wasnt able to manage his lending. He thinks Nationwide shouldnt have lent to 
him in the circumstances.
 
Nationwide says it did all the necessary checks before it lent to Mr S and it didnt see 
anything which might make it think he couldnt afford the overdraft facilities at the time. 
Our investigator considered that Mr Ss complaint should be partially upheld. They thought 
that Nationwide had completed necessary and proportionate checks in relation to the 
overdraft facilities up until 22 June 2018 but that at that point Nationwide shouldnt have 
increased it further. 
Our investigator thought that it was clear by then that Mr S would struggle to repay the 
borrowing. Our investigator thought Nationwide should repay the fees and charges incurred 
by Mr S as a result of the unfair lending. 
 
Nationwide agreed with the view and agreed to put things right the way our investigator 
suggested. Mr S didnt agree. He said that his doctor had thought that Nationwide was 
irresponsible. Mr S said that he wasnt receiving any salary in the months leading up to the 
overdraft increases and Nationwide ought to have known this and not provided more credit.
As Mr S didnt agree with the view, the complaint was passed to me to make a decision.
When I reviewed Mr Ss complaint I considered that his complaint should be upheld from an 
earlier point. I wrote to all parties to explain my provisional decision.
Nationwide responded to my provisional decision and agreed to pay the compensation I had 
said I would direct. Mr S and his representative didnt respond.
As Mr S didnt actively respond I am providing this final decision to confirm the outcome. As 
neither party provided any further information I see no reason to depart from the findings in 
my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible 
lending - including the key relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our 
website and Ive taken that into account when considered Mr Ss complaint.
The accounts
As explained, Mr S had two current accounts with Nationwide. Each of them had an 
overdraft facility and overdraft increases were made on both of them over the course of a 
few years. 
When our investigator first looked at Mr Ss complaint it seemed that Mr Ss accounts ran as 
follows:
Account 4379/First 
accountExisting overdraft 
limitIncrease New limit
23 December 2016 0 £1000 £1000
3 June 2017 £1000 £500 £1500

opened)
13 June 2018 £1000 £1000 £2000
22 June 2018 £2000 £750 £2750
However, Nationwide has since confirmed that in relation to the first account the increases 
were as follows:
Account 4379/First 
accountExisting overdraft 
limitIncrease New limit
23 December 2016 0 £1000 £1000
3 June 2017 £1000 £500 £1500
3 June 2018 £1500 £500 £2000
13 June 2018 £2000 £700 £2700
And in relation to the second account, they were as follows:

accountExisting overdraft

March 2018 £1000 (taken the 
day the account

21 June 2018 £2000 £500 £2500
27 June 2018 £2500 £250 £2750
I think this should be viewed holistically. That is, that as the two overdrafts were with the 
same business on the same type of product at the same time, they should be viewed as a 
single line of credit.

Did Nationwide act fairly?
Nationwide needed to take reasonable steps to make sure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S 
could afford to repay what he was being lent in a sustainable manner. These checks could 
take into account a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the 
repayment amounts, how much borrowing Mr S had elsewhere and Mr Ss income and 
expenditure. There is no prescriptive list of what checks need to be done. There may even 
come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that 
that the lending was unsustainable.
Nationwide said that it conducted checks to ensure the credit would be affordable for Mr S 
each time it agreed to increase Mr Ss overdrafts. I have seen only limited evidence of the 
checks it did, and these are exclusively in relation to Mr Ss second account from March 
2018. Nationwide says it would have completed other checks of Mr Ss credit file and other 
available data and I can see that it did have an understanding that Mr S had debt elsewhere. 
I will return to this later. 
Theres no information about what checks Nationwide did in relation to the increases in Mr 
Ss overdraft on the first account before 2018 but given the level of proposed borrowing, Mr 
Ss income at the time and the management of his current accounts I dont think there was 
anything to make Nationwide think the lending wouldnt be affordable. 
In March 2018 Mr S opened the second account with another overdraft facility. As Ive 
already explained, Nationwide hasnt been able to provide much evidence of the checks it 
did at the time. I can see that Mr S had by then around £30,000 of borrowing elsewhere. But 
Mr S didnt appear to be overindebted according to Nationwides checks and I havent seen 
anything else to suggest that Mr S was in difficulty. Mr S was generally in credit in his bank 
accounts and there was no evidence of unusual spending patterns. 
However, things began to change in June 2018. Mr S applied for five increases across both 
his account overdrafts during the course of the month, two of them on the same day (13th 
June). By the end of the month Mr S had increased his overdraft facility by nearly £3,000. I think this pattern of activity ought to have alerted Nationwide to a potential problem. I can 
see from Nationwides checks that Mr S didnt have any deposits into his account in three 
out of the four months leading up to the increases. 
I think after Mr S had increased his overdraft limits on both accounts on the same day that 
Nationwide should have exercised caution in relation to further overdraft limit increases. So, 
when Mr S applied again on 21 (or 22) June 2018 to increase his limit by a further £500 
Nationwide ought to have looked more carefully at Mr Ss circumstances. He had recently 
sought an increase in his credit card limit with Nationwide and he hadnt received an income 
into either of his current accounts for three out of the four preceding months. I think it was 
clear by this point that his circumstances had changed, and the increased credit was likely 
not affordable. 
On this basis, I dont think Nationwide acted fairly on the information it had available to it and 
I think Mr S lost out as a result of what Nationwide did wrong.
Putting things right
Nationwide should not have provided the final credit limit increase on the second account to 
Mr S. To settle this complaint Nationwide should do the following:
Re-work Mr Ss current overdraft balance on his second account so that any 
additional interest, fees and charges applied as a result of the overdraft limit 
increases after 13 June 2018 are removed. This means that from 13 June 2018 
onwards interest can only be charged on £2,000 of borrowing on his second account. 
If an outstanding balance remains on the second account overdraft once the 
adjustments have been made Nationwide should contact Mr S to arrange a suitable 
repayment plan for this. It should remove any negative information recorded on Mr 
Ss credit file as a result of the interest and charges applied to Mr Ss account as a 
result of the later increases in his overdraft limit.
If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer being 
an outstanding balance on the second account, then any extra should be applied to 
Mr Ss first account overdraft.
If this results in there no longer being an outstanding balance on either account, then 
any extra should be returned to Mr S along with 8% simple interest* on the 
overpayments from the date they were made (if they were) until the date of 
settlement. 
If no outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made then 
Nationwide should remove any adverse information from Mr Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Nationwide to deduct tax from any award of interest. It must give Mr S a 
certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if he asks for one. If it intends to apply the refund to reduce 
an outstanding balance, it must do so after deducting the tax.
My final decision
I have decided that Nationwide acted unfairly when it provided Mr S with overdraft limit 
increases after 13 June 2018. To put things right I direct Nationwide Building Society to pay 
compensation as detailed above. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 January 2024.
