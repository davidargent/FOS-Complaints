The complaint
Mrs B complains that Metro Bank PLC trading as RateSetter (RateSetter) is holding her 
liable for the debt on a loan taken out in her name without her knowledge and consent. 
What happened
The background to this complaint is well known to both parties, so I wont repeat everything 
here. In brief summary, in August 2022 a loan was taken out with RateSetter in Mrs Bs 
name for Â£5,000. Mrs B subsequently got in touch with RateSetter to let it know she hadnt 
applied for the loan. RateSetter investigated things and ultimately couldnt reach agreement 
with Mrs B, so she referred her complaint about RateSetter to us. Our Investigator couldnt 
resolve things informally, so the case has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint for materially the same reasons as our 
Investigator.
In this case, my first consideration is: did Mrs B enter into this loan agreement, or was it 
done without her knowledge and consent as she alleges? 
Having considered this carefully, I think its most likely the loan was taken out in Mrs Bs 
name without her knowledge and consent, and she therefore did not enter into the loan 
agreement. I say this because Im satisfied Mrs B has plausibly and persuasively explained 
that shed previously given her details to her son so he could note her as a guarantor for 
some lending in his name, but that her son applied for this loan with RateSetter in her name 
completely without her knowledge or consent. I believe Mrs B. The information suggests to 
me the email address and mobile number used in the loan application werent Mrs Bs. I note 
Mrs B appears to have reported the matter to the police and Action Fraud. And nothing 
RateSetter has said or provided persuades me Mrs B otherwise had knowledge of the loan 
application in her name or consented to it at the time. 
Since Im satisfied Mrs B most likely didnt apply for or agree to this loan, I dont think it 
would be fair for RateSetter to hold her to the terms of the loan agreement she never saw or 
agreed to. So, RateSetter shouldnt hold Mrs B liable for interest and charges, neither should 
there be a record of the loan on Mrs Bs credit file  so if there currently is, this should be 
removed. 
However, Im also satisfied in this case that it wouldnt be fair for RateSetter to pursue Mrs B 
for the outstanding loan funds. I say this because Mrs B appears to have had no benefit from 
these at all. They landed in her bank account on 8 August 2022 and she moved them onto 
her son that same day. Mrs B has explained that she queried the funds with her son, but he 
tricked her into thinking hed applied for too many loans, that the funds being sent directly to 
her was a quirk of guarantor loans, and that if she returned the funds to him  as, he said, 
this RateSetter loan had been applied for by mistake  hed return them to the lender to 
close the loan. Again, I believe Mrs B. So when RateSetter says it would have expected  
Mrs B to raise concerns with it right away when she received the funds into her account, I 
dont think this is fair. I cant see that Mrs B had any reason not to trust her son at that stage. 
She appears to have gotten in touch with RateSetter in December 2022 as soon as it was 
clear to her what had in fact happened. And like our Investigator, I have found Mrs Bs 
testimony to be plausible and persuasive and I think shes acted in good faith and is a victim 
of fraud. 
Im satisfied this means RateSetters argument that the funds are a civil dispute between 
Mrs B and her son isnt fair here. Instead, Im satisfied Mrs B didnt have anything to do with 
this loan. Her son tricked RateSetter into granting it. And when the money hit Mrs Bs 
account she was tricked into moving it onto her son in circumstances where I dont think 
Mrs B acted unreasonably given the individual circumstances of this case. Ive also thought 
about the fact Mrs B appears to have previously been content to act as guarantor for her son 
for some lending. But the evidence indicates to me this wasnt for this loan  here it seems 
most likely that Mrs B was tricked by her son into thinking this particular loan was a mistake. 
So, whilst Ive considered everything RateSetter has said, Im satisfied here it wouldnt be 
fair for RateSetter to pursue Mrs B for the outstanding funds  Im satisfied RateSetter 
should write off the loan.
My final decision
For the reasons explained, I uphold this complaint and I direct Metro Bank PLC trading as 
RateSetter to:
write off the loan and not pursue Mrs B for any repayment of the loan; and
amend Mrs Bs credit file removing any information about the loan and searches.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 November 2023.
