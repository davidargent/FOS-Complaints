K822xcomplaint
Mr B complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent 
irresponsibly to him.
background
Between July 2015 and October  2016, Mr B borrowed 17 loans from Sunny. His borrowing 
history is set out in full at the appendix to this decision.
Sunny told us that it agreed that loan 17 shouldnt have been  provided to Mr B. It offered to 
settle the complaint on that basis. Our adjudicator thought the complaint  should be upheld  in 
respect of loans 5 to 16. For loan 5, she said that Sunny should  have reasonably  known that 
Mr B was having financial difficulties. From  loan 6 onwards, she thought it should have been 
clear to Sunny that the pattern of Mr Bs borrowing was otherwise harmful.
In response, Sunny  reconsidered  its position. It said that it should not have agreed to lend 
loans 12 to 17 to Mr B and offered to settle  the complaint accordingly.  Mr B did not accept  
Sunnys offer.
Another of our adjudicators looked at the matter. He didnt  think further checks  around  
Mr Bs finances would have caused Sunny to change its lending decision about  loans 5 to 7. 
He thought Sunny should have realised that Mr B was reliant on its loans by the time it 
agreed to loan 8. He thought the complaint should be upheld  in respect of loans 8 to 17.
Neither party responded to our adjudicators latest  view and so the matter  has been  passed 
to me to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
In addition to that, there may even come a point  where the lending history and pattern of 
lending itself clearly  demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
Ref: DRN13977272difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
Early in the lending relationship, Sunny was entitled to rely on the information Mr B provided 
to it. So for loans 1 to 4, I can see that Sunny asked Mr B for details of his income and 
expenditure. From what he said about  his finances at that time, I think the loan repayments 
would have reasonably appeared to be sustainably affordable.
From loan 5, I agree  that Sunny should have probably found  out more  about Mr Bs finances. 
But even if it had undertaken  a full review at that point, I havent  seen  anything  to suggest 
that Mr B was having difficulty  managing  his money.  I agree with our second adjudicator and 
I dont think the complaint  should be upheld in respect  of loans 5 to 7.
Having said that, Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of the lending  history with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. If that were  the case, Sunny should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Bs case, I further agree with our second  
adjudicator that this point was reached by loan 8. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr B was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr B had taken out 8 loans in around five months At this stage, the amount 
he borrowed had increased  quite significantly. So Sunny  ought  to have realised it was 
most likely that Mr B was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous 
loan was leaving in his finances  and that his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Bs first loan was for £150  and loan 8 was for £350. At this point Sunny ought to have 
known that Mr B was not likely borrowing  to meet  a temporary shortfall  in his income but 
to meet  an ongoing need.
Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed. Loan 17 was taken out 
over a year after Mr Bs first. And it was for a much larger amount. Mr B had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Mr B lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 8 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number  of loans Mr B borrowed was likely  to have  had negative  implications on his 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
Ref: DRN13977273So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 8 to 17 and Sunny will need to put things 
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 8 to 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  8 to 17 should be removed from Mr Bs credit 
file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr B a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding this complaint. Elevate  Credit International 
Limited must  put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2020.
