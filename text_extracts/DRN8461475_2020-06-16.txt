K821x#15complaint
Mrs B has complained about two credit card accounts taken out with NewDay Ltd. Mrs B 
says that NewDay  shouldnt have increased the credit limit on her Aqua card in 2014 and 
that it should not have allowed her to take out the Opus card in 2018.  
background
In February 2012  Mrs B took out the Aqua card with NewDay. It had a credit limit of £800.In 
April 2012 Mrs B had to seek help with her debts through StepChange and in September 
2012 she entered into a payment plan. In October 2013 StepChange  said that the 
arrangement between it and Mrs B was ending as she was no longer considered to be in 
financial hardship.
Payments were maintained on Mrs Bs credit card without any problem after the payment 
arrangement came  to an end. In July 2014  NewDay wrote  to Mrs B saying her card limit 
would be increased  to £1,600 within 40 days if she didnt  contact  them to opt out. Mrs B 
didnt contact NewDay and so the limit was increased.
In 2016 Mrs B was once  again in financial difficulty and arranged a new payment plan. 
Unfortunately Mrs B didnt  keep  to the payment arrangement and the debt was sold to a debt 
collection agency.
In 2018 Mrs B took out another credit  card, the Opus, with a credit  limit of £600. She fell into 
financial difficulty with this account  and had to enter  into a payment arrangement with 
NewDay.
In December 2019 Mrs B complained to us about NewDay. She explained that she had 
mental health issues and a gambling addiction. Mrs B said that NewDay shouldnt have 
increased her Aqua  credit limit in 2014  because of her past credit  problems  and her health 
and gambling  issues. Mrs B also said that NewDay  shouldnt have offered her the Opus card 
in 2018 either, for the same reasons.
NewDay acknowledged that it shouldnt have allowed Mrs B to take out the Opus card, given  
that the debt on her previous NewDay card had been sold to a debt collector. NewDay said it 
would refund all the interest charged on that card. NewDay also closed the account  but 
required Mrs B to repay the balance.
NewDay didnt think it had done anything wrong when it increased the credit limit in 2014.
An investigator looked at the complaint. He was satisfied NewDays offer to refund the 
interest on the Opus credit card  a total of £156.64  was fair. But he didnt think NewDay 
should have increased the credit limit on the Aqua card in 2014.  Although  he appreciated 
Mrs B was no longer  considered to be in financial hardship at this time, he thought it was 
likely Mrs B would  experience financial hardship with the higher credit limit.
The investigator asked  NewDay to refund all interest  and charges on the Aqua card from the 
date when the credit limit was increased.  
Mrs B said she would accept the investigators  findings if all adverse information on her 
credit file was removed.
Ref: DRN84614752NewDay, however, didnt agree. It said that at the time of the increase in the credit  limit 
Mrs B had maintained  payment for nine months with no over limit or late payment fees. 
NewDay said that external information from Equifax shoed that she had a nil balance  with 
other creditors reporting to Equifax for a period of 4 months prior to the increase and had no 
arrears or payment plan information reported on her credit file. Because of this, NewDay 
didnt think it had acted  incorrectly  by increasing  the credit limit on the Aqua  card.
provisional decision of 14 May 2020
I issued a provisional decision, in which I made  the following findings:
Aqua card:  Ive looked at everything  that happened  from the time when Mrs B 
needed help from StepChange up until the credit  limit was increased  in August 2014. 
Mrs B was on a payment  plan for just over a year, from September  2012  to October 
2013. This was intended to get her back on track with her finances. But in October 
2013 StepChange was satisfied that Mrs B was no longer  experiencing financial 
hardship and terminated  its involvement  in her financial affairs.
Over the next nine months Mrs B showed  no signs of being in financial difficulty. In 
the circumstances, Im satisfied that it was reasonable  for NewDay  to increase  the 
limit on her card. I dont agree with the investigator  that it was likely . Mrs B would 
fall into financial difficulty due to the increase in her card limit. The available  evidence  
shows that shed  not been in a payment plan since October 2013, shed maintained 
payments without any difficulty since then and had no arrears or missed  payments 
reported on her credit  file.
Given this, I think the evidence shows that it was more  likely Mrs B would not have 
any difficulty with the increased credit  limit. Although I acknowledge Mrs B had had 
past financial difficulties,  it appears that by the time the limit was increased shed 
overcome these and that her finances were stable.
In the circumstances, Im not persuaded NewDay did anything wrong when it 
increased the credit limit in August 2014. This means that Im not going to order  
NewDay to refund any interest or charges on that account, or remove  any information 
recorded on Mrs Bs credit file.
Opus card: At the point when Mrs B took this card out in 2018  the debt on her Aqua 
card had already  been sold to debt collectors by NewDay. Im glad to see that 
NewDay has acknowledged  that it shouldnt have allowed  Mrs B to take out this card.
I think NewDays offer to refund £156.64 of interest and charges on the account is 
fair. But Im not going to order NewDay to remove any adverse information  about this 
card from Mrs Bs credit file. Thats because NewDay  is required to report  the 
conduct of the account accurately in order that future lenders can see if there have 
been any financial difficulties. 
Mrs Bs complaint about the Opus  card is that her past financial difficulties should 
have been taken into account before this card was issued. So its only fair that if Mrs 
B applies for credit in the future,  potential  lenders  are entitled to know that she was in 
financial difficulty with the Aqua and Opus  cards  before agreeing  to any application 
for credit. 
Ref: DRN84614753I reached the following conclusions
I didnt uphold Mrs Bs complaint against  NewDay Limited about the increase to 
the credit  limit on the Aqua  card;
I upheld Mrs Bs complaint that she should not have been  allowed to take out the 
Opus card. I thought NewDay Limiteds refund of interest  to the account  totalling 
£156.64 was fair and reasonable. I didnt intend  to order  NewDay  Limited  to do 
anything further.
responses to the provisional  decision
NewDay didnt have  anything further  to say in response to the provisional decision. Mrs B 
has made some further points, which I summarise below:
Mrs B doesnt know why StepChange said that her debt management plan ended  in 
October 2013, as this isnt correct;
at the point when NewDay said the Aqua  card limit would be increased  in July 2014,  
Mrs B says her spending was erratic, she was still in the debt management plan and 
shed taken out payday loans;
her bank statements  show that she was gambling and had payday  loans, and the 
increase in her credit  limit made matters worse.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive reviewed the file again, revisited my 
provisional decision and taken account  of the further points Mrs B has made. 
Mrs B wanted to send  us her bank statements to show that her spending was out of control 
in July 2014 when NewDay said the limit on the Aqua card would be increased. But Im 
satisfied I dont need to see these. Thats because  NewDay had no access  to Mrs Bs bank 
account, and so would have had no knowledge  of her spending habits elsewhere. 
Im satisfied that, considering the information available to NewDay  in July 2014, increasing  
the limit on Mrs Bs Aqua card was not unreasonable. Mrs B had maintained  payments on 
the account for nine months, and NewDay was entitled to rely on the information provided by 
StepChange as being accurate and correct.
So although  I acknowledge  Mrs B will be disappointed, Im not upholding her complaint  
about the Aqua card.
No further points have been made  about the Opus  card, and my findings on that part of the 
complaint do not therefore need to be revised.
my decision
My final decision is as follows:
Ref: DRN84614754I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint against  NewDay Limited about the increase to 
the credit  limit on the Aqua  card;
I uphold Mrs Bs complaint that she should not have been  allowed to take out the 
Opus card. I think NewDay  Limiteds refund of interest to the account  totalling 
£156.64 is fair and reasonable. I dont  intend to order NewDay Limited to do 
anything further.
This final decision concludes the Financial Ombudsman Services review of this complaint. 
This means  that we are unable to consider the complaint any further,  nor enter  into any 
correspondence about the merits of it.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 July 2020.
