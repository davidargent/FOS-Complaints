K820x#14complaint
Mr P complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA unreasonably limited his account 
following a dispute.  
background
Mr P said PayPal has limited his account  so he cant send or receive funds. He listed an item 
for sale on an online auction site. But another seller  complained about  his description. So 
Mr P spoke to the site and relisted the item with a different  wording.  But PayPal has now 
stopped Mr P using  his account. And he wants it reinstating.
PayPal said thered been a problem with Mr Ps item for sale.  He was in dispute with the 
owner of another product. So itd limited his account.  PayPal said itd removed the limitation 
on Mr Ps account on 13 June 2018 after hed removed his sale listing.  But itd received  a 
report on 18 June saying  the item had been  relisted with an amended description. And it felt 
itd violated the verified  rights owner program. So PayPal placed  a permanent limitation on 
Mr Ps account.
PayPal said although  Mr P had provided further information it wasnt  sufficient grounds for 
appealing the limitation. PayPal said its role was to process the payment. And the dispute 
would have to be resolved  elsewhere.
Mr P wasnt  satisfied with PayPals response. So he contacted our service and our 
investigator looked into the matter. She appreciated Mr P had explained to PayPal why, in 
his view, the item didnt breach copyright. And hed changed the description. But PayPal  had 
already informed Mr P it couldnt accept his reasons. And itd informed Mr P it would limit his 
account if he relisted it. So she felt itd acted  within the terms of its user agreement. 
Mr P didnt agree. He hadnt received the warning.  And PayPal should listen  to both sides.  
Not just accept the other persons view. So hes asked for an ombudsmans  final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how frustrating this must be for Mr P. A dispute with another seller has led 
to his PayPal  account  being terminated.  And he doesnt think PayPal has taken his 
representations into account. So Ive looked carefully at everything Mr P and PayPal have 
said.
Ive looked at the terms of Mr Ps user agreement with PayPal. And I think  PayPal acted 
reasonably when it received the infringement  report  about  Mr Ps item. It felt there was 
reason to believe Mr P might be engaging  in restricted activities.  So it restricted the account  
in response.
Mr P doesnt  agree  he was engaging in restricted activities.  And hes provided a lot of 
evidence to show why he feels  his item doesnt  infringe on the rights of the other seller. 
Mr P says similar items are available from other sellers. So he feels  PayPal  has acted 
inconsistently. And Mr P amended his description after discussions with the auction site. 
Ref: DRN72428732But PayPal had told Mr P he would need  to send an object to infringement  report form. And 
Ive seen a copy  of the email sent by PayPal on 13 June 2018.  It was sent to Mr Ps normal  
email address. And it warns his account would be limited permanently if he relisted  the item. 
Ive no reason to suspect  PayPal didnt send the message to Mr P. It was the same address 
itd already contacted Mr P on the previous day. In that email PayPal said it would review his 
form to see if further action was necessary. So even if Mr P didnt receive the 13 June email 
PayPal hadnt  told Mr P it no longer thought his item was infringing copyright. It was still 
reviewing the information.  
And when  Mr P signed and submitted the form he agreed it didnt automatically require 
PayPal to allow him to use his account.  So I think he shouldve known he had to wait for a 
response from PayPal before relisting.
I do understand Mr Ps frustrations. But as our investigator has explained its not the role of 
this service, or PayPal,  to decide  whether his item infringes upon the other sellers item. Our 
role is to look at PayPals actions and see if it has made a mistake.
Ive looked carefully  at everything Mr P has said.  But, based  on what  Ive seen, I dont think 
PayPal has done  anything wrong. I think it acted  within the terms of its user agreement when 
it limited Mr Ps account. It warned Mr P it would permanently  restrict his account if he 
relisted the item for sale. And despite  Mr Ps submissions it doesnt feel it has sufficient 
grounds to reconsider.
I know this isnt the result Mr P wanted.  But I wont be asking PayPal to do anything more. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 February  2019.
