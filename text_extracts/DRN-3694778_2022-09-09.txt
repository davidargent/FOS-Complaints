The complaint
Mr F complains that Suzuki Financial Services Limited wont allow him to make the final 
repayment for a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement by credit 
card.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in August 2022 in which I described what 
had happened as follows:
A new car was supplied to Mr F under a hire purchase agreement with Suzuki 
Financial Services that was dated in March 2018. Mr F agreed to make a payment of 
£209.58 and 41 monthly payments of £209.62 for the car to be supplied to him and 
there was a final repayment of £5,370.
Mr F wanted to make the final repayment by credit card in October 2021 but Suzuki 
Financial Services told him that it didnt accept credit card payments for payments 
under credit agreements. Mr F complained to it about that but it said that it decided in 
September 2014 to no longer accept credit card payments against credit agreements 
in consideration of the Financial Conduct Authoritys rules relating to customer credit. 
It amended the payment date to the end of November 2021 to allow Mr F more time 
to arrange payment and said that he could discuss the options available to him with 
its collections department. Mr F wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to 
this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He didnt feel 
that Suzuki Financial Services had acted unfairly and he noted that it had discussed 
a finance agreement to finance the final repayment. Suzuki Financial Services also 
agreed to put a hold on the account until the investigation is complete.
Mr F says that the letter that he received from Suzuki Financial Services in October 
2021 didnt explain the options for making the final repayment and if hed received a 
letter detailing payment options then he wouldnt have applied for a credit card and 
would have looked at other alternatives. He says that the finance agreement that it 
has offered isnt on favourable terms and he says that he would likely not be eligible 
for it. He also says that Suzuki Financial Services has recorded adverse information 
on his credit file.
I set out my provisional findings in my provisional decision which were that:  Mr Fs 
complaint should be upheld in part for these reasons:
I can understand Mr Fs frustration that he couldnt make the final repayment by 
credit card and I dont consider that the evidence provided by Suzuki Financial 
Services shows that he was sent any information about his options for making the 
final repayment;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances  but we wouldnt normally interfere with a 
businesss legitimate commercial decisions;
Suzuki Financial Services says that it decided in September 2014 to no longer 
accept credit card payments against credit agreements in consideration of the 
Financial Conduct Authoritys rules relating to customer credit  I consider that to 
be a legitimate commercial decision of Suzuki Financial Services and Im not 
persuaded that there was any requirement for it to accept payments from 
customers by credit card;
I feel that Suzuki Financial Services could have done more to inform Mr F about 
the payment options that were available to him but I dont consider that it acted 
incorrectly by not doing so and the information was available on its website and 
the letter that it sent to Mr F in October 2021 did say that he should contact it if he 
wanted to discuss the available options;
Suzuki Financial Services has offered Mr F a finance agreement for him to 
finance the final repayment but he says that it isnt on favourable terms and that 
he would likely not be eligible for it;
it has also agreed to put a hold on Mr Fs account until the investigation is 
complete but it has recorded a late payment on his credit file for January, 
February and March 2022;
its my understanding that Mr F still has the car and Suzuki Financial Services 
says that the balance of £5,370 was settled in April 2022 and that there are no 
payments outstanding;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Suzuki Financial 
Services acted incorrectly in connection with the payment options that were 
available to Mr F but I dont consider that its fair or reasonable for it to have 
recorded missed payments on his credit file  it had agreed to put a hold on his 
account until the investigation was complete so no payments were due from Mr F 
during that period and I dont consider that the adverse information on his credit 
file is a true and accurate record of his payment history; and
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Suzuki 
Financial Services to remove the adverse information about the hire purchase 
agreement that its recorded on his credit file.
Suzuki Financial Services has agreed to remove the adverse information about the hire 
purchase agreement that its recorded on Mr Fs credit file once the decision has been 
accepted by him.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Suzuki Financial Services has agreed to the remove the adverse information from Mr Fs 
credit file, I consider theres no need for me to change the provisional findings that I made in 
my provisional decision. 
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Suzuki Financial 
Services to remove the adverse information about the hire purchase agreement that its 
recorded on Mr Fs credit file.My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Fs complaint in part and I order Suzuki Financial Services 
Limited to remove the adverse information about the hire purchase agreement that its 
recorded on his credit file.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 October 2022.
