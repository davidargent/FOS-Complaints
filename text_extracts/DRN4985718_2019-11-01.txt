K820x#14complaint
Mr T complains that Aviva Life & Pensions  UK Limited (Aviva) paid an incorrect  transfer 
value when he transferred the value of his Personal Pension Plan (PPP) to a SIPP.  He also 
complains Aviva did not apply a previous  pension  contribution properly.
background
Mr T instructed Aviva to transfer the value of his PPP into a SIPP  on 20 April 2017.  Aviva 
transferred £367,934 on 12 May 2017  and said this was the closing  value of the PPP on 
27 April 2017, the date it says it received all the necessary information to make the transfer.  
Mr T says after he instructed Aviva to make the transfer he monitored the value of his 
pension fund online, keeping a note of the value  in his diary. At the close  of business on 26 
April 2017 he says he recorded a figure of £369,963. By extension,  he says this should have 
been the opening price  on 27 April 2017  and this is the value  that should have been  
transferred to his SIPP. So he thinks Aviva  has transferred £2,029  less than it should have. 
Mr T also complains  about a contribution of £4,000 he made  to his pension on 31 August 
2016. He says he discovered the £4,000 had not been invested into his pension  by Aviva.  
Aviva wrote to him on 28 April 2017  confirming his money had now been invested  and also 
offered him the option of cancelling it and receiving a refund. Mr T accepted  that option. 
Aviva then told him the refund  had been offered by mistake and the £4,000 had already 
been included  in the transfer value paid into his new SIPP.  Mr T wants the £4,000 refunded,  
with interest, from the date he paid it.
Aviva said the amount  transferred  to Mr Ts SIPP was the closing value of his pension on 27 
April 2017 and was the correct amount. 
In terms of the £4,000 payment, Aviva said Mr T paid £4,000 into his pension in August 
2016. He made another payment of £4,800  in January 2017  but then cancelled  the January 
payment. Aviva says it mistakenly cancelled the August 2016 payment and sent Mr T £4,995 
instead of the £4,800 he was due as a refund of the January 2017 payment. As it made the 
mistake Aviva bore the extra £195.95  paid to Mr T in error.  It also says it corrected  its 
records and made sure the payments  and refund were  applied to his pension correctly.
Aviva said it should not have told Mr T he had the option to cancel the 31 August 2016 
payment, because the original contribution had been made correctly in 2016  and was 
included in the transfer value that would be paid to his SIPP.  It offered  him £550 
compensation for mistakes it had made.
Mr T says he made a one-off £4,000 payment to his pension plan on 31 August 2016.  Aviva 
confirmed it had been invested  at the time. He says he later discovered it had not been 
invested. He contacted  Aviva over a period of several months in an attempt to resolve the 
issue. Eventually he was sent documents dated 28 April 2017 confirming the 31 August 
2016 payment  had now been invested  into his pension  plan.  The documents  gave him the 
option to cancel the investment and receive a refund within 30 days. He wrote back to 
accept that option on 19 May 2017.  Aviva  did not give him a refund and instead told him the 
£4,000 had been included  in the transfer value he received, calculated as at close  of 
business on 27 April 2017,  but paid on 12 May 2017. 
Ref: DRN49857182The complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators. She thought  Aviva  had made  
errors in cancelling the incorrect  transaction,  for example. But she thought Aviva had 
correctly recalculated the transfer value, paid the correct amount and had paid a reasonable 
amount of compensation for the distress  and inconvenience caused.
Mr T made some objections to the data Aviva  had presented and which  the adjudicator  had 
considered. He felt it could not be right because  it did not include  information before 30 
August 2016.  He pointed out his pension plan started in May 2016 and the records provided 
did not go back that far. He also noted  that the single premium invested on 3 January 2017  
was not shown on the records provided by Aviva, nor the cancellation of that investment on 
28 January 2017.  He provided a screenshot of Avivas system that he was able to access at 
home on 27 March 2017, showing  transactions in August 2016.  This did not contain any 
reference to a transaction on 31 August 2016. 
He asked how a pension plan that was transferred on 27 April 2017 could have included his 
£4,000 premium which he had been told was reinvested on 28 April 2017.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  what is fair and reasonable 
in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having  done so, I do not uphold Mr Ts complaint.
Delay
Mr T emailed Aviva on 20 April 2017 and said he had recently lodged transfer forms with a 
SIPP provider, who would  be sending them through to Aviva. Aviva says the transfer request 
was logged on 27 April 2017. Aviva says it did not process the transfer  request on 27 April 
2017 because  it was rectifying the issue of the payments and refunds referred to above and 
this would have  had an impact on the transfer value. When  it had resolved these issues,  it 
looked at the best transfer value  available to Mr T between 27 April 2017 and 8 May 2017 
and gave him the most favourable transfer value, which was the 27 April 2017  value. 
Aviva says it should have  sent the transfer value to the SIPP provider  on 28 April 2017 if the 
instruction was received on 27 April 2017, but it actually  sent it on 12 May 2017. It offered to 
pay interest for the delay at the rate of BOE base rate plus 1%, totalling £176.40. The 
transfer value  largely  sat in cash after the transfer  and it does not seem likely  a better rate of 
return would  have been earned had the transfer value been paid earlier.  
So, while there was a slight delay in dealing  with the request, once Aviva had all the 
information it needed on 27 April 2017,  it took steps to rectify it and ensure Mr T did not lose 
out and these steps appear reasonable.
The value of the transferred fund
Aviva says its process is to use the date it receives  everything it needs to complete  a 
transfer, as the date for calculating the transfer value. It says it has a one day turnaround 
time, so transactions are not processed  as soon as received and it uses  the closing price 
from the date the instruction was received in order to determine the transfer value paid. 
In Mr Ts case it also looked to see whether any of the closing prices between 27 April 2017 
and 8 May 2017 were more favourable to him, but it says they were  not. 
Ref: DRN49857183I do not think it is reasonable  to expect Aviva to pay the opening price on the day it received 
the instruction,  as Mr T has requested. Transactions were not processed in real time. That 
is, they were not logged  onto the system and processed immediately with instant payment of 
the transfer value as it stood at that precise  moment. It can take time to read documents, 
check everything has been received and all the paperwork is in order. So the opening  price  
is unlikely to reflect the earliest  moment the transaction could have been processed.  If Aviva  
has a one-day turnaround  time, then using the closing price  on the date it has all the 
information needed to process the transaction does  not seem unreasonable.
Even if Aviva did process transactions  in real time, looking at the notes from Aviva,  it appears 
the transfer was logged  onto the system at 17:48  on 27 April 2017. So the closing value of 
the fund on 27 April 2017 probably  accurately reflects the value Mr T would have received if 
the transaction had been processed as soon as it was logged onto the system by Aviva.
Overall, I do not think Mr Ts transfer value was £2,029 lower than he was entitled  to and I 
think it was reasonable  for Aviva to use the closing price of his investments on 27 April 2017. 
The £4,000 pension payment on 31 August  2016
Aviva has provided details of the transactions on Mr Ts pension  plan since  30 August 2016 
and a copy has been shared with Mr T. These show that £5,000 (the £4,000  pension  
contribution plus 25% tax relief) was added to his pension plan on 12 September 2016, with 
an effective date of 31 August  2016.  The effective date is the date Aviva  uses for calculation  
purposes. The £5,000  purchased  units  in three  funds: 1199.55  units in one fund; 78.41 in 
another and 1099.38 in a third fund. So I am satisfied Aviva did invest the August 2016 
payment in Mr Ts pension at the time.
The records  also show £5,000  was removed on 13 February 2017 with units being cancelled  
in the same funds,  in the same amounts i.e. 1199.55; 78.41 and 1099.38. This supports 
Avivas position that it incorrectly cancelled the 31 August 2016 transaction, instead  of the 
January 2017  investment that he had actually asked to be cancelled.  
The records  show that on 8 May 2017,  the £5,000 was added  back  into the pension plan, twice, 
purchasing two lots of 1199.55; 78.41  and 1099.38  units, in the same  funds.  Then one amount of 
£5,000 and the corresponding units were cancelled. While these transactions were physically 
keyed onto Avivas system  on 8 May 2017  they show an effective date of 31 August 2016. The 
net effect is that the £5,000 pension contribution made on 31 August 2016  appears to have been 
put back onto Avivas system and applied from that date.  In other words, the net effect of these 
adjustments was to leave Mr Ts account exactly as it would have  been  if his 31 August 2016 
contribution had not been cancelled and his 3 January 2017 contribution  had been  cancelled.  
So when Aviva had finished reconciling its figures on 8 May 2017, the transfer value it 
calculated, £367,934, based on the closing value of the units in the fund on 27 April 2017, 
should have been accurate. On balance, I think  it is likely Avivas figure is accurate, having 
looked at the data and considered its methodology.
Mr T has raised  concerns  with Avivas data, which I outlined earlier. Since  the facts  in 
dispute relate to the period from 31 August 2016, we only asked for data from this point 
onwards. I understand further data is available, but it does not seem  relevant to the 
transactions at the centre of this dispute. So, I do not consider the absence of the earlier 
data casts any particular  doubt on the validity of the data provided by Aviva. 
Ref: DRN49857184Aviva says it has removed the 3 January  2017  transaction from the history because it should  
have been cancelled within the 30 day cancellation  period. It says it does this, in part, to 
ensure it does not attract any fees and is not affected by unit price  movements  between  the 
date of investment  and the date of cancellation. I understand Mr Ts general  concern that 
this is not mentioned in the data Aviva has provided and it might have been better for Mr Ts 
own peace of mind if it had been,  but since this contribution was cancelled  within  the 
cooling-off period  and should be treated as if it had never been made, I can understand why 
it does not feature in the data.
In terms of the screenshot evidence provided  by Mr T, I would not expect it to show the 31 
August 2016 transaction because Aviva had not reinstated  that transaction  at the time the 
screenshot was taken  on 27 March 2017.  
Mr T also makes  the point that Aviva could not have included the £5,000  contribution in the 
amount transferred on 27 April 2017  when it was not reinvested until 28 April 2017. 
However, the transfer did not actually take place on 27 April 2017 and the reinvestment did 
not take place on 28 April 2017. The value of the units in the fund was recalculated on 8 May 
2017, once the 31 August 2016  transaction had been reapplied to the transaction  history.  
The funds were transferred in May,  but using the backdated value  of the units at close  of 
business on 27 April 2017.  I think a lot of confusion  was caused by the letter dated 28 April 
2017: it suggested the problems had been fixed when they had not; it suggested  a further  
£5,000 had been invested, when in fact, the money had been invested  correctly in the first 
place in August  2016 but cancelled  incorrectly, with the January investment  (which should 
have been cancelled) left on the system; it also indicated the money had all been invested in 
one fund, instead of the three  funds  it was supposed to be invested in. 
While these errors were unfortunate and did nothing to clarify an already confusing  situation, 
I think Aviva  has already adequately compensated Mr T for these errors.
Overall, based on the evidence  provided,  I think it is more likely  than not that Aviva has 
accurately calculated the transfer value, having applied  the transactions and cancellations  
correctly, following its reconciliation of Mr Ts pension plan in May 2017. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ts complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 December 2019.
