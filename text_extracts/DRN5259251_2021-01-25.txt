K821x#15complaint
Mr G has complained that Madison CF UK Limited  trading  as 118 118 Money lent to him 
irresponsibly.
background
Mr G was given a loan of £3,000 by 118 118 Money in January 2016.  The loan was due to 
be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of around £291. The total amount payable,  including 
interest was just over £6,987. I understand the loan was outstanding  at the time Mr G 
complained to 118 118 Money. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint. She thought 118 118 Money  ought  not to 
have provided  the loan to Mr G and she asked the lender to put things right.  118 118 Money 
didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment . As the complaint hasnt been settled, it has 
been passed to me to resolve the matter.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to considering unaffordable and irresponsible  lending complaints  
on our website - including the key relevant rules, guidance, good  industry  practice and law. 
And Ive considered this approach when deciding Mr Gs complaint.
I think there are some overarching  questions  I need to consider in order  to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint:
Did 118 118 Money complete  reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself 
that Mr G would  be able to repay his loan in a sustainable  way? If not, what  would 
reasonable and proportionate checks have shown at the time?
Ultimately,  did 118 118 Money  make  a fair lending  decision? 
Did 118 118 Money act unfairly  or unreasonably in some  other  way?
118 118 Money needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend to Mr G 
irresponsibly. The lender  was required to carry out a borrower  focussed  assessment or 
affordability check. The checks had to be borrower focussed  so 118 118 Money  had to 
think about whether  repaying the loan sustainably would cause difficulties or adverse 
consequences for Mr G. 
118 118 Money had to carry  out reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy  itself that Mr 
G would be able repay his loan sustainably.  There was no set list of checks that 118 118 
Money had to do, but it could take into account a number of different  things  such  as the loan 
amount, the length of the loan term, the repayment amounts, and the borrowers  overall 
financial circumstances.
I think that a reasonable and proportionate  check ought generally  to have been more  
thorough:
Ref: DRN52592512the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the longer  the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit  is 
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make  payments for an extended  
period).
There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed  a proportionate check 
should have been for any application  including  (but not limited to) any indications of 
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in future circumstances. Ive kept all of 
this in mind when thinking about  whether 118 118 Money did what  it needed to before 
agreeing to lend to Mr G.
118 118 Money says that Mr G applied for his loan via its website. 118 118 Money asked Mr 
G for information about his income and expenditure and it acquired a credit report. 118 118 
Money assessed that the loan was affordable  for Mr G.  
I think 118 118 Money could have done more to probe Mr Gs monthly expenditure, even 
considering his declaration that he lived with his parents. 118 118 Money would have  been  
aware from Mr Gs credit  report that his monthly credit commitments  were considerably 
higher than the amount  he had estimated  on his loan application. I think  118 118 Money 
would also have been aware  from the credit report that Mr G had 12 live accounts and that 
he had opened  15 accounts in the previous 6 months, including several  unsecured and 
short-term loans. I think the information that 118 118 Money gathered ought reasonably  to 
have put the lender on notice that this consumer might be experiencing some difficulties 
managing his financial position.
But in any event, I dont  think  that on this occasion  118 118 Money made a fair lending  
decision and I will explain why.
118 118 Money was required to establish  whether Mr G could sustainably  repay  his loan  
not just whether the loan payments were  affordable  on a strict pounds  and pence 
calculation. The loan payments being affordable  on this basis might  be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't  automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Mr Gs declared  monthly income  was £1,000.  118 118 Money has acknowledged  that his 
monthly loan repayments represented around 29% of his monthly income.  The  FLA Lending  
Code 2006 says that factors which may show a high risk of a consumer experiencing 
financial difficulty include spending  more than 25% of monthly  income on credit.  Given  the 
proportion of monthly income that Mr G would have to commit every month to repay his loan, 
I think 118 118 Money ought reasonably  to have realised that he might  struggle to repay the 
loan in a sustainable manner, over the extended loan term.
118 118 Money disagrees and says that Mr G confirmed in his on-line application and during 
his Welcome Call that the purpose  of the loan was to consolidate debt. It says that the loan 
Ref: DRN52592513would therefore  have significantly improved Mr Gs financial  situation, as it would have 
covered over 80% of all his active credit. Ive thought carefully about this. 
Ive listened to the Welcome Call and I note that at the beginning of the call, 118 118 
Moneys call-handler confirmed to Mr G that his loan had been approved. Later  in the call Mr 
G is asked to confirm that he intended  to use his loan to repay payday loans. He is asked for 
a second time at the end of the call. Mr G said yes each time.  It doesnt seem to me that 
118 118 Money probed this with Mr G, to check which  debts or how much debt he intended 
to consolidate  with his loan or to assess the impact that this might have on his monthly 
outgoings. I think Mr G might  reasonably  have  thought from the way this question was asked  
that the call-handler was reading from a script and following a tick box exercise, rather than 
making a borrower  focussed assessment of the loans affordability for him. And as I note, it 
seems this question was not asked until after Mr G had already been told that the loan had 
been approved.  
But in any event, even  if Mr G intended  to repay the majority of his outstanding creditors  with 
his loan from 118 118 Money,  his subsequent  monthly repayment to 118 118 Money would 
still have represented  over 25% of his monthly income. Taking everything into account,  I 
think 118 118 Money ought  reasonably  to have realised that this consumer might have 
difficulties managing his finances and that he would  be unlikely to be able to repay  his loan 
in a sustainable manner. I dont think 118 118 Money ought  reasonably  to have  concluded 
that it would  be right to provide the loan to him.
Ive not seen anything which makes me think that 118 118 Money treated Mr G unfairly in 
some other way. But taking everything into account, I dont think  it should have agreed  to 
provide the loan to him. So, I uphold  Mr Gs complaint and 118 118 Money  needs  to put 
things right.
Putting things  right 
I think it is fair and reasonable for Mr G to repay  the principal amount that he borrowed,  
because he had the benefit of that lending. But he has paid interest  and charges on a loan 
that shouldnt  have been provided to him. 
I understand Mr Gs loan might still be outstanding. 118 118 Money should try to agree an 
affordable repayment  arrangement with Mr G in respect of any outstanding  balance - bearing 
in mind the need to treat him positively  and sympathetically in those discussions.
If 118 118 Money has sold the outstanding  debt it should  buy it back, if its able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If 118 118 Money  isnt able to buy the debt back, then it should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
118 118 Money should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges  on the loan and treat all the payments Mr 
G made as payments  towards the capital. 
If reworking Mr Gs loan account  results in him having effectively made  payments 
above the original capital  borrowed, then 118 118 Money  should  refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments,  from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen,  to the date the complaint is settled*. 
Ref: DRN52592514If an outstanding balance remains, then 118 118 Money should try to agree an 
affordable repayment plan with him.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Gs credit file in relation to the 
loan. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money  to deduct tax from this interest.  118 118 
Money should give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I uphold this complaint  and direct Madison CF UK Limited 
trading as 118 118 Money to put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 February  2021.
