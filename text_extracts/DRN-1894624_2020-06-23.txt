The complaint
Mr M complains that Ageas Insurance Limited ("Ageas") unfairly declined his motor 
insurance claim.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead, I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Irrespective of whether Mr M gave permission for his car to be driven or not, the
mechanic is not a named driver under the policy, so does not get the benefit of
comprehensive cover for damage if he crashes the car. It is the individual  that is
insured f
or such cover, not the vehicle. So if the vehicle is damaged by someone
driving other than those named under the policy  as in this instance  there is only
third-party cover available.
Given that the mechanic was not insured to drive Mr Ms vehicle, Im satisfied that
Ageas have correctly declined to cover Mr Ms claim for damage. He may, however,
have recourse to pursue the mechanic directly to recover his losses in these
circumstances. But otherwise this is not something Ageas are required to cover.
For these reasons, although I understand Mr Ms frustrations, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2020.
