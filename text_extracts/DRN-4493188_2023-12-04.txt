The complaint
Mr M complains that Clydesdale Bank plc, trading as Virgin Money, wont refund to him the 
money that he paid for an introductory membership of a holiday club. His wife is also 
involved in his complaint and hes being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in October 2023 in which I described what 
had happened as follows:
Mr M and his wife applied for an introductory membership of a holiday club in July 
2016 and they entered into a purchase agreement with a holiday company. The 
purchase price for the introductory membership was £3,700 and Mr M paid €1,800 of 
that amount using his Virgin Money credit card. The amount charged to his Virgin 
Money credit card account was £1,512.23.
Mr Ms representative, on behalf of Mr M, made a claim to Virgin Money in July 2019 
under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the holiday company 
was in breach of contract by misrepresenting the contract to Mr M and his wife and 
breaching the EU timeshare directive. It said that Mr M and his wife were entitled to 
seek recompense of all monies paid on their Virgin Money credit card, namely the 
sum of £3,700, together with interest.
Virgin Money upheld Mr Ms claim and refunded £1,512.23 to him in May 2020. 
Mr Ms representative wrote to Virgin Money and said that Mr M had only been 
reimbursed for the deposit paid and asked it to clarify its reasoning and provide its 
final response. No response was received so Mr Ms representative, on behalf of 
Mr M, submitted a complaint to this service in September 2020. It enclosed Mr Ms 
complaint form which was dated in August 2019.
Our investigator recommended that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld. He said that 
Virgin Money had already accepted and paid Mr Ms claim but he said that that the 
total cost of the introductory membership was £3,700 so he didnt think that it had 
settled the claim fairly. He recommended that Virgin Money should pay Mr M the 
shortfall in his claim settlement so as to cover the total cost of the purchase 
agreement.
Virgin Money has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. It 
says that its unable to understand why the transaction amount of £1,512.23 was 
settled as the case was being investigated in May 2020 and then settled for that 
amount shortly after and it sent a letter to Mr M. It says that considering the evidence 
it has, it wouldnt agree to settle for the full £3,700 as Mr M did use the service for 
two years of holidays in 2017 and 2018 and it has no proof of how the remaining 
balance was paid. It says that it believes £1,512.23 to be a fair settlement. Mr Ms 
representative says that the whole contract purchased by Mr M and his wife was 
£4,850.03 and his claim is for the full amount.
I said in my provisional decision: I consider that Mr Ms complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Ms claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right 
to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided 
that certain criteria set out in that section are met);
Mr Ms claim was that the holiday company was in breach of contract by 
misrepresenting the purchase agreement to Mr M and his wife and breaching the 
EU timeshare directive;
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court 
would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Virgin Moneys 
response to Mr Ms claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Virgin Money upheld Mr Ms claim and refunded to him the £1,512.23 that hed 
paid in July 2016 using his Virgin Money credit card;
a complaint was then made to this service in September 2020 and Mr Ms 
complaint form says that the holiday company was in breach of the contract by 
misrepresenting the contract to Mr M and his wife and breaching the EU 
timeshare directive  but there was no reference in the complaint to the refund 
that had already been made by Virgin Money;
Mr Ms representatives letter to Virgin Money in July 2019 describes the 
misrepresentations that it says were made to Mr M and his wife, including that:
they were told that they were purchasing three holidays with the holiday 
company but the product purchased didnt give them sufficient points to 
enable them to book a two bedroomed apartment as experienced by them in 
their first holiday for three years;
they were advised that they could trade the product through an exchange 
program but werent advised that there would be extra fees to be paid to the 
exchange provider or that there would be significant restrictions on the resorts 
and dates that they could book; and
they were advised that it wasnt possible to accommodate them for their 2019 
holiday in the complex that theyd purchased which was untrue, and a search 
had shown that the accommodation was available for approximately the same 
date;
the price payable under the purchase agreement was £3,700 and Mr Ms 
representatives July 2019 letter said that Mr Ms claim was for £3,700, with 
interest, but in May 2022 it said that the whole contract purchased by Mr M and 
his wife was £4,850.03 and that his claim was for the full amount;
neither Mr M nor his representative has provided an explanation as to why the 
contract price was £4,850.03 or evidence to show the total amount paid by Mr M 
 the only evidence that Ive seen is a credit card receipt for a payment of €1,800 
made by Mr M in July 2016 and an extract from his credit card account from July 
2016 which shows a payment of that amount and a corresponding charge to his 
account of £1,512.23;
enclosed with Mr Ms representatives July 2019 letter was an e-mail from Mr Ms 
wife to the holiday company about some issues with Mr M and his wifes holiday 
in July 2018, including some photos showing the condition of the accommodation 
that was provided to them;
Mr Ms representative has provided copies of the following documents that Mr M and his wife signed with the holiday company in July 2016 - the purchase 
agreement, a statement of facts, and a premium club membership agreement 
(the purchase price payable under the premium club membership agreement was 
£1,500 and the holiday company confirmed in a letter to them that the £1,500 
would be deducted from their final payment);
its clear from Mr Ms representatives July 2019 letter that Mr M and his wife 
enjoyed the holiday that they took in 2017 and that, though there were issues 
with the accommodation that was provided to them in July 2018, they were then 
moved to other accommodation  the letter describes the issues that they then 
had with booking a holiday for 2019;
Virgin Money says that Mr M and his wife did use the service for two years of 
holidays in 2017 and 2018 and that it has no proof of how the remaining balance 
was paid so it believes £1,512.23 to be a fair settlement;
Virgin Moneys response to the claim that was made to it was to refund £1,512.23 
to Mr M  Ive seen no evidence to show that it provided a final response letter or 
other explanation of its refund to him and I consider that it should have done so  
but I consider that it was fair and reasonable in these circumstances for it have 
refunded £1,512.23 to Mr M and Im not persuaded that it should have refunded 
to Mr M the £3,700 that hed claimed at that time or the higher amount to which 
his representative referred in May 2022; and
I sympathise with Mr M and his wife for the issues that they had with their 
introductory membership but I find that the refund that Virgin Money made to 
Mr M in September 2020 was a fair and reasonable response to the claim that 
had been made to it so I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Virgin Money to pay him any further amount or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
Subject to any further comments or evidence that I received from any of Mr M, his 
representative and Virgin Money, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend to uphold 
this complaint. Virgin Money says that it has nothing further to add and neither Mr M nor his 
representative has responded to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Mr M nor his representative has responded to my provisional decision and Virgin 
Money says that it has nothing further to add, I see no reason to change the outcome that I 
set out in my provisional decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2024.
