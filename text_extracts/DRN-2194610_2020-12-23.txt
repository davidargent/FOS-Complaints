The complaint
Mr C complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) placed limitations on his 
account, led him to believe there was nothing to worry about; but then went on to advise him 
that they were closing his account and holding onto his balance for at least 180 days. 
Mr C would like PayPal to return his money and reinstate his account.
What happened
Mr C had a PayPal account which he used regularly for a number of years. In April 2019 he 
set up his own clothing brand and was using the account for personal as well as for business 
purposes. On 8 May 2020 Mr C received an email from PayPal explaining that a limitation 
had been placed on his account, pending further account information being provided by him. 
The limitation prevented him from withdrawing or sending any money. Mr C raised a 
complaint with PayPal because he was not happy with their actions.
 
On the same day, Mr C provided the information requested. Over the following seven days 
he spoke to PayPal a couple of times, over the phone, to enquire about the limitations that 
had been applied. During each conversation Mr C said he was told by PayPal that there was 
nothing to worry about and the limitations were common practice. However, on 15 May 2020 
Mr C received a further email from PayPal explaining that theyd decided to end their 
relationship with him, and this was due to the risks involved with the conduct of his account. 
They went on to explain that the limitations would be made permanent, and the remaining 
balance in the account would be held for at least 180 days, to offset any losses before 
paying Mr C any remaining balance.
Over the following month there was further correspondence between Mr C and PayPal in 
relation to his complaint. On 24 June 2020 PayPal sent Mr C their final response to his 
complaint. PayPal didnt uphold his complaint, advising that theyd acted fairly and within 
their terms and conditions. Unhappy with their response, Mr C brought his complaint to us 
here. One of our investigators looked into his concerns and felt that PayPal hadnt done 
anything wrong so didnt uphold his complaint either. Around this time Mr C also sought 
advice from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Citizens Advice and his MP.
Mr C felt that the investigator had wasted his time by not fully explaining how theyd go about 
investigating his concerns. He made it clear that he wanted us to look into the legal and 
ethical side of how PayPal implement their policies. Mr C asked that his complaint be passed 
to an ombudsman for a final decision and also complained about the way in which the 
investigator handled his concerns. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I acknowledge Mr Cs concerns with the legalities and ethics of PayPals policy, particularly 
where it comes to withholding funds. Having considered all the information provided, 
including the most recent correspondence Mr C has sent in to us, its clear that he feels very 
strongly about PayPals actions towards him, especially when I consider the personal and 
financial problems that hes experienced as a result. While I cant make a general direction 
regarding to PayPals policies or procedures, I can  where I consider it appropriate  
require it to take (or cease taking) steps in relation to an individual. PayPals terms are set 
out in their user agreement. Its essential that these are clear, fair and made accessible for 
their customers to review, enquire about and challenge if necessary, prior to agreeing to 
them. 
The FCA sets out its principles of good practice that all authorised financial firms are 
expected to follow in their conduct of business. While PayPal isnt directly authorised by the 
FCA, it is expected to apply those principles as a matter of practice, so Ive taken them into 
account here. Among other things, the principles state that businesses should act with 
integrity and fairness when applying their terms and conditions. Ive considered whether 
PayPal acted fairly in Mr Cs case. 
Mr Cs complaint consists of a few elements which Ive set out below:
1. the limitation that was placed on his account 
2. the decision to close his account which included withholding his money; and 
3.leading him to believe there was nothing to be concerned about.
Limitations
 
Under the account limitations section of PayPals user agreement, which Mr C agreed to on 
account opening, it explains that limitations can be applied for a number of reasons. Those 
reasons include, but are not limited to, when they consider an account to carry an increased 
financial risk, the sellers performance indicates the account is high risk to them, or if the 
account is showing unusual activity. The agreement explains that they also use limitations to 
collect account information necessary for keeping an account open. 
On 24 June 2020 PayPal sent Mr C their final response letter. The letter explained that his 
account had been limited and funds held, because they believed the activity on his account 
posed a higher that acceptable level of risk and potential loss to PayPal. Ive considered that 
to maintain the integrity of their risk processes, PayPal are not obliged to share a 
comprehensive account of their reasons for limiting accounts with their customers. When 
considering this reason, Ive found it to be consistent with their terms and conditions and fair 
in its application.
 
PayPal shared a transaction log they considered as part of their review into Mr Cs account. 
The log showed all the refunds and reversals together with the funds received into Mr Cs 
account for the last six months from January 2020. PayPal have pointed out that since 
January 2020, over £12,500 has been received into Mr Cs account while reversals and 
refunds had reduced that amount to around £7,500, which they also considered to be at risk 
of reversal or refund. It also shows the current balance of the account to be £948.75. 
Our investigator also shared the log with Mr C. He agreed with the income over the period 
but disputed the number of refunds and reversals paid out. I acknowledge Mr Cs willingness to verify the amount of refunds that went through his account from January to June 2020. 
Considering the circumstances and the response from PayPal, Im not convinced the 
number of refunds were exclusively the deciding factor in this case. PayPal have said their 
decision was based upon the information Mr C provided to them along with their findings 
following a review of his account. Although I can appreciate the disruption this would cause 
Mr C, in the circumstances I believe PayPal acted fairly and in line with their terms and 
conditions when they placed a limitation on Mr Cs account. 
Withholding funds and closing the account
In the section of the PayPal user agreement about account closures it explains that they may 
retain a customers money after closure for a time PayPal reasonably requires. It points out 
that This is to protect them or any third party against the risk of loss of whatever nature. 
After that, the customer would be able to withdraw any undisputed funds PayPal were 
holding.
 
On 15 May 2020 PayPal notified Mr C that a gradual approach was to be taken in the 
closure of his account, and his funds to be held for a period of time, so they could have 
oversight of any necessity to offset any loss to them following any chargebacks or internal 
disputes from buyers. They also explained that no funds would be released if they deem the 
exposure to be the same as or higher than the accounts balance. The transaction log 
mentioned above highlights the balance on the account being less than what PayPal 
considered to be a potential risk of loss to them. 
PayPal have also pointed out that their decision to end the relationship with Mr C was made 
following a review of his account, together with the risks involved with the conduct of his 
account. Mr C was clearly unhappy with this decision; however, I accept that in the individual 
circumstances at play in Mr Cs case, PayPal were entitled to apply their terms. Such terms 
might well be unpopular with customers, which means they come with their inherent 
challenges. But that doesnt mean PayPal have failed to act fairly or with integrity in applying 
their policy terms.  
Misleading the customer over the phone
Mr C highlights in his complaint that PayPal told him on two occasions that there was 
nothing to worry about and that their request for information was common practice. When 
asked, PayPal havent been able to locate or retrieve any recordings of those phone calls. 
Ive no reason to doubt Mr Cs account of the telephone conversations. But the fact is that 
after reviewing his situation, PayPal took a different stance, and for the reasons Ive already 
set out, Im satisfied it was entitled to do so.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCA. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 January 2021.
