K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that NewDay Ltd failed to place a stop on specific  payments due to be made  
from his store card account.
background
Mr S says he wrote to NewDay in June  2018  to ask it to stop a payment from going out to 
another company. He said he didnt receive  a response from NewDay and in August 2018, a 
payment of £84.99 was still made. Mr S says he then wrote to NewDay again in October  
2018 to question why this was still paid despite  his request for it to be stopped.  He also 
queried the monthly outgoing payments of £15.00 to another company.
NewDay say that they didnt  receive Mr Ss letter in June  2018. They  do confirm they 
received the letter in October 2018  but they were not able to verify the sender  as it contained 
a different postcode. Mr S says he never  received a response and so he logged a formal 
complaint in December 2018, and as a result both companies were placed on a stop list so 
that no further payments were made to them. Mr S says NewDay  should have stopped  the 
payments sooner; he wanted all his payments refunded and £100 compensation.
NewDay has since confirmed that the £84.99 has been refunded to Mr Ss account, and all 
£15.00 payments between January and December 2018 have also been refunded. NewDay 
have also adjusted the interest  on his account.
The investigator at this service didnt  think  Mr S was out of pocket  as all payments had been 
refunded and the interest had been adjusted on the account. But she also felt that NewDay 
could have dealt  with Mr Ss complaint better and said they should pay him £50 for the 
distress and inconvenience caused. 
Mr S accepted the investigators view but NewDay didnt agree so this has come to me for a 
final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I am upholding this 
complaint in part. I will explain.
Mr S says he wrote to NewDay in June  2018  but NewDay say they never received it. Its 
possible this has been lost in the post but Mr S hasnt provided a copy of this letter  or any 
proof that this was sent. As there  is no confirmation  that the letter was sent or received, Im 
unable to say that NewDay  failed to carry out the instructions Mr S detailed in his letter in 
June 2018. So Im not persuaded theyve done  anything wrong  here. 
Mr S wrote to NewDay in October 2018,  and NewDay confirm receipt of this but say the 
postcode noted didnt  match the one on Mr Ss account. So they were unable  to put a stop 
on the payments  Mr S had requested. They say they set up a call back request to follow  up 
with Mr S. Having seen NewDays system notes I can see a note that confirms a call back  
should be arranged  but it doesnt show that the call back was ever made.  NewDays system 
notes dont show any record  of communication with Mr S until a complaint was made  in 
December 2018.  
Ref: DRN76788412NewDay say this lack of response had no impact on Mr Ss situation  and the payment would 
still have been  made  by this point. Whilst I understand  that a response at this time wouldnt 
have prevented the £84.99 payment from being made, the lack of response  from NewDay 
meant the £15.00 monthly payments continued  to be made. So Ive considered the financial  
impact on Mr S. As NewDay  have  now confirmed  a refund of all payments, and an 
adjustment to the account has been  made  I am satisfied that there hasnt been any financial 
detriment to Mr S. 
I also considered the impact the lack of communication had on Mr S. NewDay didnt think  
there was any impact as a result of not contacting Mr S as they say he didnt request a 
chargeback when he contacted them. They say under the card scheme rules Mr S had a 
time limit of 120 days from the date of payment  to raise  a charge back  request  and he didnt 
do this. Whether Mr S requested a chargeback or not, I dont think  this prevented  NewDay 
from helping Mr S or from letting him know if/why they couldnt help. 
NewDay have said there was no guarantee that Mr S would have picked up the phone if they 
had called him so the lack of communication shouldnt  impact the complaint. I dont agree. 
The failure to call Mr S back resulted in further  payments  being  made  from his account. Hes 
also had to contact  NewDay again  for any action to be taken which  added  to his frustration. 
Im also not persuaded that the possibility of Mr S not answering  his phone justified 
NewDays failure to respond to him. I think its reasonable to say that NewDay  failed to follow 
up Mr Ss communication  and should have done more to help him. For the distress and 
inconvenience that this has caused him, NewDay should pay Mr S £50.
my final decision
For the reasons  above, I uphold this complaint in part. NewDay Ltd should pay Mr S £50 for 
distress and inconvenience. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 December 2019.
