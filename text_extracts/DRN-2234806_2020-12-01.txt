The complaint
Mr G complaints that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) limited his account without 
notice and withheld the balance, which was in excess of $4,000. This meant that his 
business was unable to trade or pay bills. Mr G says that balance being held was excessive. 
PayPal removed the limit on the account during our investigation.
Our investigator thought the complaint should be upheld. In short, he said that PayPal was 
entitled to place the limit on the account but that it should have reviewed it sooner than it did. 
So he thought PayPal should pay interest on the balance in the account from the date the 
account was closed to the date Mr G was able to access the funds, which was 1 March 
2020. 
Mr G agreed but PayPal didnt agree so the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator. Ill explain why.
PayPal is entitled to apply its own terms to its accounts and limit or close accounts where it 
believes these terms have been broken. My role is to consider whether PayPal has applied 
its terms fairly in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal has said that this account was limited due to a breach of its Acceptable Use Policy. 
Like the investigator, Ive considered whether the terms allow PayPal to hold the funds on 
the account if there is a breach  and in this case PayPals terms state that they will do this 
for a period of 180 days. So generally we would say this was reasonable. However when this 
service questioned whether the evidence PayPal had showed there had been a breach, 
PayPal took the decision to carry out a further review and reinstate the account.
Having reviewed the evidence provided by PayPal, I dont think it acted unfairly in limiting the 
account when it initially had concerns that one of its terms had been breached and it took 
actions that it was entitled to under the terms of the account. However, it seems clear that 
PayPal could have done more at an earlier stage to review the breach  and certainly within 
the eight-week timeframe it had to consider Mr Gs complaint.
Had PayPal carried out a review sooner, I think its likely that it would have reinstated the 
account sooner than it did which would have allowed Mr G access to his funds sooner. So it 
follows that I think Mr G has been deprived of access to his funds for a period of time  and 
in that situation I think it would be fair for PayPal to pay him interest on the balance held in 
the account from when it limited the account to when it reinstated the account in May 2020, 
although I believe Mr G removed the entire balance in March 2020 so interest would only be 
payable to this date.
Mr G has also said that many of his clients had rebilling set up for the annual charges by his 
business. He says that when the account was limited, the rebilling has all been stopped and 
Mr G has suffered a direct loss to his business. Based on what Ive seen, I think the account 
always would have had the limit applied due to PayPals concerns, so these transactions 
always wouldve been cancelled. But, like our investigator, I think PayPal should look at the 
frozen rebills and let Mr G know if there is any way to have these reinstated.
Putting things right
PayPal should put things right by:
Paying Mr G 8% simple interest on his account balance from 2 September 2019 to 
20 May 2020.
Assess whether the frozen rebill payments can be reinstated and let Mr G know if 
there is any way to do this.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should put 
things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2021.
