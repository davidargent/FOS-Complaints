The complaint
Ms M, through her representative, complains that Morses Club PLC lent to her irresponsibly.  
What happened
Using information from Morses it seems that Ms M took several loans, seven of which form 
the complaint and these are summarised in a brief loan table below.

Morses Club bought Shopacheck and it has told us it took on the responsibility of any loan 
that was still active with them at the point they bought that company in March 2014. Any loan 
that was repaid 2014 would remain the responsibility of Shopacheck. For Ms Ms complaint, 
Morses has said Loan 10 & 11 was issued by Shopacheck and Morses Club take 
responsibility for the sale of these loans.
Our adjudicator  in his view  referred to the fact that there was some information to 
suggest that Ms M may have taken earlier loans, which might have been Shopacheck. 
Neither Ms M nor Morses Club has been able to provide full details of any previous 
borrowing. So, our adjudicator proceeded on the basis that the complaint was about these 
seven loans. Ms Ms representative has sent us no more information since that view was 
issued to them and so I have proceeded on the same basis  seven loans in all. 
After Ms M had complained, Morses issued its final response letter (FRL) in which it said it 
had not done anything wrong. And Ms M referred her complaint to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service in January 2022. 
Our adjudicator treated the gap in the lending as a break in the relationship between Ms M 
and Morses. That meant that he treated the two lending chains separately. 
He did not consider that Morses had done anything wrong and did not think that Ms Ms 
complaint should be upheld. 
Ms Ms representative asked for the complaint to be referred to an ombudsman for a 
decision and when asked for more details it has given no explanation and no further 
evidence to substantiate Ms Ms claim. 
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms M 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account several different things, such as how much was being 
lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early 
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult 
to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
I have decided not to uphold Ms Ms complaint and have explained why below.Preliminary issues 
I have looked at the submissions put forward by Ms Ms representative, particularly a 
document which is an excel spreadsheet named validation report. One of those pages on 
that validation report spreadsheet lists many other loans by other lenders, with start dates 
from December 2015 through to November 2018 and end dates ranging from 
November 2016 to April 2019. 
Theres little explanation about this spreadsheet and I gather that the submission is that 
Ms Ms representative is saying that she had lots of other debt around the time she was 
borrowing from Morses. But theres no verification about these loans and so I attach little 
weight to it. All I have is a list of other lender names and loan dates. No amounts are listed.
The puzzling element is that this information must have come from a credit file of some kind 
or Ms Ms own records and yet no information to substantiate these details have been sent 
to us. I have referred to this in another decision of mine earlier this month (August 2022) and 
so it may be that additional evidence for future complaints might be sent to us.  
And when I look at the credit search report sent to us from Morses (for the second loan chain 
as the credit search was carried out in November 2016) then I do not see any correlation 
with what the validation report from Ms Ms representative says and that set of credit search 
results. But as I have no means to cross-check this then I have reviewed the list of other 
lenders on the validation report and attached little evidential weight to it. 
And I agree with our adjudicator that there were two loan chains and that means that I have 
looked at them separately. The first loan chain was for three loans and the second for four. It 
means that when Ms M returned to apply for Loan 13 in December 2016, then it was 
reasonable for Morses to treat Ms M as a new customer and rely on the information she was 
giving to it. 
Loan chain 1 
I do think that the first loan was relatively high for an initial application but neither Ms M nor 
Morses has sent us any information about that time  or for the following loan. It is 
understandable that as Morses has explained, these were loans it inherited from another 
company and in any event it cleanses its data after a period and so loans approved in 
September 2013 and August 2014 may well be ones where that data has been cleansed. 
It has sent me the application form for Ms M for loan 12 in March 2015. In that form Ms M 
declared that she earned £300 a week and her weekly outgoings were £165 leaving her with 
a  disposable income of £135. 
And it may be that Ms M has found it difficult to obtain copy bank statements from that time 
as it was almost a decade ago. And any credit file she sent us now would not extend back 
that far as the reporting period is six years. Either way  we have very little information from 
either party on those three loans. 
What I do note is that the loan sums decreased and the loan terms increased for loans 11 
and 12. Morses has sent us the repayment schedules which do go back to September 2013 
(loan 10). And I do have a record from Morses that Ms M had declared her income each 
week for loan 12 as £300 and her outgoings as £165 leaving her with a disposable income of 
£165 each week. And so, I have no reason to think otherwise than Morses would have 
viewed them as affordable.  
I cannot see that Morses did anything wrong when assessing that Ms M was able to afford the loan repayments each week. The loans do not overlap. I have reviewed Ms Ms payment 
history and I do not see anything there which likely would have caused concern to Morses to 
suggest that Ms M was struggling with the loans. Ms M paid regularly, on time or early and 
I see no evidence of reliance there. I do not uphold Ms Ms complaint about loans 10 to 12. 
Loan chain 2
I have more information about loans 13 to 16. I have the credit search results dated 
November 2016 which would have been just before loan 13. And I have a spreadsheet 
giving information about Ms Ms declared income and expenditure for those four loans. 
Some of that is duplicated here: 
Income Expenditure Disposable income
£250.00 £120.00 £130.00
£250.00 £120.00 £130.00
£320.00 £178.00 £142.00
£395.00 £150.00 £245.00
Ms Ms disposable income increased as her income increased. So, using the information 
Morses had I consider it reasonable that it thought the loans affordable. 
And I see that loans 13 and 14 did run together which means that for a period  from the 
approval date of loan 14 to when loan 13 was paid off (a period of about five months) Ms M 
would have been repaying £27.50 a week. 
Having reviewed the repayment schedule for loans 13 and 14, followed by the fact that Ms M 
applied for a lesser loan and a shorter term when she wanted loan 15 and again for loan 16 
then that does not persuade me that Ms M was struggling to repay these loans. 
I cannot see that Morses did anything wrong when assessing that Ms M was able to afford 
the loan repayments each week. Two of the four loans do not overlap. I have reviewed 
Ms Ms payment history and I do not see anything there which likely would have caused 
concern to Morses to suggest that Ms M was struggling with the loans. Ms M paid regularly, 
on time or early and I see no evidence of reliance there.
I do not uphold Ms Ms complaint about loans 13 to 16. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Ms Ms complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 September 2022.
