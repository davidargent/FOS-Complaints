The complaint
Miss R complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) wouldnt refund a 
purchase.
What happened 
On 15 December 2021. Miss R bought a mobile phone from a national retailer (X) for Â£1,149 
and paid using PayPals pay in 3 finance. On receipt of the phone, she considered that the 
box had been tampered with and contacted X. Miss R returned the item on 10 January 2022 
and it was delivered to X on 12 January 2022. On 1 February 2022, X declined to issue a 
refund. Miss R appealed the decision but on 9 February 2022, X confirmed its decision. On 7 
February 2022, Miss R opened a dispute with PayPal to say the item was not as described. 
PayPal asked X for more information and received this on 17 February 2022. On 22 
February 2022, PayPal asked Miss R to get supporting information from an unbased third 
party to support the claim. This was to be provided by 4 March 2022. It wasnt provided and 
PayPal declined Miss Rs claim on 7 March 2022.
Miss R complained. She said she had followed PayPals guidance  which was to try to 
resolve the dispute with the seller (X) first. And because of that, she couldnt get the third-
party opinion requested by PayPal  because she had sent the phone back to X. She said 
PayPal hadnt acted fairly and she should get a refund. Miss R said this was a large amount 
of money to lose  shes a student nurse without a stable income.
PayPal said that on 22 February 2022, theyd asked Miss R to provide a third-party report by 
4 March 2020. They extended the period by three days  to 7 March 2022 - to get this. But 
they didnt receive anything and denied Miss Rs claim. PayPal said the process was set out 
in their terms and conditions regarding buyer protection.
Miss R brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said PayPal acted reasonably. Their 
terms say they may need to request reports or other documents from customers. As they 
werent provided with this, Miss Rs claim was declined. Our investigator said that Miss R 
shouldve kept the item in her possession while opening a dispute  because of the need to 
provide the report in question.
Miss R disagreed. She repeated that PayPals guidance was to return the item to the seller 
first, and therefore she couldnt provide the report that PayPal wanted.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate where Miss R is coming from. She was advised to try to resolve her dispute 
with the seller (X) first. Thats in PayPals terms and conditions where it says [excerpt]
To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements: - 
- Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under 
PayPal Buyer Protection through the Resolution Centre.
-Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the      time 
requested
So  I appreciate that Miss R tried to resolve the problem with X to start with  this was 
understandable and what PayPals terms say. And thinking about what happened, it made 
sense for Miss R to return the item to X  as clearly X would need to consider her claim 
about the phone and the damage to the box. 
Ive seen that X then dismissed her claim with them  Xs final decision was on 9 February 
2022 and so Miss R then opened a claim with PayPal. On 22 February 2022, PayPal asked 
Miss R to get a third-party report on the damage - by 4 March 2022. That was a reasonable 
request  - as clearly PayPal wouldve wanted to see the claim was genuine and one they 
could support. It was also in their terms and conditions  where it said they could ask for 
documentation as they saw fit.
PayPal have shown us that nothing was sent to them by the deadline and on 7 March 2022, 
they declined Miss Rs claim. We asked PayPal if Miss R got in touch with them between 22 
February 2022 and 4 March 2020. For example, to possibly explain she hadnt received the 
phone back from X or similar- but she didnt. 
It's not clear whether Miss R got the phone back from X and by when. Ive thought about this 
as clearly, Miss R couldnt provide the third-party report if she didnt have the phone and 
box. But presumably, X wouldve returned it to her soon after they declined her claim  on 9 
February 2022. I think that this wouldve given enough time for Miss R to get the third-party 
report as requested by PayPal  by 4 March 2022. Or at least contacted PayPal to advise 
them what was going on, or possibly to ask for an extension. But she didnt.
I can only look at what PayPals role was in this dispute, and not what happened between 
Miss R and X. I know this will be a disappointment for Miss R as shes argued her case 
strongly - but in the circumstances of Miss Rs complaint and looking at what happened, Im 
not going to ask PayPal to do anything here.
If Miss R wishes to pursue a complaint against X, she should do so  but as X is not a firm 
which comes within our jurisdiction, thats not something we can help with. (continued)
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 December 2022.
