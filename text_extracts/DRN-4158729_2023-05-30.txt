The complaint
Ms C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) mistakenly told her that her 
business overdraft would be automatically renewed. 
What happened
Ms C holds two business current accounts with NatWest. In September 2021, NatWest told 
Ms C that the overdraft on one of the accounts would expire on 1 October 2021 and that 
another team would shortly be in contact to decide whether the facility could be renewed.
Ms C says she spoke to NatWest at the end of September to be told that her overdraft would 
renew automatically for a further 12 months and that there was nothing further she needed 
to do.
In April 2022, Ms C says NatWest sent her a message to say that her overdraft would be 
removed towards the end of June 2022. Ms C says she thought the overdraft would remain 
in place until at least September 2022.
NatWest says it doesnt have any record of a call with Ms C at the end of September 2021. 
NatWest says it wouldnt have agreed to automatically renew the overdraft without additional 
information. NatWest says its email of September 2021 made it clear that the overdraft was 
to expire on 1 October 2021.
The investigator didnt recommend that Ms Cs complaint be upheld. In summary she said 
NatWest had checked and couldnt find a record of a telephone conversation with Ms C on 
30 September 2021. The investigator thought it was reasonable to assume that if Ms C had 
spoken with NatWest about the overdraft, NatWest wouldnt have said her overdraft would 
renew automatically.
Ms C came back with a copy of her mobile phone bill which showed a call of almost 50 
minutes to NatWest on 1 October rather than 30 September 2021. Ms C said that the call 
handler discussed both business accounts and asked her to submit paperwork for one of the 
accounts to support the overdraft renewal. But for the account which is the subject of this 
complaint, Ms C said the call handler told her she didnt need to do anything as the overdraft 
had been automatically renewed.
Ms C also provided statements showing that NatWest continued to provide an overdraft and 
charged fees and interest. Ms C wants NatWest to compensate her for the loss after she 
received the wrong information about the overdraft renewal.
The investigator responded to say that her view on Ms Cs complaint hadnt changed. The 
investigator also explained to Ms C that this service was only considering a complaint about 
the automatic renewal of the overdraft. And that if Ms C was unhappy about NatWests 
subsequent refusal to renew her overdraft facility, shed first need to raise her concerns with 
NatWest.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Ms C and NatWest on 12 May 2023. I 
said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, Im minded to 
reach a different outcome to the one proposed by the investigator.
NatWests records indicate that it spoke to Ms C shortly before 2pm on 13 
September 2021. Following this conversation, NatWest sent Ms C an email which 
said that the facility will expire and Ms Cs account would be transferred to NatWests 
specialised business management team who would then decide whether her 
overdraft facility could be renewed. So, I think it shouldve been clear to Ms C at this 
point that her overdraft was due to expire. Where things are less clear is over what 
happened next.
Ms C says she spoke to NatWest on 1 October 2021 and was told that her overdraft 
would be renewed without further input. Ms C took from this call that she didnt need 
to worry and didnt need to provide additional documentation. NatWest on the other 
hand says it wouldnt be usual practice to agree to renew an overdraft facility without 
carrying out an assessment.
I accept that it might have been unusual for NatWest to have told Ms C that her 
facility would continue without her needing to take further steps. But on the other 
hand, apart from misremembering the date of the call, Ms Cs evidence has been 
consistent and detailed. Shes provided phone records showing a lengthy call to 
NatWest on 1 October 2021, so I dont have any reason to think the call didnt take 
place. Ms C says she was asked to provide information about the other business 
account she held and did so. Again, it seems likely that if NatWest had asked her for 
similar information on the account shes complaining about  Ms C wouldve provided 
it.
Overall, I think its more likely than not that NatWest told Ms C that her overdraft had 
automatically renewed when she spoke with it on 1 October 2021.
I appreciate that this information was incorrect and that NatWest wouldnt usually 
renew a business overdraft facility without carrying out a review. This service cant 
tell NatWest how to run its business or decide who to lend money to. But I can 
consider whether NatWest treated Ms C fairly.
I dont have evidence to suggest that NatWest contacted Ms C about her overdraft 
until April 2022. This was seven months later. During this time, Ms C appears to have 
been able to use the account in the usual way, so I cant see that shed have any 
reason to suspect that the information NatWest gave her on 1 October was incorrect.
Having understood for several months that there wasnt a problem with the account, I 
think it wouldve been distressing for Ms C to be told in April 2022 that the overdraft 
was going to end in a few months time. Particularly as this wouldve impacted Ms Cs 
ability to run her business. There was also a level of inconvenience for Ms C when 
she had to speak to NatWest about the account. For this upset and inconvenience, I 
consider it reasonable to require NatWest to pay Ms C £200.
As the investigator told Ms C, my decision is about her complaint that NatWest 
mistakenly told her that the overdraft had been automatically renewed. If Ms C is 
unhappy that NatWest went on to decline the renewal of the overdraft, she will first 
need to give the bank the opportunity to respond.Further submissions
Ms C accepts my provisional decision and NatWest confirms it has nothing further to add.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Ms C accepts my proposed outcome and NatWest has not asked me to consider any 
additional evidence or arguments, I consider it reasonable to make my final decision along 
the same lines as my provisional decision.
Putting things right
National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Ms C £200.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, National 
Westminster Bank Plc should put things right as outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 June 2023.
