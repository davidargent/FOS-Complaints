The complaint
Mr P complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA reversed a refund it had paid him.
What happened
In 2019 Mr P was a victim of fraud. He asked PayPal for a refund of the payments he had 
made to the fraudster. PayPal credited £1,400 to Mr Ps PayPal account, and he then 
transferred that money to his own bank account. But Mr P had also asked his own bank 
(which I will refer to as X) for a refund of the same payments. X raised a direct debit 
indemnity claim with PayPal for £1,400, and also for another twelve hundred pounds in 
respect of some additional transactions. (X claimed for every payment made during the 
period over which the fraud had occurred, including uncontested payments to other 
merchants.) PayPal complied and paid X the requested money, which totalled £2,581.74.
PayPal concluded that this meant that Mr P had received a double refund. So it re-debited 
his PayPal account with the £1,400 it had paid to X. This left Mr Ps PayPal account with a 
negative balance.
However, Mr P said that he had never actually received this second refund from X. He said 
he had asked X to cancel the indemnity, and X had confirmed it had returned the money to 
PayPal, without the money ever entering Mr Ps own account. So PayPals action meant that 
Mr P had now received no refund at all. He asked PayPal to return his money  specifically, 
to return £1,400, not the larger amount X had wrongly raised an indemnity for, because he 
said he had not requested any further refunds. But PayPal denied his request, because it 
said X still had all of the money it had paid to settle the indemnity claim. It told him to pursue 
the matter with X. (However, it paid Mr P £100 for some customer service issues.)
Mr P brought this complaint to our service. PayPal insisted that X had never returned the 
money. It said that it was not its fault if X had failed to credit the money to Mr Ps account.
Our investigator upheld this complaint. She thought that PayPal had failed to prove that it 
had sent the money to X. She recommended that PayPal pay Mr P £1,400, with interest on 
that refund at the rate of 8% a year from the date PayPal had debited his account (6 August) 
to the date of settlement, and also pay him another £150 for his trouble (in addition to the 
£100 already paid). Mr X accepted that recommendation, but PayPal did not, and it asked for 
an ombudsmans decision. It maintained that it had paid X, and X had never returned the 
funds.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would like to apologise to both parties for how long it has taken to resolve this complaint.
I have decided to uphold this complaint, but for different reasons from those given by the 
investigator. Ordinarily I would issue a provisional decision, but in this case I have already 
supplied PayPal with all the evidence in support of my findings and given it an opportunity to 
respond. So in those circumstances, I am issuing a final decision.
Evidence provided by X shows that Mr P asked for the indemnity to be raised in July 2019, 
for £1,399.26. The difference between that amount, and the amount X actually raised an 
indemnity for, appears to have been Xs error. I am satisfied that Mr P asked X for a refund 
of the correct amount, and that he did so before PayPal refunded him.
There is a clause in PayPals user agreement which states that PayPal will not refund 
customers who also seek a refund elsewhere, to avoid someone receiving a double refund 
at PayPals expense. That is a reasonable term, and so I would not usually uphold a 
complaint about PayPal reversing a refund in a case where that clause applies. Under this 
clause, PayPal was clearly entitled to reverse its refund to Mr P, once it learned that he had 
asked X for a refund as well. However, I do not think it would be fair of me to reject a 
complaint in circumstances where Mr P did not receive a refund from X and where X has 
paid PayPal back  and for reasons which I will explain below, I am satisfied that that is 
indeed what happened. PayPal is not out of pocket, but Mr P is. So in those unusual 
circumstances, I think it would be fair to require PayPal to honour its original refund, 
notwithstanding what its user agreement says.
Records provided by X to our investigator show that Mr P asked X to cancel the direct debit 
on 6 August, saying this was because he had recently received a refund from PayPal. The 
next day, 7 August, X received the funds from PayPal in satisfaction of the indemnity claim. 
Since the indemnity had by then been cancelled, X never assigned the money to Mr Ps 
current account (it was only ever in Xs own account). Instead, X returned the money to the 
same account it had come from. However, PayPal still disputes that it ever got this money 
back. So I investigated this further.
I asked X to prove that it had returned the money to PayPal. X provided screenshots to show 
the details of the account it had paid the £2,581.74 to, which it had done on 3 September 
2019. (This is not the same account PayPal sent the funds from when it settled the indemnity 
claim.) This evidence, which I have shared with PayPal, also identifies which bank holds the 
account; I will call that bank Y in this decision, but I have already told PayPal who Y is.
PayPal denied that it has any accounts with Y.
I contacted Y and asked it whether the account in question belonged to PayPal. It said that 
the account is Ys own account, and is the account Y uses for direct debit settlements on 
behalf of its clients. It confirmed that its clients include PayPal, and that it had credited the 
£2,581.74 to PayPals own account with Y. It provided the sort code and account number of 
PayPals account. I have shared this information with PayPal.
I asked PayPal to verify whether it had received the money in that account, but it did not 
reply. So there is no reason for me to doubt what X and Y have told me, and so I accept that 
PayPal did get its money back (although not necessarily in the same account as where the 
money started).
I am therefore satisfied that it would be fair and reasonable to require PayPal to refund Mr P 
the £1,400 it paid him in August 2019.
Putting things right
I agree with the redress proposed by the investigator, and so I will make an award in the 
same terms.My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. I order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay 
Mr P:
£1,399.26, with simple interest on that payment at the rate of eight per cent a year 
from 6 August 2019 to the date of settlement, and
£150 for his trouble (in addition to the £100 PayPal has already paid him).  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 September 2021.
