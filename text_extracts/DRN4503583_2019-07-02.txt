K820x#14complaint
Mr F has complained about his secured  loan account with Mortgage Funding 2008-1  Plc 
(which I will call MF). He is unhappy about  fees and charges added to the account and that 
MF took possession proceedings against him.
background
In 2007 Mr F took out a secured loan with a different business, not MF. The loan was for 
£15,000 over 25 years.  The loan is regulated under  the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
Unfortunately the loan fell into arrears and the lender took possession proceedings in 2010. 
The court granted a suspended possession order. The loan was subsequently transferred to 
MF, which  was substituted as Claimant in the possession proceedings.
In October  2017 Mr F complained about  fees and charges added  to the account, and that 
possession action had been taken against  him. Acenden,  which administers the account on 
behalf of MF, didnt  uphold the complaint, so Mr F brought  it to us.
An adjudicator explained that MF is no longer covered by our service, as it had resigned on 
1 September 2015. He also explained that Acenden, on behalf of MF, didnt agree to us 
looking at fees and charges that had been added to the account  more than six years before 
the complaint  had been brought - which  was 29 October 2017.
The adjudicator explained to Mr F that, because of the time limits involved, we could only 
look at fees and charges added by MF between 29 October 2011 (which is six years  before 
the complaint  was brought) to 1 September 2015 (when MF was no longer covered by the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service). 
The adjudicator didnt think the complaint should  be upheld.  He was satisfied the fees and 
charges added to the account by MF since 29 October 2011 and up to 1 September  2015  
were reasonable and had been  applied fairly.
Mr F didnt  accept the adjudicators findings. He said that statements  he had were different 
from the ones Acenden  had sent him. Mr F said that from 2012 thousands of pounds of 
charges had been added to his account.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I will clarify here that I am looking only at 
the actions of MF, not Acenden, its servicing  company. There  is a separate complaint 
against Acenden  about its administration of the account since  1 September 2015 which is 
the subject of a separate decision.
I can only consider fees and charges  applied  to the account by MF six years before the 
complaint was raised, up until the date it ceased to be covered by the Financial Ombudsman 
Service. I have taken  the date as eight weeks before the final response letter was sent on 
29 December 2017  so 29 October  2017.  MF was no longer covered  by the Financial 
Ombudsman Service after 1 September 2015.  Therefore  my review  of this complaint is 
confined to the period between 29 October 2011  to 1 September 2015.
Ref: DRN45035832Ive looked at the fees and charges applied to the account. No payments whatsoever were 
made by Mr F to the account between 29 October  2011 and 1 September 2015.  In the 
circumstances, Im satisfied the fees and charges added to the account have been applied 
fairly. I understand  there  was a fee refund in December 2012 of £387.84 following a redress 
scheme. But I can see no basis  upon  which it would be fair or reasonable to order  MF to 
refund any other fees, given the position of the account between  29 October 2011 and 
1 September 2015.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 August 2019.
