The complaint
Mrs M complains about the way Bank of Scotland plc (trading as Halifax) dealt with a 
chargeback claim she raised. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mrs M initially contacted Halifax to raise a chargeback on 24 July 2018 and was 
asked to provide evidence that the shoes shed purchased were counterfeit. I 
understand Mrs M says the local options for the specific brand of shoe she bought 
were limited. But Halifaxs notes show it asked for a confirmation the shoes were fake 
from a reputable retailer, not the manufacturer. 
Halifax needed to be sure the shoes Mrs M received were fake. Im satisfied its 
request that she obtain third party evidence to show the shoes were fake was 
reasonable. 
When Mrs M contacted Halifax again in May 2019 the time limit for raising a 
chargeback claim under Visas scheme rules had run out. Mrs M says another 
organisation told her to wait before raising a chargeback claim, but I can only look at 
Halifaxs actions in this complaint. 
Halifax doesnt set the rules for a chargeback claim and has to process them in line 
with Visas time limits. I havent found anything that shows Halifax has made a 
mistake or treated Mrs M unfairly by declining her chargeback claim.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 May 2020.
