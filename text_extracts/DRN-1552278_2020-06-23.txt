The complaint
Ms P complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc has recorded a missed payment on her credit file 
after she made a credit card payment late. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
HSBC sent Ms P a credit card statement in October 2019 that said she needed to 
pay Â£25.26 by 4 November 2019. Ms P has explained she forgot to make the 
payment. 
HSBC doesnt text credit card customers before their payments are due. 
Ms Ps credit card terms says that if she doesnt make the monthly payment HSBC 
will charge her a fee and record a late payment on her credit file. As Ms P didnt 
make a payment on time HSBC correctly recorded a missed payment on her credit 
file. 
I understand Ms P has been a good customer of HSBC for a long time. But I cant 
force HSBC to amend factually correct information. HSBC has considered Ms Ps 
complaint but hasnt agreed to amend her credit file. As the credit file shows Ms P 
didnt make the payment on time, I have no grounds to tell it to change the 
information reported. 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2020.
