K820x#14complaint
Mr M says CashEuroNet UK LLC (CEN), trading as QuickQuid (QQ)  and Pounds to 
Pocket (PTP) lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent Mr M and CEN my provisional  decision on this complaint on 27 March  2019. A copy  of 
it is attached and forms part of this final decision.  The full background to the complaint is set 
out in my provisional  decision, so I wont reiterate  it here.
I explained why I wasnt planning to uphold  Mr Ms complaint and asked both parties to let 
me know if they had anything to add. CEN accepted  my provisional decision. Mr M 
confirmed receipt of it and didnt  send me anything  else to consider.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
As CEN accepted my provisional decision and as Mr M didnt have anything to add, I see no 
reason to depart from my provisional findings. So my final decision is the same  as my 
provisional decision, for the same reasons.
my final decision
I do not uphold  Mr Ms complaint against  CashEuroNet UK LLC.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 May 2019.

An adjudicator considered the complaint and recommended it be upheld  in respect of loan 2. CEN 
didnt agree  with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed  to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive taken into account the law, good industry  practice and any 
relevant regulations at the time.
CEN needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice this means 
that it should  have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M could  repay his loans in a 
sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and Mr Ms income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages  of 
a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. But 
certain factors might point  to the fact that a lender  should fairly and reasonably  have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where  a 
consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial  portion of their income or 
where the period of time during which  a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
Ive looked at the loans CEN provided  to Mr M bearing  in mind the above.
loan 1
Mr Ms first loan was an instalment loan with a term of six months. The repayments were about £24 a 
fortnight, or £48 a month. CEN  recorded Mr Ms net monthly income as £487, so the repayments were 
about 10% of this. 
I dont think CENs checks were proportionate for loan 1. Although the repayment amount was low, 
Mr Ms net monthly income was also very low and this loan had a six month term.  So I think  CEN 
ought to have  asked about Mr Ms basic monthly living costs too (rent, food, regular credit 
Ref: DRN46496033commitments etc.), to make sure the payments were  sustainable, taking into account  Mr Ms existing 
commitments.
In order  to decide what  I think proportionate checks wouldve shown, Id usually look at evidence such 
as Mr Ms bank statements,  and what  he remembers  about his living costs at the time. Unfortunately, 
we dont have all of this evidence, despite this service having asked Mr Ms representatives for it on 
24 February and 24 April 2018 and Mr Ms representatives having had other opportunities to provide 
this information since then.
As it stands,  Im therefore unable  to say what proportionate checks  wouldve shown for loan 1 and am 
not currently  planning to uphold the complaint about  it. 
Mr M has a final opportunity to provide the information requested in response to this provisional  
decision.
loan 2
Loan 2 was repayable in three payments;  the first two were interest only and the third capital  and 
interest. At this time CEN recorded Mr Ms net monthly income as £860 and his regular monthly  living  
costs as £575. This left him with disposable income  of around £285 a month.
The largest  payment on loan 2 was £300  slightly  higher  than Mr Ms monthly  disposable  income.  
But on balance,  I dont think CEN was wrong to approve loan 2. The largest payment was only £15 
higher than 
Mr Ms monthly  disposable income. And the first two payments were much lower.  Mr M wouldnt  have 
to carry over much income from July and August  for the September payment to be sustainably  
affordable to him. I dont  think it was wrong for CEN to think Mr M was able to carry  over income in 
this way. He hadnt any difficulties  repaying  loan 1 and this was only his second loan with CEN, so 
overall there were  no signs  of financial  difficulty when  loan 2 was approved. Im not planning to uphold 
the complaint about this loan.
loan 3 and top-up 3a
Loan 3 was taken out 14 months after loan 2. So there was a substantial  breaking period and I think  
CEN could look at this as a break in the chain  of borrowing.  Mr Ms declared monthly  income was now 
£1,350 and his declared monthly  living  expenses £685  leaving him with disposable income  of about 
£665 a month.
Bearing in mind  the long break since the last loan, I think CEN carried out proportionate checks for 
the loan and top-up. The largest payment on this loan was £367, or £489 after the top-up. So I dont 
think it was wrong for CEN to think this would be affordable for Mr M and I dont intend to uphold the 
complaint about loan 3.
loan 4
Mr M had significant problems repaying  loan 3. It was scheduled to end in February  2016 but wasnt 
repaid until September   seven months late. There was then a gap of only 52 days  until loan 4 was 
approved. At £400 it was the same size as the previous  loan (after the top-up), which Mr M had 
struggled to repay.  CEN again recorded Mr Ms income as £1,350  and his expenditure  as £685. I do 
not think  this represents a proportionate check, bearing in mind  the repayment  history for the previous 
loan. Instead, I think CEN ought have carried  out a full review of Mr Ms income and expenditure  and 
asked him to provide  evidence of these, such as bank statements and/or payslips.
But as for loan 1, I dont  have enough information to decide what proportionate checks  would  likely 
have shown. So Im not planning to uphold  the complaint about loan 4.
my provisional  decision
I do not intend  to uphold Mr Ms complaint against CashEuroNet UK LLC.
