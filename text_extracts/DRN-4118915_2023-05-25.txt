The complaint
Ms E complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Fluid lent irresponsibly when it approved her 
credit card application and went on to increase the credit limit. 
What happened
In August 2021 Ms E applied for a Fluid credit card with NewDay. The application said Ms E 
was employed with an income of £25,000 and a tenant. NewDay says it carried out a credit 
search and didnt find any current arrears or payday loans. NewDay has confirmed it found a 
CCJ for £400 that was 41 months old at the point of application. NewDay says it reviewed 
Ms Es unsecured credit and found it was being managed with no evidence of arrears. 
NewDay approved Ms Es Fluid credit card application with a limit of £1,200. 
In January 2022 NewDay increased the Fluid credit card limit to £2,450.
Last year, Ms E contacted NewDay to complain about that it had lent irresponsibly. NewDay 
issued a final response and upheld Ms Es complaint in part. NewDay didnt think it had lent 
irresponsibly when approving Ms Es Fluid credit card application. But NewDay agreed to 
refund interest and charges applied to Ms Es credit card on balances over £1,200 from 
January 2022 onwards (the point it increased her credit limit). 
An investigator at the Financial Ombudsman Service looked into Ms Es complaint about 
NewDay. They didnt think NewDay had lent irresponsibly when it approved Ms Es Fluid 
credit card application. The investigator thought NewDays offer to refund interest and 
charges following the credit limit increase was a fair way to resolve Ms Es complaint and 
didnt ask it to do anything else. Ms E asked to appeal, so her complaint has been passed to 
me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our general approach to complaints about unaffordable or irresponsible lending  including  
the key rules, guidance and good industry practice  is set out on our website. In short, 
before approving an application, NewDay needed to carry out reasonable and proportionate 
checks so it could understand whether the borrowing was sustainable for Ms E. Theres no 
set list of checks a lender must complete and its up to the business to set its lending criteria. 
But NewDay needed to complete checks that were proportionate in respect of factors like the 
type of credit being applied for, the amount, the term and level of repayments and what it 
knew about Ms E. 
In this case, Ms E provided information about her income and circumstances within the 
application. Ms E said she was employed with an income of £25,000. NewDay carried out a 
credit search and found some unsecured debt in Ms Es name. But the accounts didnt show 
any evidence of current or recent arrears. And whilst a CCJ was found, it was around 41 
months old at the point of application. NewDays confirmed it allows historic adverse credit of 
this nature when considering an application. 
In addition, Ms E had held another credit card with NewDay for around 16 months when she 
applied for the Fluid credit card. And Ms E had built up a good payment history with NewDay 
which it likely also factored into its lending decision. In my view, NewDay acted reasonably 
by relying on the information given in Ms Es Fluid credit card application and carried our 
proportionate checks. As Im satisfied the checks NewDay completed were proportionate 
and that it fairly applied its lending criteria, I havent been persuaded it lent irresponsibly 
when it approved Ms Es Fluid credit card application. 
When NewDay responded to Ms Es complaint it upheld her concerns about the affordability 
of the credit limit increase to £2,450 in January 2022. As NewDay has already upheld this 
part of Ms Es complaint, I dont need to make a finding on whether it lent irresponsibly or 
not.
Im sorry to disappoint Ms E, but as Im satisfied NewDay dealt with her complaint fairly and 
has already agreed a settlement that is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances, Im not 
telling it to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that NewDay Ltd trading as Fluid has already agreed a settlement that is fair 
and reasonable in all the circumstances.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms E to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 June 2023.
