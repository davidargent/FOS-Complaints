The complaint
Mr G complains that Interestme Financial Planning Limited trading as Wise Pension Group 
(Interestme), gave him unsuitable advice to switch two pension plans from one provider to 
another. Mr G says that he suffered a financial loss due to the poor advice.
What happened
Interestme recommended that Mr G should switch two pension plans from his original 
provider to a different provider in July 2016. 
Mr G said he wasnt told that an early claim charge would be applied by his original provider. 
And that he wasnt verbally told that Interestme would charge an initial fee of 3% or an 
ongoing fee of 0.75% each year.
Mr G complained to Interestme. He felt it would be fair if it refunded him:
the early claim charges that had been applied to both switched pensions
the initial charge of £2,003
He also asked it to stop taking 0.75% each year for the ongoing service fee with 
immediate effect
Interestme didnt respond to the complaint. So Mr G brought his complaint to this service. 
Interestme didnt respond to this services request for the file. So our investigator based her 
opinion on the information Mr G had provided. She felt the complaint should be upheld. And 
recommended that Mr G be put back as close as possible to the position he wouldve been 
in without the poor advice. She also recommended that Interestme paid Mr G £350 for the 
distress and inconvenience it had caused him.
Initially, Interestme accepted our investigators view. And said it would carry out the 
calculations shed recommended. But, as Interestme had stopped responding to requests 
from this service, this case came to me for a review. What Ive outlined below is therefore 
based on what Mr G has told us happened and documents hes provided.
I issued a provisional decision on 6 January 2022. It said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so, I intend to uphold it. Ill explain why.
Although my recommended redress remains the same as that suggested by our investigator, 
Ive altered the wording in order to enable the calculation to be processed. 
As noted by our investigator, the information Ive based my decision on is more limited than I 
would normally expect. However, I consider that I have enough information to be able to 
decide this case.
To summarise, Mr Gs main objectives when seeking the advice was to plan his retirement 
and to lower the overall cost of his plans. The Suitability Report produced by Interestme 
detailed that Mr G didnt know very much about his pensions. Hed never had a review. The 
report noted that Mr G aimed to retire by 67. It noted that Mr G wanted his: pension saving 
returns to be guaranteed as a priority. And that his attitude to risk could be described as 
wanting caution. But also understanding that some risk was needed in order to see growth. 
Interestme recommended that Mr G transfer two of his pension plans from his original 
provider to a new provider. On the introductory page of the Suitability Report it said: The 
reason for our advice is for lower product costs. Interestme also identified other reasons to 
support its recommendations. It said that neither of the two plans had any guarantees. One 
of the two pension plans had a small transfer penalty of £57. The other fund had no 
penalties and a transfer value bonus of £149. But there were only seven funds available for 
both plans. 
The Suitability Report noted that Mr G would be charged 3% of the transfer value for the 
advice. This came to £2,003. The Suitability Report also noted that Interestme would charge 
0.75% each year for an ongoing service. Mr G said that Interestme never verbally told him 
about the initial advice charge or the ongoing fee. 
The Suitability Report shows a very similar projected total fund value of £87,500 (£64,600 
and £22,900) with the original provider, and £87,100 (£65,500 and £21,600) with the 
recommended provider. So a like-for-like comparison showed there was no reason to 
transfer. But the report then shows the projected total fund value based on the five-year 
annualised return on the recommended investment fund of 6.55%, allowing for charges. And 
quotes an improved projected figure of £133,900 if Mr G followed the recommendation. 
Although the Suitability Report stated the projections for Mr Gs retirement fund, Mr G 
provided information which shows the projection figures used were incorrect. The 
recommended provider sent Mr G the projections theyd given to Interestme at the time of 
advice. These show that a realistic retirement fund was likely to be £80,900, not the £87,100 
stated. 
From what Ive seen, the Suitability Report was also incorrect as different exit penalties from 
those noted were applied when Mr G completed the transfer. Early claim charges of 
£3,253.04 and £1,260.38 were taken from the two pension plans. Had these charges been 
correctly noted in the Suitability Report, the like-for-like comparison would have showed 
even more clearly that the recommendation was unsuitable.  
I also note that although the annual fund charge of the recommended product was lower 
than that Mr G had been paying, the ongoing charge the adviser had proposed needed to be 
taken into account. If this charge had been considered, the overall annual charge of the 
recommended arrangement wouldve been higher than the original. And Mr G had 
specifically requested a recommendation that would lower the cost of his plans. So the 
recommendation didnt meet one of Mr Gs primary objectives. 
From what Ive seen, Mr G was likely to be worse off in retirement if he followed the 
recommendation than if he stayed with his original pension provider. Therefore Im satisfied 
that the advice was unsuitable.Mr G said he hasnt heard from Interestme since the transfer. And that hes received no 
service for the 0.75% charge hes been paying each year. As Interestme hasnt sent any 
evidence to contradict this, I also uphold this part of Mr Gs complaint. 
Fair compensation
My aim is that Mr G should be put as closely as possible into the position he would probably 
now be in if he had been given suitable advice.
I think Mr G would have remained with his previous provider. However I cannot be certain 
that a value will be obtainable for what the previous policy would have been worth. I am 
satisfied what I have set out below is fair and reasonable, taking this into account and given 
Mr G's circumstances and objectives when he invested.
What must Interestme do?
To compensate Mr G fairly, Interestme must:
Compare the performance of Mr G's investment with the notional value if it had 
remained with the previous provider. If the actual value is greater than the notional 
value, no compensation is payable. If the notional value is greater than the actual 
value, there is a loss and compensation is payable.
Interestme should add interest as set out below.
If there is a loss, Interestme should pay into Mr G's pension plan to increase its value 
by the amount of the compensation and any interest. The amount paid should allow 
for the effect of charges and any available tax relief. Compensation should not be 
paid into the pension plan if it would conflict with any existing protection or 
allowance.
If Interestme is unable to pay the compensation into Mr G's pension plan, it should 
pay that amount direct to him. But had it been possible to pay into the plan, it would 
have provided a taxable income. Therefore the compensation should be reduced to 
notionally allow for any income tax that would otherwise have been paid. This is an 
adjustment to ensure the compensation is a fair amount  it isnt a payment of tax to 
HMRC, so Mr G wont be able to reclaim any of the reduction after compensation is 
paid.
The notional allowance should be calculated using Mr G's actual or expected 
marginal rate of tax at his selected retirement age.
Its reasonable to assume that Mr G is likely to be a basic rate taxpayer at the 
selected retirement age, so the reduction would equal 20%. However, if Mr G would 
have been able to take a tax-free lump sum, the reduction should be applied to 75% 
of the compensation, resulting in an overall reduction of 15%.
If either Interestme or Mr G dispute that this is a reasonable assumption, they must 
let us know as soon as possible so that the assumption can be clarified and Mr G 
receives appropriate compensation. It wont be possible for us to amend this 
assumption once any final decision has been issued on the complaint.
Pay Mr G £350 for the inconvenience this has caused him. This is because Mr G has 
had to wait much longer than he should have for a fair resolution to his complaint due to Interestmes lack of participation in the complaints process. So I consider that 
this amount of compensation fairly reflects the avoidable delays Interestme has 
caused by not actively participating in the complaints process.
If it hasnt already, Interestme should stop applying the ongoing service charge of 
0.75% each year from the date of any final decision.
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If Interestme deducts income tax from the 
interest, it should tell Mr G how much has been taken off. Interestme should give Mr G a tax 
deduction certificate in respect of interest if Mr G asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax on 
interest from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.

Actual value
This means the actual amount payable from the investment at the end date.
Notional Value
This is the value of Mr G's investment had it remained with the previous provider until the 
end date. Interestme should request that the previous provider calculate this value.
Any additional sum paid into the Pension should be added to the notional value calculation 
from the point in time when it was actually paid in.
Any withdrawal from the Pension should be deducted from the notional value calculation at 
the point it was actually paid so it ceases to accrue any return in the calculation from that 
point on. If there is a large number of regular payments, to keep calculations simpler, Ill 
accept if Interestme totals all those payments and deducts that figure at the end to determine 
the notional value instead of deducting periodically.
If the previous provider is unable to calculate a notional value, Interestme will need to 
determine a fair value for Mr G's investment instead, using this benchmark: FTSE UK 
Private Investors Income Total Return Index. The adjustments above also apply to the 
calculation of a fair value using the benchmark, which is then used instead of the notional 
value in the calculation of compensation.
Why is this remedy suitable?
Ive chosen this method of compensation because:
Mr G wanted Capital growth and was willing to accept some investment risk.If the previous provider is unable to calculate a notional value, then I consider the 
measure below is appropriate.
The FTSE UK Private Investors Income total return index (prior to 1 March 2017, the 
FTSE WMA Stock Market Income total return index) is made up of a range of 
indices with different asset classes, mainly UK equities and government bonds. Its 
a fair measure for someone who was prepared to take some risk to get a higher 
return.
Although it is called income index, the mix and diversification provided within the 
index is close enough to allow me to use it as a reasonable measure of comparison 
given Mr G's circumstances and risk attitude.
Response to my provisional decision
Interestme didnt respond to my provisional decision. 
Mr G accepted it. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
No new information has come to light to change my opinion. So I remain of the view I set out 
in my provisional decision.

My final decision
I uphold the complaint. I require Interestme Financial Planning Limited trading as Wise

Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 March 2022.
