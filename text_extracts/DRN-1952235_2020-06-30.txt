The complaint
Mr and Mrs C are unhappy with how National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) dealt with a 
cheque on their business account.
What happened
In September 2019 Mr and Mrs C purchased a horse from an auction in Ireland. They paid 
the £23,727 purchase price by cheque, from the NatWest account they use for their farm 
business. But NatWest didnt pay the cheque because the payee details had been changed. 
Mr and Mrs C had to make alternative arrangements to pay the auction house, and this cost 
them an additional £752.58 in currency charges and transfer fees.
Mr and Mrs C have complained that NatWest didnt pay the cheque. Theyre also unhappy 
that NatWest didnt adequately try to contact them to confirm if the cheque was genuine.
Our investigator said that NatWest had sent a text to the number they had on file for Mr and 
Mrs C, but this wasnt responded to. So she thought NatWest had acted reasonably by not 
paying the cheque for security reasons, and by writing out to Mr and Mrs C to let them know 
whatd happened. Because of this, she didnt think NatWest needed to do anything more.
Mr and Mrs C didnt agree with the investigator. They dont think it was reasonable that 
NatWest sent them a text and asked them to respond within 27 minutes  there were plenty 
of reasons why such a text wouldnt have been received in time. And they dont think that 
NatWest made reasonable efforts to try and contact them when the text wasnt responded 
to, including through their business manager. So theyve asked for an ombudsman to make 
a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed the evidence, I agree with the investigators findings on this complaint for 
broadly the same reasons. If I havent commented on any specific point, its because I dont 
believe its affected what I think is the right outcome.
Firstly, I want to recognise the upset this situation has caused Mr and Mrs C. Theyve been 
embarrassed in front of an auction house theyve traded with for many years and intend to 
continue to trade with in the future. But for me to agree NatWest should reimburse the 
additional costs theyve incurred, and pay them compensation, Id need to agree that 
NatWest shouldve paid the cheque, or they didnt make reasonable efforts to let Mr and Mrs 
C know the cheque wasnt going to be paid. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
Ive seen a copy of the cheque in question, and the surname of the payee has been crossed 
out and replaced with a similar, but different, surname. This amendment has been initialled 
but not signed. Because of this amendment, I think its reasonable that NatWest queried this, 
especially because of the amount of money involved. And I also think its reasonable 
NatWest didnt pay the cheque when they couldnt verify it with Mr and Mrs C. This was done 
for security reasons to protect Mr and Mrs Cs account and money.
NatWest have explained that, in these circumstances, they send an automated text message 
to try and verify the cheque before payment. Mr and Mrs C had updated their contact details 
with NatWest on 2 July 2019, to include a mobile phone number. It was this number that 
NatWest used to try and contact Mr and Mrs C.
At 1:33pm on 24 September 2019, NatWest sent Mr and Mrs C a text message asking them 
to verify the cheque. They asked for a text back with a Y or N (saying whether the cheque 
was genuine or not) by 2pm the same day. The text also said that no response would mean 
the cheque wouldnt be paid. Because NatWest didnt receive a response, the cheque wasnt 
paid. And NatWest them wrote to Mr and Mrs C to tell them whatd happened and why.
The way cheques are processed through the banking system has changed, and theyre 
processed much quicker than they traditionally were. While this means the cheque is paid 
quicker, it also means that the timescale for banks to deal with payment queries is much 
shorter than it used to be. Given this, I dont think that asking for a response within half an 
hour is unreasonable. Especially as most people normally have reasonably quick access to 
their phones. 
But, even if the text hadnt been seen until after 2pm on the day itd been sent, Mr and Mrs C 
could still have contacted NatWest to confirm the cheque was genuine. And this may have 
meant the cheque still couldve been paid. But NatWest werent to know that Mr and Mrs C 
didnt use the phone. And because theyd only been given the number as contact details a 
few months earlier, I wouldnt have expected Nat West to think the number was out of date 
and contact through the business manager was therefore needed. 
And if NatWest had tried to call Mr and Mrs C, because they didnt use the phone number 
theyd given NatWest, any attempts at contact wouldve been unsuccessful. And, at the time, 
Nat West didnt have an email address to contact Mr and Mrs C. So their only option was to 
write to them, which they did.
Because of the above, I agree that NatWest acted reasonably when dealing with Mr and Mrs 
Cs cheque, so I wont be asking them to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Cs complaint about National 
Westminster Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision before 28 July 2020.
