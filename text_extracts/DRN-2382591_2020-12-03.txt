The complaint
Mr M complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles increased his credit limit, lending him 
money irresponsibly, and he couldnt afford to pay it back.
What happened
Mr M said he had a job when he applied for a credit card with NewDay, but then he became
a student. NewDay increased his credit limit steadily from £300 to £2,050, without checking if
he could afford to pay. Mr M said NewDay had lent him money irresponsibly. He couldnt
afford to pay. NewDay transferred the debt to a third party debt collector, and he had to
borrow money from family to pay it off.
NewDay said that it had checked Mr Ms credit file before lending him money, and it had
reviewed the position and offered him credit limit increases when he became eligible for
those. Mr M had proactively contacted NewDay to accept the increases and have those
applied to his account. NewDay said Mr M had never told it he was in financial difficulties.
But NewDay said it had reviewed Mr Ms account and it thought it shouldnt have offered him
the second of these increases. So it said it would refund late fees of £60, overlimit fees of
£36, and interest of £222.16.
NewDay said that before this, his account was well maintained, so it didnt think it had to do
more.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. She said Mr M used almost all of 
the available credit on his account straight away. He was over his credit limit in October,
November and December 2018, and in January and February 2019. Mr M didnt pay enough 
to make a significant decrease in his overall debt at any time before his limit was increased 
in March 2019. The limit was more than tripled. Our investigator didnt think it was 
reasonable to increase Mr Ms limit in March 2019 based on how he used the account.
Our investigator said that following this, Mr M used the majority of the limit between March
2019 and July 2019 as cash transactions. Our investigator said NewDay is aware this can be
an indication of financial difficulties. And again, Mr M hadnt made any significant payments
to reduce his overall balance. The limit was almost doubled again in July 2019. Our
investigator didnt think the increase in July 2019 was reasonable either.
Our investigator recommended that New Day should:
- Refund all the interest paid on balances over £300 from March 2019 to when the 
account was cleared in April 2020.
- Refund all fees on the account from March 2019 onwards.
- Remove any late payment markers on Mr Ms credit file from March 2019 until the 
account was settled.
She said NewDay could deduct its initial offer of £321.16 from this if it had been paid to Mr M
already. 
NewDay said the first increase was actually applied in April 2019, not March. It said it had 
reviewed the statements, and didnt agree that Mr M wasnt using the account within its limits 
for the majority of the time. NewDay said that Mr M was only £0.33 over the limit initially, the  
main reason his limit was exceeded was fees and interest.
NewDay said Mr M then paid the exact amount required on his statements, but he didnt take
into consideration the extra payment that was requested. So Mr M got into a cycle of fees
being applied that continued the over limit status. When the limit was increased to £1,050 Mr
M then utilised only half of the limit available. The end balance on his April statement was
£520.68, which was a mixture of cash and retail spend.
NewDay said our service had previously said to it, when considering an appropriate credit
limit on a credit card account, the card provider should assume that the cardholder will draw
down the full amount available at the earliest opportunity and repay it over a reasonable
period. The assumption of what constitutes a reasonable period should have regard to a
typical period and other terms of a fixed-rate loan for a similar amount.
NewDay said it only offered Mr M a credit facility, it was up to him whether he accepted that,
and used it.
NewDay said it had only offered a refund from the last increase in July 2019 because not
only did it see a change in account management around this time, but that change was also
recognised by the credit bureaus. Up to that point, neither of the credit refence agencies
NewDay used had reported any financial difficulty or affordability indicators.
NewDay said if Mr Ms income had reduced during the time he had the account, he had an
obligation to update it. If he was struggling to maintain payments, he had a responsibility to
tell it. NewDay said we hadnt held Mr M accountable for his actions.
Our investigator didnt change her mind. Because no agreement was reached, this case was
passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Mr M hasnt complained about the initial lending NewDay made to him. He said he 
had a modest income then. But then he became a student, and NewDay made credit 
limit increases he told us he couldnt afford.
Mr M was offered a sizeable credit limit increase in March 2019. I have noted the 
issues that our investigator set out, with Mr M going over his credit limit almost 
immediately, and remaining over the limit for five months. In the sixth month, Mr M 
was offered a very sizeable credit limit increase.
The rules set out in the CONC section of the Financial Services Authority handbook 
applied to this lending. In broad terms, the principle is that NewDay ought not to offer 
increased lending to Mr M if it considered he was at risk of financial difficulties.
NewDay said that Mr M wasnt taking account of the additional fees he needed to 
cover each month, and thats why he remained over his limit. So Mr Ms statements 
at the time wouldve told him that he needed to make a larger monthly payment, and 
that he was over his credit limit. But he didnt bring his account back into good order 
for some five months. In the same month he managed to get his card back under its 
limit, Mr M was offered a significant increase to that limit.I do think that Mr Ms existing use of this card ought to have suggested to NewDay 
that Mr M was not managing his card well, and was at risk of financial difficulties. So 
a significant increase in Mr Ms credit limit was unlikely to be affordable for him.
I think that Mr Ms previous use of the card meant that this increase shouldnt have 
been offered in March 2019, even without taking account of the fact that NewDay had 
only ever been told that Mr M had a very low personal income, and his other use of 
unsecured credit had also significantly increased during this time.
Mr M was then offered a subsequent increase in July 2019. Mr M took well over half 
of this increase in cash advances in the next couple of months. NewDay knew this, 
and it knew that a significant number of cash advances on a credit card can be a 
warning sign of financial difficulties, but it offered him another increase to his credit 
limit only four months after the first increase. I also think this increase should not 
have been made.
Mr M then borrowed most of the newly available credit in August, in cash advances. 
He was over his new limit in September 2019. He started to miss payments 
altogether that month. His account has since been closed.
I think that NewDay ought to do the following, taking effect from the date in either 
March or April when Mr Ms credit limit increase was applied. 
- Refund all the interest paid on balances over £300,
- Refund all fees on the account,
- Remove any late payment markers on Mr Ms credit file.
-
NewDay said Mr Ms limit increase was applied in April, but it hasnt given us a date 
for this. It wrote to him on 18 March to offer this limit increase, and it has told us that 
he proactively contacted it to have this increase added to his account. So this may 
have happened as early as 19 March 2019.
If NewDay cannot determine now the date when Mr Ms credit limit increase was 
applied, it must use 19 March 2019.
NewDay can deduct its initial offer of £321.16 from my award if it has been paid to Mr 
M already.
NewDay said that our service hadnt held Mr M accountable for his part in what had 
gone wrong with this lending. I have considered that, as part of my assessment of 
this complaint, and I make no additional award for compensation in this case.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
NewDay didnt reply. Mr M replied to accept this decision. He said he hadnt accepted 
NewDays offer, and kindly alerted me to a typo in my provisional decision, which I have 
corrected in the above.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the award I originally proposed.
My final decisionMy final decision is that NewDay Ltd, trading as Marbles, must do the following, taking effect 
from the date in either March or April 2019 when Mr Ms credit limit increase was applied 
- Refund all the interest paid on balances over £300,
- Refund all fees on the account,
- Remove any late payment markers on Mr Ms credit file.
If NewDay cannot determine now the date when Mr Ms credit limit increase was applied, it
must use 19 March 2019.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 December 2020.
