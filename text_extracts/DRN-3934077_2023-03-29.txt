The complaint
A company, which I will call G, complains about the way in which PayPal (Europe) Sarl et 
Cie SCA processed a payment.
Mr R, who is a director of G, complains on its behalf.
What happened
Mr R told us:
In October 2022 he used PayPal to pay $200 for services for G.
He initiated the payment as a goods and services transaction, but a bug in PayPals 
system caused the payment type to be changed to friends and family. That means 
G is not eligible for PayPals Buyer Protection if the seller does not deliver the 
services G has paid for.
He realised the mistake immediately after making the payment, and he tried to get 
PayPal to change the payment type. Unfortunately he wasnt able to get through to a 
PayPal agent. 
He has since been able to replicate the bug. If he enters a payment for business 
purposes and is asked to enter an SMS code for security purposes, then after 
entering the code the payment type changes to friends and family.
PayPal told us that it believes Gs representative entered the payment type incorrectly 
himself, and it cannot change the payment type after it has been made.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but did not uphold it. He didnt think there 
was enough evidence to show that PayPals system had changed Gs payment type. He also 
said Mr R had had the opportunity to review the payment before finalising it, and the 
evidence suggested Mr R had confirmed that he did indeed want to send the payment as 
friends and family. Finally, our investigator said G had not yet made a loss as a result of 
this issue, and may not make a loss at all  if the seller delivered services as anticipated, the 
lack of Buyer Protection would not be an issue.
Mr R did not accept our investigators conclusions, and asked for the complaint to be 
referred to an ombudsman. He explained that G has made two payments in total to the same 
seller  this one as friends and family and another as services  but the seller has not 
provided the service and has asked for more time to fulfil the order. He does not believe the 
seller is likely to refund the $200, and he says he cannot make a further complaint to PayPal 
about this issue.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This complaint is solely about the way PayPal processed Gs payment. I have not 
considered whether PayPal should have done anything differently in respect of any Buyer 
Protection claim that G has made (or may make in future).
Im sorry to further disappoint Mr R, but there is very little I can add to what our investigator 
has already said. I havent seen sufficient evidence to persuade me that PayPals system 
has the bug he describes. In any event Im satisfied that Mr R did confirm the payment as 
friends and family before sending it, and so I dont think it would be fair for me to order 
PayPal to retrospectively change the payment type.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask G to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2023.
