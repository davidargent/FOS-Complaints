The complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) have said they cant provide 
him with a debit card that doesnt support contactless transactions.
What happened
Mr P was notified by NatWest that his existing debit card was to be replaced with a new card 
which included contactless transaction technology. Mr P wasnt happy with this as he has 
concerns about the security of this facility. So, he contacted his local branch to discuss his 
options.
NatWest told Mr P they could no longer issue cards without the contactless facility. But there 
was the option to disable this feature which could be accessed and set using their smart 
device app. Mr P said he didnt have internet access at home so was unable to use their 
app. He wanted NatWest to disable the feature on his behalf. But NatWest said they werent 
able to do that.
Mr P complained to NatWest. For his financial security and peace of mind, he didnt want a 
contactless debit card. In NatWests written response, they apologised for any 
inconvenience caused, but didnt agree theyd made an error. NatWest explained Mr Ps 
options but confirmed they couldnt issue a non-contactless card. They also confirmed that 
Mr Ps feedback regarding use of their mobile app had been logged but said they werent 
currently able to change the service or confirm if there would be changes going forward. 
They provided assurances about their fraud protection processes and confirmed they would 
refund any transaction not authorised by Mr P.
Mr P exchanged a number of subsequent letters with NatWest appealing their decision. He 
also referenced commitments and comments made by NatWest within their Annual Report 
and Accounts. He thought NatWest werent delivering on those commitments. Still unhappy 
with NatWests responses, Mr P referred his complaint to this service.
Having considered all the evidence and circumstances, our investigator didnt agree that 
NatWest had acted unreasonably or made a mistake. Mr P didnt agree with our 
investigators findings. He said NatWest wasnt meeting their commitment to customer needs 
and flexibility as theyd publicly stated. 
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Mr Ps complaint has been passed to me to consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Within his complaint to both NatWest and this service, Mr P has referenced various 
commitments made by NatWest within their Annual Accounts and Report. I want to assure 
Mr P that I have considered all his comments and observations in reaching my decision. 
When considering whats fair and reasonable, Im also required to consider; relevant law and 
regulations, relevant regulatory rules, guidance and standards and codes of practice; and, 
where appropriate, what I consider was good industry practice at the relevant time.
Ive thought carefully about all the points Mr P has raised in the course of his 
communications with NatWest and our investigator. It seems to me they largely relate to 
concerns about security and dissatisfaction about the lack of choice to have a contactless or 
non-contactless card.
Our investigator has already explained that its open to NatWest to decided what services to 
offer its customers. Its not our role to ask a business to alter its procedures or processes or 
impose improvements on the level of service offered to their customers. These aspects fall 
firmly within the remit of the regulator  in this case, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
What I can consider is whether NatWest has been fair and reasonable in the manner in 
which those policies and procedures are applied in the individual circumstances of Mr Ps 
experience with them. 
Ive not been made aware that Mr P has raised any specific concern about his own card 
being compromised. Rather, it seems he has more general concerns about the security of 
contactless card, so would prefer not to have one.
The FCA has committed to working with the banking industry to address risks associated 
with contactless cards. I do understand why certain media commentary might lead Mr P to 
have concerns about their security. But I dont think this means NatWest have done anything 
wrong by not providing Mr P with an opt out option.
NatWests terms and condition relating to Mr Ps account say that they can make changes to 
the agreement to reflect changes in the systems, schemes and suppliers they use. In turn, 
Mr P is free to cancel his agreement and account should those terms no longer be 
acceptable to him. With that in mind, and since NatWest has confirmed they cant offer a 
non-contactless card, I cant agree that its unfair to Mr P as theyve treated him in the same 
way it would other customers in similar circumstances.
NatWest have said an option to disable the contactless facility is available through their 
smart device app. And acknowledging Mr Ps inability to access the internet at home, 
theyve offered to provide support within a branch to set up and access the app should he 
choose. This would allow Mr P to remove the facility and, if he wanted, subsequently cancel 
the smart app. This appears a reasonable and fair solution and I think NatWest have tried to 
support Mr P as far as they can.
NatWest have also told this service they are working on a technical solution where staff may 
be able to assist customers who are unable to use the smart device app by manually 
applying a control. But this isnt currently available. I think this recognises the potential 
concerns raised and supports NatWests commitments. But ultimately, this service cant 
insist NatWest changes its processes.  
I appreciate Mr P feels very strongly that as a long-standing customer, he should be able to 
choose what type of card he has. But, for the reasons Ive explained, I dont think NatWest 
has acted unfairly or unreasonably in his case. Its no longer a facility NatWest offers. So, I 
cant reasonably ask them to make an exception for Mr P or change their business decision 
to only provide contactless cards.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 September 2022.
