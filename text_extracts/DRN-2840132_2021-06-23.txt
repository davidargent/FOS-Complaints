The complaint
Mrs L complains that she was unaware that her mortgage with National Westminster Bank
Plc was interest only. As a result the mortgage has reached the end of its term with a large
balance remaining, which Mrs L doesnt have the means to repay. She also says that
NatWest has failed to give her information or explanations shes requested.
What happened
In 1999 Mrs L took out an interest only mortgage with NatWest. In 2000 she took a further 
advance on a repayment basis.
In 2018 NatWest wrote to Mrs L to say the mortgage was due to be repaid. Mrs L has made 
the following complaints:
The communication from NatWest in 2018 was confusing.
She couldnt understand why interest of around £2,500 had been debited to her 
account.
NatWest hadnt give her the full mortgage statement she requested.
She didnt know her mortgage had been moved between NatWests systems and 
how that affected her.
She was unaware the mortgage was interest only and would never take out a 
mortgage on that basis. The repayment vehicle is stated as a pension, but she was 
self-employed at that point and didnt have a pension.
The original mortgage was £77,400  but despite making overpayments NatWest 
said that £79,395.90 was due.
She has been told repeatedly by NatWest that her mortgage wasnt in arrears.
When she took out the further advance in 2000, she found out her main mortgage 
was interest only she asked for the whole mortgage to be switched to repayment.
She thought the annual statements simply reflected the original split of the mortgage 
 and the statements and NatWests correspondence were confusing and contradictory.
Mrs L noted that the statements didnt state the duration of the mortgage.
I issued a decision that we did not have the power to consider any complaint about events 
before 16 December 2013 as it had been brought outside our time limits. Apart from the 
complaint about Mrs Ls mortgage being moved across different systems.
Our investigator didnt think the complaint should be upheld. She said that NatWest should 
give Mrs L time to sell her property and take into account the Financial Conduct Authoritys 
(FCA) guidance around Covid-19. 
Mrs L didnt accept what the investigator said. She said that she felt NatWest hadnt treated 
her fairly in selling the mortgage and not complying with her instructions. She said she hadnt 
been given a full statement of her account. 
Mrs L said she had moved out of the property temporarily and her tenants were entitled to 
six months notice. She added that the property needed some work and that it was likely she 
would achieve a significantly lower price if she were to sell.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Apart from the complaint about NatWest switching systems, I can only look at events from 
16 December 2013. So I cant consider:
How the mortgage was sold.
That the mortgage was interest only with the repayment vehicle stated as a pension.
How the mortgage was administered and how the balance accrued before 16 December 
2013.
Any communication  including annual mortgage statements  before 16 December 
2013.
The failure of NatWest to switch the mortgage to repayment in 2000.
I can consider everything that happened from 16 December 2013. 
Ive looked at Mrs Ls mortgage from 16 December 2013. I cant see that she has pointed out 
any specific issues where NatWest hasnt treated her fairly during that period in respect of 
how the balance was calculated (other than the issues I will deal with below). It looks like the 
balance increased before the time I can consider. But after carefully considering the 
information available to me, I cant see any mistake in the way the NatWest calculated the 
balance on her mortgage from 16 December 2013.
NatWest said that Mrs Ls mortgage has moved systems twice  once in 2002 from a 
branch to a central system and again in 2018 to allow online access. Mortgages are long 
term financial products. It isnt unusual for lenders to change and update the way they 
administer mortgages. NatWest has an obligation to conduct its business with due skill, care 
and diligence. That doesnt mean that it is required to keep records going back more than six 
years. I cant say that the system change in 2002 resulted in any detriment to Mrs L.
NatWest has explained that the system change in 2018 was responsible for the difference in 
balance of around £2,500. It said that the closing balance on the statement before the 
system change included that amount of interest  while the opening balance after the system 
change didnt include this amount. It said that the interest was shown correctly in a different 
section of the new statement.
I can understand why this caused Mrs L some confusion, but I accept NatWests explanation 
and I cant see it has made any error in calculating the mortgage. 
NatWest has also accepted that it made a mistake in sending letters that said the mortgage 
ended in May 2018 and not 2019 and that statements also included incorrect information. 
But there is no evidence that NatWest acted upon the incorrect date  and it doesnt change 
the overall position here. So I dont consider NatWest needs to do anything further.
Our investigator has offered to give Mrs L copies of mortgage statements.end of term
Mrs L hasnt complained about the way that NatWest has treated her once the term of the 
mortgage ended. She has put forward a number of options she would like to explore. Mrs L 
should speak to NatWest and it should consider whether an extension, a switch to 
repayment, giving Mrs L more time or something else is in her best interests. It is more likely 
that a mutually acceptable outcome can be reached if Mrs L engages with NatWest.
NatWest had threatened repossession action. Since April 2021 the FCA guidance has 
permitted lenders to start repossession proceedings. But it should only do so as a last resort, 
subject to any relevant government restrictions and acting in line with the FCAs guidance. 
The investigator said that NatWest should give Mrs L a reasonable amount of time to 
market the property. It is in line with good practice for a lender to allow a borrower 
reasonable time to conduct a sale. But it is for Mrs L to speak to NatWest if that is what she 
wishes to do so it can understand her intentions and circumstances, and tell her if there is 
any further information it will need or any other assistance it can offer her. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2021.
