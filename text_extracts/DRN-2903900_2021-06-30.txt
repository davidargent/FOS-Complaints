The complaint
Mr H says that National Westminster Bank Plc irresponsibly lent to him. He says NatWest 
didnt obtain information about the extent of his existing credit commitments to check that the 
loans were affordable. 
What happened
Mr H applied for a loan from NatWest in September 2018, an overdraft in November 2018 
and a further loan in December 2018.
Mr H says that at the tie he applied for the loans, NatWest was aware of his financial position 
and should have known the extent of his existing credit commitments and other borrowing. 
He says t the time of taking the loans he had borrowed to his limit and had no available 
income to service the loans.
Mr H complained to NatWest and said the loans shouldnt have been provided to him. He 
said hed used the overdraft facility to cover the monthly payments on the loans. He asked 
NatWest to remove default charges and write of the loan balance.
In response NatWest said it had carried out the checks to make sure that Mr H met its 
lending criteria before the loans were approved. It said it had never been advised by Mr H of 
any financial difficulties he was experiencing. NatWest said that because no bank error had 
been made, it wasnt able to write off the loan balance.
Mr H wasnt happy with the response and complained to this service. 
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She said she couldnt find anything to suggest 
that NatWest had lent irresponsibly.
Mr H didnt agree. He said NatWest shouldve checked his financial history with the credit 
reference agencies because this wouldve shown the extent of his financial commitments.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Unaffordable lending
NatWest needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend irresponsibly. This means 
it shouldve carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H could repay the loans in a 
sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of things, such as how 
much was being lent, the repayment amount and Mr Hs income and expenditure.
Certain factors might point to an obligation on NatWest to do more to establish that lending 
was sustainable. These factors include:
The lower the consumers income
The higher the amount due to be repaid
The greater the number and frequency of loans and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the act that repeated refinancing may 
signal that borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable)
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments and evidence provided. I can see that Mr H 
declared an income of £2500 per month when he applied for the loans. The loan repayments 
were £421 per month and £185 per month respectively.
NatWest has said that it carried out checks before approving the loans. These checks 
included affordability checks and credit scoring. As part of the checking process, NatWest 
says it obtained information from credit reference agencies. It says that having carried out 
these checks, it found that Mr H had a good credit score with no arrears noted. It also says 
that the checks showed that the loans were affordable, based on Mr Hs income and 
expenditure.
Based on what Ive seen, Im satisfied that NatWest carried out reasonable and 
proportionate checks before lending to Mr H. I havent seen anything to suggest that 
NatWest were aware of any financial difficulties being experienced by Mr H at the time he 
applied for the loans. So I cant say that NatWest did  anything wrong in lending to Mr H.
Financial difficulties
As part of his complaint, Mr H has said that the loans caused him to experience financial 
difficulties. As Ive said above, I havent seen anything to suggest that NatWest was aware of 
this at the time he applied for the loans. I can see that Mr H advised NatWest about his 
financial difficulties when he complained about irresponsible lending. By this time, the loan 
account had been defaulted and passed to a  debt recovery agency.
Id expect a  lender to response positively and sympathetically when it becomes aware that a 
customer is experiencing financial difficulties. In this case, I can see that NatWest advised 
Mr H to contact the debt recovery agency to discuss repayment options. I think this was a  
reasonable  and sympathetic  response in the circumstances.
Taking all of the available information into account, Im unable to find anything to suggest 
that NatWest lent irresponsibly. Therefore Im unable to uphold the complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2021.
