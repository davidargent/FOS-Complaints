The complaint
Mrs H complains about a declined request to write off her debt with Capquest Debt Recovery 
Limited (Capquest).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Capquest asked for medical evidence that Mrs H supplied.  
It was clear from that medical evidence that Mrs H was unable to work due to her 
condition. When the medical evidence was sent to Capquest, it was within 12 months 
of the date the GP assessed her. 
On this basis, I conclude that Mrs H provided what was asked for and her request 
wasnt fairly assessed.
Since the investigators view, Capquest have now agreed to write off the balance, but 
didnt agree to pay compensation.
Due to the delay in accepting the medical evidence and the trouble and upset this 
has caused Mrs H, Im satisfied Capquest should pay Mrs H £200 compensation. 
For these reasons, my decision is to uphold Mr Hs complaint
Putting things right
Capquest Debt Recovery Limited should write off the balance of the account as previously 
agreed and pay Mrs H a £200 trouble and upset payment.
This should also be confirmed to Mrs H in writing once done. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 April 2022.
