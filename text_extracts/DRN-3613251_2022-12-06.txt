Total £64,439.36
Mr B received refunds totalling £4, so the total loss he disputes is £64,435.36.
When Mr B subsequently got in touch with NatWest to explain hed been scammed, NatWest 
didnt reimburse his lost funds. Remaining unhappy, Mr B referred his complaint about 
NatWest to this office. As our investigator couldnt resolve the matter informally, the case 
has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided to not uphold this complaint, for materially the same reasons as the investigator. 
Ill explain why.
At the time Mr B made his payments, banks were expected to process payments a
customer authorised it to make; but as a matter of good industry practice, a bank should
have taken proactive steps to identify and help prevent transactions  particularly unusual or
uncharacteristic transactions  that could involve fraud or be the result of a scam.
There is a balance to be struck: banks had (and have) obligations to be alert to fraud and
scams and to act in their customers best interests, but they cant be involved in every
transaction.
Ive reviewed the prior operation of Mr Bs NatWest account. I dont think I can say  given
the payments in question here, taken singularly or collectively  that NatWest unreasonably 
failed to intervene before executing Mr Bs instructions, or that it would be reasonable here 
to hold NatWest responsible for Mr Bs loss and Ill explain why. 
Firstly, all the payments in dispute were sent to legitimate crypto exchanges and NatWest 
would reasonably have known this at the time they were processed. So Ive thought about 
whether there was anything else about the payments which ought to have concerned 
NatWest. 
The first six payments
There is a balance to be struck. Banks had (and have) obligations to be alert to fraud and 
scams and to act in their customers best interests. But they cant reasonably be involved in 
every transaction. And here I dont think I can fairly say that the first two payments which 
were, £3,350 each, spaced two weeks apart, were sufficiently unusual or uncharacteristic for 
the account. Certainly not enough to say that NatWest ought to have been obliged to have 
intervened before allowing either through, to protect Mr B from the possibility of financial 
harm from fraud. 
The same would apply to payments three to six  these were of very low value and I dont 
think NatWest ought reasonably to have been concerned about them. 
Payments seven to sixteen
Prior to payment seven, Mr B had made large debit card and bank transfer payments from 
his account to an investment company. These payments included a payment of £30,023 on 
23 September 2020, £20,000 on 13 October 2020 and £10,000 on 2 November 2020. I 
appreciate Mr B says these payments were in relation to his business and unrelated to the 
scam. But we have to consider how Mr B operated his account and what NatWest ought 
reasonably to have known at the time the payments in dispute were processed. From the 
information Ive found about the recipient of the undisputed payments, they appear to have 
been an investment company based in Cyprus. 
So whilst payments seven to sixteen were higher than payments one to six, in light of the 
recent undisputed investment payments made by Mr B (some of which were much higher 
than the individual payments in dispute), I dont think they would have reasonably stood out 
to NatWest. 
The scam payments were reasonably spaced apart and not for example sent in quick 
succession over a short period of time - which could indicate the pressure to pay larger 
funds quickly. The payments were also sent to the same payee that Mr B had paid over a 
five-month period. I dont the payments were sufficiently unusual, uncharacteristic or 
suspicious for me to say NatWest ought to have done more than it did, such as calling him to question him about the payments. It wasnt in my view unusual for Mr B to use his account to 
make large payments towards investments as this was in line with the recent account 
activity. 
I understand Mr C reported the scam to NatWest in March 2021. NatWest contacted the 
beneficiary bank in respect of Mr Cs bank transfer payments immediately. It replied several 
months later (after chasers from NatWest) to say no funds remained in the account. 
In respect of the debit card payments, I dont see that NatWest attempted chargeback claims 
but Im satisfied this would have made no material difference to the outcome. The Visa 
chargeback time limits applicable to Mr B would have been 120 days from the date of the 
transactions and more than 120 days had passed by the time Mr B contacted NatWest. 
I dont think NatWest could have done anymore than it did to recover Mr Bs payments. 
I appreciate Mr B will be disappointed with this outcome. But I can only uphold this complaint 
if Im satisfied NatWest did something wrong that caused his loss. And in this case, whilst I 
sympathise with Mr Bs position, for the reasons Ive explained, Im not persuaded NatWest 
can fairly be held responsible for his losses. 
My final decision
My final decision is, despite my natural sympathies for Mr Bs loss, I dont uphold this 
complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2023.
