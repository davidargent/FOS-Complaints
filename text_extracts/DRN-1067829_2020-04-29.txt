The complaint
Mr M complains that the loans he had from Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as 
Sunny) were unaffordable. 
What happened
Mr M had seven loans from Sunny between May 2018 and July 2018 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repaid
1 07 May 2018 £350 6m 31 May 2018
2 11 May 2018 £350 6m 31 May 2018
3 18 May 2018 £100 6m 05 Nov 2018
4 26 May 2018 £50 6m 01 Nov 2018
5 03 Jun 2018 £200 6m 05 Nov 2018
6 04 Jun 2018 £450 6m 02 Jul 2018
7 03 Jul 2018 £500 6m 05 Nov 2018
 
Mr M says Sunny should have known the loans were unaffordable and that hed have to 
borrow elsewhere to make the repayments. He says Sunny was irresponsible to lend to him 
and the lending trapped him into a debt spiral.
Sunny says it asked Mr M about his income and expenditure and checked his credit file. It 
says it validated his declared expenditure with third party sources and increased this number 
where appropriate. Sunny says it did not agree that the loans were unaffordable and Mr Ms 
pattern of borrowing showed he was charged interest for fewer than 12 months across all 
seven loans.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld. He said Sunny shouldn't 
have approved loan 4, or subsequent loans, because at that stage Mr M already had three 
outstanding Sunny loans. He added that, by loan 6, Mr Ms pattern of borrowing suggested 
he'd become persistently reliant on short-term loans. Our adjudicator recommended Sunny 
should refund interest and charges on loans 4 to 7 (plus 8% statutory interest). He said that 
adverse information about loans 4 to 7 should be removed from Mr Ms credit file.
Sunny responded to say that its robust checks showed the repayments on loans 4 to 7 were 
a small percentage of Mr Ms income and affordable based on his disposable income. It 
adds that its product allows four concurrent loans subject to a calculated credit limit and that 
there was nothing in his credit file to indicate he was struggling to manage his money. 
What Ive decided  and whyIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Sunny was required to lend responsibly. It 
should have made checks to make sure Mr M could afford to repay the loan before it lent to 
him. Those checks needed to be proportionate to things such as the amount Mr M was 
borrowing, and his lending history. But there was no set list of checks Sunny had to do.
Loans 1 to 3
Mr Ms first three loans were taken out within 11 days, but Im satisfied Sunnys checks 
showed repayments were affordable and there was no sign Mr M was struggling financially.
Loan 4
When Mr M applied for his fourth loan in three weeks, he still had three loans outstanding. 
As he had no repayment history at this stage, I find Sunny should have realised it was likely 
Mr M was having trouble managing his money and should not have approved further loans.
Loan 5
Mr M applied for loan 5 shortly after repaying loans 1 and 2, so I think its more likely than 
not that making these repayments left Mr M short, and he was borrowing again to cover a 
hole in his finances. Given Mr M still had two other outstanding Sunny loans at the time, I 
consider it was irresponsible for Sunny to have approved loan 5.
Loans 6 and 7
The day after Mr M took out loan 5, he applied for his highest loan yet. Again it seems likely 
Mr M was struggling financially due to the recent repayments, and he now had three other 
Sunny loans outstanding. Mr M repaid loan 6 early, but the following day he applied for an 
even bigger loan. I consider there were clear indications by this stage that Mr M was having 
trouble managing his money and Sunny should not have approved either of loans 6 or 7.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as 
Sunny) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr M paid on loans 4 to 7;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on refunds from payment date to settlement date*;
Remove any negative information about loans 4 to 7 from Mr Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 May 2020.
