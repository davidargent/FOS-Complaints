K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains about two loans CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) lent to him. 
Mr G says the loans were irresponsibly lent.
background
Mr G was lent a payday  loan and flex credit  account in September 2013 and November 
2013. The payday loan was for £50 and the flex credit had a limit of £550. Essentially,  Mr G 
could draw down  up to £550  on the flex account and repay it over 10 monthly  instalments. 
And had Mr G drawn down the maximum,  the highest repayment hed have made  in the 10 
month period  was £188.20.
Mr G complained to QuickQuid about  his loans but QuickQuid  didnt uphold his complaint 
and so he referred the complaint to this service where it was looked  at by one of our 
adjudicators.
Our adjudicator didnt  think QuickQuid was wrong to lend the first loan to Mr G but they 
thought that during the duration of the flex credit, there was a point where  it shouldve  been 
apparent to QuickQuid  that Mr G wasnt using the facility for its intended purpose and the 
repayments were no longer sustainable for him. QuickQuid disagreed and so the complaint 
has come  to me  an ombudsman - for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general  approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr G 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
QuickQuid has told us what checks it carried out, it has said it checked Mr Gs income and 
monthly expenses before  it agreed  to lend.  Mr Gs declared income was £2,500  and his 
declared living costs  were £700   this remained the same  at the outset of both loans. 
QuickQuid also said it searched Mr Gs credit  file before lending and there was no active 
adverse information.
Given that the first loan represented a small amount of Mr Gs declared income, I think  the 
checks QuickQuid carried out went far enough.
Also, the maximum repayment on the flex credit was a small amount relative to Mr Gs 
income and his monthly expenses suggest  that he was in a position to make  the repayments  
over the term. And so, at the outset, I think this loan was affordable.
Ref: DRN96733322However, QuickQuid did have a duty to monitor how this facility was used and to react  where 
there were signs Mr G had difficulty repaying. And so Ive considered how Mr G used this 
facility and I can see that within the first two weeks, Mr G drew down his maximum of £550  
and formed a pattern  over the next six months  of repaying some of the loan and within a few 
days drawing down  the same amount hed repaid. When he repaid  his outstanding balance 
in May 2014,  he drew  down £100 within a few days and repaid  it the next day.
Mr G then draws  down  more than the agreed limit of £550 in July 2014. I can see that over 
about a two week period, Mr G drew down £600.  QuickQuid  has said it agreed a limit 
increase at the time.  But I think the fact that Mr G needed an increased limit ought to have 
concerned QuickQuid. I also think the fact that for several months, Mr G was repaying some 
of his borrowing  and within  a few days borrowing the same  amount again should also have 
concerned QuickQuid. As this suggests  that Mr G may have been reliant on the loans and 
was likely needing to borrow again  to fill a hole the repayments were leaving  in his finances.
In September  2014, theres email  correspondence  from QuickQuid that suggests Mr G 
contacted it to say that making the previous repayment had left him struggling  to meet  his 
living costs.  The email  seems to suggest  that Mr G was requesting a refund from QuickQuid, 
something QuickQuid declined. QuickQuid then went on to approve five consecutive  
drawdowns totalling £400.
I think by this stage, QuickQuid ought  reasonably  to have been aware that that Mr G was 
struggling to make his repayments and when he did make them,  he wasnt doing  so in a 
sustainable manner.  There were sufficient signs that shouldve alerted QuickQuid to this and 
it wasnt responsible  to continue lending, particularly  given the manner in which Mr G had 
borrowed and repaid his previous drawdowns.  Also the flex credit ran for nearly 16 months 
and Mr G had to enter into a repayment  plan with QuickQuid as he went into financial 
difficulties.
Given what QuickQuid knew about  Mr G and how the flex credit account had been  used,  it 
shouldve reacted in September  2014  and shouldnt have continued lending from 
2 September 2014 onwards. As a result of continued lending,  Mr G has lost out and 
QuickQuid needs  to put things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid as a result of any drawdown  made  from 
2 September 2014 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove adverse information about the drawdowns from 2 September 2014 onwards 
from Mr Gs credit  file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr G a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN96733323my final decision
I uphold Mr Gs complaint in part and require CashEuroNet  UK LLC to put things right as 
outlined above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 June  2019.
