The complaint
Mr B is unhappy with the service hes received from PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
surrounding the value of reimbursements made to his account following returns of items 
purchased using his PayPal account.
What happened
Mr B purchased an item from an overseas seller and made payment via his PayPal account. 
When Mr B received the item, he was unhappy with it and so contacted the seller about this. 
The seller didnt resolve the issue to Mr Bs satisfaction, and so Mr B contacted PayPal who 
offered to provide a refund to Mr B under their Buyer Protection scheme. However, when Mr 
B received the refund from PayPal, he found that it was £8.50 less than he was expecting, 
which PayPal explained was because of currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Mr B then purchased the same item as before from a different overseas seller, but Mr B also 
wasnt happy with that item when he received it and so again contacted PayPal and 
arranged for a refund. PayPal agreed to arrange a refund for the cost of the item but didnt 
agree to cover a customs charge of approximately £50 that Mr B had incurred. Mr B wasnt 
happy about this, or about the earlier loss hed incurred because of exchange rate 
fluctuations. So, he raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mr B complaint, but they felt that theyd refunded Mr B fairly and in line 
with the terms of the PayPal account, and so they didnt uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Mr B wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also felt that PayPal hadnt acted 
unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr B in how theyd managed this situation, and so they 
also didnt uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Mr B remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how Mr B might feel disgruntled that on both occasions he sought a 
reimbursement for a returned item from PayPal that he didnt receive the full amount he felt 
he should - because currency exchange rates moved against him in the first instance, and 
because PayPal wouldnt reimburse the customers charges in the second instance.
However, PayPals User Agreement confirms that if a payment involves a conversion to a 
foreign currency, as was the case in this instance, that any reimbursement of that payment 
can be converted back to GBP using a currency exchange rate applicable at the time of the 
reimbursement. Additionally, the User Agreement also confirms that movement in currency 
exchange rates between the date of the original payment and the date of the reimbursement 
can result in an account holder receiving less money back than was originally paid.
Furthermore, PayPals Used Agreement also makes it clear that PayPal wont involve 
themselves in the reporting or remitting of any taxes, such as customs charges, that might 
be incurred on a transaction or reimbursement of a transaction to or from an overseas 
merchant.
These conditions seem reasonable to me, and I dont feel that PayPal should fairly or 
reasonably be asked to cover the cost of the exchange rate movement or customs charges 
as Mr B would here. And one reason I say this is that PayPals role is not that or either the 
buyer or the seller, but merely that of a payment facilitator.
Instead, I feel that it was incumbent on Mr B, when purchasing from an overseas seller, to 
have understood the risks that purchasing items from overseas sources can entail. These 
include that customs charges may apply for which Mr B would be responsible for recovering 
should he need to, and that movements in the currency exchange rates between purchase 
and refund dates may have a negative effect on any refund amount he may receive. 
Mr B has also stated in his correspondence with this service that he is unhappy with the item 
provided by the sellers. However, the complaint under assessment here is against PayPal 
only, and so any issues that Mr B has specific to the sellers cant be considered.
I realise that this wont be the outcome Mr B was wanting, but it follows from the above that I 
wont be upholding this complaint or instructing PayPal to take any further action. I hope that 
Mr B will understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2022.
