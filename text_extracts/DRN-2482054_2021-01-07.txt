The complaint
Miss O complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA left her considerably out of pocket 
when it unfairly reversed a sale shed completed.
What happened
Miss O said that late in 2019 she sold a vintage coat online for £133. She advertised it on an
online auction site, with five-day delivery and no returns. It was bought by someone
overseas, although Miss O said shed only posted it to a UK address.
Miss O thought that the buyer had simply changed her mind. Miss O told us that the buyer
tried three times to return the item.
First, the buyer said that there was a delay in arrival, and she wanted to cancel. Miss O said
shed met the requirements on her for delivery, and the delay was in international postage,
which was the buyers responsibility.
Secondly, the buyer said the coat was too small. Miss O said shed supplied extensive
measurements, and could evidence this. Miss O said that PayPal had told her it wouldnt
cover issues of description like size. And PayPal confirmed this claim wasnt upheld.
Thirdly, the buyer complained about the lining. Miss O said she didnt know the details of
this, but the photos she supplied included ones of the lining. But she said PayPal told her it
had told the seller to return the coat. It also told her she could claim if, once she got the coat
back, it wasnt in the same condition as when it was sent.
Miss O said that she then found out that the coat was being held by customs, and wouldnt
be returned to her until she paid the customs charge.
Miss O said the buyer then made a chargeback request, and that was upheld. PayPal took
the money back for the sale, and it charged Miss O £14 for that.
Miss O said as a private seller, she wasnt in breach of the Sale Of Goods Act, and PayPal
had made a mistake.
Miss O wanted PayPal to pay her the £133 shed lost through the sale being reversed, and
the £14 it had charged for the chargeback. And she wanted PayPal to ensure that the
auction site she had used removed the negative feedback the buyer left.
PayPal said the buyer had opened a dispute saying the coat was not as described, as it was
the wrong size. That dispute had been turned down, but the buyer appealed, and PayPal
had decided that the buyer ought to send it back. Miss O had contacted PayPal to disagree,
but the coat was already on its way back. At the start of February 2020, PayPal told Miss O
that the buyer had filed a chargeback with her credit card provider. The item was being held
by customs at that time.
The chargeback request was successful. PayPal took back the £133 Miss O had received
for the coat, and paid it to the buyers credit card provider (who will have passed this on to
the buyer). PayPal also charged Miss O its £14 chargeback fee, but it said it has since
refunded this.
PayPal said it wouldnt refund the cost of the coat to Miss O, because she didnt qualify for
its seller protection. That didnt apply to chargebacks. And it said she was responsible for
customs fees. But it said this matter had caused her frustration, so it would offer her a credit
of £30.
PayPal has now said to our service that it understands the buyer had sent it photos which
showed the coat was torn at the linings. PayPal has also told us that it no longer has these
photos, so it cant send them to our service. It also said its offer of £30 was made to cover
any customs fees, but Miss O hadnt replied to its offer.
PayPal repeated that it had acted in line with its buyer protection policy. And it said it was
bound to pay for a successful chargeback. It didnt control the outcome of chargebacks.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said that once PayPal had
asked the buyer to send the item back, the buyer pursued this through their card issuer. And
that chargeback was successful. PayPal doesnt control that, and has to abide by the rules
of the card issuer. So our investigator was satisfied that PayPal didnt make a mistake when
it gave the money back. It had reversed the chargeback fee it was intending to charge Miss
O for this, and it had offered her £30 which covered the customs fees shed been charged
when the item was returned to her. Our investigator said he wouldnt expect PayPal to also
give Miss O a refund for the item, because it was returned to her.
Our investigator said he wouldnt ask PayPal to do any more.
Miss O didnt agree. She said that shed sought advice, and it was sufficient under the Sale
Of Goods Act, for a private sale, that the item matched the description. She said any views
on faultiness didnt come into play. She asked if she had no right of recourse when PayPal
authorised the return of the item without any prior discussion, and after telling her the case
was found in her favour. And she said the seller had left incorrect and damaging feedback
on the auction site where the item was sold. She wanted fairness there too.
Miss O also said that the £30 was to cover frustration not the customs fees shed incurred.
Miss O wrote again, to say shed lost a sale for £133, and suffered damage to her reputation.
Our investigator said he couldnt comment on the advice Miss O had received about the Sale
Of Goods Act. He said that PayPal had followed the terms of its user agreement, which Miss
O had agreed to. It had also followed the requirements of the card scheme operator by
reversing the payment, and that reversal wasnt covered by PayPals seller protection. And
PayPal couldnt be held responsible for feedback left on a third party site.
Our investigator said that PayPal had confirmed that its payment of £30 was to cover the
cost of the customs fee. He didnt change his mind.
Miss O said that her complaint was always about PayPal costing her the full cost of the sale.
And she thought that PayPal had enabled the reputational damage shed suffered, so ought
to have its hands slapped by our organisation. Miss O wanted her complaint to be
considered by an ombudsman, so this case was passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decisionI issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Firstly, Id like to set out the issues Ill be considering here.
Miss O said that she wasnt in breach of the Sale Of Goods Act. But I dont think that 
the Act is the key issue here. Miss O has agreed to PayPals user agreement, which 
includes a buyer protection policy. So when Im thinking about whether PayPal made 
a mistake by allowing the buyer to return the item, Ill need to think about what 
PayPal should have done under its buyer protection policy, not the Act.
Ill also need to think about what PayPal should have done in response to the 
chargeback request the buyer made.
I dont think PayPal is responsible for feedback given by the buyer. So I wont be 
considering that issue further here.
PayPal told us that the buyer had reported the coat was narrower than the 
measurements Miss O gave. But it also told us it had turned down the buyers claim 
made on this basis, so I dont think that the accuracy of the measurements is relevant 
here.
PayPal has told us that it understood the lining of the coat Miss O sold was torn. It 
had turned down the buyers appeal, and had apparently told Miss O this. But PayPal 
then changed its mind when it found out the buyer had sent it pictures, before the 
deadline for her appeal was up. I think its poor service for Miss O to be told that the 
appeal had been turned down, then for this decision to be reversed because of 
evidence PayPal had overlooked. Ill bear that in mind when Im thinking about 
compensation.
Miss O has sent us pictures which include one showing most of the lining. There are 
no tears visible there, the item seems to me to be as Miss O described it.
PayPal hasnt sent any pictures to show the lining was torn. It says it no longer has 
them. And I understand the person dealing with this complaint on PayPals behalf 
hasnt been able to view these pictures either. So there is simply no information 
available to me on whether the buyer was alleging the coat was torn in an area 
shown on Miss Os photo, or not.
On the evidence Ive seen, I dont think I can conclude that its more likely that the 
coat lining was torn, or, if it was, that it was torn when it was sold. So I cant say the 
decision PayPal took was fair.
PayPal has told us it isnt able to review items manually. But it is presumably able to
compare photos, and it hasnt shown us it did that. I think that PayPal shouldve 
looked into this issue further at this stage, particularly as Miss O would be likely to 
have to pay customs fees to get the returned coat back. So I dont think PayPal 
shouldve told the buyer to return this item when it did.
Ive also thought about what PayPal did when it received a chargeback request. I can 
see that it contacted Miss O, and asked if she wanted to send further information. But 
I think PayPal could also have said that it was dealing with this matter under its buyer 
protection policy, and had authorised a return. I think that if PayPal had said this, a 
chargeback wouldve been unlikely to be successful. If a refund was made under the 
policy, Miss O wouldnt have been asked to pay a chargeback fee.I think PayPal provided Miss O with poor service again at this point.
Because I dont think PayPal should have authorised a return in this case when it did, 
and because PayPal has provided Miss O with poor service, I think it should pay 
compensation.
Miss O says she wants the lost income from her sale, which is £133, and the 
chargeback fee. PayPal has already refunded that fee. And I dont think it has to pay 
the lost income from Miss Os sale. Thats because Miss O now has the coat back. 
She hasnt suggested its been damaged by the buyer, or in transit. So she can 
presumably sell it again.
I know Miss O is already out of pocket for customs charges (which she only paid 
because PayPal authorised the return) and if she resells the coat, she will then have 
to pay for a second transaction, and shipping (again, only because PayPal 
authorised the return). But I think its fair to assume she can achieve roughly the 
same price when she sells the coat again. So that means her loss from the first, 
failed sale isnt £133. Its shipping, auction fees, and customs charges. I think its fair 
to ask PayPal to pay £50 for this. It can include in that its offer of £30, which I 
understand Miss O hasnt yet accepted.
I also think Miss O has found this a deeply frustrating and upsetting process. I have 
noted points at which I think PayPals service has been particularly poor. So I think 
PayPal should also pay Miss O some compensation. I think an additional payment of 
£150 in compensation would provide a fair and reasonable outcome to this 
complaint. So I think PayPal should pay Miss O £200 in total.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
PayPal didnt reply. Miss O sent a substantive reply.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss O said that she didnt think that PayPal had ever told her the buyer had sent photos of 
the coat. She said it certainly didnt send those to her. She said shed received no evidence 
of the alleged tears in the lining, only claims that it was torn. She still said that the coat was 
just as she had described it. And she said that although PayPal had said to us that it offered 
£30 towards customs fees, it told her this money was for frustration. 
Miss O said that she had found this issue very upsetting, so she was glad it was drawing to a 
close. And she hoped that having pursued this complaint, and won, meant that this would be 
less likely to happen to other people in future.
Ive considered Miss Os further representations, and reconsidered this complaint as a 
whole. I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the award I originally proposed.My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must pay Miss O £200.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms O to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 February 2021.
