K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs B say HSBC UK Bank  Plc (HSBC)  mis-sold a Plus packaged  bank account  to 
Mr B in 2007. Theyve used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to complain. 
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr and Mrs Bs complaint  already and didnt think  that HSBC mis-
sold the packaged account.  The CMC  disagreed  and asked for an ombudsmans  review.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr and Mrs Bs complaint.  Having  done so, I dont think  HSBC mis-sold the 
Plus account  to Mr B. Id like to explain why I think thats the case. 
Its common knowledge that free accounts are widely available in the United Kingdom. And 
Mr B having  one before the Plus account  means he wouldve known HSBC did free accounts 
and that he couldve  had one of those  if thats what he really wanted.
The Plus account  wasnt recommended  to Mr B. So it was up to Mr B to decide  if it was right 
for him. I think  that Mr B couldve used some  the main benefits included on the account and 
it was up to him to do so. 
Im open  to the possibility Mr B wasnt told everything he needed  to know about  all the 
benefits. But Ive not seen  anything  suggesting the main limitations or exclusions affected 
him. So I dont think  clearer information wouldve made a difference and I think Mr B was 
given enough  to know and understand what he was choosing to take.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr and Mrs Bs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision  before  20 April 2019.
