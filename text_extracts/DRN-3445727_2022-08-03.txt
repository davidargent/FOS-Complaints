The complaint
Mrs T complains that the interest rate NewDay Ltd charge on her store credit card is too high 
and her payments are not reducing the balance she owes.  
What happened
Mrs T has held a retail store card since around 2000. While originally provided by a high 
street retailer, Mrs T says the account was taken over by NewDay in or around 2012/2013. 
Since then, NewDay have, on various occasions, increased the interest rate charged on Mrs 
Ts account. 
Mrs T says shes always maintained her payments to the account as they fall due. But as the 
interest rate has increased, a greater proportion of her payments have covered interest costs 
and the balance she owes has reduced more slowly.
Mrs T complained to NewDay in March 2021. She told them she was unhappy with the 
interest rate they were charging on her account. She wanted NewDay to either reduce or 
stop the interest they were charging.
In their response, NewDay didnt uphold Mrs Ts complaint. They explained how interest was 
calculated and how she could reduce or avoid future interest charges by increasing the 
amount she paid each month. They said the interest rate is applied in line with their terms 
and conditions and they didnt agree theyd made an error.
Mrs T wasnt happy with NewDays response. So, she decided to refer her complaint to this 
service. She said NewDay had been overcharging interest for a considerable number of 
years.
Having considered all the information provided by Mrs T and NewDay, our investigator didnt 
think NewDay had done anything wrong and that any increases to the interest rate they 
charge were made in accordance with their terms and conditions. She didnt think NewDay 
needed to take any action.
Mrs T didnt agree with our investigators findings and asked for her complaint to be referred 
to an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Credit and store card providers are able to vary their terms and conditions, including the 
interest rate they charge. Interest rate changes can occur for various reasons. These may 
include where the card provider undertakes a repricing exercise or following a Bank of 
England base rate change.
There are various rules around the circumstances in which a card provider can change the 
interest rate on a credit or store card account. One of the key requirements is that NewDay 
has to have permission in the credit agreement to make the change.
Ive considered the credit agreement that applies to Mrs Ts account with NewDay. It says, 
We may make changes to this Agreement, including the interest rates. It goes on to explain 
the circumstances where a rate change may be applied. These include, to reflect an actual, 
or reasonably expected change in our underlying costs and where we have good reason to 
think that you are not making sufficient payments to pay your balance down in a reasonable 
period. So, I believe this means NewDay could vary the interest rate they charge.
Industry guidance suggests that where an interest rate is increased due to re-pricing, 
NewDay should give at least 30 days notice of any increase. They should tell Mrs T she can 
opt-out and give her at least 60 days to do that. 
NewDay have confirmed they wrote to Mrs T on 14 July 2017 to tell her the interest rate they 
were charging would be increased. They gave her until 19 September 2017 to opt out. 
Should Mrs T choose to opt out, she had that period to repay the amount she owed at the 
existing interest rate. While NewDay have been unable to provide a copy of the letter they 
sent to Mrs T, they have provided a copy of the letter wording. Their file records show that 
this was sent to Mrs T at the same address detailed on her account statements. 
Ive considered the wording of the letter they sent, and I believe it complies with the industry 
guidance at the time. So, I cant reasonably say that NewDay did anything wrong when they 
increased the rate on Mrs Ts account. They were entitled to do that. And while Mrs T did 
have the option to either repay or refinance the amount she owed; she didnt do that here.
There are circumstances where NewDay may wish to consider reducing or waiving the 
interest they charge. This is normally where its established that Mrs T is in financial difficulty 
and is struggling to maintain her contracted payments. NewDays file notes show they 
offered to review Mrs Ts financial situation. But Mrs T confirmed she was able to maintain 
payments and wasnt struggling financially. So, I wouldnt expect NewDay to have reduced 
the interest they charged.
There is evidence that NewDay suggested to Mrs T she increase her monthly repayments to 
a level higher than shed previously been paying. This is what I would expect to see from a 
lender acting responsibly. They told her this would help to reduce the amount she owed 
more quickly and also reduce the amount of interest charged. But Mrs T chose not to do that 
here.
Ultimately, NewDay are entitled to decide the interest rate they charge. That is a commercial 
decision, and not one this service is able to influence. NewDay appear to have given the 
required notice to Mrs T ahead of applying any increased interest rate. This gave her the 
opportunity to opt out of any increase and consider, where possible, refinancing at cheaper 
rates any remaining balance she couldnt repay within the notice period.
I do acknowledge Mrs Ts strength of feeling on this matter. Shes made it clear that she 
believes the interest rate charged to her account is very expensive. But as Ive explained, I 
cant find that NewDay did anything wrong here or treated her unfairly. I appreciate Mrs T will 
be disappointed, but I shant be upholding her complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 August 2022.
