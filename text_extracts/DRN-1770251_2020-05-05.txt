The complaint
Miss F is unhappy Santander UK Plc allowed several fraudulent transactions to a well-known 
food delivery service debit her account. She says these shouldve been blocked and 
because they werent, her mortgage Direct Debit bounced. She would like Santander to 
compensate her for the upset caused.  
What happened
During the early hours of 2 December 2018, numerous transactions were made using Miss 
Fs debit card to a well-known food delivery service. Not all of them were successful and 
below is a table detailing the sequence of events.

Miss F called the bank that morning to report the fraudulent transactions. Santander 
explained that it couldnt refund the transactions until they appeared on Miss Fs statements. 
They were therefore refunded on 4 December 2018. 
Miss F is unhappy because the fraudulent transactions meant she didnt have enough 
money in her account to pay her mortgage Direct Debit and it therefore bounced. Although 
she was able to call up and pay this, and it had no adverse effect on her mortgage, it was 
inconvenient and caused undue stress. In its final response Santander said that it couldnt explain why the transactions hadnt been 
picked up by its fraud prevention systems. It offered Miss F £40 for the distressed caused 
but she didnt accept this and brought her complaint to this service. 
Our investigator didnt uphold Miss Fs complaint. He didnt think the transactions were 
unusual enough for Santanders systems to have flagged them. And he pointed out that the 
transactions were refunded promptly, so he wouldnt be asking Santander to do anything 
further. 
Miss F didnt agree and asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman, so the 
complaint has been passed to me. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There are circumstances where a bank should fairly and reasonably make additional checks 
before processing a payment to help protect customers from the possibility of fraud. 
Ive considered whether the transactions were sufficiently unusual or out of character that 
the bank ought to have been concerned about them and intervened. Having done so I do 
agree that there were certain characteristics of the transactions that could be considered as 
unusual when compared to Miss Fs usual account usage. For example, the fact the 
transactions occurred to the same merchant in such a short space of time. 
However, this doesnt mean Santander shouldve flagged the transactions immediately. I say 
this because the transactions on their own arent sufficiently unusual  they are for a 
relatively low amount and to a well know merchant. Its more the cumulative effect of them 
happening over a relatively short space of time, coupled with the then declined transaction, 
that make them appear more out of the norm. 
You could go onto argue Santander couldve flagged the transactions slightly sooner than it 
did, because of the pattern that emerged. But this is a very fine line given the low amounts of 
the transactions and the relatively low number of them. 
However, even if I was to conclude Santander shouldve flagged the transactions sooner, I 
dont think this wouldve resulted in a different outcome here. Miss Fs account balance was 
already sufficiently depleted enough after just the first two transactions, that her Direct Debit 
to her mortgage provider wouldve always bounced. And it follows, given I dont think 
Santander made an error in not flagging the transactions initially, that it cant be held 
responsible for Direct Debit bouncing and the upset this caused. I also have to take into 
account Santander refunded Miss F promptly, so she wasnt without the funds for long. 
I dont want to take away from the understandable upset and worry Miss F suffered when 
she found out about the transactions and the fact her Direct Debit had bounced. But I think 
its fairer to apportion this to the actions of the unknown fraudster who stole Miss Fs card 
details, rather than Santanders actions. 
Im satisfied Santander has done what I would expect it to do in the circumstances and I 
therefore wont be recommending it takes any further action. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Miss Fs complaint against Santander UK Plc. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss F to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 June 2020.
