K821x#15complaint
Ms W complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid  and Pounds to Pocket,
lent to her in an irresponsible manner.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  5 July 2019,  
an extract  of which is attached and forms part of this final decision.  So, I wont  repeat that 
information here.
In my provisional decision,  I set out why I thought  Ms Ws complaint should  be upheld in part 
and what CashEuroNet  should do to put matters right. I invited  both parties to let me have 
any further comments and evidence. Both Ms W and CashEuroNet said that they didnt have 
anything further  to add. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that neither  Ms W nor CashEuroNet have provided me with anything  further,  I see no 
reason to depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.  So, I remain  of 
the view that CashEuroNet shouldnt have given  Ms W loans three  to 11. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Ms Ws complaint in 
part. I now require CashEuroNet UK LLC to:
refund  all interest and charges Ms W paid on loans three to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans three and four from Ms Ws credit  file;
the number  of loans  taken from loan five onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans five to 11 should  be removed from 
Ms Ws credit file.
Ref: DRN63535702 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  
CashEuroNet must  give Ms W a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off, if she asks 
for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 August 2019.

Ms W says that she couldnt  afford  to repay  the loans. She wants a refund  of interest,  with 
interest and information  removed  from her credit file.
One of our adjudicators  assessed Ms Ws complaint. He said that CashEuroNet shouldnt  
have given Ms W loans three to 11. The adjudicator set out what  CashEuroNet should do 
to put that right.
CashEuroNet didnt  agree  with the adjudicators assessment. As the complaint hasnt 
been resolved  informally,  it has been  passed to me, an ombudsman,  to decide.
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant  rules, guidance and 
good industry practice - on our website.
Ref: DRN63535704CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice, this means that it should  have carried  out proportionate checks to make  sure
Ms W could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks  could take into account  
a number of different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts  
and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages  of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  should fairly and 
reasonably have done more to establish  that any lending was sustainable for the 
consumer. These factors  include:
    the lower  a customers  income  (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to 
make any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of 
income);
    the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher  repayment from a particular  level of income);
    the greater  the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period 
of time during  which a customer has been given  loans  (reflecting the risk that 
repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending  itself 
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  was required to 
establish whether  Ms W could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the 
loan payments were  affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable on this basis  might  be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this 
is the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments . And it follows that a lender should realise, 
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence and information  provided in 
this context and what this all means for Ms Ws complaint.
In relation to loans one and two, given the loan amounts, what  was apparent  about 
Ms Ws circumstances  at the time and her history with the lender at that point, I dont think  
it wouldve  been proportionate for CashEuroNet to ask Ms W for the amount of information  
needed to show the lending was unsustainable.  There wasnt  anything  in the information 
Ms W provided or the information  CashEuroNet shouldve been  aware  of, which  meant it
wouldve been proportionate for it to conduct  a full review of Ms Ws financial position. So, I
dont think that CashEuroNet treated Ms W unfairly in giving  her loans one and two.
Ref: DRN63535705I think the position changed  at loan three.  Thats because the repayments for loans three,  
four and five required a significant proportion of Ms Ws income.  Ms Ws stated income  
was £1,500. Some of the repayments  were more than £700.  I appreciate that loans four 
and five were repayable  in two payments but given  that Ms W had returned for more 
borrowing within weeks of repaying  her previous loans, theres no indication that she could 
save from a previous month in order to make the repayments.
I note that CashEuroNet asked Ms W about  her expenditure  but I dont think that went far 
enough. I think  proportionate checks before loans three, four and five would have shown 
that the level of repayment as against Ms Ws income meant that there was a significant risk 
that Ms W wouldnt have been able to meet  her existing commitment without having to 
borrow again. So, I think its unlikely that Ms W would have been able to meet her 
repayments for these  loans in a sustainable way. I dont think  that CashEuroNet  should 
have given Ms W loans three,  four and five.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Ms Ws lending history with CashEuroNet,  with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which CashEuroNet should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so CashEuroNet should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan five. I dont  think CashEuroNet should  have  given Ms W loan five as Ive explained 
above. But I think it also should  have been prompted at this point to think about Ms Ws 
pattern of lending.  I say this because  by loan five, Ms W had borrowed from CashEuroNet 
for almost seven months with very little break.  She wasnt making any real inroads to the 
amount she owed CashEuroNet. Loan 11 was taken out over three years after Ms Ws first 
loan and it was for a much  larger  amount. So Ms W had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service  an intermittent debt to CashEuroNet over an extended  period.
Ive noted the gap of nine months between loans 10 and 11. Ive thought  carefully about 
this, as its a considerable period of time. However, when Ms W repaid loan 10 in June 
2017, shed been a customer  of CashEuroNets for around  two years and four months.  And 
when she came back to borrow again I understand that CashEuroNet  didnt do anything 
differently to assess the risk of the repayments  being unsustainably affordable  than what it 
had done when she first borrowed from it. I havent  seen anything  from either  party that 
suggests Ms Ws situation had improved in the intervening  time.  I dont think that 
CashEuroNet should have given Ms W loans five to 11.
I think that Ms W lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from loan 
five onwards because  these  loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ws 
indebtedness by allowing  her to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time. And 
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Ms Ws ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
Ive noted that loans  nine and ten and 11 were  instalment loans but I dont think  that alters 
the outcome here. For the reasons  Ive set out above, I intend to uphold Ms Ws complaint 
about loans three to 11 and CashEuroNet should put things right.
Ref: DRN63535706putting things right   what I intend  to ask CashEuroNet to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms W paid on loans three to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans three and four from Ms Ws credit  file;
the number  of loans  taken from loan five onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans five to 11 should  be removed from 
Ms Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  
CashEuroNet must  give Ms W a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off, if she asks 
for one.
my provisional decision
For the reasons  Ive set out above,  my provisional decision is that I intend to uphold Ms Ws 
complaint in part. I intend to direct CashEuroNet UK LLC to take the steps Ive set out 
above.
