K820x#14complaint
Mr P has complained that Hastings Insurance Services  Limited  allowed his car insurance 
policy to lapse. 
background
Mr P bought a car insurance policy  through a broker, Hastings. In May 2016 Hastings sent 
Mr P a renewal invite. His policy was due to renew  in June 2016. 
Mr P called Hastings. He said he didnt want to renew  through it as hed found a policy  
cheaper elsewhere. Hastings told Mr P it wouldnt collect the renewal payment due on 
25 June 2016.  
In January 2018 Hastings received a claim from a third party  insurer  about an incident Mr P 
was involved in in October 2016. So Hastings contacted Mr P. Mr P said he thought  he was 
insured through Hastings. 
In November 2018 Mr P complained to Hastings.  He also contacted us. He believed  
Hastings had cancelled  his car insurance policy without telling him. He provided a certificate 
of motor insurance from Hastings which showed  cover from 25 June 2016  to 25 June  2017.  
Hastings replied to Mr Ps complaint in December 2018. It said it had resolved it. But this 
was an error. 
Hastings provided  us with a recording  of the key call Mr P made  in 2016 where he asked it 
not to renew his policy. 
Our investigator didnt  recommend Mr Ps complaint  should be upheld. 
Mr P didnt agree. He believes Hastings randomly cancelled his car insurance policy without 
making him aware. 
So the case has been passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I dont intend to uphold 
it. 
I dont know the exact  date of when Mr P called  Hastings.  But from the other information 
available to me, I can conclude that it was after Hastings sent its renewal invite dated 
27 May 2016  but before  the renewal  date of 25 June 2016.  The purpose of Mr Ps call was 
to ask Hastings  not to renew his policy as he found  a cheaper policy elsewhere. The agent  
quoted the renewal premium of Â£405.78  which matches the price on Mr Ps 2016  renewal  
invite. 
The agent  told Mr P it wouldnt collect the yearly premium on 25 June 2016. Mr P was happy  
with this and the call ended.
Ref: DRN55570032I understand that Mr P has a certificate of motor insurance from Hastings which  shows  cover 
from 25 June 2016 to 24 June 2017.  It isnt clear when Hastings sent this to Mr P. Its 
possible that it was already  in the process of being  sent when Mr P called to cancel the 
renewal.
So based  on what Ive seen, I dont think Hastings cancelled Mr Ps car insurance policy 
without his knowledge. He asked it not to renew his policy and Ive seen no evidence that 
Mr P paid for insurance through Hastings from June 2016.
Hastings said it found that Mr P was insured with another  insurer after he cancelled the 
renewal of his policy  through  Hastings. It said it redirected the third partys  claim to that 
insurer in April 2018. 
I think Hastings correctly  acted on Mr Ps request to cancel the renewal of his policy  in 
June 2016. So I dont think Hastings has been unreasonable  to him.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given above,  my final decision is that I dont uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 February  2020.
