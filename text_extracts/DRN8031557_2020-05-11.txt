K820x#14complaint
Mr D complains that a van that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement  wasnt  
of satisfactory quality and that it was misrepresented to him by FCE Bank Plc, trading as 
Ford Credit. 
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
Ford Credit, as the supplier of the van, was responsible  for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr D. Whether or not it was of satisfactory  quality 
at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the van and 
the price that was paid for it. The van that was supplied to him was new and had a price  of 
£26,045 so I consider that it was reasonable for him to expect that it would be free from even  
minor defects. Satisfactory quality also covers  durability  which means that the components 
within the van must be durable  and last a reasonable  amount of time  but exactly  how long 
that time is will depend on a number of factors. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr D says that he ordered and paid for a sport model but that the van that was 
supplied to him is a trend model  which has a lower specification;
the hire purchase  agreement which was signed by Mr D refers to a spt model, the 
invoice refers to a trend sip sport and Ford Credit says that its a special edition van 
which is a hybrid  of the sport and trend  models  with a few unique features  it also 
says that Mr D was quoted for a sport model but it was more  than £5,000  more  
expensive so he chose the van that was supplied to him;
I sympathise with Mr D that hes not satisfied with the specification and model of van 
that was supplied to him  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that the van was misrepresented to him;
Mr D has complained  about issues with the vans tyres, fuel additive consumption, 
brakes and power and he says that it wasnt of satisfactory quality;
I can understand Mr Ds frustration about those issues   but the tyres  were replaced 
by the dealer, it dealt with the additive  consumption and two manufacturers  recalls, 
and Ive seen  no other  evidence  to show that there are any issues  with the van that 
would cause it not to have been of satisfactory quality when it was supplied  to him;
the van was serviced by the dealer in November 2018 and it says that no unusual 
issues with it were  found;
Mr D was able to drive more than 36,000 miles in the van between April 2018 and 
September 2019  and Im not persuaded that hed have been able to do so if the 
van hadnt been of satisfactory quality when it was supplied  to him;
Ref: DRN80315572Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that the van wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to him; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Ford Credit to allow Mr D to reject the van, to pay him any compensation or to take 
any other action in response  to his complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 June  2020.
