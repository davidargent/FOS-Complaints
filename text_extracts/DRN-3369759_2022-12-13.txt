The complaint
Mr G complains about entries recorded on his credit file by National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest).
What happened
Mr G holds a mortgage account with NatWest. In March 2020 NatWest agreed to a payment 
holiday on the account due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This applied from April 2020 until 
September 2020. Afterwards, as Mr G was still affected by the pandemic, NatWest agreed to 
accept reduced monthly payments from October 2020 to December 2020. Another reduced 
payment plan was agreed from January 2021 until March 2021. In April 2021, NatWest 
agreed a period of forbearance and no payments were made between April and June 2021. 
Mr G was agreeing these arrangements with NatWest at each stage. But, as he wasnt 
making the contractual payments, arrears were building up on the account.
In July 2021, Mr G agreed a repayment plan with NatWest. The monthly payment under this 
arrangement is the mortgage payment plus an extra amount to clear the arrears. Mr G has 
maintained the payments under this plan.
There was an issue with the July 2021 payment whereby the Direct Debit was collected even 
though Mr G had made a manual payment for that month. The Direct Debit was returned, but 
Mr G says that NatWests system treated this as a missed payment. NatWest paid Mr G £50 
for the distress and inconvenience caused by this. It said it would ensure that his credit file 
showed that he was in an arrangement to pay for July and August 2021 and that it would 
make any necessary amendments.
Mr G accepts that his account is reporting as being in an arrangement to pay. But he says 
that missed payment markers are also being recorded, even though he isnt missing 
payments. He says this started showing on his credit file from September 2021, but the 
arrangement to pay marker has been on his credit file since the end of 2020. He also says 
that the missed payment markers for July and August 2021 dropped off when NatWest 
corrected his credit file.
Mr G raised a complaint with one of the Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs), querying the 
missed payments. But he says the CRA said that NatWest is reporting both the arrangement 
to pay and the missed payments.
NatWest offered a further £100 to resolve the complaint after Mr G brought it to this service. 
Mr G didnt accept this as he remains concerned about the entries on his credit file. He says 
he cant transfer his credit card balance elsewhere because of the adverse entries, so he 
would like NatWest to set the interest rate on his credit card account to 0% as part of the 
resolution to this complaint.
Our Investigator didnt think NatWest needed to do anything further here. But Mr G didnt 
agree and asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an Ombudsman.
Mr G has provided screenshots from both a credit website (which Ill call C) and NatWests 
own app. They consistently record that he recently missed a payment on the mortgage 
account, usually one month ago. I asked NatWest about this. It confirmed that Mr Gs 
account is in arrears, that hes maintaining the arrangement to pay and isnt missing 
payments. NatWest says its reporting this correctly to the three main CRAs. 
NatWest says it doesnt have control over how the CRAs report this data. It explained that 
the information displayed on NatWests app is taken from just one of the CRAs. This is the 
same CRA which C takes data from. NatWest confirmed that its app simply displays the 
information from the CRA and is not NatWests interpretation of Mr Gs credit file.
NatWest says it has checked with the CRA, which has responded that it is correctly reporting 
the information which NatWest is providing to it. NatWest says the CRA explained that the 
information displayed to Mr G is an accurate reflection of how the data is treated from a 
credit scoring perspective and that an arrangement to pay doesnt alter a customers 
payment status within its customer reporting. But Mr G remains unhappy about the 
information on his credit file and says its affecting his credit score.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr G accepts that his account should be reporting as being in an arrangement to pay. Im 
satisfied that NatWest is reporting this to the CRAs, so I dont find there to be any error in 
that respect.
The main issue here is the reference to missed payments. Im satisfied that Mr G is not 
missing payments on the account. NatWest accepts that he is not missing payments. But 
both C and the NatWest app are regularly recording that he is behind with a payment. This is 
generally presented as him having missed a payment one month ago, although the most 
recent screenshot Ive seen says that Mr G last missed a payment three months ago. Ive 
considered whether this is caused by a mistake on NatWests part. I dont think it is and Ill 
explain why.
Im satisfied that NatWest is not reporting missed payments to the CRAs. It is reporting that 
the account is in arrears, which is correct. The information Ive seen shows that all the CRAs 
(of the three which NatWest reports to) are recording that the account is in an arrangement 
to pay. One simply records the arrangement to pay whereas the others also record that the 
account is in arrears. The CRA from which C and the NatWest app take their data records 
that the account is in arrears and in an arrangement to pay. 
NatWest has suggested that the term missed payment may be being used to reflect the 
fact that payments on the account are more than one month behind, that is, that the account 
is in arrears by more than one contractual payment. It says that the account would first show 
as having a missed payment when the amount overdue is at least as much as one 
contractual payment. It says that this will continue to show as missed until the full amount of 
the arrears has been cleared, even if payments are made on time. 
I think thats a reasonable explanation. I think its likely that the reference to missed 
payments is linked to the payment status which is being recorded by the CRA. From the 
information Ive seen, it looks as though the payment status of Mr Gs account is that 
payments are more than three months behind and new repayments have been agreed to 
bring the account in order. The payment status appears to have been reported in this way 
since around July 2021, which is when the repayment plan was agreed. Im not looking at the way the CRAs record the information, as theyre not part of this 
complaint. Im only looking at what NatWest has done here. Im satisfied that its reporting 
the account correctly as being in arrears with an arrangement to pay in place and that Mr G 
is making the monthly payments. It isnt reporting missed payments.
Mr G has queried why the missed payment comment fell away for July and August 2021 
when NatWest corrected his credit file. I havent seen anything which confirms the reason for 
this. But I find it most likely that any change in the data for those months could have been a 
result of amendments by NatWest in response to the complaint about the Direct Debit in July 
2021. The complaints team said they would check in September 2021 that the account was 
reporting as being in an arrangement and that they would make any amendment needed. I 
think its possible that, if they saw a reference to missed payments or arrears, the complaints 
team might have removed those for July and August to ensure that Mr G wasnt adversely 
affected by the Direct Debit being taken in error. 
If Mr G remains unhappy about the way the account is being recorded, I suggest that he 
makes further enquiries of the CRA. Im only looking at NatWests actions here, not at how 
the information is interpreted or recorded by the CRAs. I think NatWest has tried to help in 
explaining the references to missed payments on the app and on Cs website. NatWest 
offered a further £100 to resolve this complaint and I think that was fair. But I dont think 
NatWest is reporting the account incorrectly, so I dont think it needs to do anything more.
My final decision
National Westminster Bank Plc has already made an offer to pay a further £100 to settle the 
complaint and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances. So, my decision is that 
National Westminster Bank Plc should pay £100 to Mr G.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 January 2023.
