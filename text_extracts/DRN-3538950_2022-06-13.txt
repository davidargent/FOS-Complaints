The complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) incorrectly registered 
defaults to his credit file. Mr B also feels NatWest lent him money irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr B held an account with NatWest. He also held an overdraft facility on the account, which 
was taken out in July 2014, with a limit of £25,000. Within a short period of time, Mr B had 
spent almost all his overdraft facility. Mr B says that he was in financial difficulty. NatWest 
says a default for the account with the overdraft was registered in October 2015.
Mr B says the bank subsequently gave him a loan of around £22,500 in August 2015 and 
that NatWest registered another default for the loan account in August 2016. He says he 
was unable to get a mortgage at a reasonable interest rate as a result of the defaults and 
that NatWest shouldnt have lent him the additional £22,500. Mr B wished to have the 
defaults removed from his record and so complained to NatWest.
NatWest responded explaining that the loan applied for in August 2015 of around £22,500 
was a consolidation loan to repay the overdraft facility Mr B held on his account. They say 
the notes they hold indicate it was to refinance bank debt. As a result of receiving the loan, 
NatWest say they intended to remove Mr Bs overdraft facility. But NatWest say that Mr B 
transferred the funds from the loan to a third-party account, before the overdraft was closed. 
NatWest say they advised Mr B at the time that this would have an impact on his credit file 
and that they would need to send his account to their recoveries department. NatWest 
believe the defaults applied to Mr Bs credit file were done correctly after the required 
notifications were sent to him.
NatWest also believe that they lent to Mr B by following their lending criteria at the time. 
They say they used information provided by Mr B, as well as review data from credit 
reference agencies, among other things.
The investigator found that NatWest acted responsibly when lending to Mr B in August 2015. 
She explained that NatWest made it clear to Mr B that the loan was to consolidate debt, and 
as he had moved the funds elsewhere, she felt it was reasonable that NatWest applied a 
default on his account.
Mr B disagreed with the investigators view. He says that he had a variety of health issues as 
a result of the stress the borrowing incurred. Mr B believes NatWest shouldnt have given 
him access to the funds of the loan as he was in financial difficulty and had a mental health 
condition.
As Mr B disagreed, the complaint was passed to an ombudsman.
I issued a provisional decision on 27 May 2022 where I explained why I intended to not 
uphold Mr Bs complaint. In that decision I said:
Did NatWest irresponsibly lend to Mr B?
Weve set out our approach to unaffordable/irresponsible lending complaints on our website 
 including the key relevant rules, guidance, good industry practice and law. Ive considered 
this approach while deciding Mr Bs complaint.
NatWest needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. This means it needed to carry out 
proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr B could afford to repay the amount it was 
lending. A proportionate check is dependent on a number of factors including  but not 
limited to  Mr Bs particular circumstances (e.g. his financial history, current situation and 
outlook, and any indications of vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount / type / cost 
of credit obtained.
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify that 
information  in the early stages of a lending relationship. But we might think it needed to do 
more if, for example, a borrowers income was low, the amount lent was high, or the 
information the lender had  such as a significantly impaired credit history  suggested the 
lender needed to know more about a prospective borrowers ability to repay. Ive carefully 
thought about what this means for Mr Bs case.
Mr B says he had defaulted on previous credit provided to him on an overdraft facility he 
took out with NatWest and so they shouldnt have lent to him. Mr B also says that he had a 
mental health condition during the time NatWest lent to him. 
In this case, NatWest provided Mr B with a loan for £22,436 in August 2015. This loan had 
an APR of 14.6% and the total amount repayable of around £29,000 was due to be repaid in 
48 monthly instalments of around £610. 
NatWest says it agreed Mr Bs loan by following their lending criteria at the time. They say 
they used information provided by Mr B, as well as review data from credit reference 
agencies, among other things. NatWest has provided me with their records of the loan 
application. Having reviewed it, I cant see Mr Bs salary or income recorded, nor can I see 
clear details of an income and expenditure completed. I also cant see clearly that a credit 
check had been completed for Mr B. So, from what I have seen, I cant be certain that 
reasonable and proportionate checks were completed by NatWest at the time the loan was 
taken out.
In addition, NatWest had access to Mr Bs current account statements. And the funds from 
this loan were provided to consolidate the current accounts debt. Ive taken a look at Mr Bs 
current account statements for the months prior to the loan application being approved. 
Having looked at Mr Bs spending and account habits around the time the loan was taken 
out, I can see he had regular money coming into his account. On a number of occasions, 
these were significant amounts. His regular fixed monthly expenditure was around 25% of 
his monthly income. From what I can see, Mr B had more than enough disposable income to 
make the loan repayments each month. So even if NatWest had considered the account 
statements in further detail, I think it would still have been fair to lend to Mr B.
So, in these circumstances, while I have doubts as to whether NatWests checks did go far 
enough, bearing in mind what the purpose of the loan was for and their intention to close Mr 
Bs overdraft facility, I dont think NatWest treated Mr B unfairly or unreasonably when 
providing him with the loan.Ive also looked at whether NatWest was aware or ought to reasonably have been aware, 
that Mr B could be in financial difficulties by reviewing his use of his account. And if so, 
whether it was appropriate for NatWest to apply any interest, fees and charges.  
Once a lender is aware a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, we would expect it to 
exercise forbearance and due consideration, in line with its regulatory obligations. Ultimately, 
wed expect a lender to listen to a borrower, get an understanding of their circumstances and 
then assess the most appropriate way to move forward. 
NatWest must also monitor their customers repayment record and take appropriate action 
where there are signs of actual or possible repayment difficulties.
I feel it is important to point out the purpose of Mr Bs loan. I have seen notes that indicate 
the loan was taken out to refinance debt. NatWest has also told us that the loan was 
provided on a consolidation basis to repay the overdraft facility Mr B held on his account with 
them. Given the amount of the loan being similar to the amount of overdraft credit previously 
taken out by Mr B, I think it is more likely than not the purpose of the loan was to consolidate 
debt into a more affordable option for Mr B. So I think NatWest ought to have been 
reasonably aware that Mr B may have been in financial difficulty given it was providing him 
with a consolidation loan to reschedule his existing debt onto more affordable terms.
Having said this, one of the ways in which a lender can provide forbearance and due 
consideration is by refinancing existing debt onto more affordable terms. Generally, overdraft 
facilities are for short term emergency borrowing needs, and can lead to high costs and fees. 
So in this case, I think its fair to say that NatWest supported Mr B by attempting to remove 
the overdraft facility and putting in place a consolidation loan. Having reviewed the account 
statements, Im satisfied the rescheduled terms were affordable to Mr B. And by 
rescheduling the debt, this would have prevented further overdraft interest and fees being 
applied to the account.
So Im satisfied NatWest responded to Mr B with forbearance and due consideration once it 
was aware that he was in financial difficulty.
Im also sorry to hear Mr B had a mental health condition during the time NatWest lent to 
him, but it doesnt automatically mean that NatWest has done anything wrong. I cant see 
that NatWest was aware of this at the time, so I dont think it would be fair to ask NatWest to 
have reasonably acted on information they werent made aware of.
I now turn to whether I think it was fair for NatWest to register defaults on Mr Bs accounts.
In its Principles for the Reporting of Arrears, Arrangements and Defaults at Credit 
Reference Agencies, the Information Commissioners Office says a business can register a 
default after a customer is behind with their repayments for three months. And that it expects 
a business to register a default by the time a customer is six months behind with their 
repayments. I consider this to be representative of good industry practice. And as a 
minimum would expect a lender to act in accordance with these principles when deciding 
whether to default a consumers account. 
Id also expect a default notice to be given to a customer, telling them to pay any arrears by 
a deadline (usually, around 30 days). If a customer doesnt pay the arrears by the deadline, 
then a business can default the account and record it as such with credit reference agencies.
So Ive kept this in mind when deciding whether NatWest acted fairly and reasonably in 
relation to this matter.Default applied to Mr Bs account with an overdraft
Having seen Mr Bs account history around the time the default was registered and for the 
months prior, I cant see regular payments made to NatWest to clear overdraft funds he had 
used.
So, I dont think it was likely Mr B was keeping up with any payments he was required to 
make to clear the overdraft facility he held on his account.
While NatWest hasnt provided a copy of the default notice they say was sent to Mr B, I have 
seen internal notes NatWest has provided me. Within them, it says  21/09/2015 ----- 
formal demand sent for [Mr Bs account number]
On balance, I think its likely the default notice was sent to Mr B on this date for this specific 
account. So, I think its more likely than not that NatWest has registered a default on Mr Bs 
account correctly on this occasion.
Default applied to Mr Bs loan account
It's worth noting that I have seen NatWests internal notes and having reviewed them, its 
clear they had taken a slightly unorthodox approach to how Mr Bs loan account was 
handled. This is because NatWest say that after the loan was credited to Mr B to repay his 
overdraft facility and consolidate his debt, he transferred the money out of his account. This 
resulted in Mr Bs falling back into his overdraft. The notes indicate that Mr B was aware of 
the need to have his overdraft paid immediately, within a few months, rather than over years 
as the bank couldnt allow this to remain indefinitely. So, while Mr Bs loan repayments were 
up to date, NatWest believed the account needed to be moved to their recoveries 
department. 
NatWest also say that they advised Mr B at the time, of the impact this would have on his 
credit file and that his account would be sent to their recoveries department. From what I 
have seen, I think it is more likely than not Mr B was aware of this at the time.
NatWest say the default for the loan account was registered in August 2016. So there is an 
argument for saying that NatWest didnt default the account in line with good industry 
practice. Having said that, I still dont think it was unfair or unreasonable for NatWest to 
report a default to credit reference agencies when it did. I say this because, from what I can 
see, NatWest made it clear to Mr B of its intention and the reasons why. They told Mr B in 
various communications what the funds were for and the implications if it wasnt repaid. And, 
I cant see that Mr B had repaid what he owed until much later than when NatWest expected 
to be paid back by.
So overall I dont think NatWest treated Mr B unfairly or unreasonably when providing him 
with his loan and for registering the defaults to his credit file. I appreciate this will be very 
disappointing for Mr B. but I hope hell understand the reasons for my intended decision and 
that hell at least feel his concerns have been listened to.
I gave both parties the opportunity to send me any further information or comments they 
wanted me to consider before issuing my final decision.
Responses to the provisional decision
Neither NatWest nor Mr B responded to my provisional decision.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As I didnt receive a response to my provisional decision, I see no reason to depart from it.
So, in this instance, I wont be asking NatWest to do anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 July 2022.
