K821x#15complaint
Miss T has complained about short-terms loan granted to her by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid. Miss T says she couldnt  afford these loans and that QuickQuid 
didnt take appropriate steps to check whether she could afford them  when she took them  out. 
background
QuickQuid agreed ten short-term loans for Miss T between October 2016 and July 2017. 
The loans ranged from £100 to £1,000 and were  due to be repaid over between  one and 
three months. On four of these loans, Miss T took a top-up. This is where she took out 
further borrowing  under  the same agreement, before paying back the initial amount 
borrowed. She also re-financed one of these loans, taking out additional  borrowing, and 
rescheduled the term and repayments accordingly.  Ive set out a summary of lending  below.

One of our adjudicators has looked into Miss Ts complaint already and recommended the 
complaint be upheld in part. He thought the checks QuickQuid carried  out across  all of 
Miss Ts applications werent proportionate.  And he thought that had QuickQuid carried out 
proportionate checks, it wouldve seen that loans 2  10, including the top-ups on those 
loans wouldve been unaffordable for Miss T, and would not have agreed to them.
Miss T raised  no objections  to the view.  QuickQuid responded further,  disagreeing with the 
assessment. So the case has come  to me, as an ombudsman,  for a final decision. 
As loan 1 no longer seems to be in dispute, my decision  will focus  on the remaining loans   
loans 2  10, and the subsequent top-ups and re-finances. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time.  
Ref: DRN85556892QuickQuid initially said it carried out appropriate and proportionate affordability assessments, 
including validation of Miss Ts income  and expenses before funding all these loans. Its said 
it started implementing changes to affordability assessments in June  2014  and all the 
changes were completed by 28 February  2015.
And that starting  1 March  2015, before Miss T borrowed her first loan, it had implemented an 
affordability review that was consistent with the FCA Handbook and was in place at the time 
it received authorisation by the FCA. And that its assessment was conducted properly and 
individually for each of these  applications.
I can see that the adjudicator addressed these points in her view.  She said:
 
Ive looked at everything both sides told me and I note what  you've said about the loans
Miss T borrowed  from 2015 onwards, however our job is to look not only into the rules
and regulations set by the regulator at the time of borrowing but also the law, good  industry
practice and all the available evidence and arguments to help us decide whether we think
what the business has done  is right or not. In this case I don't think  you were right to provide 
Miss T with some of the loans she borrowed from 2015 onwards.
I fully agree with this point. This service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic 
argument directly and through earlier final decisions.  So I am not going to expand  on this 
point any further  here,  though I have considered it alongside everything else in making my 
decision. 
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  in 
how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
So my decision will focus on the specifics of Miss Ts complaint and what  both parties have 
said about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Miss T borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in 
mind the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business (PRIN) and its Consumer 
Credit Sourcebook  (CONC),  I would expect a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect QuickQuid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
Ref: DRN85556893In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
Turning to the specifics of Miss Ts complaint, when she took out her second loan with 
QuickQuid she borrowed £500.  And this was the same day she repaid the final amount due 
on the loan 1 of £496.  The new repayment  on loan 2 was for £624, which accounted  for a 
significant proportion  of Miss Ts declared monthly  income of £1,616.  
Given the size of the monthly repayment  on loan 2, and how soon Miss T had come  back  to 
borrow further funds  after repaying loan 1, I think at this stage QuickQuid needed to do more 
to satisfy itself that Miss T could meet the repayments on this loan sustainably, by looking 
specifically into whether she owed any monies to any other short-term lenders.
Had it done so, I think  it wouldve seen that Miss T owed over £400 to other  short-term 
lenders, and over £100 a month to an instalment provider when at the time she applied  for 
loan 2. Which,  when deducted  from her declared monthly income  of around £1,616,  along  
with the £775 of regular  monthly outgoings QuickQuid had recorded, wouldve left her with a 
disposable monthly income of £400 at the time she applied for loan 2. 
The repayment on loan 2 was for £624.  So had QuickQuid carried  out proportionate checks, 
it wouldve  seen that at the time Miss T applied for loan 2, she had insufficient disposable 
monthly income available  to sustainable repay this loan, and as a responsible  lender, I dont 
think it wouldve approved  her application  knowing this.
Miss T re-financed loan 2, just two days after taking out the initial advance, and borrowed  a 
further £150. This increased the loan term to three months, and subsequently increased the 
highest repayment due to £814. So, for the same reasons I think QuickQuid shouldve  seen 
Miss T was unable to afford the repayment  on loan 2 for £624,  I think  proportionate checks 
wouldve shown that this re-finance  wouldve also been unaffordable  for her, and as a 
responsible lender, would  not have  agreed  to this either. 
Miss T repaid loan 2 early, just two days after re-financing  it, but around two weeks after 
doing so was back borrowing further  money from QuickQuid. This time taking out a loan of 
£600. 
This loan was repayable over two months,  and the highest instalment was around £740.  
Given both the frequency,  and the increasing  amounts Miss T was borrowing,  I think by now,  
QuickQuid shouldve become concerned about  Miss Ts possible reliance on this type of 
lending, and from this point on shouldve built a full picture  of Miss T financial circumstances, 
and verified the information  it received before agreeing to lend any further.
Miss Ts provided  bank  statements from around the time of the above applications. So Ive 
used these, and all the other evidence provided by both parties, to work out what I think 
QuickQuid wouldve found out, had it carried out proportionate checks  at the time Miss T 
applied for loans 3  10.
Ref: DRN85556894When Miss T applied for loan 3, QuickQuid initially recorded her monthly income  as £1,616  
and her outgoings as £275, which included £50 on her living costs, £75 on utilities,  £50 on 
transport and £75 on food, as well as £25 listed as other expenses. I can see that 
QuickQuid further  inflated  these outgoings  from the results of a check it said it ran.
But having  looked at the evidence provided, the amendments QuickQuid have made  to 
Miss Ts disposable monthly income appear inadequate to account for her expenditure at the 
time. From what Ive seen,  I think its likely  proportionate checks wouldve shown QuickQuid 
that Miss Ts regular  monthly living costs alone were almost  £1,300  - considerably more than 
the £50 QuickQuid recorded. This included costs such as; £500 a month on rent, around 
£250 on food,  and £100 on council  tax. As well as a further £300  on her bills including costs 
such as: electric, gas, water, mobile phone,  car insurance, and television costs.  
I think QuickQuid wouldve also seen from a full review, that Miss T had around £250  a 
month due in repayments on her regular credit commitments, and was due to repay around 
£150 to other short-term  lenders at the time she applied for loan 3. 
So from the checks I think QuickQuid  shouldve carried out, it wouldve its likely concluded 
that with living costs of almost £1,300;  and total credit commitments  of around £400, that 
Miss Ts monthly  outgoings were already in excess of her monthly income of around £1,617, 
and that she was not in a position  to be able to make any further repayments to additional  
creditors at this time. So as a responsible  lender, I think it would not have  agreed  to loan 3, 
or the subsequent top-up  on this loan either, had it carried out proportionate checks. 
Miss Ts financial  circumstance  remained relatively  unchanged throughout the period she 
applied for loans 4  10. Her income remained around £1,616 a month, decreasing  to 
around £1,530  from December  2016. And her monthly living  costs  fluctuated  between  
£1,200 and £1,300  a month. While  her regular monthly credit  commitments remained steady 
at around £251  a month. 
But throughout November 2016  to July 2017,  Miss T also seemed to owe between 
£146 - £653 to other short-term lenders at the point of each loan application. Which meant 
her disposable  monthly  income ranged from between negative  -£53,  to negative -£593 
throughout this time.
So proportionate checks shouldve shown QuickQuid that at the times Miss T applied for 
loans 4  10, her monthly expenditure already exceeded her monthly  income, and she was 
in no position  to commit to any further credit repayments. And I think  that as a responsible 
lender, it would not have agreed to loans 4  10, or any of the associated  top-ups or 
re-finances of these loans knowing this. 
In summary,  I dont think the checks QuickQuid carried out from loan 2 onwards were 
proportionate. And I think that had it carried out proportionate checks, it wouldve concluded 
that loans 2  10 wouldve been unaffordable for Miss T, and would not have agreed to any 
of these loans,  or the associated top-ups or refinances. 
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
For the reasons  outlined  above, I think QuickQuid should not have agreed to loans 2  10 for 
Miss T, including the top-ups and re-finances of these loans. So it needs to refund all of the 
interest and charges Miss T paid towards these.
Ref: DRN85556895Specifically, it should:
refund the interest and charges paid for the loans it agreed  between October 2016 and 
June 2017,including the top-ups and re-finances  on these loans on these loans 
pay interest on these  refunds at 8% simple from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement
remove any adverse  payment  information  about these loans from Miss Ts credit  file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
QuickQuid should  also:
remove all the interest and charges  added  to loan 10 agreed  in July 2017  from the 
outset. I understand this will leave an outstanding balance, so QuickQuid can deduct this 
balance from what it now needs  to pay Miss T above, if it still owns the debt.
If, after all of the above has been actioned, a balance remains  outstanding, a mutually 
agreeable repayment plan should  be arranged. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Miss Ts complaint in part. 
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 April 2019
