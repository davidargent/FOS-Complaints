The complaint
Mr M complains about two loans provided to him by Madison CF UK Limited, trading as   
118 118 Money, (118 118), which he says were unaffordable. 
What happened
118 118 agreed two loans for Mr M. Loan 1 was for £1,000 and was taken out in     
December 2020. Loan 2 was for £3,000 and was taken out in January 2022. From the most 
recent information Ive seen, it appears that Loan 2 hasnt been repaid. Some of the 
information 118 118 provided about the loans is shown in the table below.

2. 15/1/2022 Unpaid £3,000 £212.78 24
Mr M says that he is in great financial difficulties due to the loans. 
Our adjudicator recommended that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld. He said that the 
results of 118 118s checks showed that Mr M was already paying over £1,900 towards his 
regular credit payments for Loan 1 and over £3,000 for Loan 2. Both of these figures were 
much higher than those 118 118 had used in its calculations and both represented a 
significant proportion of his income. In these circumstances, the adjudicator said there was a 
significant risk that Mr M wouldnt have been able to meet his existing commitments without 
having to borrow again. And on both occasions, he would have been left with a negative 
disposable income. So, the adjudicator thought it was unlikely that Mr M wouldve been able 
to sustainably meet his repayments for either loan, and the decisions to lend were unfair.
118 118 disagreed and responded to the adjudicators view by querying his calculations of 
Mr Ms credit commitments. The adjudicator forwarded his calculations to the lender. The 
lender responded to say that whilst 118 118s credit checks showed the payment frequency 
as weekly, the balance movement was reflective of monthly payments. 118 118 also said 
that an ombudsman in another case with the same lender had noted that confusion had 
been caused in that case as the credit report showed the credit commitments as weekly. But 
the same credit report also showed the total commitments as a monthly figure. The lender in 
that case had treated the repayment amount as a monthly commitment and the ombudsman 
thought it was right to do so. 118 118 asked for Mr Ms complaint to be referred to an 
ombudsman.
As this complaint hasnt been resolved informally, it has been passed to me, as an 
ombudsman, to review and resolve. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry 
practice at the time. 
118 118 has referred to another decision of this Service. However, as 118 118 knows, we 
assess each case on its own merits.
When 118 118 lent to Mr M, the regulator was the Financial Conduct Authority and relevant 
regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit Sourcebook. 
118 118 will be aware of the relevant regulations and how we consider irresponsible lending 
complaints, so I wont go into detail on these points. 
Ive thought about whether 118 118 completed reasonable and proportionate checks when 
assessing Mr Ms applications to satisfy itself that he would be able to make his repayments 
without experiencing adverse consequences. Ive thought about the information it knew, and 
what it ought reasonably to have known.
Loan 1
Loan 1 was for £1,000. I note that 118 118 gathered some information about Mr Ms income, 
rent and expenditure. It also carried out a credit check.
118 118s application details show Mr Ms income as £2,286, his rent as around £326, and 
his living costs as around £506. 118 118 said it assessed Mr Ms credit expenditure from his 
credit file and it said his monthly credit commitments were £578. 
Ive reviewed 118 118s credit checks. I note that these showed that Mr M had 13 active 
credit accounts and his total credit balance was around £10,100. I think the results of       
118 118s credit checks ought to have caused it some concerns as Mr M appears to have 
taken out seven loans totalling almost £3,000 in the seven months prior to the loan 
application. I can also see that the balance on Mr Ms credit card was just four pounds short 
of its credit limit. Mr M had also missed a payment around two months prior to the loan 
application on a high cost long term loan. I think the credit checks suggest that Mr Ms 
finances were under pressure. 
I also note that there was some confusion over whether the credit repayment amounts 
shown in the credit checks were weekly or monthly. At the very least, I would have 
reasonably expected 118 118 to have taken steps to gather more information about Mr Ms 
actual monthly repayment amounts if these were ambiguous from the credit checks. 
In addition as Mr Ms finances appeared to be strained from the credit checks, I think B 
needed to verify Mr Ms income and actual monthly regular expenditure to gain a more 
thorough understanding of his financial position in order to satisfy itself that he could repay 
the loan without having to borrow again. 118 118 didnt say that it took steps to do this.
Mr M was entering into a significant commitment with 118 118. He would need to make 
monthly repayments of around £106 for 12 months. Given the length of time Mr M was 
committing to repay the credit and what 118 118 would have likely seen on its credit checks, 
I dont think its checks were sufficient for 118 118 to get a clear picture of Mr Ms finances at 
the time. 
But although I think 118 118 should have asked for some additional information before 
agreeing the loan, that in itself doesnt mean that Mr Ms complaint should succeed. Id also need to be persuaded that any further information would have suggested to 118 118 that   
Mr M couldn't repay the loan without the repayments having a significant adverse impact on 
his financial situation. 
I note that the adjudicator reached his conclusions about the high amount of Mr Ms credit 
commitments after reviewing 118 118s credit checks. The lender queried the adjudicators 
calculations as it thought that the adjudicator had used some weekly rather than monthly 
repayment amounts in his calculations. I thought obtaining Mr Ms current account 
statements from around the time of the loans would provide a more accurate picture of his 
monthly credit commitments. So, I asked the adjudicator to ask Mr M to provide his current 
account statements  from around the time of the loans. Ive reviewed these to give me the 
best picture of what the lender should have seen, although Im not suggesting here that 
these are the checks that 118 118 should have done. I also asked the adjudicator to ask     
Mr M for some more information about his financial situation.
Ive reviewed Mr Ms current account statements for October 2020 and November 2020. It 
appears that his average monthly income was around £1,968. The statements suggest that 
Mr M was struggling to manage his finances. He was repaying at least three payday loans, a 
high cost credit loan, two credit union loans and a loan from a friend. Some of the credit was 
being repaid weekly. Ive calculated that the monthly credit commitments were around 
between £1,530 and £1,900 in those months and so represented a significant proportion of 
Mr Ms income. I also note that in October 2020, Mr M had taken out a new payday loan for 
£150 and hed also taken out a loan of £500 from a credit union in the following month to 
support his income. And I can see from the statements that the total of Mr Ms credit 
commitments and identifiable regular living costs exceeded his monthly income in both 
months. 
So, if 118 118 had carried out further checks, I think its likely it would have discovered the 
full extent of Mr Ms financial commitments which were much higher than the amount it had 
used in its calculations. I think 118 118 ought reasonably to have realised that Mr M was 
over committed financially and that he was having significant difficulties managing his 
finances. I think there was a very real prospect that Mr M would need to borrow again in 
order to repay his new loan and that would likely have a significant adverse effect on his 
financial situation.
So, I think 118 118 should reasonably have concluded that it made an unfair lending 
decision when it agreed to lend Loan 1 to him.
Loan 2
I can see that Mr M repaid Loan 1 in December 2021 and the following month he borrowed  
Loan 2 which was for the higher amount of £3,000. The new monthly repayment had more 
than doubled and was to be repaid over two years.
118 118s application details show Mr Ms income as £2,177, his rent as around £242, and 
his living costs as around £603. 118 118 said it assessed Mr Ms credit expenditure from his 
credit file and it said his monthly credit commitments were £877. 
Ive reviewed 118 118s credit checks. I note that these showed that Mr M had 13 active 
credit accounts and his total credit balance was around £9,600. I think the results of the 
lenders credit checks ought again to have caused it some concerns as Mr M appears to 
have taken out seven loans, including short term loans, totalling around £13,600 in the       
12 months prior to the loan application. I can also see that hed taken out two credit cards in 
that period and was borrowing cash advances on those cards which might suggest that his financial situation was strained. He was also still repaying loans borrowed in previous years. 
Again, I would have reasonably expected 118 118 to have taken steps to gather more 
information about Mr Ms actual monthly repayment amounts if these were ambiguous from 
the credit checks. 
I think the credit checks suggest that Mr Ms finances were still under pressure and I would 
have reasonably expected 118 118 to have taken steps to verify Mr Ms income and actual 
monthly regular expenditure to gain a more thorough understanding of his financial position 
in order to satisfy itself that he could repay the loan without him having to borrow again.   
118 118 didnt say that it took steps to do this.
Mr M was entering into a significant commitment with 118 118. He would need to make 
monthly repayments of around £213 for 24 months. Given the length of time Mr M was 
committing to repay the credit and what 118 118 would have likely seen on its credit checks, 
I dont think its checks were sufficient for 118 118 to get a clear picture of Mr Ms finances at 
the time. 
Ive gone on to consider whether further information would more likely than not have shown 
118 118 that Mr M would be able to make the loan payments over the loan term without 
adverse consequences.
Mr M provided his bank statements from around the time of Loan 2 to this Service. Ive 
reviewed these for November 2021 and December 2021. I can see that his financial situation 
was, if anything, worse than at the time of his application for Loan 1. Most of the credit was 
being repaid weekly. Ive calculated that the total regular monthly credit commitments were 
at least around £1,900 in those months and so again represented a significant proportion of 
Mr Ms income. And again, I can see that Mr Ms credit commitments and identifiable living 
costs were greater than his monthly income. Hed also taken out further short term loans 
totalling £900 to support his income. 
So, if 118 118 had carried out further checks, I think its likely it would have discovered the 
full extent of Mr Ms financial commitments which were much higher than the amount it had 
used in its calculations. Again I think 118 118 ought reasonably to have realised that Mr M 
was over committed financially and that it was unlikely that Mr M wouldve been able to 
repay Loan 2 without him having to borrow to meet the repayments, without him failing to 
make any other repayment he had a contractual or statutory duty to make, and without the 
repayments having a significant adverse effect on his financial situation. 
So, I think 118 118 should reasonably have concluded that it made an unfair lending 
decision when it agreed to lend Loan 2 to Mr M. 
So, Im upholding Mr Ms complaint and 118 118 should put things right as follows.
Putting things right  what 118 118 needs to do
I understand that Mr M has repaid Loan 1, and that Loan 2 hasnt been fully repaid. 
If 118 118 has sold the outstanding debt it should buy this back if it is able to do so and then 
take the following steps. If it isnt able to buy the debt back, then it should liaise with the new 
debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards interest, fees and
charges on Loan 1.
B) Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr M which were
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr M originally made the payments,to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on Loan 2, and treat any 
repayments made by Mr M as though they had been repayments of the principal on Loan 2. 
If this results in Mr M having made overpayments, then 118 118 should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the 
overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 118 118 should then 
refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should
be used to repay any balance remaining on Loan 2 and any principal 118 118 has already        
written-off. If this results in a surplus, then the surplus should be paid to Mr M. However, if 
there is still an outstanding balance then 118 118 should try to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with Mr M. 118 118 shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of 
principal it has already written-off.
E) Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ms credit file in relation to the
loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 must 
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement of this complaint, I 
order Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, to take the steps set out above 
under the heading Putting things right  what 118 118 needs to do. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2022.
