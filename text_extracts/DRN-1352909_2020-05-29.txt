The complaint
Mr S says MYJAR Limited irresponsibly lent to him. Mr S has said he couldnt afford the loan 
repayments and as a consequence got into further debt which has led to financial hardship.  
What happened
This complaint is about 11 short-term loans MYJAR provided to Mr S between November 
2014 and July 2018. Mr Ss borrowing history is as follows:

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ss complaint and thought the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been given. 
MYJAR disagreed with the adjudicator and also thought that because of the gap between 
loan eight being repaid and loan nine being taken, the complaint should be considered as 
two chains of lending.As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me to decide in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MYJAR should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr S didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to three shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing relationship Mr S had with MYJAR. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
First, I should say that I dont agree with MYJAR there were two chains of lending. Loan nine 
was taken out seven months after loan eight was repaid. But because of the length of time 
Mr S had been borrowing from MYJAR  over three years when he applied for loan nine  I 
dont think its reasonable for MYJAR to have assumed that Mr S had overcome whatever 
financial circumstances had caused him to take high-cost credit in the first instance. A break 
in a chain of lending in effect, starts the clock ticking again on what we would consider to be 
proportionate checks a business should carry out when taking into account the length of the 
borrowing relationship with a consumer. So, Ill be considering all of the loans as one chain 
of lending. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of MYJARs lending history with Mr S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
four. I say this because:
At this point MYJAR ought to have realised Mr S was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr S had taken out four loans within seven months. So MYJAR 
ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr S was having to borrow further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances. And it ought 
to have realised that Mr Ss indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mr Ss first loan was for £100 and loan four was for £300.  At this point MYJAR ought 
to have known that Mr S was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing need. 
 
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR. Loan 11 was 
taken out three and a half years after Mr Ss first. And it was for a larger amount and 
over a longer term. Mr S had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a 
debt to MYJAR over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr S lost out because MYJAR continued to provide borrowing from loan four 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ss ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans four to 11 and MYJAR 
should put things right.
Putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans four to 11;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 
the number of loans taken from loan four onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans four to 11 should be removed from 
Mr Ss credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ss complaint. MYJAR Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 June 2020.
