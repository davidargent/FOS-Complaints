The complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt do enough to protect 
him from becoming the victim of a scam and hasnt reimbursed him for his loss.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. The 
facts are not in dispute, so Ill give a brief summary and then focus on giving reasons for my 
decision.
Mr P was the victim of a scam in 2019 which led to him losing over £4,000. NatWest didnt 
think it had made an error in following Mr Ps payment instructions. It also said Mr P was out 
of time to raise a chargeback. But, in any event, it noted that the payments were made to 
payment processing companies whose only responsibility was to transfer funds to an          
e-wallet, which it said they did.
Our investigator considered this complaint. She didnt think the payments were large enough 
to trigger NatWests fraud systems, or that they were significantly unusual or out of 
character. And she noted the payments were made to legitimate companies  so didnt think 
NatWest was wrong in not pursuing a chargeback.
Mr P disagreed so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
As the payments were authorised, the starting position would be for NatWest to allow 
the transactions. But there are some situations where Id expect NatWest to have 
been alerted to something not being quite right. In this case, however, I dont 
consider the payments to have been high enough to have triggered NatWests fraud 
systems  with the highest payment being £933.34. I also dont think these payments 
were significantly unusual or uncharacteristic when compared with Mr Ps normal 
activity prior to these payments. So, I dont think it would be reasonable to have 
expected NatWest to intervene with these payments on this basis. 
Mr P said he didnt deal directly with the companies showing on his statements. But 
when considered along with the above, NatWest would have had no indication that 
he was dealing with anyone other than these companies, as this is who the payments 
were made to. And given that these were legitimate companies, there werent any 
applicable warnings, such as on the Financial Conduct Authority register, that 
NatWest should have been aware of in relation to these payments.
Mr P didnt speak with NatWest when making these payments, so I cant see that it 
missed an opportunity to identify the payments were linked to a scam.
NatWest has said the chargeback claim was made out of time. But I also 
acknowledge that the payments were made to legitimate companies, which provided 
the intended services  the purchase of cryptocurrency. So I dont think NatWest was 
unreasonable in not pursuing these claims further. 
For these reasons, I dont think NatWest missed an opportunity to protect Mr P from 
becoming the victim of scam. Nor do I think it acted in error in relation to the attempted 
recovery of funds. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint about National Westminster Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2022.
