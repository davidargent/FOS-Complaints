The complaint
Mr B complains that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, lent to him irresponsibly by giving him a 
credit card and later increasing the limit of what he could borrow using the card.  
What happened
Mr B took out a credit card with NewDay in May 2016. The initial credit limit was £900.
In December 2016 NewDay increased the amount Mr B could borrow to £1,550. It increased 
the credit limit again in April 2017 to £2,550.
Mr Bs credit limit was then reduced to £650 from September 2017.
Mr B complained to NewDay in late 2019 that it had lent to him irresponsibly. He said it 
should not have provided the credit card to him as he was over extended at the time of 
applying, which NewDay shouldve identified, as well as having a serious gambling problem. 
He also questioned why NewDay hadnt restricted his access to credit, as his problems with 
gambling had continued for some time and hed also fallen into arrears on his credit card 
frequently.
NewDay said it didnt think it had made a mistake by providing the credit card as, based on 
the information provided by Mr B when he applied, he met its lending criteria. It also noted it 
was unaware of his gambling issue at that time. And it also felt the first increase to his credit 
limit had been appropriate. But it said, having reviewed the second limit increase, in light of 
the information Mr B had now provided about his situation, it didnt think this shouldve been 
granted. As a result, it refunded charges (totalling £216) and interest (£28.60) to the account. 
NewDay also paid Mr B £85 for any upset caused.  
Mr B then raised with NewDay that, when it had sent him its final response, it hadnt paid the 
postage correctly. So, hed had to pay to have the letter released to him. I can see that 
NewDay then refunded the amount for postage to Mr Bs credit card along with a further £10 
for the inconvenience.
Mr B then asked our service to consider his complaint as he didnt think the offer made by 
NewDay, in respect of his complaint about the lending decisions, went far enough. 
I understand the outstanding balance was repaid in full in March 2020 and the credit card 
account closed.
One of our investigators considered Mr Bs complaint. She felt that the initial decision to 
provide the credit card was reasonable. But she felt that the decision to grant both of the 
credit limit increases was inappropriate. So, she recommended that NewDay refund all 
excess charges and interest applied from the point the credit limit increases took effect.
NewDay did not agree with the investigators opinion as it still felt the first credit limit 
increase had been fairly assessed and granted. 
As NewDay did not agree with the investigators opinion, the complaint has been passed to 
me to make a final decision on the matter.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Businesses are required to make sure that, where they agree to lend, they do so 
responsibly. How they go about determining this is a matter of their own judgement  as 
there arent set requirements of what a business must do in every instance. But generally, it 
is expected that they will carry out appropriate and proportionate borrower focused checks, 
taking account of the applicants financial situation, before lending.
NewDay has provided a copy of the information it says it relied on when it initially provided 
the card. This included income information provided by Mr B and details of the amount of 
borrowing he held with other financial businesses, obtained from credit reference agencies. 
So, the reviews carried out prior to lending seem to relate to information specific to Mr B and 
I think were borrower focused.
Mr B has said he had significant borrowing elsewhere and has provided a copy of his credit 
report to support this. I can see that he did already have borrowing with several different 
lenders. But the information NewDay has shown it relied upon also reflects this, so I think it 
considered this. And already having borrowing does not mean further lending is necessarily 
irresponsible. Mr Bs recent credit report, and the information NewDay obtained at the time, 
suggest Mr B wasnt behind with any of his borrowing at the time. And in the context of the 
income information he provided, I dont think there was any indication that the new card from 
NewDay would be, or make the other borrowing, unaffordable.
Mr B has mentioned that the majority of the existing debt was as a result of gambling. But 
the information NewDay got from credit reference agencies wouldnt show this. And as he 
had no other accounts with NewDay, it couldnt have observed this from other accounts. So, 
it couldnt have known about Mr Bs situation unless he had made it aware  and I havent 
seen anything to suggest he did before the card was agreed.
With all of this in mind, and given the relatively modest credit limit initially agreed, I dont 
think NewDay acted unreasonably when agreeing to provide the credit card to Mr B, or that it 
acted irresponsibly when doing so.
Turning to the decision to increase Mr Bs credit limit to £1,550 in December 2016, NewDay 
has again provided evidence to show it relied on information from credit reference agencies 
to show how much outstanding borrowing Mr B had elsewhere. It has said it didnt obtain up 
to date information about Mr Bs actual income though and instead used an estimated figure 
for his disposable income. NewDay has indicated this is in line with its usual processes. Im 
not commenting on the processes NewDay chooses to use. Im simply looking at whether, 
on a fair and reasonable basis, I think it did enough to check that the lending decision here 
was appropriate.
Mr B had held the credit card for six months at the point this proactive increase to the credit 
limit was granted by NewDay. Immediately after the card was first provided, in the space of 
five days, Mr B had used the full credit limit for spending  specifically gambling. And in fact, 
had exceeded the credit limit. And the account had remained over its credit limit for the first 
three months. And then, when the balance had been brought under his credit limit, the 
payments made by Mr B were the minimum monthly ones required.
I think that the account immediately exceeding its credit limit and remaining there for three months shouldve prompted NewDay to do more when considering whether further lending 
was affordable  as I think these represent potential warning signs in terms of affordability. 
And I dont think using estimated data around what Mr B could afford went far enough here. 
So, I dont think NewDay did enough to check that the decision to increase the borrowing 
available to Mr B, by over 70%, was appropriate. NewDay has said it gave Mr B the 
opportunity to opt out of the credit limit increase. But giving this option doesnt excuse or 
allow a business to lend in an unaffordable way.
And I think, if NewDay had done further checks, as it should have, it is unlikely it wouldve 
increased the credit limit. As Ive said, the usage of the account  which was data now 
available to NewDay  showed that all of the spending had been in relation to gambling. And 
while that is not prohibited, it ought to have prompted NewDay to potentially make further 
enquires. And the amount Mr B owed to other creditors had increased significantly between 
the initial decision to provide the card and this subsequent credit limit increase. So overall, I 
dont think NewDay acted responsibly by increasing Mr Bs credit limit to £1,550.
In respect of the later increase of the credit limit to £2,550, NewDay has already said in its 
final response that it didnt think this was appropriate. So, I dont intend to comment much 
further on this point other than to say I agree with NewDay, for largely similar reasons to why 
I dont think the first credit limit increase was appropriate.
So overall, I think there have been errors here by NewDay. While I think the initial decision to 
provide the credit card was appropriate, I think the checks it carried out in relation to the later 
increases to the credit limit didnt go far enough. And if further checks had been carried out, I 
think that additional lending wouldve been deemed unsuitable and NewDay would not have 
provided it  so wouldnt have increased the available credit from £900 to £2,550. 
So, Ive thought about what NewDay should do to put that right.
As Ive mentioned, I understand the credit card account is now closed, and there is no 
outstanding balance due. So, there is no balance to be reduced, and therefore any 
recommendation I make would be a refund to Mr B of amounts paid previously.
I dont think itd be reasonable to ask NewDay to refund the principal amount borrowed by 
Mr B through spending on the card. But I do think the costs incurred, associated with the 
additional lending that wouldnt have been granted without the errors I mentioned, should be 
refunded.
So, I think NewDay should refund all interest and charges applied to Mr Bs credit card, on 
balances above £900, from December 2016 onwards. 
Ive seen evidence that some of this has already been refunded when NewDay dealt with the 
original complaint. So, this does not have to be refunded again. Im also conscious the 
information Ive seen indicates that balance on the account only exceeded £900 for a period 
of two months, and has since remained significantly below that level  particularly as the 
credit limit was reduced to £650 from September 2017 onwards. With this in mind I think 
NewDay should provide Mr B with a summary of how it has calculated the refund it makes.
Ive thought about whether NewDay should pay interest on top of the amount to be refunded. 
And I think it would be right to do so. Mr B made a large payment to the account in March 
2017 that brought the balance well below £900. If the credit limit increases hadnt taken 
place, the level of payment hed have needed to make at that time wouldve been less. So, 
Mr B has been without money he wouldnt otherwise have had to repay, since that time, so I 
think itd be fair for NewDay to pay interest, equivalent to 8% per year, on top of the amount 
refunded from March 2017 onwards. In the case of the amount it refunded when handling the original complaint though, I think itd be fair for NewDay to only pay interest on that 
amount, from March 2017 to the point the refund was made.
Turning to Mr Bs argument that NewDay shouldnt have allowed him to continue to use his 
card, due to him gambling regularly, I dont think NewDay has done anything wrong. Ive not 
seen anything that indicates that Mr B made NewDay aware of his situation before he 
complained about the lending decisions  with the last significant spending taking place on 
the account in early 2018. And so, I dont think it wouldve been fair for NewDay to prevent 
Mr B from using his card - as gambling transactions are not prohibited and as Ive explained 
I dont think it made an error in providing the card. Im also conscious that NewDay did in fact 
reduce Mr Bs credit limit from £2,550 to £650 in September 2017  limiting the amount of 
spending that could take place. So, for these reasons, I dont think NewDay has made an 
error by not closing or blocking the account sooner.  
My final decision
For the reasons given above my decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint in part.
To put things right NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, should;
Calculate the amount of interest and fees Mr B paid on his credit card on all balances 
over £900, following the increases to his credit limit in December 2016, and refund 
this amount to him.
NewDay can deduct the amount it has already refunded directly to the card from this 
amount.
NewDay should pay interest equivalent to 8% per annum on this amount from March 
2017 to the point the refund(s) is / were made. 
NewDay should send a copy of the calculation of the above to Mr B for reference.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 July 2021.
