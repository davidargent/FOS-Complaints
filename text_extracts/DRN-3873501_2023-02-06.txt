The complaint
Mr H has complained that U K Insurance Limited trading as Privilege (UKI) unfairly cancelled 
his car insurance policy. 
What happened
Mr H bought a car insurance policy with UKI in January 2022. In July 2022 he called UKI as 
Mr H owed a monthly premium. He asked to make a partial payment. The agent accepted 
the partial payment. The agent asked Mr H when he could make the balance payment. He 
said the 16th (July). The agent told Mr H that he needed to call back and pay the balance 
payment by the agreed date of 16 July 2022 or his policy would be cancelled. 
Mr H didnt call back and on 18 July 2022 he called as hed received an email from UKI 
confirming his policy had cancelled. He said hed made arrangements a couple of weeks 
before for the deadline to pay to be extended to 22nd July 2022. 
The agent agreed to listen to the key call and call Mr H back to discuss. 
UKI didnt call Mr H back and on 1 August 2022 he raised a complaint. 
UKI upheld the complaint that it had failed to call Mr H back when promised. For this it paid 
him £20 compensation. 
But it said it had correctly cancelled the policy - as in a call on 12 July 2022 it said it had 
made it clear that the policy would cancel if he didnt make the balance payment by 16 July 
2022. 
Mr H asked us to look at his complaint. He provided copy letters sent by UKI after 16 July 
2022 which asked him to pay a balance by 31 July 2022 to prevent his policy from being 
cancelled. He said he felt misled by UKI. 
Our Investigator issues two views. In the first view she thought UKI had caused confusion 
and misled Mr H by its letters after 16 July 2022 - as they gave a deadline of 31 July 2022 to 
make payment and to prevent the policy from being cancelled. And UKI had incorrectly told 
Mr H he had cancelled the policy, when he hadnt. 
For this the Investigator recommended UKI pay Mr H a further £100 compensation, remove 
any record of the cancellation and offer Mr H the option to reinstate the policy. 
UKI didnt agree. It asked the Investigator to listen to the key call on 12 July 2022. 
The Investigator did so and issued a second view. She thought UKI should still pay Mr H 
compensation of £100 for the confusion it caused by its letters after it cancelled the policy on 
16 July 2022. But she thought UKI had made it clear in the phone call on 12 July 2022 that 
the policy would be cancelled if Mr H didnt call by 16 July 2022 to make the balance 
payment. As Mr H didnt call UKI by this date to make payment, she thought UKI had 
correctly cancelled the policy - and Mr H was aware this would happen. So she no longer 
recommended UKI remove the record of cancellation, or offer Mr H the reinstatement of the 
policy. 
UKI agreed with the Investigators second view. Mr H didnt agree. He says UKI misled him 
by the letters it sent after 16 July 2022 and this is unfair. He wants UKI to remove the 
cancellation record as this is affecting his ability to buy insurance. 
So the case has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive listened to a recording of the call between Mr H and UKI on 12 July 2022. Mr H called 
UKI to discuss an overdue payment following a letter he received dated 1 July 2022. In this 
letter UKI said Mr H would need to bring the policy up to date by 15 July 2022 to prevent it 
from being cancelled. 
Mr H asked if he could make a partial payment on 12 July 2022. The agent agreed - and 
asked Mr H when he would be able to make the balance payment. Mr H gave a date of 16 
July 2022. 
I think UKIs agent was very clear in this phone call. She told Mr H that he needed to call 
back by 16 July 2022 to make the balance payment - if he didnt the policy would be 
cancelled. Mr H confirmed his understanding and thanked the agent for her help. 
However, Mr H didnt call back by 16 July 2022 and he didnt pay the balance payment. So I 
cant say that UKIs decision to cancel Mr Hs policy was incorrect or unfair. 
I can understand why Mr H is upset about receiving letters dated 17 and 18 July 2022 from 
UKI which gave a deadline of 31 July 2022 to make a balance payment to prevent the policy 
from being cancelled. This was clearly an error on UKIs part.
For the confusion caused by its error, I think UKI should pay compensation to Mr H. But I 
dont think this error means UKIs cancellation of Mr Hs policy on 16 July 2022 should be 
reversed. This is because I think UKIS actions up to the cancellation date were reasonable. 
I understand that Mr H is very upset about the consequences the cancellation of the policy 
has had on his ability to afford a replacement policy. But I think UKI has treated Mr H in a fair 
way and how it would treat any other customer in the same circumstances. If Mr H had 
called and made payment by 16 July 2022, UKI wouldnt have cancelled his policy. 
I think UKI should pay compensation of £100 for the confusion it caused by its letters sent 
after 16 July 2022 - and by incorrectly advising Mr H that hed cancelled the policy when he 
hadnt. 
I appreciate this isnt the outcome Mr H wants - but I think its a fair outcome overall.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I require U K Insurance Limited 
trading as Privilege to pay Mr H £100 compensation in addition to the £20 its already paid for 
the confusion it caused by its communication after it cancelled the policy on 16 July 2022. 
U K Insurance Limited trading as Privilege must pay the compensation within 28 days of the 
date on which we tell it Mr H accepts my final decision. If it pays later than this it must also 
pay interest on the compensation from the date of my final decision to the date of payment at 
a simple rate of 8% a year.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 March 2023.
