The complaint
Mr O complains about the service he received from National Westminster Bank Plc
(NatWest) surrounding the closure of his accounts and demand for repayment of his
overdraft.
What happened
Mr O held a number of accounts with NatWest. Some were personal accounts and some
were business accounts. In 2021, NatWest decided to close some of the accounts. It wrote
to Mr O to give him notice of this.
Mr O says that NatWest didnt agree to him using a switching service to switch to a new
provider. So he says he had to transfer all the direct debits and standing orders manually. As
this was a significant task, he says he had to employ someone to help him, at a cost to him.
One of the accounts had an overdraft and NatWest required this to be repaid in full when the
account was closed. Mr O wasnt able to do that and he says he repeatedly tried to contact
NatWest to discuss the situation. He says he told NatWest that he was struggling financially
and wanted to agree a repayment plan. But he says that NatWest never got back to him
about it, so nothing was put in place. He says that NatWest continued to apply interest and
charges to the account and is still doing so.
Mr O says that, as he couldnt repay the overdraft in full and no repayment plan was agreed,
NatWest defaulted the account and referred it to a debt collection agency which Ill call D. He
says this negatively affected his credit score and that adverse information about the account
on his credit file led to a mortgage application being declined. He has explained that this
borrowing was part of an important re-financing deal for his business. He says it fell through
because of the adverse reporting by NatWest and that he has incurred significant losses as
a result. These include having to arrange bridging finance and a new deal at a higher rate of
interest, as well as expenses relating to the original application.
In January 2022, a third-party business which Mr O works with paid around £5,000 into one
of his accounts by mistake. Ill call this business H. H attempted to recall the funds but
needed Mr Os authority to do this. Mr O says he called NatWest and asked for the payment
to be returned to H. He also wrote to NatWest in February 2022 asking for the funds to be
returned to H, but NatWest didnt do so.
Mr O complained to NatWest and later referred the complaint to this service. NatWest
acknowledged that it hadnt been in touch with him to set up a repayment plan, despite him
contacting it several times. It accepted that this was a mistake on its part. At that stage, Mr
Os account was reporting as being three months in arrears and NatWest said it would
remove this adverse data.
NatWest also agreed that Mr O had been given incorrect information by one of its advisors
about the status of his accounts. Overall, NatWest agreed it could have handled things
better. It offered Mr O £100 as an apology for the distress and inconvenience caused, but Mr
O declined this offer.
NatWest asked Mr O to contact D about the credit from H, which he did. But D said they
couldnt release the funds and told him to contact NatWests Recoveries department, which
then referred him to another team. NatWest accepted that it had made further mistakes by
giving Mr O incorrect information about who to contact. It sent him a cheque for £50 as an
apology.
But Mr O remained unhappy about the situation. He explained how it had affected him and
his business, causing a great deal of stress and ultimately impacting his health. He said hed
had no support from NatWest. 
I issued a provisional decision on 13 October 2022 indicating how I thought NatWest should 
resolve this complaint, to include paying Mr O further compensation of £500. NatWest 
accepted my recommendations. But Mr O was disappointed with the provisional decision. He 
said that £500 isnt reflective of the losses he has suffered, which he says run into tens of 
thousands of pounds. Mr O maintains that NatWests entries on his credit file were the 
reason the mortgage application failed. He has provided some further information and asked 
me to reconsider the redress. 
When responding to the provisional decision, both parties confirmed that the mistaken 
payment from H had been returned several months ago. So Im not going to comment on 
that in this decision and I have removed the direction for NatWest to return that payment.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at everything again and carefully considered the new information from Mr O. Im 
sorry to disappoint him, but my thoughts about the appropriate outcome here are largely 
unchanged from my provisional findings. My reasons are set out below.
The terms and conditions of Mr Os account allow NatWest to close it by giving him at least
60 days notice. Whilst Mr O wasnt happy about the accounts being closed, he doesnt
dispute that NatWest was entitled to take this step. So Ive focused here on what happened
after notice was given, rather than on NatWests decision to close the accounts.
Repayment of the overdraft
Under the terms and conditions, Mr Os overdraft is repayable on demand. Upon closure of
the account, the overdrawn balance has to be repaid, together with any interest due for
using the overdraft. So I dont find that NatWest acted unfairly by asking for the overdraft to
be repaid in full.
But Mr O says he was struggling financially and wasnt able to repay the outstanding
balance in full. The Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) says that a lender should treat
any consumer in financial difficulty with forbearance and due consideration. Id expect
NatWest to have treated Mr O with appropriate forbearance here, but Im not satisfied it did.
NatWest has acknowledged that it didnt get back to Mr O to discuss a plan, despite him
making contact several times. It said in its first final response letter that it would contact Mr O
to arrange a repayment plan, but that this wouldnt happen until the account was actually
closed (that is, some time after the 60 day notice period but on a timescale which NatWest
couldnt confirm). It said that, during this time, NatWest wouldnt be able to discuss a
repayment plan with Mr O. In effect, NatWest was declining to engage with Mr O for a periodof over 60 days about repayment of the debt which it had called in while continuing to charge
interest on the debt, knowing that Mr O couldnt pay in full and wanted to agree a repayment
plan. I dont think that was reasonable.
NatWest then defaulted the account without trying to come to an arrangement with Mr O and
passed his account to a debt collection agency. I dont think that was fair and it put Mr O in a
worse position. Further interest and charges had accrued, negative information was being
recorded on his credit file and he had the ongoing uncertainty and stress about how the debt
would be repaid.
Id expect NatWest to have engaged with Mr O to get an understanding of his
circumstances. It could have asked about his income and expenditure. And it should have
discussed what help was appropriate. It didnt do this and I dont think it treated him fairly.
Interest
Mr O says that NatWest is still applying interest and charges to his account. I understand
that NatWest treated the account as defaulted from November 2021 (when it was initially
transferred to the Recoveries department). I dont think any further interest or charges
should have been applied from that point. When responding to the provisional decision, 
NatWest said that none were applied from November 2021 onwards. I dont doubt what 
NatWest says, but I havent seen any documents which confirm it. So Im going to keep the 
direction for NatWest to remove any interest or charges which were applied after this date, 
on the basis that if none were applied there wont be any to remove.
I think the account should be put back into the position it was in at the beginning of
November 2021, so far as interest and charges are concerned. NatWest should then engage
with Mr O about repayment of the outstanding balance. The parties will need to work
together to come to an agreement which is affordable for Mr O, taking account of his
circumstances. Given the history here, I think that NatWest should provide Mr O with the
name and direct contact details of an individual within NatWest who is fully aware of this
case and who has authority to reach agreement with him about how the debt will be repaid. 
Looking at the situation impartially, I think its fair to say that if an arrangement had been
agreed before November 2021, NatWest may reasonably have continued to apply interest to
the outstanding balance. Once the account has been re-set as Ive outlined above, it may be
reasonable for NatWest to charge interest on the outstanding balance going forward, in line
with its terms and conditions. But that will depend on what is fair and reasonable in light of
Mr Os current financial situation, which the parties will need to discuss in order to come to
an arrangement. It is of course open to the parties to negotiate a settlement involving a lump 
sum payment, as opposed to repayment by instalments. That is a matter for the parties and 
not something for me to decide.
Mr Os credit file
Following on from the above, I think NatWest also needs to remove the adverse entries from
Mr Os credit file. Mr O says these are still being recorded. For the avoidance of doubt, I 
think all adverse entries to date should be removed. If Mr O and NatWest now agree a 
repayment plan, Mr O should be aware that this will be noted on his credit file and any failure 
to keep to the arrangement going forwards will have an adverse impact. 
Effect of the adverse entries to date
Mr O says it was the negative reporting by NatWest which caused his mortgage deal to fall
through. Im satisfied that NatWest was already reporting missed payments on the accountby the time the mortgage application was made in January 2022. Mr Os broker asked about
it the day before the application was made. The application passed the automated stage of
the process but was ultimately declined in March 2022. Mr O says that the lender had been 
happy to proceed having seen evidence that NatWest would remove the adverse reporting. 
But he says the lender changed their mind because NatWest didnt remove the adverse 
entries and continued the negative reporting. 
The emails provided by Mr O show that the lender was willing to proceed at the end of 
January 2022 after receiving an explanation of the credit file entries. NatWest sent a final 
response letter on 2 March 2022, which was passed on to the lender. In that letter, NatWest 
confirmed that it would remove the adverse data from Mr Os credit file. It said it would check 
on 30 March 2022 that this had been done. The mortgage application was declined on 4 
March 2022. Mr O says the lender had previously been satisfied with the explanation about 
the adverse entries. The letter from NatWest confirmed this explanation. So I think its likely 
there were other factors which influenced the lenders decision. And the timing of the 
rejection means it cant have been down to negative entries by NatWest after March.
The credit report Mr O provided shows three or four adverse accounts being reported.  And 
the email from his mortgage broker asked him about missed payments on his credit file, 
including a recent one with NatWest. I said in my provisional decision that this suggests 
there were other missed payments which werent with NatWest. Mr O has confirmed that 
there were other missed payments but says these were triggered by NatWests 
mismanagement of his account closures, meaning some direct debits and standing orders 
didnt transfer correctly. Hes provided evidence of one such issue with a business which Ill 
call C, who agreed to remove a missed payment marker it had recorded. But I havent seen 
details of the other missed payments. I cant safely conclude that it was NatWests fault they 
were missed.
Mr Os mortgage broker has confirmed that the NatWest entries were one of the 
fundamental issues that ultimately made the underwriter uncomfortable to lend (my 
emphasis). Mr O says this comment relates to the direct debits and standing orders which 
werent transferred correctly, as above. 
I understand that the parties involved cant say for certain that it was the NatWest entries 
which caused the mortgage deal to fail, although Mr O is adamant that they were the cause. 
But I cant reasonably ask NatWest to pay the costs associated with the mortgage 
application unless Im satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that NatWests mistakes caused 
the losses and there werent other factors which contributed to the lenders decision. I cant 
conclude that from the information Ive seen. 
I note that the borrower under the failed mortgage deal was a limited company, not Mr
O himself. Mr O says it isnt unusual for lenders to look at a directors personal situation 
when assessing a mortgage application and I think thats understandable. Ive considered Mr 
Os comments about this. But I still think there could have been several other factors 
relevant to the lenders decision, not just Mr Os personal credit file. In any event, I think that 
some of the losses Mr O is seeking to recover may have been suffered by his business 
(rather than him personally) and the business isnt a party to this complaint.
On balance, I still find it likely that there were other issues which affected the application, not 
just the NatWest reporting. I cant safely conclude that the application would have 
succeeded but for the adverse entries about the NatWest account. So Im not going to ask 
NatWest to reimburse Mr O for the financial losses he says hes suffered as a result of the 
application being declined.
Other lossesI understand that Mr O has incurred costs employing someone to deal with the
administrative side of the account closures and the wider issues around that. But Im not
going to ask NatWest to meet those costs. Thats because NatWest was entitled to close the
accounts in the way it did, so there was always a possibility that the administrative tasks
associated with this would be necessary.
Compensation
In light of the issues outlined above, I think NatWest needs to pay some compensation to Mr
O for the distress and inconvenience he has suffered. He has described the stress this 
situation has caused and how it has affected his health. I dont think NatWest treated Mr O 
fairly or showed appropriate forbearance. It didnt deal effectively with the problems he was 
complaining about and gave him wrong or inconsistent information on numerous occasions. 
NatWest knew that Mr O wanted to resolve matters, but it didnt contact him and just allowed 
the situation to drift. This has added to the distress for Mr O and caused the matter to be 
prolonged. He has had to spend a great deal of time pursuing it, all the while knowing that 
his credit file was being impacted and that the debt remained outstanding.
But Im making an impartial decision, so I think the above issues have to be balanced
against the fact that NatWest closed the accounts within the terms and conditions and the
overdraft was repayable on demand. Even if NatWest had engaged with Mr O and a
repayment arrangement had been agreed early on, its likely there would have been some 
negative impact on his credit file as it would have been noted that there was an arrangement 
to pay in place. I think its also relevant that Mr O didnt make payments towards the 
outstanding balance at the time. I understand that he was waiting for NatWest to agree a 
repayment plan. But the fact that there wasnt a plan in place didnt prevent him from making 
payments if he was able to do so, particularly as he says the consequences of the debt 
remaining outstanding were so significant for his business.
In the circumstances, I think NatWest should pay Mr O £500. I realise he will be 
disappointed with this and Im sorry for that. But I think its a fair amount of compensation to 
reflect the distress and inconvenience he has experienced. 
Other issues
Mr O says he would like a clear indication of what accounts are open and what accounts are
closed. I think thats reasonable, so Im going to ask NatWest to provide this.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc should:
remove any interest and charges which were applied to Mr Os overdrawn account
from November 2021 onwards;
ask the Credit Reference Agencies to remove the adverse entries from Mr Os credit
file;
provide Mr O with the name and direct contact details of an individual within NatWest
who is fully aware of this case and who has authority to reach agreement with him
about how the debt will be repaid;
pay compensation of £500 to Mr O; and
provide Mr O with written confirmation of the status of each of his accounts, whether
open or closed, together with the current balance.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 December 2022.
