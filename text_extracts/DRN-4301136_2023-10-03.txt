The complaint
Mr W is unhappy with the service hes received from National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) surrounding his Bounce Back Loan (BBL).
What happened
Mr W had a BBL with NatWest which was set up receive payments from Mr Ws NatWest 
business current account. In March 2022, the NatWest business current account was closed 
at Mr Ws request, with the money present in the account at the time of closure being moved 
to Mr Ws personal savings account. This meant that no arrangement was in place to make 
the BBL payments, and the BBL subsequently fell into arrears.
NatWest wrote to Mr W in June 2022 and apologised for not informing him that standing 
orders cant be set up from a NatWest personal savings account. NatWest also confirmed 
that Mr W would need to set up a standing order to pay the BBL from a different account and 
explained that they had credited Mr W with the total of the missed BBL payments to enable 
him to clear the full arrears that had accrued. 
But Mr W didnt clear the BBL arrears or make the monthly payments required on the loan 
following NatWests complaint response in June 2022. So, the BBL arrears continued to 
grow. NatWest wrote to Mr W about this in August 2022. This prompted a further complaint 
from Mr W as he felt that NatWest should have set up a standing order for him themselves 
as a part of the resolution to his earlier complaint. NatWest didnt uphold Mr Ws complaint 
and reiterated to him that he needed to act to clear the BBL arrears and set up a standing 
order to ensure that future BBL payments were made. 
Again, Mr W didnt set up a standing order or clear the account arrears. So, in September 
2022, with the BBL five months in arrears, NatWest issued a formal demand and defaulted 
the BBL for non-payment. Mr W wasnt happy with how NatWest had administered his BBL, 
and so raised another complaint.
NatWest responded to Mr W and said that they didnt feel that theyd done anything wrong 
by defaulting the BBL for non-payment. Mr W wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so 
he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel that NatWest had acted 
unfairly towards Mr W and so didnt uphold the complaint. Mr W remained dissatisfied, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I note that Mr W has provided several detailed submissions to this service regarding his 
complaint. Id like to thank Mr W for these submissions, and I hope he doesnt consider it a 
discourtesy that I wont be responding in similar detail here. Instead, Ive focussed on what I 
consider to be the key aspects of this complaint, in line with this services role as an informal 
dispute resolution service. 
 
This means that if Mr W notes that I havent addressed a specific point hes raised, it 
shouldnt be taken from this that I havent considered that point  I can confirm that Ive read 
and considered all the submissions provided by both Mr W and NatWest. Rather, it should 
be taken that I have considered that point but that I dont feel it necessary to address it 
directly in this letter to arrive at what I consider to be a fair resolution to this complaint.
Mr W feels that, when NatWest wrote to him in June 2022, in resolution of his earlier 
complaint, that NatWest should have set up standing order at that time to ensure that he 
didnt miss any further BBL payments. But a standing order is an instruction given to a bank 
by an account holder. And NatWests complaint response makes it clear that Mr W would 
need to set up a standing order himself from an appropriate account of his choosing. 
Additionally, at the time of Mr Ws earlier complaint, his BBL was three months in arrears. 
NatWest credited Mr Ws personal bank account with the cumulative total of these three 
months arrears to enable him to make the necessary payment to bring the BBL up to date. I 
think it was reasonable for NatWest to expect Mr W to set up the standing order himself and 
I think their explanation of what was needed was clear. But Mr W didnt do this.
Mr W was given another opportunity to put things right in August 2022, when NatWest wrote 
to him and explained that the previously existing account arrears hadnt been cleared and 
that a further BBL payment had now been missed. However, rather than clearing the 
cumulative arrears and setting up a standing order as was required of him, Mr W raised 
another complaint because he felt that NatWest should be doing these things for him. 
NatWest rejected this complaint, and Im satisfied it was fair and reasonable for them do so. 
NatWest then defaulted Mr Ws account for non-payment in September 2022. NatWest had 
informed Mr W on several occasions leading up to this point that he was required to clear the 
BBL arrears and set up a standing order for the future monthly loan payments. But W 
repeatedly failed to do this. And because of this, I dont feel that NatWest acted unfairly by 
defaulting the BBL as they did.  
Ultimately, I consider it was Mr Ws responsibility as the BBL account holder to ensure that 
the BBL payments were made and that any account arrears were cleared. And I dont feel 
that its reasonable for Mr W to claim that NatWest are at fault here because NatWest 
themselves didnt take the action that theyd clearly explained to Mr W was required of him.
All of which means that I dont feel that NatWest have done anything wrong or acted unfairly 
here. And it follows from this that I wont be upholding this complaint. I realise this might not 
be the outcome Mr W was wanting. But I hope that hell understand, given what Ive 
explained above, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 October 2023.
