Ms E complains  that Portafina LLP (formerly Portal Financial Services  LLP) wrongly advised 
her to transfer her Group Personal  Pension (GPP) to a Self-Invested  Personal  Pension 
(SIPP) in 2014. 
background
I issued a provisional decision on 9 July 2020. Ive recapped the background below:
Ms E was referred to Portafina  by a third party  for a free pension  review. Shes said this 
happened after she was cold called. 
At the time Ms Es circumstances and pension provision were recorded  as follows:
She was 38 years  old and single
Shed  been  unemployed  for two years  and was receiving Job Seekers Allowance 
She was a homeowner with £33,000 outstanding on her mortgage
She was £17,000  in debt, in a debt management  plan and had no disposable  income
She had £400  in savings and £700  invested  in Stocks and Shares 
She intended to retire  at age 60; her only retirement provision was the paid up GPP 
shed held with her former  employer
Portafinas fact find dated 14 November 2013 and suitability letter  dated  20 November 2013 
said, amongst other things:
Ms Es objectives for transferring were:
 
-To have  greater fund choice
-To have  better investment performance
-To switch to a cheaper scheme
Ms Es risk profile suggested  she had an Adventurous  attitude to risk (ATR)
To achieve Ms Es objectives,  Portafina recommended  she transfer her GPP  to a 
SIPP and invest in the following funds:
-Lakeview UK Investments  13.3%
-Marbella Resort & Spa  16.8%
-Real Estate Investments USA  18.2%
-Motion Picture Global Investments  8.4%
-Strategic Residential  Developments  13.3%
-CF Ruffer European- 5%
-Premier Multi Asset  Income  and Growth- 5%
-Invesco Perp Managed Income  Z Shares- 5%
-Cazenove Managed Portfolio-  5%
-Cash- 10%
Due to the amount of time that passed since  its original  advice, Portafina  changed its 
recommendation, advising Ms E to invest in the following funds:
Ref: DRN18144452-Lakeview UK Investments  16.67%
-Real Estate Investments USA  13.33%
-Strategic Residential  Developments-  10%
-CF Ruffer European- 16.4%
-Invesco Perp Managed Income  Z Shares- 16.78%
-Schrode MM Diversified  Balanced- 4.92%
-Premier Multi Asset  Income  and Growth- 16.9%
-Cash- 5%
Ms E agreed to Portafinas recommendations. In September  2014 the value of her GPP  
(£13,289.85) was transferred to a SIPP and invested.
As an initial fee Portafina was paid 5% of the total value  transferred to Ms Es SIPP. It was 
also agreed that Portafina would be paid 1% of the value of Ms Es SIPP  each year for its 
review service.
In November 2018, with the assistance of a claims management company (CMC),  Ms E 
raised a complaint against Portafina  about the suitability  of the 2014 advice shed received. 
Portafina responded to Ms Es complaint and didnt uphold it. It said the transfer and 
investments were suitable based on Ms Es circumstances  and objectives  at the time of its 
advice.
Unhappy with Portafinas response, the CMC representing Ms E referred her complaint to 
our service.  
One of our investigators  considered the matter and said that the complaint should  be upheld.  
In summary  she said:
The cost of switching  to the SIPP was high and coupled with ongoing charges, would 
reduce the amount of Ms Es fund invested . Any investment returns  would  need  to 
cover the cost of switching and ongoing  charges before any growth could be 
achieved
She disagreed  that Ms E was an adventurous investor. Given  Ms Es responses to 
the ATR questionnaire  and circumstances at the time, she felt Ms E shouldve been 
considered a balanced investor  at most 
The portfolio  of funds Portafina advised  Ms E to invest in presented  a degree of risk 
which was unsuitable given Ms E.
She thought  that, were it not for Portafina  contacting her, Ms E wouldve left her GPP  
where it was originally
Our investigator set out how she thought Portafina  should compensate  Ms E. 
Portafina accepted our investigators findings.  The CMC representing Ms E confirmed she 
was happy with the outcome but queried the settlement of the CMCs fee.
Our investigator responded, saying the payment of the CMCs fee was something that 
needed to be worked out between Ms E and the CMC directly. She confirmed her position 
on how Portafina should compensate Ms E wouldnt change.
Ms Es complaint was passed  to me for a decision. And my provisional  findings were as 
follows:
Ref: DRN18144453Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive come to the same 
conclusion as the investigator. I agree with her reasoning and Im upholding this complaint. 
Based on everything  Ive seen, Im not satisfied the advice Portafina gave Ms E was 
reasonable. 
Overall, I dont  think the product costs which resulted  from Portafinas  advice were justified. 
Nor do I think Ms E had the experience, knowledge or ATR to assess  or fully appreciate  the 
transfer or the investments  Portafina recommended. Ms Es circumstances  at the time of the 
advice indicate  to me that she didnt have  the capacity to bear the risk of loss the transfer 
and recommended funds represented. And I dont  believe she wouldve agreed  to the 
transfer and investment approach if shed  sufficiently understood them.
In addition to determining Ms Es capacity for loss for its recommendation as suitable,  
Portafina identified  her ATR as adventurous. The latter was based  on a risk profiling 
questionnaire she completed. Portafinas  Suitability Report described this as someone 
who:
Was usually an experienced investor  with high levels of financial knowledge 
Was usually willing to take a risk with most  of their available  assets 
Was able to make  up their mind on financial matters quickly
Although some of the answers  Ms E gave on the questionnaire indicated she was willing to 
take some  degree  of risk, I think other answers  shouldve led Portafina  to question whether 
the assessment  of her risk profile was correct. There were  clear inconsistencies with some 
of the answers  Ms E gave  and what Portafina  knew of her circumstances  at the time. For 
example, Ms E answered agree or strongly agree to the following statements:
Usually it takes me a long time to make  up my mind on investment matters
I find investment matters easy to understand
I tend to be anxious about  the investment decisions Ive made
I feel comfortable investing in property
I have little experience  investing in property
From what  Ive seen theres  no persuasive evidence Ms E was an experienced or 
adventurous investor. While the risk profiling  questionnaire may have  been  a useful starting 
point, I think Portafina  needed to use this as part of a wider  discussion about risk with Ms E; 
her answers needed to be considered  in the context of her overall circumstances.
At the time of Portafinas advice Ms E wasnt in a secure financial position. Shed been out of 
work for two years and was receiving  state benefits. Ms E was also in a debt management  
plan and had no disposable income.  Other than the house she owned (with an outstanding 
mortgage), it seems to Ms Es GPP was her most valuable asset. Apart from a nominal 
investment in stocks  and shares, Ms Es GPP  was the only other investment she held. It 
represented her entire retirement provision. 
As I understand it, Ms Es GPP had been  invested in a Lifestyle Fund  which would 
automatically switch to less risky underlying  asset  allocation in the run up to retirement. 
Along with Ms Es circumstances, this doesnt suggest to me Ms E was an adventurous 
investor who would and could readily take gambles with her money.  
Ref: DRN18144454Like the investigator, I dont think Portafinas  assessment  of Ms Es ATR or capacity for loss 
was an accurate appraisal of the investment risk Ms E was prepared or able to take with her 
only pension  fund.  Based  on what was known  about  her circumstances and lack of 
investment experience, I think it was more reasonable to conclude  that Ms E was a relatively 
cautious or at most, balanced investor . And on this basis,  I dont  think  she had the appetite 
or capacity  to accept  the level of risk Portafinas recommendation presented to her pension  
fund.
Within the investment portfolio Portafina  recommended, Ive seen that around 34% of Ms 
Es money  was invested in international equities and around 37% invested in property 
bonds. As a result, a significant proportion of Ms Es investments were either illiquid, abroad 
or unregulated; it appears some of the investments may have shared all three  of these  high-
risk characteristics.
I note that some of the recommended funds involved  investing in UK and overseas property 
development projects where the targeted returns were said to be up to 15% per annum. Risk 
and reward are inextricably linked, and in my view, investments offering that level of return  
can reasonably  be assumed  to be high risk. Especially at a time when interest rates  were  
generally quite  low.
I cant see that the potential failure  of Ms Es investments or risk of significant  capital erosion 
were sufficiently highlighted to her. But even if it was, like the investigator Im not satisfied  
the investment  portfolio Portafina recommended  was suitable. Disclosing the risks of the 
recommended Portfolio to Ms E wouldnt have made it suitable.
I think Portafina shouldve  known Ms E didnt have the knowledge  or experience  to make an 
informed assessment about the portfolio it was recommending or properly appreciate the 
risks of some of the investments. She was a retail investor, for whom  I dont consider 
subjecting a significant proportion of her only retirement provision to international exposure 
and property bonds, could reasonably be justified or deemed anything  but unsuitable. 
Ive also considered the charges Ms E needed to pay to switch  to a SIPP. Portafina recorded 
one of Ms Es objectives as moving  to a cheaper  pension arrangement.  It said that by 
following its recommendation, Ms E would meet this objective. But from what  Ive seen,  the 
SIPP wasnt  cheaper; the switch represented  a sizable reduction to Ms Es already modest 
transfer value.  And the ongoing SIPP charges were higher than her existing GPP. 
Portafinas initial fee was 5% of Ms Es transferred fund value  and its ongoing advice fee 
was 1%. The SIPPs annual management charge  (AMC) was 0.5%. Whereas for Ms Es 
GPP, the only cost she was incurring was a 0.9% AMC. 
Bearing in mind I think that Ms E was, at most, a balanced investor, I dont believe there was 
great prospect of making  up the cost of the switch via investment growth without taking 
significant investment  risks, of which she had no experience. And as Ive already said,  I dont  
believe the investment  approach Portafina  advised Ms E to take was suitable.  Im also 
mindful that Ms Es GPP,  which I consider was invested more in line with her ATR, had 
provided an average return of 7.87% per year over the 5 years up to the transfer. I think  
more appropriate  advice wouldve been  for Ms E to leave her GPP where it was. 
The justification Portafina provided  for Ms E switching to a more expensive  arrangement was 
so she could access the required funds.  But I havent seen anything  to suggest Ms E was 
unhappy with the fund her GPP was invested in or that she had experience  of or wanted to 
Ref: DRN18144455invest in the types  of funds Portafina later recommended. But even if she had, Portafina was 
advising Ms E and it was the expert;  it had a duty to act in her best interests. It was also 
reasonable for Ms E to rely on the advice and suitability  of Portafinas recommendation. 
As Ive already  said, I dont believe Ms Es experience or circumstances meant  that investing 
in the funds Portafina recommended, was a compelling need or appropriate. Even if I were 
to believe that switching to other funds was important to Ms E, I cant see that alternative  
options within her existing arrangement were explored by Portafina before being discounted. 
Ms E may have been curious about  the options  available with her pension,  but ultimately,  I 
think that her decision to consider this was mainly  as a result of contact  from the referring 
third party and Portafina.
Overall, like the investigator,  Im not persuaded the advice to transfer was suitable  or in Ms 
Es best interests. If Portafina had clearly explained the position in terms of Ms Es capacity  
for loss in her particular  circumstances, and the risks in this context, I dont think  she would 
have been likely to transfer or make the recommended investments. 
fair compensation
My aim here is to put Ms E as close to the position she would  probably  now be in if she 
hadnt been given unsuitable advice.
In my view Ms E wouldve  invested  differently. Its not possible to say precisely what  she 
would have done, but Im satisfied what Ive set out below is fair and reasonable given Ms 
Es circumstances  and objectives when she invested. 
I understand Ms Es CMC and Portafina have been in discussion about  the CMCs fee and 
any compensation payable. However,  like the investigator, I dont see any reason to depart 
from how this service  normally awards  compensation for complaints of this nature.  The 
matter of the CMCs  fee is something  Ms E will need  to resolve  with directly with her CMC.
what should  Portafina  LLP do?
To compensate Ms E fairly, Portafina must:
Compare the performance of Ms Es investment  with that of the benchmark  shown. If 
the fair value  is greater  than the actual  value, there is a loss and compensation is 
payable. If the actual value is greater than the fair value, no compensation is payable.
         Portafina should add interest  as set out below.
If there is a loss, Portafina should pay into Ms Es pension plan to increase its value 
by the amount  of the compensation and any interest.  The amount paid should allow 
for the effect of charges and any available tax relief.  Compensation should not be 
paid into the pension plan if it would conflict with any existing protection or allowance.
If Portafina is unable  to pay the compensation  into Ms Es pension plan, it should pay 
that amount  direct  to her. But had it been possible  to pay into the plan, it would have 
provided a taxable income. Therefore, the compensation  should  be reduced to 
notionally allow  for any income tax that would otherwise  have been  paid.  
The notional allowance should  be calculated using Ms Es actual or expected  
Ref: DRN18144456marginal rate of tax at her selected retirement age. 
For example, if Ms E is likely to be a basic rate taxpayer at the selected retirement 
age, the reduction would equal the current basic rate of tax. However, if Ms E would 
have been able to take a tax free lump sum, the reduction should be applied to 75% 
of the compensation.
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If Portafina deducts income tax from 
the interest,  it should tell Ms E how much has been taken off. Portafina should give 
Ms E a tax deduction certificate  if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from 
HM Revenue  & Customs  if appropriate.

actual value
This means  the actual amount payable from the investment at the end date. 
It may be difficult  to find the actual  value of the investment. This is complicated where an 
investment is illiquid (meaning it could  not be readily  sold on the open  market) as may be the 
case here. Where this applies, the actual value  should be assumed  to be nil to arrive at fair 
compensation. Portafina should take ownership  of any illiquid investment by paying  a 
commercial value acceptable to the pension provider. This amount should be deducted from 
the compensation and the balance paid as I set out above.
If Portafina is unable  to purchase the investment the actual value should be assumed to be 
nil for the purpose  of calculation. Portafina  may require that Ms E provides an undertaking to 
pay Portafina any amount  she may receive from the investment in the future. That 
undertaking must allow for any tax and charges that would be incurred on drawing the 
receipt from the pension  plan. Portafina will need to meet any costs  in drawing up the 
undertaking.
fair value
This is what  the investment would have been  worth at the end date had it produced  a return  
using the benchmark.
Ref: DRN18144457Any additional sum that Ms E paid into the investment  should  be added  to the fair value 
calculation at the point it was actually  paid in. 
Any withdrawal, income or other distribution out of the investment should be deducted from 
the fair value  calculation  at the point  it was actually paid so it ceases to accrue any return in 
the calculation  from that point on. If there is a large  number of regular  payments, to keep 
calculations simpler, Ill accept if Portafina  totals  all those payments  and deducts  that figure 
at the end instead of deducting  periodically.  
future SIPP  fees
If Portafina had given suitable  advice  Ms E wouldnt have the SIPP.  The SIPP  only exists 
because of the investments. In order for the SIPP to be closed (should Ms E wish to move  
her investment portfolio)  and further SIPP fees to be prevented, the investments need  to be 
removed from the SIPP.  Ive set out above how this might be achieved by Portafina  taking 
over the investments, or this is something that Ms E can discuss  with her SIPP provider 
directly. But I dont  know how long that will take. 
Third parties are involved, and we dont have  the power to tell them  what  to do. If any 
investment cant be removed, to provide certainty to all parties,  I think its fair that Portafina 
pay Ms E an upfront lump sum equivalent  to five years worth  of SIPP fees (calculated  using 
the previous years fees). This should provide  a reasonable  period for the parties  to arrange 
for the SIPP to be closed.
why is this remedy suitable?
Ive chosen this method of compensation because:
Ms E wanted capital  growth and was willing to accept some investment risk.
The FTSE UK Private Investors Income  total return index (prior to 1 March  2017, the 
FTSE WMA Stock  Market Income total return index) is made up of a range of indices  
with different asset classes,  mainly UK equities  and government bonds. Its a fair 
measure for someone who was prepared to take some  risk to get a higher return. 
Although it is called income index, the mix and diversification provided within the 
index is close enough to allow me to use it as a reasonable measure of comparison 
given Ms Es circumstances and risk attitude.  
I invited Portafina  and Ms E to respond  to my provisional decision. Both parties confirmed 
they accepted my provisional findings.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I see no reason to depart 
from my provisional decision.
I remain of the view that Ms Es complaint should be upheld  on the basis  I outlined in my 
provisional decision.
