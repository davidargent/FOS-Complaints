The complaint
Mrs W complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay), trading as Aqua, irresponsibly granted her 
credit that she couldnt afford to repay. 
What happened
NewDay approved a credit card application for Mrs W in November 2017. The credit limit 
was set at £900 and was never increased.
Mrs W says that NewDay were wrong to provide credit as it wasnt affordable for her.
NewDay disagree. They say that when they approved the credit card application they 
reviewed Mrs Ws credit file and found she had no arrears, no County Court judgments, and 
no defaults. They said there was £38,400 of unsecured debt but they thought that as Mrs W 
had told them she was earning £22,000 a year she would be able to afford the credit they 
were providing.
Our investigator thought that NewDay shouldnt have approved the credit card application 
and she suggested NewDay should take some action to remedy the situation. But as 
NewDay disagreed the complaint has been referred to me, an ombudsman, for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to considering complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending is set 
out on our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
I think NewDay completed proportionate checks before approving the credit card. They 
reviewed Mrs Ws credit file and gathered some information from her about her income and 
circumstances. But I think the information they gathered should have raised concerns about 
Mrs Ws ability to repay the credit they were providing sustainably.
Thats because it was clear Mrs W had significant other debt and a relatively low income 
from which to furnish that debt, and any additional debt Mrs W was to be granted through 
this application.
NewDay have suggested they took into account other household income Mrs W would have 
had access to but, whilst that income may have meant her household expenditure may be 
shared, I dont think it was reasonable to suggest that other income could be used to pay off 
the substantial debt she owed to other creditors. That was Mrs Ws responsibility alone.
I think NewDays decision to approve Mrs Ws credit card application was irresponsible as 
the information it had suggested the lending was unaffordable.
Putting things right
As I dont think NewDay should have approved the credit card, I dont think its fair for it to 
charge any interest or charges on it. However, Mrs W has had the benefit of all the money 
she spent on the account so I dont think that spending should be refunded. The account 
was closed in February 2018 so, NewDay should:
Refund all interest, fees, charges, and insurances and add 8% simple interest per 
year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the date of settlement. 
Remove any adverse information they may have reported to Mrs Ws credit file in 
relation to this account. 
*If HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. 
It must give Mrs W a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if she asks for 
one. If it intends to apply the refund to reduce an outstanding balance, it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to put things right in the manner set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 September 2022.
