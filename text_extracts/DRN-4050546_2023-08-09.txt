The complaint
Mr and Mrs C complain they werent able to remortgage with National Westminster Bank Plc 
in September 2022, as NatWest said they couldnt pay an Early Repayment Charge (ERC) 
to end their current deal without advice, and no advice could be given for over six weeks.
What happened
Mr and Mrs C said in late September 2022 they wanted to exit their existing NatWest 
mortgage deal a little early, to secure a new deal with NatWest. They said their own broker 
would have been able to help them select a new deal at the start of November, but they 
didnt want to wait until then. They told us they needed to avoid the potential increases in 
mortgage interest rates before their current deal expired. 
Mr and Mrs C contacted NatWest, but they were told that because they had an ERC on their 
current mortgage, they would need to get advice from a NatWest mortgage advisor first. 
Without that advice, they couldnt pay the ERC, exit their current mortgage deal, and take 
out a new deal with NatWest. So they would need an appointment with a NatWest mortgage 
advisor. Their own broker couldnt do this for them until the start of November. 
Mrs C spoke to NatWest on 29 September 2022, and was told no appointments with its 
mortgage advisors were available until 12 November 2022. Mr and Mrs C said this was too 
late. So they said interest rates rose before they could remortgage, and they anticipated 
paying much more as a result. 
Mr and Mrs C said changes to their family situation (which I will not set out fully here) have 
meant their income has reduced, so they couldnt switch lender for their remortgage. Mr and 
Mrs C said they felt theyd been responsible in seeking to plan their finances, but had been 
blocked by NatWest. They wanted NatWest to honour the rate which was available to them 
at the time they asked to switch. 
NatWest said it had apologised to Mr and Mrs C for long call wait times, and for the long wait 
times to speal to a mortgage advisor. But NatWest said when a customer is moving from an 
existing deal before it ends, and wants to repay the ERC to do so, it does want those 
customers to speak to a mortgage advisor first. Thats to ensure they are fully informed 
about the choice theyre making, and aware of the consequences. 
NatWest said at the time when Mr and Mrs C asked for an appointment, the volume of 
customers switching to new rates had been unprecedented, and like many other banks, it 
had found the requests for appointments to be overwhelming. So there was, unfortunately, a 
long wait for appointments. NatWest didnt think that was its fault. It had offered Mr and Mrs 
C a gesture of goodwill of £100, but it wouldnt do more than this. It wouldnt offer them now, 
the rates that were available when they first asked about an advisor appointment. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said although he couldnt be 
certain what decisions Mr and Mrs C would have made if theyd spoken to an advisor, he still 
thought that Mr and Mrs C were affected by the lack of availability of these appointments. 
Because of this, Mr and Mrs C werent able explore borrowing possibilities during a time 
when it was particularly important to them to do so.
Our investigator noted that other lenders do allow people to exit their existing mortgage 
deals in different ways. He said it was for NatWest to set its own processes here, but he 
didnt think that NatWest had acknowledged the impact this process had on Mr and Mrs C. 
So he said hed ask it to pay £200 more, making £300 in compensation. 
Mr and Mrs C didnt accept that. They said they could show they did want to exit their current 
deal, and sent evidence that their broker had asked NatWest if they could do this through the 
broker. They also said their broker had explained they couldnt go to another lender. 
Mr and Mrs C said theyd recalculated, and their losses were £1,044. They said that was 
based on the difference between the monthly payments on the rate they had now secured 
and the payments on the rate they could have secured if theyd remortgaged when they 
wanted to, at the end of September, minus the ERC they expected, of £2,000. They said it 
wasnt fair for them to absorb all the losses, when NatWest was entirely responsible. 
NatWest also objected to the increased compensation in this case. It said all lenders were 
under pressure at this time, due to the unprecedented situation with rate rises in September 
2022. There simply werent enough advisors to cope with the demand. But our investigator 
said NatWests initial award didnt recognise the impact on Mr and Mrs Cs ability to 
financially plan for the coming years, during very difficult personal circumstances. NatWest 
then agreed to pay what our investigator suggested. 
Our investigator also considered the further evidence Mr and Mrs C provided. He said this 
did support what theyd said about intending to exit their mortgage, but NatWest hadnt 
stopped them from seeking borrowing elsewhere. He said it wasnt NatWests fault that they 
werent able to do that, or that it was an extraordinarily busy time for lenders at this particular 
time. So he said he couldnt fairly ask NatWest to repay the difference between the rate they 
wanted and the one they had eventually secured. 
Mr and Mrs C disagreed. They said they couldnt have exited their deal without NatWests 
involvement, and NatWest held them in their current deal against their will for 11 weeks, just 
because it didnt have any other way to let them out of their deal, and pay the ERC, then 
take new borrowing. Mr and Mrs C still thought all the evidence pointed to it being NatWests 
fault that they couldnt exit their mortgage deal. And they said, having considered other 
situations set out on our website, they didnt think that an extra £200 was fair. 
Our investigator said that as hed understood it, NatWest only prevented Mr and Mrs C from 
taking out a new deal with it. Its customers are free to repay ERCs and move elsewhere. But 
Mr and Mrs C said that the fact they couldnt switch lenders was irrelevant, the deal they 
wanted was NatWests, and they were blocked from getting that because of NatWests 
inadequate systems. Mr C said hed spoken to a number of lenders, and many of the other 
major lenders will allow customers to exit their current mortgage without an interview, either 
using an online application or through a broker. Mr C said he thought NatWest was the only 
major lender requiring an interview. 
Our investigator didnt change his mind. Because no agreement was reached, this case then 
came to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
Although I havent set out in this decision the personal circumstances that Mr and Mrs C 
have told us about, I have taken those into account in reaching my decision. So I appreciate 
that their financial circumstances have changed, and I accept that this meant they would 
have been unlikely to secure borrowing away from NatWest. This is why they say the impact 
on them of the lengthy waiting times for mortgage advice, was more severe. 
But Ive also got to take into account that the policy NatWest put in place, was designed to 
protect its customers. Exiting a mortgage early, and repaying an ERC, in order to take out a 
new deal, is a complex decision, and one which can shift rapidly with changes in mortgage 
rates. I think thats shown by the fact that Mr and Mrs C initially feared their mortgage costs 
would be £470 more each month, but have since told us their losses would total around 
£1,000 over the next two years, based on the ERC they anticipated, of £2,000. 
I think its reasonable for NatWest to say that it wont always be suitable for customers to 
repay an ERC to exit an existing deal. And NatWest wants to ensure that those customers 
who do choose to pay an ERC, are fully informed (including of the exact ERC that will be 
payable) and have considered all the implications of this. I know that not all lenders insist 
that customers have a mortgage advisor interview in these circumstances, but I dont think 
this was just an unreasonable policy for NatWest to have adopted. 
I appreciate that things then became significantly more difficult, because of the increasing 
turmoil in the mortgage markets during September 2022, when Mr and Mrs C also wanted to 
remortgage. And that meant lenders were simply overwhelmed by requests for advice. 
I think it was a combination of NatWests policy on remortgaging when an ERC is payable, 
and the unprecedented demand for mortgage advice at the time, that delayed the provision 
of the advice that Mr and Mrs C needed. And I do appreciate this advice was a prerequisite 
for them moving forward. They told us the delay meant they werent able to do so until they 
were past the time when they would have been able to reserve a new mortgage rate 
anyway, without the payment of an ERC. 
But Ive explained that I dont think NatWest had an unreasonable policy, I think it just 
became difficult in an unprecedented set of circumstances. And I think that even if Mr and 
Mrs C had been offered a mortgage appointment quite soon after their request was made at 
the end of September, they would still have been unlikely to avoid the NatWest rate rises 
which took effect at the start of October. I also dont think it would be reasonable to expect 
NatWest to have just waived its policy, in this case. So, on balance, I dont think it would be 
fair and reasonable, in all the circumstances of this case, to ask NatWest to offer Mr and Mrs 
C now the mortgage rate they could have achieved at the end of September 2022. 
I do think that, as our investigator suggested, NatWest hadnt fully appreciated how the 
problems that it was experiencing in staffing advised mortgage appointments had affected 
Mr and Mrs C. So I think, in the circumstances of this case, that the total payment of £300 
that our investigator suggested, does provide a more appropriate resolution than NatWests 
original offer. 
I understand that Mr and Mrs C are unlikely to agree with me, but I think that a total payment 
of £300 provides a fair and reasonable outcome in the circumstances of this case. And I 
know Mr and Mrs C will be disappointed, but I dont think NatWest has to do more than that.My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must pay Mr and Mrs C £200 in 
compensation, in addition to the £100 it has already paid.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision before 6 September 2023.
