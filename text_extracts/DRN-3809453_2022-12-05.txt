The complaint
Mr P complains about the quality of a used vehicle supplied by MotoNovo Finance Limited 
under a hire purchase agreement (HPA).
What happened
Mr P got this van near the end of October 2020 for social and commuting use. In early 
February 2021 it broke down and he contacted the supplying dealer. The dealer wasnt 
much help - as the van was just outside a three month/3,000 mile warranty  and Mr P 
complained to MotoNovo. MotoNovo arranged for an independent engineer (that Ill call A) to 
inspect the van. He thought the problem lay with the EGR valve or head gasket failure and, 
while further investigation was needed to confirm this, the issue was probably wear and tear 
related.
MotoNovo told Mr P it wasnt responsible in the circumstances and he felt that was unfair, as 
hed only had the van for three months and driven it just over 4,000 miles. Mr P engaged two 
different independent engineers (that Ill call L and J) to inspect the van. They agreed the 
problem was related to the EGR valve and/or the head gasket and recommended further 
investigations so Mr P took the van to a main dealer (for this brand) for checks. The EGR 
valve was replaced but this didnt solve the problem - the van broke down again almost 
straightaway. 
The valve (that the main dealer removed) was dismantled and examined by L and J. They 
found evidence of a leak in the cooling system which was likely repaired with sealant and the 
use of tap water to top up which probably took place over a prolonged period, before Mr P 
got the van, causing engine failure. MotoNovo asked A to comment on the findings and 
another engineer carried out a desktop review. He said there was no firm evidence that 
sealant was used and a fault like this would have been evident within 1,000 miles of use so it 
probably developed while Mr P had the van and Mr P may have contributed to the problem 
by topping up with tap water. L and J didnt agree that this issue would appear within 1,000 
miles of use and Mr P says he never topped up the coolant system but MotoNovo remained 
of the view its not responsible and Mr P referred the matter to our service.
One of our investigators considered the evidence and recommended the complaint should 
be upheld. On balance, he thought the van was probably of unsatisfactory quality when Mr P 
got it. He was satisfied that faults appeared within three months of supply and he wasnt 
persuaded that MotoNovo had done enough to show these werent there at the outset. He 
said theres no evidence of a coolant leak while Mr P had the van (so he had no reason to 
top this up) and he preferred the evidence provided by L and J overall. The investigator 
recommended Mr P should be allowed to reject the van and MotoNovo should refund the 
deposit plus expenses - such as the cost of investigations, repairs and expert evidence. He 
said MotoNovo should also refund monthly finance payments and road tax and insurance 
from February 2021 (as Mr P reasonably stopped using the van at this point) and pay £150 
compensation for associated distress and inconvenience and rectify Mr Ps credit file.
MotoNovo asked for the matter to be referred to an ombudsman. In summary, MotoNovo 
accepts all three engineers found faults in the cooling system but, relying on As opinion, 
considers these would not have been present or developing at the point of supply. MotoNovo 
said coolant was below the normal level when the van was first inspected, Mr P says he 
didnt top up the coolant system and running the engine without coolant can contribute to the 
faults identified,
Mr P was unhappy about the prospect of further delay and decided to have the van repaired 
in the meantime so he wants to keep it now. He says MotoNovo should refund the repair 
costs plus his out of pocket expenses and pay compensation. MotoNovo thinks it was 
uneconomical to repair the van, paperwork Mr P submitted doesnt include all the expenses 
he claimed for and included some wear and tear items which MotoNovo shouldnt be held 
responsible for.
Having considered the available evidence, I was minded to uphold the complaint but my 
reasons were a bit different to those of the investigator. I thought it was fair to give the 
parties the chance to see my provisional findings, and make further submissions (if they 
wanted to) before, I made my final decision. I issued a provisional decision on 28 October 
2022. Ive set out below (in italics) what I decided provisionally - and why. This forms part of 
my final decision. 
My provisional decision 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Where evidence is incomplete,
inconclusive or contradictory (as some of it is here), I reach my decision on the balance of
probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in the light of
the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
Both parties have provided a good deal of evidence so Ive had to summarise things in this
decision. The rules of our service allow me to do this but I want to assure the parties, if I
dont mention every single point thats been raised, its not because I havent thought about
it. I have considered everything thats been said and sent to us. However, Im going to
concentrate here on what I consider is key to reaching a fair and reasonable outcome
overall.
MotoNovo supplied this van to Mr P under a HPA and it was obliged, under the Consumer
Rights Act 2015 (CRA), to ensure that the van was of satisfactory quality at the point of
supply (among other things). What amounts to satisfactory quality will vary depending on
individual circumstances. The quality of goods includes their general state and condition as
well as fitness for purpose, appearance and finish, freedom from minor defects, safety, and
durability. And goods need to meet the standard that a reasonable person would consider
satisfactory. In the case of a used vehicle, its generally considered reasonable to take the 
age, cost and mileage at the point of supply into account. This van was around five years of 
with about 59,000 miles on the clock at the point of supply. It cost nearly £13,000 and Mr P 
paid a deposit of £1,950 and funded the balance with finance provided by MotoNovo - which 
he agreed to pay back over four years at about £300 a month.
Was the van of satisfactory quality at the point of supply?
I think a reasonable person would accept that a vehicle like this was likely to have some
parts that were worn and would need replacing or repairing sooner or later  which is
reflected in the lower price paid compared to the price of a brand new vehicle. I cant fairly
hold MotoNovo responsible for normal wear and tear. But, I consider Mr P had a reasonable
expectation that this van would be relatively durable - taking its age, price and mileage at the
outset into account.
Theres no dispute that the van broke down just over three months after supply, by whichtime Mr P had driven it about 4,000 miles. The parties engaged three different independent
expert engineers to inspect and report on what went wrong and Mr P also took the van to a
main dealer for some investigations and repairs. 
I have read all of the relevant paperwork and expert evidence. I can see A found coolant was 
above the maximum level at the first inspection and, after about five minutes of the engine 
running, there was noticeable excessive pressure within the coolant system. The engineer 
concluded that this could be due to a faulty EGR valve/cooler or possibly the cylinder head 
gasket having failed and further investigation was required. He recommended checking the 
EGR valve unit and cooler to eliminate this before replacing the head gasket. And, given 
how long Mr P had the van and how far hed driven it, the engineer considered the problem 
would not have been present or developing when the van was supplied.
J and L both inspected in early May 2021. They also found excessive pressure in the coolant
system which was likely due to the presence of combustion gases and usually only happens
after the failure of the EGR cooler or the cylinder head gasket.
Im satisfied that all three experts thought further investigation was needed so I dont think it
was unreasonable for Mr P to take the van to the main dealer for checks at this stage. As I
understand it, the main dealer replaced the EGR valve initially (as A suggested) because
this would have been the most cost effective repair - if it had resolved things. Unfortunately it 
didnt and the van broke down again very soon after because the engine damage was 
extensive.
Both J and L then checked the part that the main dealer removed. J found significant
amounts of oxidation to the alloy cooler housing which can only have occurred as a result of
continued use over a long period of time with plain water in the cooling system as well as a
build up of grit and lime scale deposits which suggests that some type of leak stopper has
been added to the cooling system. 
J thought leak stopper had probably stopped the leaks but also impacted on the efficiency of 
the cooling system  blocking water jackets and allowing the sediment to solidify and 
prevent circulation causing the cylinder head gasket to fail. And L confirmed a build-up of 
limescale and rust staining suggested the vehicle was operated with a coolant leak and 
topped up with tap water at some time in the past. L thought the extent of the limescale 
present meant the van probably had tap water in its cooling system for a prolonged period 
and operating with insufficient coolant had caused localised thermal overload ultimately 
resulting in cylinder head gasket failure.
I think its fair to say all three experts agree that the breakdown was caused by an issue with
the coolant system. Where they disagree is whats likely to have caused that exactly and
when this happened. J and L both consider theres evidence of a long-standing coolant leak,
the use of tap water to top up the system and an attempt to repair by the use of a sealant.
And, looking at the deposits present, they think this probably happened some time before 
the van was supplied to Mr P. 
A, on the other hand, remains of the view this fault would have developed solely during the 
time Mr P had the van as this sort of issue would usually be apparent within 1,000 miles of 
use - and Mr P was able to drive the van four times as far before it broke down. A goes on to 
suggest that Mr P may have been topping up the coolant with tap water which added to the 
problem but Im not clear about where the suggestion that Mr P topped up the coolant 
system came from. Ive seen no evidence to support that. Theres nothing to show the van 
had a coolant leak in the three months or so Mr P used it - the main dealer ran diagnostic 
checks and found no evidence of any relevant fault stored  so Mr P had no reason to top up 
the coolant system with tap water (or anything else). And Im satisfied he has consistently said he checked the coolant level visually, when he looked over the engine every week or 
so, but he never topped this up.
In any event, if coolant levels were dropping during the first few months after Mr P got the
van, its difficult to see why hed choose to top this up repeatedly. The van came with the
benefit of a three month warranty and I think its more likely than not Mr P would have 
contacted the supplying dealer. Mr P told us he checked the engine regularly because he 
wanted to be sure he spotted any issues so these could be resolved under the warranty and 
I think that sounds plausible. 
I find Mr Ps actions here to be credible and consistent. Im satisfied he contacted both the 
supplying dealer and MotoNovo very soon after the breakdown in February 2021. And he 
then went to some trouble and expense to have the problem investigated by a main dealer 
and two expert engineers. I think Mr P is unlikely to have taken the steps he did if he knew 
theyd find evidence of mis-use of the coolant system. And, weighing up all the evidence, I 
consider the expert evidence from J and L to be more persuasive than that provided by A. I 
think their findings and views about the likely cause of the fault make sense. I consider its 
more likely than not this van had a leak before it was supplied to Mr P and actions taken by a 
third party - such as the application of sealant and the use of tap water - damaged the 
engine over time causing the head gasket to fail in February 2021. 
There seems to be no dispute that this engine was damaged beyond repair. I dont think a 
reasonable person would expect to have to replace the engine in a van of this age and 
mileage after just three months and 4,000 miles or so of use. Im minded to conclude that the 
van was probably of unsatisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr P. And Ive gone on to 
consider what MotoNovo should do to put things right.
The cost of work carried out by the main dealer and expert evidence
For the reasons Ive given above I dont think it was unreasonable for Mr P to take the van to
the main dealer for checks and repairs in May 2021. Im minded to find MotoNovo should
reimburse this cost along with the cost of expert evidence because Mr P wouldnt have
incurred these expenses if the vehicle was of satisfactory quality at the outset.
Monthly finance payments, road tax and insurance
I find it fair that Mr P should also have his monthly payments refunded for the time he was 
unable to use the van from February 2021 until May 2022 - when it was repaired. Likewise 
Im minded to agree with the investigator that Mr P should have the cost of insurance and 
road tax reimbursed (for this period). Im satisfied that Mr P was obliged to keep the van 
insured even though he wasnt using it. And he was unable to make a statutory off road 
notification (SORN) - as he couldnt store it off the public road. Paperwork supplied by Mr P 
indicates he paid insurance of £88.51 a month until 20 Aug 21 then £75.01 for one month 
and £74.85 a month after that until May 2022. And, in terms of road tax, he seems to have 
paid £23.18 a month until October 2021 when he paid £24.09 for one month and £24.06 
after until May 2022.
Repairs (and other costs) in May 2022
I think Mr P was left in a somewhat difficult position by this stage. He had a van he couldnt
use that he was paying over £400 a month for (including tax and insurance) which was due
an MOT. He wasnt sure how long it would take to get a final ombudsmans decision and
whether that would be in his favour. And I dont think it was unreasonable for Mr P to decide
to have the van repaired, in these particular circumstances.
I understand MotoNovo considers the repairs were uneconomical and says, given the
choice, it would have preferred to take the van back and provide a refund. But, I think its
unlikely that these repairs cost significantly more than rejection overall. As far as I can see, rejection would have required MotoNovo to pay for collection and then either have the van 
repaired or sold at a discount (in view of damage present). In addition, MotoNovo would 
have had to refund the deposit £1,950, the cost of investigations and repairs already 
incurred and expert evidence (£2,000 at least) plus monthly finance payments, tax and 
insurance from February 2021 until settlement - along with interest. As a result of Mr P 
having the van repaired, MotoNovo wont now need to pay for collection and repair/sell at a 
discount or refund the deposit or any finance or tax/insurance payments made after May 
2022 (which would probably have been ongoing otherwise until the ombudsmans decision).
Turning to the repair costs Mr P has claimed, Ive seen two relevant invoices. I think £1,500
for the supply of a reconditioned engine seems fair. Im minded to find it reasonable for
MotoNovo to refund this amount along with the cost of any labour associated with removing
the damaged engine and fitting the reconditioned one. I think it likely oil and filters would
form an essential element of replacing the engine so I consider it fair that MotoNovo should
refund this cost as well.
Ive seen no evidence however to show that it was necessary (as a result of faults present
when the van was supplied) to replace the other parts listed in the invoice  namely two
turbos, the clutch and flywheel, the water pump, front brake discs and pads and the bottom
crankshaft pulley. I realise it may have been more cost effective to undertake this work at the
same time as replacing the engine. But I think any wear to the parts in question was
probably due to normal use - in a vehicle of this age and mileage. And I cant therefore fairly
hold MotoNovo liable for the associated cost - on the current evidence.
The invoice (dated 27 May 2022) doesnt set out the cost of the individual parts and or the
associated labour so Ive asked Mr P to obtain a detailed breakdown if possible. I
understand Mr P also incurred some transport costs at this time but I havent seen any
evidence of that. If Mr P still wants to claim for transport it is open to him to supply relevant
evidence. If he no longer has receipts, this could consist of information about the cost of any
relevant train fare, for example, along with confirmation (in a bank statement or similar) that
he paid this amount on the relevant date.
Im satisfied that Mr P has experienced some distress and inconvenience as a result of being
supplied with this faulty van. He had to take it back and forth to several garages for checks 
and repairs, among other things. I think its fair that MotoNovo should pay Mr P £150
compensation to reflect this. In addition, if any adverse information was recorded about the
HPA on Mr Ps credit file as a result of what happened, I am minded to find that should be
removed as well.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I invited the parties to consider my provisional findings and let me have any further 
comments or new evidence by 11 November 2022. MotoNovo accepted my provisional 
findings initially and Mr P supplied a breakdown of the repair invoice and details of his 
insurance and road tax payments. He said a new water pump was required because the 
engine had to be replaced so the cost of this should be refunded. And the £1,500 charged 
for labour didnt include labour associated with fitting of additional parts (such as the clutch) 
because of the extensive work needed anyway in order to replace the engine. Mr P didnt 
provide any documentary evidence relating to additional transport costs.
I wrote to both parties and explained that I was minded to require MotoNovo to take the 
steps set out below (under the heading my final decision) to put things right as (among other things) it looked as if Mr P no longer wished to claim for additional transport. And I allowed 
the parties some more time (until 23 November 2022) to make further submissions. 
Mr P hasnt sent us anything else but MotoNovo supplied a very detailed response saying (in 
summary) having considered all the evidence again, it doesnt agree the vehicle was of 
unsatisfactory quality when it was supplied for the following reasons:-
when the first expert (A) inspected the van in March 2021 he concluded that the fault 
could not have been present or developing since supply due to the time elapsed from 
the point of sale to breakdown and the mileage covered; 
the two experts (L and J) instructed by Mr P both noted water in the coolant system 
contributed to the engine failure;
Mr P claims not to have topped up the system but coolant was found to be overfilled 
with a mixture of coolant and water when A inspected in March 2021  MotoNovo 
asks how would that be possible if Mr P never topped up the coolant system after he 
got the van, almost four months previously;
if the van was operated with depleted coolant thats Mr Ps responsibility; 
J refers to some type of leak stopper being added to the cooling system but theres 
no evidence of when this was added - or that it was not added by Mr P; and 
Mr P had unauthorised repairs completed without allowing MotoNovo the opportunity 
to further inspect the van and gather additional evidence.
MotoNovo hasnt provided any new evidence and I think Ive addressed most of the points it 
has raised in my provisional findings already. Nothing thats been said has caused me to 
change my mind. I acknowledged in my provisional decision that A found coolant was above 
maximum when he checked in March 2021. I can see no reference to a mixture of coolant 
and water in his report. And, in any event, Im not persuaded that the presence of fluid in the 
coolant system above the maximum means Mr P must have topped it up after supply  with 
tap water or anything else. 
For the reasons Ive given already, I prefer the evidence of J and L which points (in 
summary) to prolonged use of tap water in the coolant system for some time before Mr P 
acquired the van causing the fault. Im satisfied MotoNovo had the opportunity to carry out 
further investigations (even after J and L provided their reports) if it wanted to but chose to 
commission a desktop report instead. And, given MotoNovo continued to reject his 
complaint, I dont think it was unreasonable of Mr P to decide to have the van repaired when 
he did (for the reasons I have set out in my provisional decision).
On balance overall, I remain of the view this vehicle was probably of unsatisfactory quality 
when it was supplied to Mr P. And, taking everything into account, I consider it is fair and 
reasonable for MotoNovo to take the steps set out below to put things right. 
My final decision
My decision is I uphold this complaint and I require MotoNovo Finance Limited to do the 
following:- 
1. Refund the cost of investigations (£89) and repairs (£1,321.43) carried out but the 
main dealer totalling £1,410.43,
2. Refund the cost of expert evidence (£420 for L and £300 for J) totalling £720;
3. Refund monthly payments made while the van was off the road along with the cost of 
road tax and insurance, from 5 February 2021 until 27 May 2022 (pro rata);
4. Refund the cost of the replacement reconditioned engine (£1,500);
5. Refund the cost of oil and various filters (£110), a new water pump (£50) and labour (£1,500) associated with replacing the engine;
6. Pay interest on the above refunds at 8% simple a year from the date paid until the 
date of settlement;
7. Pay Mr P £150 compensation for his associated distress and inconvenience and 
remove any adverse information recorded about the finance from his credit file.
If MotoNovo does not pay the £150 compensation for inconvenience and distress within 28 
days of the date on which we tell it that Mr P accepts my final decision then it must also pay 
8% simple yearly interest on this from the date of my final decision to the date of payment. 
If MotoNovo considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to withhold income tax 
from the interest part of my award, it should tell Mr P how much its taken off and give him a 
tax deduction certificate, if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 January 2023.
