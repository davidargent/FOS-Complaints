The complaint
A limited company, which I'll refer to as 'C' is unhappy with several aspects of the service it 
received from National Westminster Bank Plc ("NatWest") following the transfer of its 
business relationship by NatWest to its Global Restructuring Group ("GRG").
What happened
C has close operating relationships with two other limited companies, and although all three 
limited companies are separate entities they have historically worked in compliment with one 
another and the directors of all three limited companies are, either as a couple or 
individually, the same husband and wife. As such, while this letter will be addressing the 
complaints that relate to C specifically, where it's appropriate within this letter to address all 
three companies simultaneously I will refer to all three companies as the 'Connection'.  
 
C was engaged in the investment and development of property and had a long business 
relationship with NatWest from whom it borrowed money to fund its business objectives.
 
In 2008, as market conditions deteriorated because of the global financial crisis at that time, 
NatWest became concerned about the performance of C, and the business relationship was 
transferred by NatWest to GRG in February 2009. Following this, and because of C not 
meeting agreed financial commitments, GRG issued a default notice to C in regard of its 
credit facility in April 2009.
 
A restructuring of C's credit facilities was arranged in September 2009, but C subsequently 
struggled to meet the obligations of the new agreement and it was ultimately agreed that 
asset sales were required to enable the repayment of the borrowing.
 
The properties over which NatWest held a security interest were eventually sold in 
November 2015 by NatWest's appointed receiver.
 
In 2017, C raised a complaint with NatWest on the basis that it was unhappy with several 
aspects of the service it had received following the transfer to GRG. NatWest looked at C's 
complaint. For the large part, they didnt feel that C's complaint had merit, although they did 
uphold some aspects of the complaint.
 
C wasn't satisfied with NatWest's response, so it appealed its complaint to an Independent 
Third Party ("ITP") for review. The ITP considered C's complaint, but they didnt feel that 
NatWest had acted unfairly or unreasonably towards C in the way that C maintained, and so 
they didnt uphold C's complaint.
 
C remained dissatisfied, so it referred its complaint to this service. One of our investigators 
looked at this complaint. But they also felt that for the large part, NatWest hadnt acted 
unfairly or  unreasonably towards C, and they felt that NatWest's response to C's complaint 
in regard to the aspects of C's complaint that NatWest had initially upheld, already 
represented a fair and reasonable response to the complaint.
 
C didnt agree with the view of the complaint put forwards by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
C has raised several points of complaint that it wants this service to consider. However, this 
service isnt free to consider every complaint thats brought to us. The rules that were 
governed by set out the complaints we can and cant look at. Theyre called the Dispute 
Resolution (DISP) rules and are found in the Financial Conduct Authoritys handbook.
 
These rules include certain time limits. In particular, DISP 2.8.2 says that unless the 
business involved gives its consent, or if exceptional circumstances apply, the ombudsman
cant consider a complaint if the complainant refers it to the Financial Ombudsman Service
more than:
 
(a) six years after the event complained of; or (if later)
 
(b) three years from the date on which the complainant became aware (or ought reasonably 
to have become aware) that they had cause for complaint
 
These time limits were voluntarily waived by NatWest for the period that C as a complainant 
company was being managed by GRG. But NatWest have confirmed that they don't agree to 
waive these time limits for complaints made about events that happened when C was being 
managed by the mainstream part of the bank, for instance before the transfer of the 
business relationship to GRG in 2009. 
 
In this instance, some of the complaints raised by C do refer to events that took place before 
C's business relationship was transferred to GRG. Specifically, these complaint points are 
that NatWest:
 
unreasonably refused to refinance a development loan into an investment loan 
following the completion of building works
provided bad advice and prevented the sale of properties and unreasonably withdrew 
from an agreement to sell properties
unreasonably dissuaded the complainants from refinancing the borrowings by saying 
the bank would restructure the borrowing
unreasonably reneged on a promise to provide a new loan of Â£350,000 and withdrew 
promises of future finance
altered the terms of a loan agreement
 
Given that C referred its complaint to this service in 2020, I'm satisfied that the time limits as 
set out in the DISP rules referred to above do apply in relation to these aspects of C's 
complaint. 
 
Furthermore, after consideration, I'm similarly satisfied that there are no exceptional 
circumstances that give reasonable cause for this service to look past these time limits and 
to consider these aspects of C's complaint in this instance. Consequently, this means that 
I'm satisfied that this service cant consider these particular aspects of C's complaint. And I 
will not refer to these aspects of C's complaint further.
 Conversely, the aspects of C's complaint that I do feel that this service can consider - given 
that they relate to the period where C's business relationship was being managed by GRG - 
are that NatWest:
 
provided unsatisfactory restructuring proposals
amended a loan agreement and withdrew a five-year loan and forced C into a 
Property Participation Fee Agreement
charged excessive fees and interest
made unreasonable payment demands and forced asset sales
unreasonably appointed LPA receivers and consented with their actions without 
engaging with C
failed to appoint local LPA receivers and therefore incurred unnecessary additional 
expenses
allowed the receivers to sell the properties for less that the true market value
did not provide any completion statements on properties sold
arranged valuations in April 2009 that weren't required and were unreasonable
unfairly introduced third parties
changed relationship manager too often
I will explain my decision in relation to each of these complaint points in turn.
NatWest provided unsatisfactory restructuring proposals  and  NatWest amended a
loan agreement and withdrew a five-year loan and forced C into a Property Participation Fee 
Agreement 
 
In June 2008, while the business relationships of the Connection were all still managed by 
NatWest on a mainstream basis, NatWest agreed five-year loans to all three companies, 
including C. However, C maintains that following the transfer to GRG in September 2009, 
NatWest changed those loan agreements unfairly, offering alternative arrangements that 
weren't reasonable or satisfactory to C, and forcing C into a Property Participation Fee 
Agreement ("PPFA").
 
It seems evident from the information available to me, following the transfer of the 
Connection's business relationships to GRG and the subsequent defaulting of the 
Connection's credit facilities by NatWest  which occurred because the Connection were 
unable to meet the financial commitments required of them on the previously agreed five-
year loans  that it was agreed by both the Connection and NatWest that a restructuring of 
the Connection's credit facilities was the best way to move forwards. 
 
Indeed, I note that a representative of the Connection wrote to NatWest on the Connection's 
behalf and made the suggestion that NatWest should provide individual consolidation loans 
to each of the three members of the Connection, C included, to be repaid on an interest only 
basis for a minimum period of three years.
 
Regarding C, the initial restructuring proposal put forwards by NatWest included that C's 
credit facilities would be included in a PPFA and C would benefit from an initial interest only 
repayment period of five years. However, following a request made by one of C's directors, 
NatWest withdrew the requirement for C to be included in a PPFA but with the consequence 
that the initial interest only repayment period was reduced to two years.
 
This seems to me to be a reasonable compromise, and while it is correct to say that the 
initial five year interest only period offer was withdrawn, it was done so as the result of a 
negotiated compromise to which all parties ultimately agreed. 
 And, given that C's financial position continued to be problematic up to this point, I don't feel 
that the restructuring proposals that were ultimately put forwards by NatWest were unfair, 
and I also don't feel that NatWest acted unreasonably towards C by managing this situation 
and negotiating the compromise position as they did.
 
As such, given the above, and given that C wasn't ultimately subject to a PPFA, I won't be 
upholding these aspects of C's complaint.
NatWest charged excessive fees and interest
 
C has complained about the fees and margin rates charged by NatWest following the 
transferral of C's business relationship by NatWest to GRG.
 
When C was transferred to GRG in 2009, it already had two outstanding loans which were 
being charged margin at Base Rate ("B") +2.5%. Following the defaulting of C's credit facility 
by NatWest after the transfer to GRG, the margin increased to B+4.5%.
 
Given that C hadn't been able to meet its loan repayment commitments to NatWest, and the 
subsequent increase in perceived ongoing repayment risk that I feel it's reasonable for 
NatWest to have felt at that time, this increase in the margin from B+2.5% to B+4.5% doesn't 
seem unreasonable to me.
 
Additionally, the loan restructuring that took place in September 2009 was also charged at 
B+4.5%, which corresponds with the margin that NatWest had been charging C immediately 
following the default. And again, I feel this was reasonable for the same reasons as 
explained above.
 
It's notable that another member of the Connection was granted a loan restructuring by 
NatWest with a lower margin rate, but it's also notable that there were differences in the 
restructuring agreement reached between NatWest and the other company which I'm 
satisfied merited the lower margin rate for that other company. This included that the other 
company was subject to a PPFA, whereas C was not, as discussed above.
 
Finally, for the restructuring of the loan in September 2009, NatWest charged a loan 
arrangement fee of 1%. Such arrangement fees are a common feature of business loans 
and take account of the work undertaken by the loan provider in arranging and committing to 
that loan. As such, I don't feel that it was unfair or unreasonable for NatWest to have 
charged such an arrangement fee in this instance, and I also don't feel that the size of the 
fee was unfair and I note that it was commensurate and wasn't unduly large in comparison to 
the industry norms of that time.
 
All of which means that I'm satisfied that NatWest didnt charge C excessive fees and 
interest, given the circumstances here, and it follows that I won't be upholding this aspect of 
C's complaint.
NatWest made unreasonable payment demands and forced asset sales
 
NatWest issued a notice of default to C shortly after the transfer to GRG in April 2009. This 
was done largely on the basis that C weren't able to meet the repayment commitments on 
their loan facility such that the loan facility had fallen into arrears and because C were 
experiencing operational issues linked to their difficult financial position at that time.
 
As discussed previously, following the issuance of the default notice, it was agreed by all 
parties including NatWest to restructure C's loan facility to give C the opportunity to regain its financial position. This loan restructure took place in September 2009, with further wider 
financial restructuring agreed in 2010.
 
In 2011, with C continuing to struggle financially, it was agreed by all parties that sales of 
property assets would be required to ensure that C could meet its financial commitments to 
NatWest. Despite this agreement, no properties were sold for several years, and NatWest 
issued new default notices to C in 2014.
 
In May 2015, NatWest appointed receivers to realise the bank's security assets, and in 
November 2015 those receivers sold the properties over which NatWest held a security 
interest and returned the sale proceeds to NatWest.
 
As such, it therefore appears that despite C not meeting its agreed loan repayment 
commitments such that default notices were initially issued by NatWest in April 2009, 
NatWest continued to work with C for several years to give C an ongoing opportunity to 
recover its financial position. And it wasn't until approximately six years after the initial notice 
of defaults were issued that NatWest then moved to appoint receivers.
 
This doesn't seem unreasonable to me, and it's difficult to reach any conclusion from the 
above other than that NatWest did provide C with a fair amount of assistance and 
forbearance when C fell into financial difficulty. 
 
Ultimately, C wasn't able to honour its financial commitments to NatWest, and on that basis 
I'm satisfied that NatWest were entitled both to seek the repayment of C's loan facility in line 
with the evolving agreements and to appoint receivers to sell C's security assets when C, 
after a period of several years, continued to be unable to honour its financial commitments to 
NatWest's satisfaction.
 
As such, I consider that NatWest's payment demands to C were reasonable. I also consider 
that following C not meeting these payment demands that NatWest were entitled to force the 
sale of assets as they ultimately did. And it follows from this that I won't be upholding this 
aspect of C's complaint.
 
NatWest unreasonably appointed LPA receivers and consented with their actions without 
engaging with C and NatWest failed to appoint local LPA receivers and therefore C 
incurred unnecessary additional expenses
 
As explained above, I'm satisfied that it was fair and reasonable for NatWest to have 
appointed the receivers when they did. Having done so, NatWest then consented with the 
actions of the receivers, as would be expected. 
 
Having taken the reasonable decision to appoint receivers at that time, NatWest weren't 
obliged or expected to have requested any form of agreement from C as to how the 
receivers fulfilled their duties.
 
Additionally, there was no obligation on NatWest to appoint a receiver from a certain 
location, such as one based locally in relation to the property assets that were due to be 
sold, and NatWest were entitled to appoint a receiver of their choosing so long as that 
receiver was able to adequately fulfil their professional duties. 
 
And I haven't seen anything to suggest that the receivers that were appointed by NatWest 
weren't able to adequately fulfil their professional duties, or that any additional unreasonable 
costs were incurred by C because the appointed receivers weren't locally based. And it 
therefore follows that I won't be upholding these aspects of C's complaintNatWest allowed the receivers to sell the properties for less than the true market value
 
Once a receiver has been appointed and tasked to sell property assets, that receiver then 
advises as to whether a particular property should be sold at a particular price.
 
Having reviewed all the information available to me, I'm satisfied that this was what 
happened here. Additionally, given the mandate to sell the property assets and thus realise 
the value of those assets that the receiver had, I haven't seen anything to suggest that the 
receiver sold any property for an unreasonably low price. 
 
In short, having appointed the receivers, I'm satisfied that it was fair and reasonable for 
NatWest to accept the property sales prices put forwards by the receivers. And given that 
NatWest weren't themselves directly responsible for the sale of the properties, and that 
NatWest accepted the positions put forward by their reasonably appointed professional 
agent, it follows that I won't be upholding this aspect of C's complaint.
 
NatWest didnt provide any completion statements on properties sold
 
The properties werent sold by NatWest but rather by the appointed receivers, and NatWest 
held a security charge over all of the properties sold. As such, NatWest weren't required to 
provide completion statements to C in the manner than C contends here, and it follows from 
this that I won't be upholding this aspect of C's complaint. 
  
The April 2009 property valuations werent required and were unreasonable
 
As discussed, NatWest's security for the lending it provided to C was the property assets 
held by C. In April 2009, these assets hadn't been valued for some time and global property 
markets had experienced a period of considerable change. It therefore seems reasonable to 
me that NatWest would have wanted to have had an updated value of the properties at that 
time so as to have an accurate understanding of the value of its security position.
 
C has also stated that the valuations weren't carried out correctly to the detriment of the 
property values that were returned. But I haven't seen anything in the information available 
to me to suggest that the property valuations weren't undertaken in an appropriate manner, 
and it appears that they did meet the standard necessary to be considered as 'Red Book' 
valuations, as was required at that time. As such, I wont be upholding this aspect of C's 
complaint. 
 
NatWest unfairly introduced third parties
 
C has referred to a number of third parties that NatWest either introduced or asked to be 
introduced, including forensic accountants, estate agents, lawyers, and surveyors - although 
I havent seen any details of what specific fees that C incurred resulting from these 
introductions it feels were unfair.
 
Given the evolving circumstances surrounding this complaint, I haven't seen that NatWest 
introduced or requested the introduction of any third parties that I feel was unreasonable, 
given those circumstances. For instance, a fee charged by an estate agent for work 
undertaken when trying to sell property assets seems to me to be fair and reasonable here, 
given that it had been agreed by all parties that such property asset sales were necessary. 
And, other than one specific fee charged to the Connection that NatWest have already 
agreed to reimburse, I haven't seen anything to suggest that NatWest acted out of 
accordance with the process that I would expect NatWest to have followed, given the nature 
of the developing situation that was taking place. 
Accordingly, I find it difficult to conclude that NatWest did unfairly introduce third parties in 
the manner which C suggests here, and instead I feel that all third parties that were 
introduced were reasonable given the circumstances at those times. And it follows from this 
that I won't be upholding this aspect of C's complaint. 
 
NatWest changed relationship manager too often
 
It's notable that since the transfer to GRG in 2009, C's business relationship has been 
managed by eleven different relationship managers to date. While this figure may seem 
high, it can be the case that relationship managers need to be changed for reasons beyond 
a business' control  for instance, if that relationship manager leaves the company.
 
To be able to say that a change in relationship managers has been unfair or unreasonable in 
this instance it would need to be demonstrable that C incurred a direct detrimental effect as 
a result of the changes of relationship manager. 
But I haven't seen any such detrimental effect, and indeed NatWest's approach towards C 
appears to have remained reasonably consistent despite relationship manager changes that 
took place. As such, while I can appreciate how it might have been frustrating for C to have 
had to deal with changing relationship managers, I won't be upholding this aspect of C's 
complaint.
Summary
 
While I can appreciate how C might be disappointed with how events transpired here, I find it 
very difficult to conclude that NatWest acted unfairly or unreasonably towards C in the ways 
which C contends. Ultimately, speaking broadly, C couldn't meet the financial commitments 
it had agreed to when borrowing from NatWest, and I'm satisfied that NatWest did give C 
reasonable forbearance and opportunities to recover its financial position before appointing 
the receivers as they eventually did. And I'm also satisfied that NatWest were entitled to 
appoint the receivers and to force the sale of the properties to recoup their lending as much 
as possible, given C's ongoing inability to meet its financial commitments to NatWest.
 
I realise that this won't be the outcome that C was wanting, but it follows that I won't be 
upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action here, beyond that 
to which theyve already agreed. I trust that C will understand, given all that I've explained, 
why I've made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask C to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 April 2022.
