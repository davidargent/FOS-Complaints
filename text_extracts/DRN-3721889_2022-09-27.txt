The complaint
Miss L complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA attempted to get her to pay them an 
amount after she says she was the victim of a scam. Shed like an apology and 
compensation.
What happened
Miss L had a PayPal account. In September 2020 she sold an item for £87, and accepted 
payment through PayPal. However the buyer raised a dispute through PayPal, saying the 
item was not as described.
PayPal investigated under their buyer protection policy. Miss L believed shed found the 
buyer reselling the item for a higher price, and attempted to submit screenshots of this, but 
these were declined by PayPal. It was decided the fairest way to resolve the situation was to 
allow the buyer to return the item and receive a refund. 
But Miss L did not receive the item, as her address held with PayPal was a previous address 
and the item returned undelivered. But her account was put in a negative balance, which she 
was asked to repay. She was also prevented from using her account.
Miss L complained to PayPal about this, saying she could show the buyer still had the item, 
and was now reselling it for higher value. But PayPal didnt think theyd done anything 
wrong. They said theyd stuck to the terms of the user agreement. But they decided to issue 
a credit to clear the negative balance on her account in March 2021.
Unhappy with this response Miss L referred the complaint to our service. One of our 
investigators looked at the complaint, but felt that by writing off the remaining balance 
PayPal had resolved the complaint in a fair way. They didnt ask PayPal to do anything 
further. Miss L disagreed, saying shed had debt collectors sent after her, and had to spend 
a lot of time trying to resolve the issue with PayPal. Shed also lost income as she couldnt 
use PayPal to collect payments for good sold online.
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me to decide. After 
reviewing the evidence and circumstances of the complaint, I felt it should be upheld. I 
issued a provisional decision which said:
Firstly, Im glad to see that PayPal decided to clear the outstanding balance. Im satisfied this 
was the fairest thing to do in the circumstances. Based on what Ive seen I think its more 
likely than not Miss L was the victim of a scam, and Ive seen nothing to suggest that she 
hasnt acted in good faith.
The PayPal Seller Protection policy says that PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, 
whether your claim qualifies for PayPal Seller Protection. PayPal will make a decision, in its 
sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements, any information or 
documentation provided during the resolution process or any other information PayPal 
deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.
However, in this case I can see that Miss L offered PayPal information about the dispute, 
which Ive reviewed and found relevant to the dispute in hand. This included the information 
that the item was possibly being resold. But this information was declined, and Miss L was 
told that the item being resold would have no bearing on the case. 
It doesnt seem reasonable to me for PayPal to decline to review relevant information about 
the dispute, when the terms say they will consider any information provided. So, I can see 
why Miss L would be upset by PayPals actions. 
If PayPal had reviewed Miss Ls evidence, I think its likely they would have reached a 
different conclusion in the dispute. This would have resolved the dispute for Miss L a lot 
sooner. Instead I can see PayPal took several months to investigate her concerns, which is 
much longer than Id expected to see. During this time they were still asking for repayment of 
the money. So, dragging this out would only increase the upset caused to Miss L.
On that basis Im satisfied PayPal havent treated her fairly, and it would be appropriate for 
compensation to be paid. Miss L has commented that she has lost out because she hasnt 
been able to sell items online and collect payment through PayPal. But my understanding is 
that the account was blocked for reasons unrelated specifically to this dispute. 
Having considered the overall impact, Im minded that £100 would be a suitable award to 
reflect the distress and inconvenience to Miss L.
Miss L didnt respond. PayPal responded to say they believe they acted in accordance with 
their user agreement, and that as a credit was issued to her account, they feel no further 
actions were required.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
After careful consideration Im still minded the conclusions I reached in the provisional 
decision are reasonable. Ive reviewed the correspondence Miss L has supplied between her 
and PayPal; and considered what the PayPal Seller Protection Policy says. Im still minded 
that Miss L has fallen victim to a scam, and that there is nothing to suggest she has acted in 
anything other than good faith.
The terms of the Seller Protection policy clearly state that all evidence considered relevant 
will be considered. But in this case Miss L has provided compelling evidence that PayPal 
refused to consider the evidence she had  she is told directly by a PayPal agent that the 
item being resold will have no bearing on the case and it doesnt contradict the buyers 
claim. 
But I find Miss Ls evidence to be relevant to the claim, particularly as the buyer does appear 
to be reselling the item for a higher price, despite claiming it was not as described. There 
isnt a reasonable reason for PayPal to decline to consider this evidence since, as the terms 
state, the decision whether a claim qualifies for Seller Protection is down to PayPals sole 
discretion. 
Ultimately, Im not satisfied that PayPal have followed the terms of their Seller Protection, 
and in any case the outcome reached is unreasonable. Had they considered Miss Ls 
evidence, as their terms suggest they would, then they ought reasonably to have reached a 
different conclusion. I dont see it was reasonable to hold Miss L liable for the amount in 
dispute when the buyer has received a refund and is reselling the item.PayPal have commented that they could not find any evidence of poor service. But I find that 
declining to consider relevant information to fall well below the standard I would expect to 
see. The dispute took several months to resolve, which is much longer than I would consider 
reasonable. During this time were asking Miss L to repay a balance. This can only have 
increased the upset to her.
Im satisfied that PayPal have treated Miss L unfairly. PayPal have suggested that they have 
sufficiently compensated her by writing off the outstanding balance. But for the reasons 
explained above, I dont see she should have been held liable for this amount. So, I cant 
see this could count as compensation.
Ive still seen nothing to suggest that Miss L suffered any specific losses from PayPals 
actions  and the restriction on her account are unrelated to this dispute. With that in mind 
Im satisfied £100 is a suitable amount to reflect the distress and inconvenience PayPals 
handling of this dispute caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must pay Miss L £100 
compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 October 2022.
