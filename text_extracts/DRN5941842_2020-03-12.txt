K821x#15complaint
Mr H says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 24 loans Sunny provided to Mr H between  May 2015 and September  
2018. Mr Hs borrowing history is set out in the appendix at the end of this decision.
Mr H says the loan repayments were  unaffordable and that he suffered a significant 
deterioration in his financial situation as a result of Sunnys  irresponsible lending, which 
would not have occurred had proper  checks been carried out.
In its final response,  Sunny told Mr H that it did not uphold Mr Hs complaint. It explained  to 
him that it had carried out the required checks before  lending  to him and that Mr H met its 
eligibility, creditworthiness  and affordability requirements for the loans which were approved. 
It says the amounts advanced were assessed  as affordable over the term of each loan. It 
then revised the position and offered to put things right for Mr H from loan 8 onwards and 
amend Mr Hs credit file in line with our approach.
Our adjudicator said he couldnt say it was unfair for Sunny to provide loans 1-5 to Mr H. But 
he said from loan 6 onwards the loans shouldnt have been  given.  From loan 6 Mr Hs 
overall pattern  of borrowing  suggested he had become  persistently  reliant  on short  term 
loans. Sunny disagreed and the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN59418422There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.  Ive decided to uphold this complaint 
from loan 6 onwards.
I agree  with our adjudicator that early in the relationship I wouldnt expect Sunny to do more 
than it did. It looks like for loans 1-4 Sunny checked Mr Hs income and expenditure and 
carried out some other checks, but I wouldnt  have  expected it to verify the information Mr H 
gave them. On the face of it, I think on balance these loans would have appeared to have 
been affordable.  So, I dont uphold  this complaint about loans 1-4.
By Loan 5 I would have expected Sunny  to carry out some  more detailed  checks.  Mr H has 
kindly provided copy bank  statements and a credit report from the time he took out loan 5 in 
January 2016.  But even  though he still had an outstanding  balance  from loan 4, and another 
short-term loan I still think at this point it was likely that loan 5 appeared sustainably 
affordable.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6.I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr H was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Loan 6 was the sixth loan Mr H had taken out in almost eight months 
and Mr H had been indebted to Sunny for all that period with no gaps and he was still 
repaying loans  4 and 5 when  he took out loan 6. So Sunny ought to have realised it 
was more likely than not Mr H was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness  
was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Hs first loan was for £200 and loan 6 was for £100. But at that time as I said 
above he still had two other loans running at the same time. At this point Sunny 
Ref: DRN59418423ought to have known that Mr H was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall 
in his income but to meet an ongoing  need.  
Although Loan 7 was taken out a few months  after Mr H repaid loan 6, after that 
Sunny provided  Mr H with a new loan within days or weeks of settling a previous  one. 
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  24 was 
taken out around 40 months after Mr Hs first and whilst he was still repaying loan 23 
which Sunny had provided.  Mr H had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  
service a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
I think that Mr H lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Hs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6-24 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 6-24;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6-24 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr Hs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mr H compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 April 2020
