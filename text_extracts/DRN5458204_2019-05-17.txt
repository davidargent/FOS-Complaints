K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains about the loans  CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid)  lent to him 
from March 2008  to November 2013. Mr M says the loans  were irresponsibly lent.
background
Mr M was lent a total of 20 loans  by QuickQuid. Ive set out some of the loan information  in 
an appendix at the end of this decision.
QuickQuid said Mr M had complained about  loans 1 to 14 too late and so this Service  didnt 
have the authority to look into his complaint about those loans. So Mr M withdrew  his 
complaint about  loans  1 to 14.
And so our adjudicator looked  at Mr Ms complaint about loans 15 to 20 and didnt  
recommend that the complaint about any of those  loans  should be upheld.
Mr M didnt  agree with the adjudication and so the complaint has come to me  an 
ombudsman for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law and 
any relevant regulatory  rules and good  industry practice at the time.
QuickQuid was required to lend responsibly. It needed to check  that Mr M could  afford to 
repay his loans sustainably. While there was no set list of checks  it needed to do, the checks 
shouldve been  proportionate to the circumstances of each loan which for example might 
include considerations about  the amount borrowed,  Mr Ms income and his borrowing history 
with QuickQuid. QuickQuid didnt have to request Mr Ms bank statements before lending but 
it had to carry out borrower  focussed proportionate checks before lending each loan.
So in making  this decision I have considered whether QuickQuid did everything it should  
have when assessing Mr Ms loan applications. And if there were insufficient checks, 
whether this resulted in QuickQuid agreeing to lend to Mr M when it should  have known that 
it would  be difficult for him to repay.
were QuickQuids checks sufficient/proportionate?
QuickQuid has told us what checks it carried out, it said before agreeing to lend it checked 
Mr Ms income and searched  his credit file. It also checked his employment  and housing 
status.
From the information QuickQuid gathered,  Mr M was employed and paid rent. His declared 
income varied from £1,000 to £3,000 over the lending  period. 
There was a gap in the lending between when Mr M repaid loan 14 and when he borrowed 
loan 15. This break was around 9 months and I think given  this length of time,  it wasnt  
unreasonable for QuickQuid to believe that Mr Ms finances had improved and he wasnt 
reliant on the loans.  And so this gap effectively broke the lending  chain.
Ref: DRN54582042Loan 15 was for £200 and as the amount was a small  portion of Mr Ms declared income of 
£2,000, QuickQuids checks went far enough.  And having considered the entries on Mr Ms 
credit file at the time, there was nothing that shouldve  concerned  QuickQuid at this stage.
Mr M borrowed more  when  he applied  for loan 16, including interest, Mr M was due to repay  
around £375 for this loan. Given the increase  in borrowing shortly after repaying a previous 
loan, it wouldve been reasonable for QuickQuid to take its checks further. I think QuickQuid 
shouldve been  checking Mr Ms living costs and regular credit commitments  as well as his 
income.
I think a similar level of checks shouldve been carried out before lending  loans  17 and 17a 
as this was now Mr Ms third loan in this chain of lending. And although there was a gap of 
around three  months  between the end of loan 16 and the start of loan 17/17a, I dont think 
that gap was sufficient to allow QuickQuid  reasonably believe that Mr Ms financial  
circumstances had improved.
By the time Mr M was borrowing loan 18, QuickQuid shouldve  been checking not just his 
income but shouldve been looking to build a picture  of his financial circumstances including  
verifying some of the information provide. I say this because  I think  by this stage, QuickQuid 
shouldve been  concerned that Mr M may have become reliant  on these, particularly given 
his previous borrowing history from loans  1 to 14.
There was again  a break which I consider  to be significant between the end of loan 18 and 
the start of loan 19. Loan 19 was for £300  and Mr M was due to repay around £375.  As this 
repayment was significant compared to Mr Ms declared income of £2,000, QuickQuid 
shouldve been  taking its checks further to include Mr Ms living  costs  and regular credit  
commitments before  agreeing to lend this loan.
Due to the length of time Mr M was tied into repaying  loan 20, the flex credit  account and the 
fact that his highest repayment from the hypothetical  schedule  wouldve been £325.14, 
before lending this loan,  QuickQuid shouldve been  taking its checks further  to include Mr 
Ms living costs, regular credit commitments  and any short  term commitments  he had.
So I dont  think QuickQuids checks for loans 16 to 20 went far enough.
what would  proportionate cheeks have shown?
Ive considered what QuickQuid was likely to have  found had it carried  out proportionate 
checks before agreeing  to lend some of the loans. After all, if proportionate  checks were 
likely to show that Mr M could sustainably repay the loan they wouldnt have been 
unaffordable.
This Service has asked Mr M for copies of his bank  statement to allow  us gain an 
understanding of his circumstances at the time of the loans  but hes been unable to provide 
these. Mr M has provided a copy of his credit file and also given us a break down of his 
recollection of his living costs and regular  credit commitments.
Ive thought carefully about Mr Ms testimony and how much weight to place on it. Ive also 
considered what  I think hed likely have told QuickQuid about his living  costs, regular credit  
commitments and short term credit  commitments  had it asked him about  those at the time of 
the loans. Ive also used Mr Ms credit  file to check what his credit  commitments at the time 
were.
Ref: DRN54582043Mr M has told us now that his income was £1,700 but I can see that he told QuickQuid at the 
time of these loans  that his income was £2,000 and by the time of loan 20, it was £3,000.  
Ive placed more weight on the information  Mr M gave QuickQuid about his income at the 
time because its what he chose to declare at the time. Ive also thought about what  his 
reasonable living costs might  have been  at the time. While Im unable to get a clear  picture 
of Mr Ms financial circumstances as he hasnt provided his bank statements, I can see that 
he told QuickQuid he was renting at the time and it would be reasonable to expect that he 
had rental  costs, Mr M has told us that his rent was around £300  I dont think this is 
unreasonable.
As Mr M was renting, its also reasonable to expect that he had associated housing  costs 
and other  core living expenses. Mr M has told us he spent £150  on food, £100 on utilities 
and council tax, £65 for transport and £100 for his mobile phone and broadband package. I 
think these figures are reasonable and so Ive taken them  into account as I think  QuickQuid 
is likely  to have found these out if it carried out proportionate checks.
Ive tried to align the information Mr M gave to us about his credit commitments with the 
entries on his credit  file but I cant see that all of the costs he told us were effective at the 
time of the loans  Im considering. And I cant be sure that QuickQuid would likely have found 
out about all the credit commitments hes now told us about.  What I can see is that he was 
borrowing from other short term lenders and Ive taken  account of the outstanding short term 
loans he had at the time.
So had QuickQuid  checked Mr Ms living costs at the time of loan 16, its likely to have found 
that his living  costs were  around £715 and given that he had to repay around £375 for this 
loan, Mr Ms declared income  of £2,000  shows that he could afford to repay this loan.
Similarly for loan 17/17a,  its likely  proportionate checks  wouldve shown  QuickQuid that 
Mr M was in a position to sustainably repay  this loan.  Mr Ms declared income was £2,000 
and his repayment of £125 for loan 17 and around £218 for loan 17a. Even taking into 
account his reasonable living costs, it seems Mr M could afford this loan.
At the time of loan 18 Mr M was borrowing from other short term lenders, when he took out 
this loan, but I cant see that he had any outstanding  balances to other  short term lenders 
and so its likely QuickQuid wouldve found  that he could also afford this loan.
Proportionate checks for loan 19 are also likely to have shown that Mr M could also afford  
this loan. The loan repayment was £375  and his reasonable living  costs  wouldve left him in 
a position to sustainably repay this loan.
I think that had QuickQuid carried out proportionate  checks before lending loan 20, its likely 
to have found that Mr M could sustainably repay this loan. Mr M was borrowing from other  
short term lenders  at the time and he had at least £650 outstanding to another short term 
lender, taking into account  his highest  repayment  of £325.14, his reasonable living costs and 
his declared income  of £3,000, its likely that Mr M was in a position to sustainably  repay this 
loan.
I appreciate that Mr M feels  strongly that the loans were lent irresponsibly but theres very 
limited information about  his circumstances at the time and he has asked us to look his 
complaint based  on the available information   which is what  Ive done.
Ref: DRN54582044The information thats available doesnt  lead me to conclude that QuickQuid lent Mr M loans 
that he couldnt afford. I agree with the adjudicator that on most  of the loans, QuickQuid 
shouldve taken its checks further.  But had it done so and from what  I can see, its unlikely to 
have resulted in a different lending  decision.
And so I cant conclude that QuickQuid irresponsibly lent to Mr M.
Ive considered how the flex credit account (loan 20) was used  and whether QuickQuid failed 
to act when it shouldve during the term. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT), the regulator at 
the time issued guidance to say that lenders such as QuickQuid should monitor  the 
borrowers repayment during the term of the credit  facility  and offer assistance where the 
borrower appears to be in financial difficulties.
I can see that Mr M made a total of four drawdowns. Within  a week  of opening the account,  
Mr M drew down  the maximum of £950, he repaid some of the interest and capital  of £95 in 
November 2013  and borrowed £95 in December 2013 taking  him back  to the credit  limit. 
Mr M again repaid  £95 of the capital  in January 2014 and in the same  month  borrowed the 
same amount, again taking him to his limit. Mr M missed the repayment in February 2014 
and by March  2014 QuickQuid stopped adding interest to the outstanding balance and only 
charged one late repayment fee.
QuickQuid has acted  reasonably by ceasing  to add interest  charges  after Mr M missed two 
payments and it only charged  one late repayment  fee. I can also see that it didnt continue  to 
lend when it suspected Mr M might  be in financial difficulties and when Mr M told QuickQuid 
in June 2014 about his financial difficulties, it noted  this on his account. QuickQuid was 
required to treat Mr M positively and sympathetically  and the steps its taken here persuade 
me that it did so.
Theres still an outstanding balance on the account and Id remind QuickQuid of its obligation 
to continue to deal positively and sympathetically with Mr M.
In conclusion, QuickQuid  shouldve taken it checks further before lending  some of the loans 
but based on the information available, I cant conclude that QuickQuid  lent to Mr M when he 
couldnt afford to repay. And in my opinion, QuickQuid didnt do anything wrong with the way 
it dealt with Mr M during  the course of the flex credit facility.
my final decision
I do not uphold  Mr Ms complaint and make no awards against CashEuroNet UK LLC.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 June  2019.
