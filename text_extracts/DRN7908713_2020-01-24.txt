K820x#14complaint
Mr H is unhappy with the way PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has dealt with his account.
background
Mr H sold some items by auction  on eBay. The buyer said an item arrived damaged and 
used eBays refund policy. Mr H disputes this. Hes unhappy that PayPal actioned the eBay 
funds holding request and reduced  the balance of his PayPal account.
PayPal said in its final response that when the buyer filed an eBay  claim it placed  the funds 
on hold in line with is PayPal user agreement. It was eBay that would determine the outcome 
of the dispute  not PayPal. EBay  determined that the buyers payment should  be refunded 
which it did.  
Our investigator felt this complaint  should  not be upheld. She said:
We cannot look into eBays actions as online  shopping isnt something  we can cover.  
But we can look at what PayPal  has done.
The PayPal user agreement says Mr H is responsible for all reversals or 
chargebacks incurred by PayPal. And it says he authorises PayPal  to process 
payments from his account  where  he has authorised them to do so or when eBay 
has notified them. It also authorises eBay to contact PayPal. Mr H agreed  to these 
terms.
The full value of the items was refunded out of Mr Hs PayPal account but hes only 
received one of the two items back.  PayPal received  a notification from eBay with 
very limited information about the dispute. And eBay instructed  it to place the funds 
on hold and to refund them which it did.
PayPal and eBay are separate  companies  and PayPal has no involvement  in eBay 
disputes. PayPal  acted in line with its user agreement and it wouldnt be fair to hold 
PayPal responsible here or to do anything  more.
Mr H remains  unhappy and has asked  for an ombudsman review.  He still thinks this was an 
unauthorised transaction by PayPal. He believes his consumer rights have been violated by 
eBay and questions why they arent  registered with the Financial Conduct Authority. He says 
he wants eBays abuse tackled. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As the investigator  has said eBay  and PayPal  are separate  businesses  and we can only look 
into what PayPal has done  and not eBay. And the actual dispute  between Mr H and the 
buyer is considered  by eBay, not PayPal.
If Mr H believes  eBay  has infringed his consumer rights he will need to contact  eBay directly  
about that. I also cannot consider or comment on the fact that eBay isnt registered with the 
FCA.
Ref: DRN79087132I understand Mr Hs frustration at whats happened. But I havent  seen anything to suggest  
PayPal has carried out an unauthorised  transaction by placing the funds on hold, refunding 
them or adjusting  his PayPal account  balance as Mr H suggests. PayPal has done so in line 
with the user agreement  he agreed  to. This says PayPal can accept instructions form eBay 
and that if a buyer files a claim PayPal will place a temporary hold on the funds in the PayPal 
account to cover the full amount of the claim.  And if the dispute is lost PayPal will remove 
the money from Mr Hs PayPal account. Thats  what has happened here.
Taking everything into account  I dont think PayPal has done  anything wrong. Consequently 
I dont think I can fairly  or reasonably ask it to do anything  more or differently as Mr H would 
like.
Overall, although I recognise  Mr Hs strength of feeling, I dont see any compelling reason to 
change the proposed outcome in this case.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2020.
