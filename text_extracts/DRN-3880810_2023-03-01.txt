The complaint
Mr S complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his accounts with 
immediate effect and gave no explanation. He adds this has caused him financial loss, 
adverse impact to his credit rating, and substantive distress and inconvenience  including 
severe impact to his health.  
To put things right, Mr S wants NatWest to pay him around £100,000 compensation. 
What happened
In early September 2021, Mr S received a SMS text message from NatWest saying it had 
decided it can no longer offer him the facilities he held with it. NatWests message also said 
the facilities were suspended, and he would receive a letter to advise him of this decision 
and what he needs to do next. 
Mr S says he never received a notice of closure  or any other letter from NatWest as 
promised in the text message. 
Mr S then tried to arrange a Current Account Switch Service (CASS) with another bank. 
But this was shortly rejected by the other bank as NatWest had declined to accepts its CASS 
request.  
Around this time, Mr S was given a funds release form by NatWest to complete and return to 
it so that he could withdraw the remaining money in his accounts. NatWest say Mr S 
returned the form the following day  but as he had failed to give his business details, he 
was sent a letter to complete the form again. 
NatWest say it received the recompleted form around two weeks later, on the 24 September 
2021, and Mr S withdrew funds from a local branch on 27 October 2021.  
Unhappy with NatWests actions, Mr S complained. In its response, and in summary, 
NatWest said: 
- Following a review, its decision to close the accounts remains the same 
- NatWest will not give an exact reason for why it closed the accounts, but it did so in 
line with the terms and conditions of the account 
NatWest added that the closure letter said all of Mr Ss accounts and facilities will stop which 
included overdrafts being withdrawn and standing orders and direct debits being cancelled. 
Mr S also complained that he didnt receive the closure letter. In a separate response, 
NatWest said it had identified the closure letter wasnt sent as it had previously thought. It 
apologised for any inconvenience caused. 
Mr S then referred his complaint to this service. In addition to the above complaint points, 
Mr S said NatWests actions had impacted him in the following ways: 
- He had a regular monthly direct debit in place to pay HMRC money that he owed it. 
As his account was closed in this way, he couldnt meet the payment that month. 
HMRC have subsequently rescinded the payment arrangement he had because of 
this, and hes been asked to pay the full outstanding amount of £25,000  
- As he couldnt use the CASS service, he had to set-up new regular direct debits 
manually. This was time consuming and inconvenient. Because of this, he missed 
some payments which adversely affected his credit rating 
- The funds were not returned to Mr S until a few weeks later, and he had to make 
multiple visits to the branch and complete a form 
- The closure of Mr S credit card also caused detriment to his credit rating. The impact 
on Mr S credit rating affects his ability to get a mortgage
- Mr S has been diagnosed with a serious illness which he says stems from the 
distress NatWests actions caused 
One of our Investigators then looked into Mr S complaint. In summary they found: 
- NatWest has provided information to show its reasons for closing Mr S accounts, 
and this has been sent to us in confidence. NatWest didnt act unreasonably, and did 
so based on the obligation placed on it, when closing Mr S accounts 
- NatWest can call in debts owed to it when closing accounts in this way 
- Having checked NatWests records, they could not be certain Mr S was sent an 
account closure notice letter. As NatWest didnt send the letter, this was poor 
customer service
- NatWests text message says he wont be provided a reason for the account 
closures. The template closure letter NatWest has provided shows the only additional 
information given was that any existing borrowing would need to be paid. Its 
reasonable to say Mr S would have been aware he would need to repay any debts 
owed
- As Mr S accounts were closed immediately, NatWests processes dont allow for a 
CASS to take place. But this shouldve been explained to Mr S  and as it wasnt it 
led to him trying a CASS with another bank unsuccessfully. This is poor customer 
service as it led to loss of expectation
- But NatWest isnt liable for Mr S having to move his direct debits across manually. 
Thats because NatWest acted fairly when closing his accounts immediately. And as 
Mr S knew he couldnt do a CASS as early as 8 September 2021, our Investigator 
was satisfied he knew he had to take alternative steps urgently 
- Mr S hasnt given any information which shows his credit rating was adversely 
impacted until then  
- Our Investigator hadnt seen strong enough evidence to show NatWests actions led 
to HMRC voiding its payment plan with Mr S. But as NatWest acted fairly when 
closing Mr S accounts, HMRCs decision isnt due to actions it took. So NatWest 
doesnt have to pay Mr S £25,000 
- Mr S had minimal funds in his accounts when they were closed. Its unclear why Mr S 
made a payment into his account when it was being closed. Mr S had to recomplete his funds release form, and his funds were made available three days after this by 
NatWest. But theres no evidence to show he was clearly told he could access his 
balance. Had this been done, its likely he wouldve been able to access his funds 
sooner
- Our Investigator was unable to get evidence to show Mr S visited a branch on 
multiple occasions. 
- NatWest should pay Mr S £150 for the poor customer service and administration 
issues. This takes into account the nominal funds Mr S was likely deprived of for a 
short while  
NatWest agreed with what our Investigator said. But Mr S did not and didnt think the review 
was independent. 
This complaint has now been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint in part. I know my decision is likely to 
disappoint Mr S  so Ill explain why. 
But before I do that, I would add that our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. 
We may treat evidence from banks as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if 
it contains security information, or commercially sensitive information. Some of the 
information NatWest has provided is information we consider should be kept confidential.
Account review and closure
Banks, like NatWest, in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to 
meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need to 
restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
Having looked at the information NatWest have given me for initially carrying out a review of 
Mr S accounts, Im satisfied it acted in line with the rules and regulations it must follow. So I 
dont think it did anything wrong when deciding to do this. 
NatWest is entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with it. But 
before NatWest closes an account or accounts, it must do so in a way, which complies with 
the terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions of the account, which NatWest and Mr S had to comply with, say it 
could close the account by giving him at least 60 days notice. And in certain circumstances 
it can close an account immediately or with less notice. 
Having looked at the information given to me by NatWest, Im satisfied it was entitled to 
close the accounts in the way that it has done. I note NatWest sign posted Mr S to the 
relevant terms of the account in its final response letter. Im satisfied NatWest applied these 
terms fairly.   
Mr S would like to know the specific reason why NatWest closed his accounts. But as Ive said above, this is information I consider should be kept confidential. Id also add that Im 
aware of no obligation under which either NatWest, or I, are under to disclose this. 
Closure notice and what Mr S says he was told about this 
Ive seen the text message Mr S was sent by NatWest which explained it couldnt offer him 
his account facilities anymore.  It also said NatWest was unable to discuss the rationale 
behind this decision in branch or over the phone. 
Mr S says he was told he would get the reason for the account closures in the notice to close 
letter  which he says he didnt receive. 
Ive not been able to listen to any call in which this might have been said to him. Where 
evidence isnt available, or is inconclusive, I can make my decision on what I think is most 
likely to have happened  the balance of probabilities. 
Given what the text message says about this, and given the concerns NatWest had, I think it 
very unlikely Mr S was told he would be given the reason for NatWests actions. 
In one of its complaint responses NatWest say it didnt send Mr S a notice of closure letter  
and apologised for this. In its submissions to this service, NatWest say the letter was sent 
and have sent a template of what wouldve been sent to Mr S. 
Having carefully considered this, Im not persuaded a letter was likely sent. Thats because I 
havent seen evidence enough to show a letter like this was dispatched to Mr S. The 
contradictory positions from NatWest on this point, as Ive set out above, dont do anything to 
persuade me either that one was sent. 
So I think NatWest have failed to communicate and properly inform Mr S here  this of 
course is poor customer service. 
CASS and Direct debits 
I havent seen anything which shows Mr S was told he wouldnt be able to use the account 
switching service. NatWest should therefore have done more to inform Mr S about this. Mr S 
had many direct debit payments, so I can see why this service wouldve been more than 
useful for him. It follows that NatWests lack of communication here has led to loss of 
expectation. 
Having said that, in my experience, its not uncommon for banks to not offer the CASS 
process when an account is closed with immediate effect. 
Mr S says having to reset direct debits manually with his new bank caused him 
inconvenience and led to him missing some payments on time which affected his credit 
rating adversely. 
I dont think NatWest did anything wrong by rejecting the request from Mr S new bank to 
carry out a CASS. And I can see Mr S was quickly informed about this the following day the 
request was made to NatWest by his new bank. He was informed about this on 
8 September 2021, the day after the request was made. 
Given Mr S was told his accounts were being closed in early September, and he knew he 
couldnt use the CASS process by 8 September 2021, I do question why he says his credit 
file has been adversely affected. I say that because Mr S had the whole month to make the 
payments and set-up new instructions with his new bank. Banks normally report a missed payment after the month has finished and the payment is still outstanding in the following 
month. 
So I think its most likely Mr S had enough time to resolve this matter before his credit file 
was at risk of being impacted. 
In any event, like Ive said, NatWest acted in line with its obligations when deciding to close 
Mr S accounts. So even if Mr S has suffered some detriment to his credit rating, it wasnt 
because of something NatWest did wrong. 
I should add here that Mr S hasnt sent any compelling evidence to show his credit was 
adversely affected in the way he says.  So, taken together, Im satisfied NatWest hasnt done 
anything wrong, nor made a mistake which affected Mr S in this way. 
HMRCs payment arrangement 
Mr S says his account being closed led to his regular payment to the HMRC failing in 
September 2021. Having looked at the account statement I can see a direct debit payment 
to HMRC was made on the 1 September 2021  a couple of days before NatWest decided to 
close the account. 
Because of this Im finding it difficult to understand why Mr S couldnt reinstate a payment 
with HMRC the following month with his new bank given he knew he had to do it manually 
around the 8 September 2021. 
Mr S also hasnt sent in any compelling evidence to show he missed this payment because 
of what NatWest did, nor that he was refused the opportunity to keep whatever payment 
arrangement he had with HMRC. 
Notwithstanding this, and as Ive already said, NatWest havent done anything improper 
when deciding to close Mr S account immediately. So I dont think it needs to pay Mr S 
£25,000 he says he had to pay in whole to HMRC. 
Unable to access funds 
I havent seen a copy of the funds release form Mr S initially completed and was told to 
recomplete because it didnt have his business details on there. So I cant say he was aware 
that this missing information needed to be completed. I note that once it was completed in 
the way NatWest wanted, the funds were released to Mr S three days later.
On balance and given some of the other poor customer service and communication issues 
Ive seen on NatWests part, I think its likely Mr S wasnt properly informed of what he 
needed to do to access his funds. So its likely a delay of around a couple of weeks 
prevented Mr S from withdrawing around £300 from his accounts. 
Mr S has also said that NatWests actions have led to him contracting a serious health 
condition. This is quite far removed from NatWests actions  which Ive said were not 
wrong. Nor have I seen any evidence, let alone strong evidence, that is what caused the 
condition. But as NatWest did nothing wrong in closing the accounts, Im satisfied it isnt 
responsible for any impact to Mr S health.  
Lastly, and for the sake of completeness, I have carried out my review and decision 
independently  having looked at all the evidence, and arguments, afresh. My role in 
deciding complaints is set out in the FCAs handbook under the DISP rules. This is available on the Financial Conduct Authoritys website. 
Putting things right
Ive explained above why NatWest failed to communicate adequately and thereby failed in 
providing a competent level of customer service to Mr S. 
To summarise, this was due to not showing a closure letter was sent, not likely explaining 
CASS wasnt available and causing some delay in the funds being released. 
Because of this, and the impact these actions had on Mr S in terms of distress and 
inconvenience caused, Im satisfied £150 is fair compensation. Thats because there have 
been repeated errors requiring a reasonable effort for Mr S to sort out over a few weeks. 
This award also considers the nominal loss Mr S suffered by being deprived of his funds for 
around two weeks. 
My final decision
For the reasons above, I have decided to uphold this complaint in part. I now direct National 
Westminster Bank Plc to put things right as above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 March 2023.
