K820x#14complaint
Mr M has complained that when  he looks at his National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest 
for short) account online he sometimes sees his wifes details. 
background
Mr M says that NatWest has treated him unfairly  because it should respect his confidentiality 
during his online interactions  with it and shouldnt be mixing his and his wifes bank 
accounts.
NatWest says its treated  him fairly. It says it doesnt think its done  anything wrong with 
regard to his online banking.
Mr M complained to NatWest and it said it treated him fairly.  Mr M disagrees. The 
adjudicator at this service  felt that overall  NatWest had treated him fairly. As Mr M remains  
unhappy this complaint  has been passed  to me for a decision.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered the entirety of the matter I do not think  this complaint should be upheld.  I 
say this for the following  reasons:
Im not persuaded NatWest has done  anything wrong with regard to its online systems  in Mr 
Ms case. Mr M points to a welcome  message which isnt in his name and says he cant have 
entered this message so it must be a fault with the application. However NatWest has 
persuasively shown  that the welcome  message can be changed at any time by the user 
through the settings of the application. Latterly  Mr M has accepted  that the user can alter this 
welcome message.  So I dont think this welcome message demonstrates that Mr Ms 
accounts have  been compromised.
Mr M points  to video hes submitted of using the application. However this doesnt include 
the logging on process to the application.  So it is impossible to tell whether  its being  logged 
onto correctly, which is key to this complaint around confidentiality. I appreciate Mr M doesnt 
want to video the keying in of his codes to enter his application for security reasons, which I 
fully understand.  However this process is key and as it stands the video available isnt is 
persuasive of any significant  fault by NatWest.
Mr M has said he feels like this service and NatWest think hes making  this up in order  to 
complain. As the adjudicator made  clear,  its not that this service  thinks  that Mr M is acting in 
anyway unscrupulously. I think  considering everything thats happened,  it is at least possible 
that an innocent  mistake has led to the matters arising around logging  in to NatWests 
systems.
Mr M has also suggested that NatWests refusal to share some of its internal data with Mr M 
is indicative of its bad faith. I do not agree.  NatWest  has commercial  and security  interests  in 
such information being shared. And as the information in that data has been shared with Mr 
M Im not persuaded  NatWest has done  anything wrong here.  And it should be remembered 
that in this whole situation Mr M hasnt pointed to any significant  losses  that he has suffered.
Ref: DRN50979702Overall I dont think Mr Ms comments are persuasive. He hasnt  been  able to demonstrate 
any specific instances of failings by NatWest. So all in all Im not persuaded he has been 
treated unfairly  by NatWest in the circumstances. So, in short, this complaint does not 
succeed. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I do not uphold the complaint against National Westminster 
Bank Plc.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 June 2019.
