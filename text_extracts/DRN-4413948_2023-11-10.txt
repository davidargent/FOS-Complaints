The complaint  
Mr O complains that M adison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money (118 118 Money),  
irresponsibly granted him a loan he couldnt afford to repay.  
What happened  
In January 2022 Mr O entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 118 118 Money to  
borrow £2,000, repayable in 12 monthly instalments of £213.13.  
Mr O entered into a debt management plan having sought advice about his financial  
difficulties. 118 118 Money then agreed to a payment breathing space that applied between  
June and August 2022. A notice of default was issued in September 2022. I understand the  
that the account remains in arrears.  
Mr O says that 118 118 Money didnt complete adequate affordabilit y checks when it agreed  
the loan. He says had it done so, it would have seen the loan was unaffordable to him and  
he was already in difficult financial circumstances.  
118 118 Money didnt agree. It said it carried out a reasonable and proportionate  
assessm ent to check Mr Os financial circumstances before agreeing the loan.  
Our adjudicator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. She thought 118 118 Money  
didnt act unfairly or unreasonably by approving the loan.  
Mr O didnt agree and so his complaint has been passed to me for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why  
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and  
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
118 118 Money will be familiar with all the rules, reg ulations and good industry practice we  
consider when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. So,  
I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about our  
approach to these complaints is set out on our website.  
Before providing Mr O with his loan, 118 118 Money says it carried out a credit check. This  
included asking him about his income and regular expenditure, as well as using statistical  
data and completing a credit check using credit r eference agencies. Ive seen that Mr O had  
a couple of historical credit defaults but there were no recent adverse markings on his credit  
file. The credit check showed that Mr O already owed around £3,700 in credit card debt and  
another £400 in loan debt. He had a total of around £5,000 in available credit.  
Mr O said in his application he had a monthly income of £2,000, which works out as a net 
income of just under £1,700. He also said he lived with his parents and wasnt responsible  
DRN-4413948for paying towards any monthly outgoings or other household expenses. 118 118 Money  
was satisfied that alongside its other checks, Mr O would be able to meet the  monthly  
repayments.  
 
There isnt set criteria for what a proportionate check ought to encompass. Given the size of  
the loan and the repayment period, plus the information Mr O had provided in his application,  
I think it would have been reasonable for 118 1 18 Money to have gone back to Mr O to  
check for more information about his monthly outgoings, since hed said he didnt have any,  
which does seem unlikely. But I wouldnt have expected it to carry out other checks once it  
had established that, allowing for  his existing debt and available credit, the loan was likely to  
be affordable for Mr O. It follows that I dont think 118 118 Money acted unfairly in agreeing  
to lend to Mr O.  
 
Mr O has told us he is unhappy that 118 118 Money applied a default to his accou nt 
when it fell into arrears. He says his health had suffered as a result of his financial  
circumstances and it was wrong to add the default. I am sorry to hear about the difficult  
time Mr O has been through. 118 118 Money offered support to Mr O when hed  applied  
for a breathing space, having passed his account to its specialist support team. And  
from what Ive seen the default was fairly applied to Mr Os credit file and accurately  
reflected what had been happening with his account after he fell behind with his  
repayments. So I wont be asking 118 118 Money to do anything more other than to  
continue to treat Mr O with all necessary forbearance.  
 
It follows that Im not persuaded that 118 118 Money acted unfairly in approving the loan and  
I dont think it has acted unfairly or unreasonably in the way its responded to Mr Os  
difficulties with managing his loan repayments.  
 
My final decision  
 
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint.  
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or  
reject my decision before 8 December 2023.
