K822xcomplaint
Mr C complains about the customer service hes received from NewDay  Ltd. Mr C says hes 
had direct debit issues  with funds not being taken, which  resulted in him incurring late fees. 
Mr C wants his credit card balance written off and compensation awarded to him from 
NewDay.
background 
NewDay agreed to pay Mr C £75 compensation by way of an apology for any distress and 
inconvenience he had experienced  during  this whole matter. And they refunded  him £96 of 
interest and fees which he incurred as a result of errors on his account. 
An adjudicator then reviewed the case and proposed NewDay  pay Mr C an additional £50 
compensation. NewDay agreed  to pay this additional sum. In light of Mr C not accepting this 
view, the matter has now been referred  to me for consideration. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I too have  reached  the same  outcome as 
the adjudicator,  for broadly the same  reasons. Please note whilst I have considered  all the 
issues raised, my decision focuses on what I think are the key issues  in dispute.
NewDay has acknowledged  the errors  they made in respect of Mr Cs account. Im satisfied 
that NewDay has refunded Mr C any fees or interest applied  to his account  due to this.
As the adjudicator has mentioned, when NewDay reinstated  the direct  debit,  they failed to 
set this up for the date Mr C had requested. I agree with the adjudicator that this was a 
failing on behalf  of NewDay. I too think an additional £50 compensation acknowledges this 
point. This additional  sum of compensation also acknowledges the length of time it has taken 
NewDay to resolve Mr Cs service complaint.
As the adjudicator has already explained I think NewDay did tell Mr C that he wouldnt be 
able to use his card until the payment  was showing on his account. And that if a payment 
was missed, Mr C wouldnt  be able to use his card until a payment had been made. I dont 
accept that the calls NewDay made to contact Mr C to discuss this matter were  
unreasonable. 
Mr C wanted his account placed on hold with NewDay whilst our service was looking into his 
complaint. It was clearly  explained that NewDay would not agree  to this. Mr C has told our 
service that a CCJ has now been  filed against  him. Whilst I note Mr C wants us to tell 
NewDay to write off the outstanding balance on his credit card, Im afraid Im unable to do 
this.
my final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd should  pay Mr C an additional £50 compensation. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 February  2020.
