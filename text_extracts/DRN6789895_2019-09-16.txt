Miss C complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc didnt tell her she could make early  partial  
repayments on her fixed sum loan.  She doesnt  think she should be liable to pay interest on 
the loan which she thinks is in accordance with relevant legislation.
background 
Miss C took out a five year fixed sum loan for £7,000 with HSBC  in July 2010.
She says she wasnt told she could make partial repayments on the loan until           
February 2015. She says HSBC should  have been telling her she could  do this from late 
2010/early 2011  onwards. 
Miss C believes  this requirement is based  in the Consumer Credit Act 1974  (CCA)  and 
relevant regulations, where certain agreements (including hers) were meant to comply with 
requirements relating  to the timing, form and content of annual  loan statements. 
Miss C says that because  those  requirements  were not met, the legislation  provides she is 
not liable  to pay interest on her loan between 2011  (when she says HSBC  had to tell her she 
could make early partial repayments) and 2015  (when HSBC  started  including  the relevant  
wording in her annual statements). 
I issued a provisional decision in August 2019  where I set out why I didnt think  Miss Cs 
complaint should  be upheld.  An extract of this is attached and forms part of my final 
decision. 
Overall, I didnt  think the relevant legislation entitled Miss C to a refund of interest. So taking 
account of this and the wider circumstances of the complaint, I didnt think  it would be fair to 
ask HSBC to refund  interest on Miss Cs loan. HSBC offered  Miss C £150  compensation for 
the time it took to give her an answer to her complaint. I thought  this was fair in the 
circumstances. 
HSBC agreed with my provisional decision.  Miss C did not. In summary, she explained she 
did not understand how she had the right to make early partial repayments but did not have 
to be told she could  do this. She also said shed like to know why HSBC started amending  
statements in 2015 onwards to include the wording if there  was no obligation to do it. 
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss C questions why the relevant legislation would give her a right to make partial early 
repayments on her loan but no obligation to be told about it. I get Miss Cs frustrations with 
this. But the legislation only makes her not liable for interest on her loan in if HSBC failed to 
meet the form and content requirements  set out in section 77A Consumer Credit Act 
(S77A). This is a remedy that is specific to the legislation. Without a breach  of S77A (which 
there isnt in this case)  I dont find I could fairly ask HSBC to refund all of the interest she 
paid on her loan from 2011 to 2015.  
Ref: DRN67898952And even  if (irrespective  of the fact she was not entitled to a refund under  the legislation)  I 
were to conclude that HSBC should  have told Miss C about her right to make early  partial  
payments, I dont think the appropriate remedy in her case  would be a full refund of interest 
from 2011 to 2015.  Especially when there  is no way of knowing in this case what Miss C 
might have repaid  early  or when.  If I had have reached that conclusion  I think  the £150 
HSBC paid Miss C would still have covered the disappointment she might  have suffered 
here in any event.
Miss C asks why HSBC started  including the relevant wording about early partial settlement 
from 2015 onwards.  But I dont  think this means  it needed to do this then or indeed  from 
2011 for the reasons Ive already explained.
So having  thought about everything again, including Miss Cs comments since  my decision,  I 
still dont think HSBC  needs to do any more than it already has. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above, my final decision is that HSBC  UK Bank Plc has paid    
Miss C fair compensation for her complaint.  Under  the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman 
Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept  or reject my decision  before 16 October 2019.

complaint
Miss C complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc didnt tell her she could make early  partial  
repayments on her fixed sum loan.  She doesnt  think she should be liable to pay interest on 
the loan which she thinks is in accordance with relevant legislation.
background 
Miss C took out a five year fixed sum loan for £7,000 with HSBC  in July 2010.
She says she wasnt told she could make partial repayments on the loan until           
February 2015. She believes  HSBC should  have  been  telling  her she could do this from late 
2010 onwards.  
Miss C believes  this requirement is based  in the Consumer Credit Act 1974  and relevant 
regulations, where  certain agreements (including  hers) were meant to comply  with 
requirements relating  to the timing, form and content of annual  loan statements. Miss C says 
that because those requirements  were not met, the legislation provides she is not liable to 
pay interest on her loan for a certain period.  
Our investigator didnt  think Miss Cs complaint should be upheld. She said she didnt think  
the regulations  Miss C was relying  on applied  to her agreement because  they didnt come  
into force  until after Miss Cs agreement started. 
Miss C didnt agree with the investigator and asked for an ombudsman to look into her 
complaint. She said the relevant regulations gave her the right to make  partial  early  
repayments on her agreement from at least November 2010  so HSBC should  have  told her 
about this at the time. 
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   
Miss Cs complaint centres  on the interpretation  of the law relating to the content of certain  
loan statements. Ultimately I am required to decide Miss Cs complaint by reference  to what  
is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. But I am obliged to take the law and regulations 
into account in doing this  although I do not apply it directly here. 
Consumer Credit Act 1974
The core legislation  Miss C refers to is section 77A Consumer Credit  Act 1974 (S77A).  
Relevant parts of this provide that:
(1) The creditor under  a regulated agreement for fixed-sum  credit  must give the 
debtor statements under this section
(1A) The statements must  relate to consecutive periods

(1C) No such period may exceed  a year.
Ref: DRN67898954(1E) Each statement  under this section must  be given to the debtor before the end 
of the period  of thirty  days  beginning with the day after the end of the period 
to which the statement  relates.
(2) Regulations may make provision  about  the form and content of statements 
under this section
Miss Cs original agreement is not available. From  HSBCs records  I see that it was a loan 
for £7,000  for home improvements with a 60 month term.    Therefore, on balance,  I consider 
HSBC made  a fixed sum loan to Miss C for the amount of £7,000,  which satisfied the 
definition of a regulated  credit agreement, and which was not open-ended  because it was for 
a fixed duration of 60 months.  So, relevant  legislation says HSBC had to send Miss C annual  
statements for her loan and those  statements  had to contain certain information  to comply 
with S77A. Miss C says the statements she received  from HSBC didnt contain the 
information required to comply with S77A until 2015. 
Subsections (4), (5), (6) and (7) of S77A  set out what happens when a business  fails to give 
a statement  in accordance with S77A.  These  provide  that:
(4) The creditor is not required to give the debtor any statement under this section  
once the following conditions are satisfied
(a) that there  is no sum payable under the agreement by the debtor; and
(b) that there  is no sum which will or may become so payable.
(5) Subsection (6) applies  if at a time before the conditions mentioned  in subsection 
(4) are satisfied the creditor fails to give the debtor
(a) a statement under this section within the period mentioned in subsection  [(1E)]
(6)Where this subsection applies in relation to a failure to give a statement under 
this section to the debtor-
(a)the creditor shall not be entitled  to enforce the agreement during the period of 
non-compliance;
(b)the debtor shall have  no liability  to pay any sum of interest to the extent 
calculated by reference to the period of non-compliance or to any part of it; and
(c)the debtor shall have  no liability  to pay any default sum which (apart  from this 
paragraph) -
(i) would have  become payable during the period of non-compliance; or
(ii) would have  become payable after the end of that period in connection 
with a breach  of the agreement which occurs  during  that period 
(whether or not the breach continues after the end of that period)
(7) In this section the period  of non-compliance means, in relation to a failure to give 
a statement  under this section  to the debtor, the period which 
Ref: DRN67898955(a) begins immediately  after the end of the period mentioned in [...] 5 subsection (5); 
and 
(b) ends at the end of the day on which the statement  is given to the debtor or on 
which the conditions  mentioned in subsection (4) are satisfied, whichever is 
earlier.
So, if HSBC  failed to comply with the requirements in S77A, The Consumer Credit Act sets 
out that Miss C wouldnt be liable to pay interest  or default charges during the period the 
correct statements were  not sent up until the point that they were.  
2007 and 2010 regulations
Miss C says that under the Consumer Credit (EU Directive) Regulations 2010/1010         
(the 2010 regulations) HSBC  was required to include specific  wording  in her annual  loan 
statements explaining  that she could make partial early repayments  towards  her loan. She 
says HSBC was required  to do this in the first annual statement it gave her after                   
1 November 2010. Miss C says HSBC didnt do this so it failed to comply  with the form and 
content requirements in S77A  (2) and she shouldnt have  been  liable to pay HSBC  any 
interest on her loan from then until 2015 when HSBC started sending compliant  statements. 
Ive carefully considered  the relevant regulations. 
The form and content requirements referenced in S77A  (2) are set out in the Consumer 
Credit (Information Requirements and Duration  of Licences and Charges) Regulations 2007 
(the 2007 regulations).  These set out (amongst other things) specific  wording which had to 
be included  in annual  loan statements.
The 2010  regulations amended the 2007 regulations. Regulation  91A was inserted  into the 
2010 Regulations by regulation 27 of the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Regulations 
2010/1969 (regulation 91A). Regulation 91A of the 2010 regulations introduced  new 
wording in the 2007 regulations that had to be contained in annual  loan statements in 
relation to partial early repayments. This is set out as follows:
91A.  Consumer Credit  (Information Requirements and Duration of Licences and 
Charges) Regulations  2007
In paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the Consumer Credit (Information Requirements  and 
Duration of Licences and Charges) Regulations  2007-

(c) at the end insert
You can also settle this agreement in part at any time by giving notice and 
paying off some of the amount you owe.
So the key issue  is when regulation 91A of the 2010  Regulations came into force.
The 2010  regulations came into force in accordance  with regulations 99, 101 and 101A. 
Regulation 99 provides that the 2010 Regulations come into force  on 1 February 2011, with 
Ref: DRN67898956some exceptions which arent relevant here.  But Miss Cs agreement  started  before              
1 February 2011,  on 7 July 2010. 
Regulation 100 of the 2010 regulations deals with the application  of regulations  to 
agreements entered  into before 1 February  2011, so, for agreements  already in existence 
before the 2010 regulations came into force: 
100. Application of regulations to agreements  entered into before 1st February  2011  
(1)Subject to paragraphs (2) to (5) and Regulations  101 and 101A these Regulations 
apply only to a regulated consumer credit  agreement  entered into on or after          
1 February 2011. [my emphasis added]
I have carefully examined the paragraphs  and regulations that regulation  100(1) is subject 
to. 
Regulation 100 (4) lists a number of the 2010  Regulations which apply to regulated 
consumer credit agreements which are not open-ended and were entered into on or after   
11 June 2010  but before the general  coming into force date for the 2010 regulations of         
1 February 2011.  So I think  this would apply to Miss Cs loan taken out in July 2010. In 
essence, it would appear that regulation 100 (4) contains transitional provisions setting out 
how the new regulations would affect loans which were taken out shortly  before the 2010 
regulations came into force:
4) The following regulations apply (from 1st February 2011) to a regulated consumer 
credit agreement  which is not an open-end agreement and is entered into on or after 
11th June 2010 and before 1st February 2011  
(a) regulation 25 (linked credit agreements);
(b) regulation 26 (statement of account);
(c) regulations 29 to 35 (early repayment);
(d) regulation 36 (assignment);
(e) regulation 46 (amendments  to Enterprise  Act 2002);
(f) regulations 59 to 62 (amendments to Consumer Credit  (Settlement Information) 
Regulations 1983);
(g) regulation 69 (amendments  to Enterprise  Act 2002 (Part 8 Community  Infringements 
Specified UK Laws)  Order 2003);
(h) regulations 77 to 84 (amendments to Consumer Credit  (Early Settlement) 
Regulations 2004).
Regulation 100 (4) (c) says it applies regulations  (29 to 35) giving the debtor the right to 
make early  partial repayments  to agreements entered into on or after 11 June 2010 and 
before 1 February 2011. So it seems Miss C was entitled to make early  repayments from     
Ref: DRN678989571 February 2011  because  her loan wasnt an open-end agreement and was entered  into 
between 11 June 2010 and 1 February 2011.  But regulation  100 (4) doesnt  mention 
regulation 91A which contains the wording  about early partial repayments to be inserted into 
the annual statements.  So I cant  see from the legislation that regulation  91A was specified  
as one of the regulations which would apply to agreements entered  into between 11 June 
2010 and 1 February 2011.  
A business could  become subject to the 2010  regulations (become compliant) either all in 
one go or on a product by product basis before 1 February 2011. Once it did this it had to 
comply with all of the relevant 2010  regulations for relevant agreements  entered into after 
the date of compliance. HSBC says it became compliant in November 2010.  But this was 
also after Miss Cs agreement started,  so regulation 91A still wouldnt apply to her 
agreement because it wasnt  a new agreement entered into on or after HSBC became 
compliant in November 2010.
Ive also considered some of the guidance  and commentary on the regulations.  
The department of Business, Innovation  and Skills (BIS) guidance on the regulations 
explains that:
3. COMMENCEMENT  AND TRANSITIONAL  PROVISIONS

3.2 All regulated consumer credit agreements  that are entered  into on or after 1 
February 2011 will need to comply  with the new regime  []
3.3 In addition, certain pre-existing  agreements will need to comply with some of the 
new requirements from 1 February 2011, depending upon  when the agreement  was 
entered into and whether it is open-ended(regulation 100(2)-(4) of the EU Directive 
Regulations). [my emphasis added]

3.5 A creditor or credit  intermediary may decide  to move to the new regime  all at one 
go. Alternatively, it may do so on a product-by-product basis, or some companies in a 
group may move earlier  than others.  It will not however be open to firms to comply  
with old CCA  rules in respect of one aspect of an agreement, and new CCA rules in 
respect of the remainder. The transition for an individual agreement is all or nothing.

Requirements which  will apply from 1 February  2011 to other agreements  
entered into between 11 June 2010 and 31 January  2011
3.9 Regulation 100(4) provides that from 1 February  2011,  certain  requirements  will 
apply to agreements  entered into between 11 June 2010 and 31 January 2011 which 
are not open-end agreements. These  are requirements:
 on secondary liability of the creditor under certain linked credit agreements  
(regulation 25 of the EU Directive Regulations),
 to provide  a statement  of account on request under a fixed-sum  credit  
agreement (regulation 26),
 to allow partial early settlements at any time during the life of the 
agreement, to provide a rebate in the event of partial early settlement 
(subject to compensation in appropriate cases) and to provide information on 
request following a partial early settlement, with corresponding changes to the 
Ref: DRN67898958regime for full early settlement (regulations 29 to 35, 59 to 62 and 77 to 84), 
and
 to notify the borrower of an assignment of rights under the agreement 
(regulation 36). [my emphasis added]
I think all of this reinforces  that some of the 2010  regulations did apply to agreements that 
came into force before 1 February 2011, or before the date a business became compliant, 
but not all of them. And nothing within the BIS guidance makes me think  that regulation  91A 
was one of these regulations. 
With all of this in mind, I do not think that the obligation within  regulation 91A to include 
wording about  early partial repayments  in annual  statements applied  to Miss Cs loan 
agreement. Regulation 100 (4) of the 2010  regulations sets out a defined list of regulations  
which do apply to certain existing agreements, but regulation 91A, is not on that list. So, 
although Miss C had the right to make  early partial  repayments, I dont  think HSBC had to 
include specific wording about  Miss Cs right to do this in any of her annual statements.
Miss C has pointed out another section of the same  BIS guidance  Ive referred  to above:
3.6 firms should  ensure that it is clear  to borrowers what rights  and obligations  
apply under the agreement. A firm should not mislead, whether  by inclusion or 
omission, contrary to the CPRs.
CPRs refer to The Consumer Protection  from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. Ive thought 
about what this means  for Miss Cs agreement. Miss C is not liable to pay interest or default 
sums on her loan under S77A where  a business has either  failed to provide statements 
within the time limits set out or where  those  statements dont comply with the form and 
content requirements set out by regulations. Ive already concluded that the specific  
regulation, regulation 91A, relating to wording  about  early partial repayment in annual  
statements didnt apply  to Miss Cs agreement. So while 3.6 of the BIS guidance does 
explain  that firms should ensure its clear what rights apply under an agreement, I dont 
think it requires HSBC  to include wording about  early partial  repayments  in annual 
statements or that a failure to do this is a breach of S77A. 
timing of annual statements
Another requirement of S77A was that HSBC  had to send Miss C annual  statements. HSBC 
says it didnt do this in 2014. S77A  (1E) CCA sets out that a statement under this section 
must be given to the debtor before the end of the period of thirty days beginning with the 
day after the end of the period to which  the statement relates.  Miss Cs 2012/2013  
statement covered  from 17 December 2012 to 16 December  2013. So her 2013/2014 
statement should have  covered 17 December  2013 until 16 December 2014. This means the 
latest date that HSBC  should have sent Miss C her next annual  statement was 15 January 
2015. It didnt  send one until 12 February  2015. So it failed to comply with the requirement in 
S77A to send  Miss C annual statements. 
In accordance with S77A  (7) CCA  the period of non-compliance would  have begun  on             
16 January 2015  and Miss C would not have been  liable to pay interest on her loan until a 
statement was given  to her on 12 February 2015.
Ref: DRN67898959HSBC says that Miss C had no more interest to pay on the loan at this point  so there  is 
nothing to refund her. Ive seen a breakdown of the interest on Miss Cs loan account and 
she had indeed paid all of the interest  at this point. And Ive not seen anything that makes 
me think Miss C was charged any default sums during the period of non-compliance, nor 
that HSBC tried to enforce the agreement. So I dont  think,  fairly  and reasonably it needs to 
do anything more in respect of this failure to comply with S77A. 
So, all in all, having concluded that I dont think HSBC has failed  to meet  the timing, form or 
content requirements for annual loan statements under S77A, I do not think it would be fair 
or reasonable to require it to refund any of the interest Miss C paid on her loan. And Ive not 
seen any other reason  in this complaint why it would be fair to do this either. I appreciate that 
Miss C will be disappointed about  this. But it reflects the fact that her loan agreement  with 
HSBC was entered into during a transitional  period, when some  of the new rules  which  came  
into force  did not apply  to Miss Cs loan.
HSBC offered to pay Miss C £150  for the time it took to give her an answer about whether 
she was due a refund on her loan. It did take a long time and I can well understand how 
frustrating this must have  been for Miss C. But I think  this is fair compensation for the 
distress and inconvenience Miss C has been caused. I understand HSBC  has already sent 
Miss C a cheque for this amount.  
my provisional decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above I intend  to make a final decision that the compensation 
of £150 that HSBC UK Bank Plc has paid Miss C is fair and that it need does not need to do 
anything more.
