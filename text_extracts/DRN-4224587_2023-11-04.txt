The complaint
Mr A complains about how National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) dealt with his 
mortgage redemption.
What happened
Mr A says he went to a NatWest branch in October 2022 to arrange a payment to redeem 
his mortgage. He accepts he left the branch to attend a different bank before returning to 
NatWest. Mr A says he told a member of staff to proceed with the transaction before leaving. 
He says the transaction was not processed and as a result he paid over £364 in extra 
interest. Mr A would like that interest refunded and compensation for what took place.
NatWest says Mr A left the branch to attend a different branch which was closed and 
accepts he returned to the branch. It says Mr A told a different staff member, to the one he 
dealt with earlier, to process the transaction but says Mr A then left. NatWest says Mr A 
needed to remain to complete and authorise what it says was a large payment.
Mr A brought his complaint to us, and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought NatWest was entitled to follow its process and that Mr A hadnt remained in branch 
for that to be completed.
Mr A doesnt accept that view and maintains all the paperwork was completed. He says he 
waved at the staff member telling her to process the transaction.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr A will be disappointed by my decision.
There is no dispute here that Mr A left the NatWest branch before the transaction was 
completed and went to his other bank. And that Mr A then returned to the NatWest branch. I 
appreciate Mr A says he told a staff member to carry out the transaction before leaving. But 
Im satisfied that NatWest had a process to follow and needed Mr A to stay at the branch in 
order to follow that process.
Im also satisfied that Mr A wished to make a significant transaction to redeem his mortgage 
and it is reasonable to have expected him to remain in the branch to make sure it was 
processed appropriately. I dont think that NatWest made a mistake or acted unfairly by not 
processing a transaction started earlier that day when Mr A waved at a staff member 
instructing that person to process it. I also dont think, by Mr A leaving the branch, that 
NatWest had an opportunity to explain to Mr A what its process was and why it required him 
to remain at the branch.
Overall, I find it was Mr As decision to leave the NatWest branch before confirming the 
transaction was completed and before NatWest could carry out its correct process. It follows 
that I cant fairly order NatWest refund the extra interest Mr A paid or pay him compensation 
in these circumstances. I dont think all the paperwork was completed as Mr A suggests and 
find its up to NatWest to decide what information and authority it requires before processing 
what I have said was a relatively large payment of over £300,000. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2023.
