The complaint
Mr J makes a number of complaints about NewDay Ltd.
What happened
Mr J makes three main complaints about NewDay. He says it told him it was increasing the 
interest rate which he says was unnecessary as interest rates generally havent increased. 
He complains that he received new PIN despite not asking for one and would like to keep his 
existing one. And that a transaction was blocked but NewDay wrote to him some days later 
rather than contact him by other means. Mr J says NewDays actions have caused him 
stress and anxiety and he would like compensation for whats taken place.
NewDay says its entitled to change the interest rate in line with account terms and 
conditions but accepts the letter was sent in error. It has apologised and says Mr Js account 
interest rate will not change. NewDay cant explain why the new PIN was sent and says Mr J 
could change it to a PIN of his choice at an ATM. And it says it blocked the transaction and 
tried to call Mr J but doesnt attempt contact by methods other than letter in those 
circumstances. NewDay has paid Mr J £10 compensation for what took place.
Mr J brought his complaint to us and our investigator thought NewDay was entitled to 
increase the interest rate but thought it acted fairly by apologising for the letter and for the 
new PIN being sent. The investigator thought NewDay could have considered alternative 
methods of contacting Mr J and thought overall he had been caused inconvenience. And 
recommended NewDay increase its compensation offer to £75.
NewDay doesnt accept that view and says its actions didnt cause Mr J any financial loss or 
affect his credit file.
Mr J also doesnt accept that view and says he should be awarded compensation of at least 
£220.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the overall view that NewDay should pay further 
compensation for the reasons I will explain.
I have looked at Mr Js account terms and conditions which I think he would have agreed to 
when the account was opened. Those terms and conditions make clear that NewDay can, by 
giving appropriate notice, increase or reduce the interest rate. So, Im satisfied NewDay is 
entitled to increase the interest rate and I dont think it matters that interest rates generally 
may not have increased. But there is no question here that NewDay made a mistake by 
telling Mr J that it was increasing the interest rate and I appreciate he was caused some 
inconvenience by trying to find out what the correct position was.
I also accept that Mr J would have been caused further inconvenience by the change to his 
PIN when he didnt ask for a new PIN. I appreciate that Mr J can change that PIN fairly 
easily, but I also think he would have spent some time again trying to find out why it was 
sent.
I appreciate that on occasions legitimate transactions can be blocked by a bank or building 
society. I accept in those circumstances that legitimate customers are caused 
inconvenience, but I also think that a business has a duty to protect its and its customers 
money. So, I dont think NewDay acted unfairly by blocking Mr Js transaction where it had 
security concerns. Im also satisfied that it tried to speak to Mr J about it but was unable to 
do so. I think its up to NewDay to decide in those circumstances how it communicates with 
its customers when it takes into account its security and fraud policies. So, I dont think 
NewDay acted unfairly by writing to Mr J about the transaction. And in any event I can see 
that it was authorised, and Mr J didnt suffer any financial loss.
Overall Im satisfied NewDay has fairly apologised for the incorrect information about the 
interest rate and for what took place with the PIN. Im also satisfied that Mr J hasnt suffered 
any financial loss as a result or that the inconvenience was particularly significant. But I dont 
think £10 compensation is fair and reasonable and I dont think it takes into account the 
length of time Mr J would have spent trying to find out what had taken place. For those 
reasons I think NewDay should increase its compensation offer to a total of £75 which I think 
is fair and reasonable and fairly reflects whats taken place.
Putting things right
I intend to order NewDay to increase its compensation by £65 to £75.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and order NewDay Ltd to pay a further 
£65 compensation to Mr J.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2020.
