Mr C says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading as Sunny  irresponsibly lent to him.

and April 2018. Mr Cs borrowing history is as follows:

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Cs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 3 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because he had a few loans with Sunny as well as other short-
term lenders. Sunny  disagreed and said it had done  robust checks on Mr C before lending to 
him. It also said even though Mr C had loans outstanding, he was only borrowing over a 
short period  of time and repaid some of his loans early.
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN21074732the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint. Having done  so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 and 2. Mr C 
didnt respond  to the view. As there is no dispute with the adjudicators opinion about  these 
loans, I wont be making  any findings  on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 3 to Mr C and the results of these checks 
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Cs third loan in just over two months  and for a 
larger amount, I think Sunny should  have been  looking  to build a clearer  picture about  Mr Cs 
finances before lending  him this loan.  
Had Sunny  carried  out proportionate checks before lending loan 3, its likely to have found 
that Mr C was borrowing  from other short-term lenders as well as having out-standing loans 
with Sunny itself.  The repayments for these  loans would have been  increasing his monthly 
outgoings. 
I think the fact Mr C repaid his loans much earlier than planned should have caused  some 
concern to Sunny. As that might  be the sort of behaviour that would indicate someone was 
facing problems managing their money  and needing to refinance  loans on a regular basis.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because at this point Sunny ought  to have realised Mr C was not managing  to repay  his 
loans sustainably. Mr C had taken  out 6 loans  within less than six months. So Sunny ought 
to have realised it was more likely that Mr Cs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
Ref: DRN21074733He also wasnt really  making any inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Mr C had paid large 
amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny provided  borrowing for loan 6 because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period.
The length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 3, 4 and 5;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 to 5 from Mr Cs credit file;
any information recorded about  loan 6 is adverse. So, all entries about loan 6 should 
be removed from Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr C a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 February  2020.
