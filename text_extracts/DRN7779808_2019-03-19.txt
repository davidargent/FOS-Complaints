K820x#14complaint
L, a business  partnership, complains that Lloyds Bank PLC did not treat its financial 
difficulties fairly.
background
L had a secured business loan and overdraft  from Lloyds.  In March 2017  arrears in 
payments started  to develop on the loan.  In May 2017 the borrowing was moved  to the 
business support  team  at Lloyds. L said that it planned to sell some land that was not 
charged to Lloyds. This did not complete by December 2017  as expected. There  were 
further attempts  at sale but in June 2018 the overdraft was reduced resulting in unauthorised  
borrowing. And Lloyds  made formal  demand in July 2018 and transferred the borrowing to its 
recoveries department in August 2018.
Our investigator did not recommend that the complaint he upheld. He said that:
-The loan was in arrears and this was an event of default. Lloyds had allowed L time 
to clear the arrears  and reduce  borrowing.
-He appreciated  the difficulties that L had with the sale. But this was not guaranteed 
and at the time formal demand was made  there were 10 months of loan arrears  
outstanding.
-He understood  that L said that if Lloyds had increased the overdraft again  then it 
could have paid the arrears. But that would not have  reduced overall  borrowing.
-The relationship  manager at Lloyds  had clearly summarised the position  for L on 9 
July 2018. L said he had not responded to further  emails or calls.  The service  from 
Lloyds could have  been better. However,  Lloyds had made a commercial  decision 
about the borrowing.
L did not agree. The partners said that Lloyds had never made clear that the overdraft would 
not be renewed again at the previous amount in June 2018.  If Lloyds  had said this before an 
auction in April 2018, then the land would not have been withdrawn from sale there.  The 
email from the relationship manager on 9 July 2018  admitted he had not seen an email from 
L. And Lloyds did not respond to further  contact. L said that it was harsh for Lloyds to make 
demand when  the land sale was delayed. Given the severity of the position a manager  from 
Lloyds should  have visited the partnership.  As a result of the service failings L asked that its 
facilities be reinstated.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our investigator has set out the background to what happened. I can see from the complaint 
form that L accepts that it agreed in April 2017  to sell the land. This would release funds to 
pay other creditors, reduce the overdraft from £120,000 to £90,000 and clear any arrears  to 
the loan. A sale fell through in December 2017.  The land was then put in the next available  
auction in April 2018. It was taken out of the auction  as a local purchaser promised to 
complete immediately. L said it did not know then that the overdraft would not be renewed at 
the original level.
timeline
Ref: DRN77798082Im going  to refer to some of the key events and emails in 2018  as these are important to the 
complaint:
-23 March 2018 - overdraft extended  to 4 June  2018. L had said to Lloyds that the 
completion date after the auction  sale was 14 May 2018.  
-30 April 2018 - the completion  date for a sale was confirmed by L as 11 May 2018.
-9 May 2018 - email from Lloyds reminding L that overdraft would reduce.
-25 May 2018 - Lloyds  writes to L and says overdraft will reduce to £90,000 on 4 June 
2018 and will then be at this level until 4 December  2018.  The then nine payments of 
the loan in arrears  needed to be covered.
-6 June 2018 - Lloyds  writes to L and asks why completion has not happened  and the 
overdraft is £30,000 over the limit.
-10 June 2018  - L says sale is taking longer to complete then it was led to believe.  
The absolute deadline was 29 June 2018. L says it will contact the estate agent and 
solicitor for an update  and give this to Lloyds
-14 June 2018  - L writes to Lloyds saying  it has not had a direct update but 
understands things  are on track.  Lloyds responds to L saying it will need  a new 
completion date from the solicitor  before  it can consider extending the overdraft.
-27 June 2018  - Lloyds writes to L saying  it still needs the revised completion date so 
it can consider restoring the facility.
-3 July 2018 - L writes to Lloyds saying that it had responded on 14 June 2018 but not 
on secure email. The completion  date deadline was 29 June 2018 but the purchasers 
had not got funding. An extension to the end of July 2018  was requested.
-9 July 2018 - Lloyds  writes to L saying that an earlier  email  was not received. The 
arrears on the loan were carried on the basis that they were cleared by the end of 
June 2018. Formal demands would be issued.
-9 July 2018 - L responds to say there  might  be an exchange and completion that 
week. Or if it not it has another buyer.
-12 July 2018  - Lloyds  issues  formal demand letters to all the partners.
-Further contact - L says it also sent an email on 19 July 2018  and got no response.  L 
later missed a returned call from the relationship  manager who left a message saying 
that the borrowing was now in the hands of the recovery department.
assessment
Ive set out the events leading to demand being  made on the loan and overdraft in some  
detail as these  are important in assessing the key complaint points.
Lloyds had renewed the overdraft in March 2018  for a relatively short  period.  Im persuaded 
this was done on the basis that the land would be sold in auction  by the time it expired. I 
cant see any assurances that the overdraft would be extended  again.  I accept  it had before 
but this time Lloyds  had written to L twice in May 2018 saying the reduction would happen.
My assessment is that Lloyds wanted a firm completion date before it would consider a 
further extension  of the overdraft. Ive seen that L wrote to Lloyds about this but the email 
Ive seen does  not give absolute assurance. And in any event the sale did not complete as L 
expected. Lloyds knew before it made  demand that the overdraft extension  request was now 
to the end of July 2018. It is clear it was not prepared to accept this and it explained the 
reasons for making demand. There is no record of it responding to further  emails.  My 
understanding is that it was not going  to change its approach. I can appreciate as L said this 
was a very stressful time for the partners. 
Ref: DRN77798083Im afraid I am going to disappoint L with my decision on this complaint. I find that Lloyds 
fairly gave  L an extended period to address  arrears  and reduce  borrowing. L had not been 
able to give any firm date by which this would happen. It was Ls decision  to remove the 
property from auction and it still thought it would sell the property. I dont doubt it now regrets 
that decision and unfortunately  the alternative  sale did not happen in the expected timescale. 
Arrears on the loan were  increasing and I agree with our investigator that even if this had 
been allowed  to be covered by a restored overdraft that would  not have addressed the 
problem. Even though  the position on the sale was not guaranteed by the end of June 2018 
Lloyds took no recovery action that month. However  a further loan payment was missed on 3 
July 2018 and then Lloyds  decided  it could no longer support the borrowing. This message 
was clearly distressing  for the partners. My view is that Lloyds did not intend  to change that 
decision and thats likely  why it did not respond  at first to any further  emails  from L.
In my judgement any shortcomings in that subsequent communication are not to the extent 
that theres a basis for me to find Lloyds should  be required to change its approach to 
dealing with Ls borrowing. I find it dealt with the borrowing in a reasonable way and so I 
wont be requiring it to take any further  action on this complaint.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 April 2019.
