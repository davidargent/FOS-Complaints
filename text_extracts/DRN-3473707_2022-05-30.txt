The complaint
Mr O complains about how Capital One (Europe) plc (Capital One) dealt with a payment 
dispute he had with a company that he paid £195.00 to using his credit card.
What happened
On 9 May 2021 Capital One sent Mr O his May credit card statement. This had an 
outstanding balance of £nil.
On 19 May 2021 Mr O paid a company that I will call B £195.00 for a repair to a car part 
using his credit card. 
Mr O was then advised by B that he had to pay, or might have to pay, a further £195.00 for 
his requested repair. Mr O wasnt happy with this so decided to cancel his original repair 
order with B and to ask it for a refund of the £195.00 he had paid on 19 May.
On 1 June 2021, and with B having refused Mr Os refund request, Mr O approached 
Capital One for assistance in securing the same.
On 9 June 2021 Capital One sent Mr O his June credit card statement. This had an 
outstanding balance of £202.99 (inclusive of the £195.00 purchase from B).
On 9 July 2021 Capital One sent Mr O his July card statement. This had an outstanding 
balance of £207.90 (inclusive £4.91 interest).
On 9 August 2021 Capital One sent Mr O his August credit card statement. This had an 
outstanding balance of £217.08 (inclusive of a £12.00 charge and £5.17 interest).
On 12 August 2021 Capital One credited Mr Os credit card with a £12.00 refund.
On 7 September 2021 Capital One raised a chargeback with Bs bank and credited Mr Os 
credit card with a £195.00 refund.
On 8 September 2021 Capital One credited Mr Os credit card with a £10.13 refund.
On 9 September 2021 Capital One sent Mr O his September credit card statement. This had 
an outstanding balance of £12.19 (inclusive of the above credits, a £12.00 charge and £0.24 
interest).
On 9 October 2021 Capital One sent Mr O his October credit card statement. This had an 
outstanding balance of £24.20 (inclusive of a £12.00 charge and £0.01 interest).
On 9 November 2021 Capital One sent Mr O his November credit card statement. This had 
an outstanding balance of £26.44 (inclusive of a £12.00 charge and £0.24 interest).
On 9 December 2021 Capital One sent Mr O his December credit card statement. This had 
an outstanding balance of £48.99 (inclusive of a £12.00 charge and £0.55 interest).
On 30 December 2021 Capital One credited Mr Os credit card with £36.44, £0.55 and 
£12.00 in refunds.
On 9 January 2022 Capital One sent Mr O his January credit card statement. This had an 
outstanding balance of £nil (inclusive of the above credits).
Capital One provided our service with details of information it had provided third party 
reference agencies between January 2021 and April 2022. This shows the following 
information was reported and recorded:
Date Payment Status Account Status
To and including July 2021 0 OK
August 2021 1 AA
September 2021 0 OK
October 2021 1 AA
November 2021 2 AA
From and including December 2021 0 OK
Mr O confirmed to our service that because of the way Capital One had treated him and 
dealt with his payment dispute (including chasing him for payment, charging him for late 
and/or missed payments and recording adverse information with third party credit reference 
agencies) he was looking for, in addition to a refund of £195.00 plus associated charges and 
interest, £600 in compensation.
Mr Os complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that 
Capital One had done nothing wrong.
Mr O didnt agree and so his complaint has been passed to me for review and decision.
After this complaint was passed to me for review (and decision) I asked the investigator to 
get some further information from Mr O. However, this information wasnt provided to our 
service by the date given. However, Im satisfied that I dont need this information to fairly 
and reasonably decide this complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear Mr O has very strong feelings about this complaint. He has provided detailed 
submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their 
entirety. However, I trust that Mr O will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I 
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as 
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The purpose 
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them. 
I would also point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or 
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities. 
did Capital One take too long to deal with Mr Os payment dispute?
Mr O raised his payment dispute with Capital One on 1 June 2021 and Capital one raised a 
chargeback with Bs bank on 7 September 2021, a period of just over three months. Given what Capital One needed to be in receipt of before making a chargeback claim 
against Bs bank, and the time taken for Capital One to be in receipt of this information, Im 
satisfied there was no material delays on Capital Ones part in dealing with Mr Os payment 
dispute.
For the sake of completeness, I would add that I cant see that Mr O has been prejudiced in 
Capital One dealing with his payment dispute as a chargeback, rather than as a section 75 
claim. This is because I cant see that a successful section 75 claim would have resulted in a 
better outcome for Mr O than the one achieved by Capital One dealing with his payment 
dispute as a chargeback.
has Capital One adequately dealt with Mr Os payment dispute?
Given the adjustments Capital One has made to Mr Os credit card (which includes a refund 
of the £195.00 purchase and a full refund of all charges and interest) Im satisfied it has 
adequately dealt with Mr Os payment dispute.
did Capital One act fairly and reasonably in chasing Mr O for payment of his credit card 
liability and charging him for late and/or missed payments whilst it investigated/considered 
his payment dispute?
As pointed out by the investigator although Mr O had disputed the £195.00 debited to his 
credit card on 19 June 2021 with Capital One on 1 June 2021, this didnt relieve him of his 
obligations (under his credit card terms and conditions) to continue making monthly 
payments against his credit card. In this respect Mr Os credit card terms and conditions 
specifically state:
When youre paying your credit card bill, you must pay us at least the minimum monthly 
payment by the date written on your statement.
Its really important that you pay on time to avoid any late payment fees and extra interest 
charges.
You must not hold back any payments you owe us, unless you have a legal right to do so.
I also think its worth pointing out that just because Mr O might have felt he had legal rights 
against B doesnt mean he had the legal right (against Capital One) to withhold payments.
So, with the above in mind, and given Ive seen no evidence to suggest Mr O was in financial 
difficulties in 2021, Im satisfied that Capital One was entitled to chase Mr O for payment and 
to charge him for late and/or missed payments.
has Capital one recorded anything with third party credit reference agencies that it shouldnt 
have done in respect of Mr Os credit card?
Mr O submits that Capital One recorded information with third party credit reference 
agencies that it shouldnt have done. But based on what both parties have said and 
submitted, Im not persuaded it did so. In other words, Im satisfied that what Capital One 
recorded with third party credit reference agencies was an accurate reflection of Mr Os 
management of his credit card. And this was one payment in arrears in August and 
October 2021 and two payments in arrears in November 2021.
So, in summary, Im satisfied that Capital One has, in the particular circumstances of this 
case, done nothing wrong.My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
I appreciate Mr O will be disappointed by my conclusions. My final decision, however, 
represents the last stage of this services dispute resolution procedure. Mr O doesnt have to 
accept my decision, and if he doesnt do so, he will be free to pursue legal action against 
Capital One (Europe) plc, something he has suggested he might want to do.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 June 2022.
