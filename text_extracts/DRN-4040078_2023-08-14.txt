The complaint
Mrs S is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) set up a Bounce Back 
Loan (BBL) on a sole trader basis rather than on a limited company basis as should have 
been the case.
What happened
In May 2020, Mrs S applied for a BBL in the name of her limited company, which Ill refer to 
as X. Unfortunately, X went into liquidation in June 2022, and when Mrs S spoke with 
NatWest about the BBL she was told it had been opened in her name on a sole trader basis, 
which meant that she remained personally liable for the outstanding debt. Mrs S wasnt 
happy about this, so she raised a complaint.
NatWest responded and explained that the business relationship between Mrs S and 
NatWest had always been on a sole trader basis. NatWest also noted that the BBL 
agreement confirmed the loan was being provided to Mrs S and not to a limited company, 
and that the funds had been received by Mrs S in her NatWest sole trader account. Mrs S 
wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel that NatWest had acted 
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation, and so didnt uphold the complaint. Mrs S 
remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs S applied for a business bank account on a sole trader basis with NatWest in May 2018. 
This was before X was incorporated, which took place in July 2018. This means that Mrs S 
would have needed to amend the status of her business relationship with NatWest from 
being on a sole trader basis to being on a limited company basis sometime after the 
incorporation with X  if she wanted to do so.
Mrs S maintains that she did update her business relationship with NatWest to being on a 
limited company basis, and that she did this after X was incorporated but before she applied 
for a BBL on Xs behalf. But NatWest have no record of ever receiving such a request to 
amend the basis of the business relationship with Mrs S. And this means that NatWest 
continued to administer the business relationship as being on a sole trader basis. 
From an impartial perspective, I feel the different versions of events put forwards by Mrs S 
and NatWest means that one of two things is most likely to have happened. Either Mrs S did 
request a change of relationship basis with NatWest, but this wasnt then actioned by them, 
or Mrs S didnt request a change of relationship basis with NatWest. 
However, if Mrs S did request a change of relationship basis, its notable that Mrs S didnt 
receive any confirmation of this change from NatWest. This includes that the business 
account remained in the name of Mrs S and that the account documentation and statements 
continued to list Mrs S  and not X  as the account holder. And because of this, if NatWest 
had failed to respond to a request made by Mrs S to change the business relationship from a 
sole trader to a limited company basis, I feel that this should reasonably have been 
recognised by Mrs S and acted upon by her, before she applied for the BBL.
Its also notable that when Mrs S applied for the BBL, the BBL loan documents were 
provided to her for her acceptance in the name of Mrs S, and not X. And, because the 
business bank account remained in the name of Mrs S, and wasnt in the name of X, the 
BBL funds were received by Mrs S into a bank account in her name.
Ms S may ask why NatWest didnt contact her to discuss her BBL application upon noting 
that she had applied for it in the name of a limited company. In normal circumstances, I 
might agree with this point. But the BBL scheme was set up precisely because of abnormal 
circumstances  the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic  and many of the rules and 
regulations surrounding lending were suspended for this scheme.
This includes that BBL applications were self-attested, and it wasnt expected that lenders 
such as NatWest would check the trading name of applicants  in much the same way as 
they werent expected to verify the business turnover information provided by the applicant 
at the point of application. And as mentioned, Mrs S received the BBL agreement to review 
and accept if she was happy with the information contained therein  which she did.
Importantly, it could never have been the case that NatWest could have issued a BBL to X 
on a limited company basis following Mrs Ss BBL application. This is because NatWest 
never held a business relationship with X. The business relationship was always with Mrs S.
Finally, Mrs S feels that telephone agents she spoke with at NatWest confirmed to her that 
the BBL should be in the name of X. It appears that the specific phone call Mrs S would like 
me to listen hasnt been found by NatWest and provided to this service, although the agents 
call notes from that call have. These notes dont corroborate Mrs Ss position here. However, 
regardless of what may have been said on that call, Im satisfied that NatWests later 
correspondence with Mrs S  made after theyd conducted a thorough review of the situation 
and confirmed that the business relationship had always been on a sole trader basis  
supersedes anything that the telephony agent may have advised Mrs S at that time.
All of which means that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take 
any further action. This is because Im satisfied that Mr Ss business relationship with 
NatWest was on sole trader basis and that it was incumbent on Mrs S to have recognised 
this either before or during the BBL application. And, given that Mrs S received the BBL 
funds into a bank account in her name, and not in the name of X, I feel its fair that she 
should be considered personally liable to repay any BBL balance that remains outstanding.
I realise this wont be the outcome Mrs S was wanting, but I hope shell understand, given 
what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 September 2023.
