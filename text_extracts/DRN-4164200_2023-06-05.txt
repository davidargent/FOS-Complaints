The complaint
Miss K complains National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly blocked her accounts, closed them 
and she then couldnt access her funds until they sent her a cheque.
What happened
Miss K held accounts with NatWest. NatWest blocked her accounts for around two weeks 
without notice in early 2022. They say they then sent her notice that her accounts would 
close which she denies receiving. Her accounts closed after the notice period expired, and 
they sent her a cheque for the remaining balance over two months afterwards.
Our investigator upheld Miss Ks complaint in part. They found:
NatWest were able to block her accounts to carry out a review in line with their legal 
and regulatory obligations.
NatWest could close her accounts. Their records show they sent her a letter giving 
her 60 days notice. It wasnt clear why she didnt receive it.
NatWest blocked her accounts again to process the account closure once the notice 
period expired. They sent her a cheque for the account balance over two months 
later. This was an unreasonable delay. Miss K says she called NatWest during this 
time and was promised call backs, which was plausible, and NatWest hadnt 
provided satisfactory evidence to show she hadnt called them.
Miss K said she experienced a lot of inconvenience and distress as a result of not 
having access to her funds earlier, but she hasnt provided documentary proof of her 
losses. So, £100 compensation is reasonable to account for how she was impacted 
by NatWests delay. NatWest should also pay her 8% simple interest per annum on 
the balance they held from 14 April 2022 to 17 June 2022.
NatWest agreed to pay redress according to our investigators recommendation. Miss K 
disagreed, so her complaint has been given to me to make a final decision on as an 
ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided to uphold Miss Ks complaint, but Im not recommending NatWest pay her more 
redress than they have already agreed to pay. Ill explain why.
NatWest have important legal and regulatory obligations to meet when providing accounts to 
customers. Those obligations are ongoing and dont only apply when an account is opened. 
They can broadly be summarized as a responsibility to know their customer, verify their 
sources of income, monitor accounts, and prevent harm.
NatWest will review accounts to comply with their responsibilities. And its common industry 
practice for firms to restrict access to funds to conduct a review - doing so helps prevent 
potential harm that might otherwise result. Ive considered NatWests reasons for their 
review, which they dont have to reveal to Miss K, and Im satisfied their decision to block her 
accounts was reasonable. Miss K said not having access to the accounts meant she had to 
rely on friends and family to fly home from abroad and she needed cash for her wedding. But 
as NatWest acted reasonably, Im not putting these losses at their door.
Miss K says she never received NatWests notice to close. But based on NatWests 
evidence Im persuaded one was sent. She may not have received the notice, or it may have 
been mislaid before being read, but thats not NatWests fault. I find they complied with their 
account terms.
NatWest can generally close customers accounts. Ive considered the terms of her account 
and relevant law, and Im persuaded their decision was fair based on the reasons for their 
review. Miss K was asked to provide a copy of her credit file, which she failed to do. So, Im 
not satisfied she has shown she didnt have other accounts available to her when the 
account was blocked a second time and then closed.
NatWests reasons for taking over two months to issue a cheque after they blocked Miss Ks 
account a second time arent satisfactory. They may have had delays internally but that isnt 
Miss Ks fault, and they needed to act promptly to ensure she didnt suffer avoidable losses 
and harm. 
I find 8% simple interest per annum calculated on the balance NatWest held from 14 April 
2022 to 17 June 2022 is reasonable. This is to account for the cost of being deprived of the 
funds from when NatWest ought to have issued Miss Ks cheque to when they did. If 
NatWest considers theyre required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct income tax from 
that interest, they should tell Miss K how much theyve taken off. They should also give her a 
tax deduction certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate. 
I also find £100 is a reasonable award account for the avoidable frustration and 
inconvenience Miss K experienced by not having access to her funds earlier. Miss K wants 
more than this, but she has failed to provide proof to evidence what she says she went 
through. I find it implausible that she could not at least evidence the cancellation of her 
wedding and the loss of deposits.
Putting things right
Subject to Miss K accepting this decision, I direct NatWest to pay her:
8% simple interest per annum on the balance they held, calculated from 14 April 
2022 to 17 June 2022.
£100 for the distress and inconvenience she experienced by not having access to her 
funds when she should have.
My final decision
My final decision is to uphold Miss Ks complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc should pay 
her redress according to my direction above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 July 2023.
