K821x#15complaint
Miss K is unhappy that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA declined her claim for a refund for 
goods she returned to the seller. 
background
On 28 December 2018 Miss K made a purchase  for $1,695.20 (USD)  using her PayPal 
account. Miss K says she raised a refund  claim  with PayPal  saying  the item was significantly 
not as described.  PayPal  told Miss K to return the item to the seller for a full refund and it 
was despatched by her on 22 February 2019. But she says the seller  requested  a change of 
address while  the goods were in transit and has deliberately failed to collect them  from the 
courier company. Despite this PayPal closed  the case on 29 May 2019 in favour  of the 
seller.
Miss K is unhappy with this and the way PayPal has handled matters and she wants  a full 
refund.
PayPal said that as the tracking pulls no results the case had been  closed in the sellers 
favour. And after reviewing the case it refused Miss Ks appeal  as it didnt receive valid proof 
or tracking  that she returned the merchandise. PayPal said in its final response that it had 
used it correct procedures  and acted in line with the user agreement and its policies. It said it 
isnt in a position to offer Miss K any monetary  redress.
Miss K remained unhappy and provided proof from the courier company that the local 
customs continued to hold the shipment until their own deadline after which it would be 
placed into the abandonment procedure.
Our investigator felt this complaint  should  be upheld. She said in summary:
PayPal asked Miss K to provide proof  of delivery of the item to the seller.  But she 
cant do so as the seller hasnt  collected the item. PayPal is aware the seller  asked  
for the address to be changed when the item was already in transit as it asked 
Miss K to change  the address. The item has been held at a depot abroad since and 
this has been  confirmed by the courier company.  
The user agreement  says PayPal encourages the parties to resolve things and that it 
will contact them  both to look for a resolution. It says a party must respond or it may 
close the case in the others favour.  And if the seller refuses to accept the items back  
PayPal may award in favour of the buyer as long as they can show satisfactory 
evidence that the item was sent back to the seller. Thats what Miss K has done. 
Here Miss K returned the item as she was asked  to do and now doesnt have access  
to it. There is also therefore  still a chance  the item could be collected from the depot. 
If that happens the seller would benefit  both from the having  the money and the item 
back. That wouldnt be fair to Miss K. She also raised her dispute within  180 days 
and has co-operated  in trying to get things resolved. PayPal couldve also interceded 
earlier to try to resolve things.
Consequently PayPal should  refund  $1,695.20 (USD) to Miss K and pay her £100  
compensation for the distress  and inconvenience shes been caused.
Ref: DRN58172892PayPal doesnt  agree and has asked for an ombudsman  review. In summary  it says it isnt 
the sellers responsibility  to collect the item. Its up to the buyer  to organise delivery to the 
seller. Theres  no evidence  a delivery has been  attempted. The documents provided show  
the item was last tracked  by the courier to a location over 1,500  miles from that supplied  by 
the seller for the return. Its not fair to expect the seller to collect them.  Miss K decided  to 
return the item to an address PayPal wasnt aware  of before it intervened. To be covered 
under the buyer protection programme the goods had to be returned to the address PayPal 
provided.  It isnt responsible for what has happened  to the goods. Theres nothing to show 
the seller hasnt accepted the items return.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Some of the evidence in this case is incomplete,  inconclusive or contradictory. So, Ive made 
my decision  based  on what I think is more likely to have happened  than not. 
PayPal has provided  detailed submissions in response to the investigators view which Ive 
read and considered. But on balance I cannot agree fully with its interpretation of likely 
events and  conclusions.  
In this case I think Miss K registered the dispute within the time set out in the user 
agreement. She also, as requested by PayPal, sent the item back by courier  to the seller  at 
the sellers registered  address. And while the item was in transit she received an email from 
PayPal saying that out of courtesy  it was checking if she could change  the delivery address 
to a different  location. Miss K reasonably complied with this request. But PayPal didnt at any 
time mention that in doing  so she would potentially be breaching the terms of the user 
agreement denying her the ability to get a refund.
I think Miss K acted in line with the terms of the user agreement and acted reasonably in 
response to PayPals requests for her to send the item back to the seller and subsequently 
to change the sellers  delivery address. 
PayPal says the item is now some 1,500  miles away  from the seller  and it isnt reasonable to 
expect the seller to collect it. But Im not convinced on balance that is correct. Its unfortunate 
that the courier company only holds tracking information for three  months and I think  if 
PayPal had been more active in trying  to resolve  matters earlier, more and full tracking 
information mayve been  available.  And it isnt Miss Ks fault only limited tracking information 
is now available from the courier company  
The limited  tracking information the courier company has been able to provide from its 
archive shows the item on its journey  at the end of February when it was, as PayPal has 
noted, some  considerable distance from the seller. But the courier company has also 
confirmed that when last scanned on 8 April 2019  the item was held by local customs in the 
original recipient country awaiting  more paperwork from the seller.
Taking everything into account  I think the issues that have arisen arent  caused  by Miss K. 
She has done her best to act in line with the user agreement terms and PayPals requests 
including to change  the delivery  address. I also dont think  she can be held responsible for 
the delivery issues that have clearly subsequently arisen.
Ref: DRN58172893Overall in the individual circumstances of this case I think  it is fair and reasonable for PayPal 
to provide a refund of the money  Miss K paid for this item. 
I also think the way PayPal has dealt with Miss K and this matter has led to her experiencing 
some additional  distress and inconvenience  over and above that she wouldve experienced 
in any event by having to return  the item. And I agree with the investigator that its fair for 
PayPal to pay her £100 compensation  for this.
I therefore think the investigators  proposed  resolution of this complaint is fair and 
reasonable. And I dont see any reason to change the proposed outcome in this case.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  To put things  right PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should  refund  
$1,695.20 (USD) to Miss K and pay her £100  compensation.
PayPal must  pay the compensation  within 28 days of the date on which we tell it Miss K 
accepts my final decision. If it pays later than this it must also pay interest* on the 
compensation from the date of my final decision to the date of payment at 8% a year simple.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal  to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Miss K a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 February  2020.
