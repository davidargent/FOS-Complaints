The complaint
Mr C says Options UK Personal Pensions LLP (Options) shouldnt have accepted his 
application to transfer his defined benefit pension into a self-invested personal pension 
(SIPP) and invest his funds in a Friends Provident International (FPI) bond. He wants 
Options to put him back in the position he wouldve been in had Options not accepted his 
application.
At the time of the relevant events Options was trading as Carey Pensions UK LLP. But I will 
refer to the business as Options throughout this decision.
Background
Ive set out below the parties involved in Mr Cs pension transfer and investment.
Options
Options is a SIPP provider and administrator. At the time of the events in this complaint, 
Options was regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which later became the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Options was authorised, in relation to SIPPs, to arrange 
(bring about) deals in investments, to deal in investments as principal, to establish, operate 
or wind up a pension scheme, and to make arrangements with a view to transactions in 
investments.
Caledonian
Caledonian was a trading name of a business called MMG Associates, which was registered 
in the British Virgin Islands. Caledonian was not authorised in the UK to carry on regulated 
activities and it does not (and did not at the time of the events subject to complaint here) 
appear on the FCAs Financial Services Register. And there is no evidence it was authorised 
to carry out regulated activities (where there was any relevant legislation) in any other 
jurisdiction.
Friends Provident International
Friends Provident International (FPI) is registered in the Isle of Man. It provided a bond (i.e. 
life assurance) wrapper which allows investment in a number of funds with a number of fund 
providers. Mr C invested in a number of investments in an FPI bond.
Business C
Business C is an investment manager. The evidence is that Business C agreed to manage 
or provide oversight of some of the investments taken out by Caledonians customers after 
they had transferred their pensions.
What happened
In 2012 Mr C was living in the UK and working abroad in security. He had a defined benefit 
pension from his time in the Armed Forces. His representative said Mr C had no investment 
experience and low financial capability.
Mr C said of his first contact with Caledonian:
I think I contacted them because my friend was doing it. I was based [abroad] at the 
time and Caledonian seemed to be preying on the Armed Forces and everyone was 
signing up to them.
The representative said the relationship between Mr C and Caledonian was conducted via 
emails and telephone calls. And Caledonian sent Mr C a pre-populated Options SIPP 
application form and a Caledonian letter of authority amongst other things for Mr C to sign 
and date.
Mr Cs representative said changing his pension wasnt something Mr C had been thinking of 
doing, but when in contact with Caledonian he was advised he could access his pension at 
55 instead of 65 and have a much better pension if he transferred.
Mr C told us he dealt with a particular representative of Caledonian. I will refer to that 
representative as Mr C of Caledonian. Mr C told us:
I was told by [Mr C of Caledonian] that my army pension will not generate money 
and the government can reduce the pot, but if I were to move to Careys I would be 
able to access my pension at 55. He also said if I was to put my pension fund into 
Careys I would be guaranteed to get £400,000 - £450,000 back.
He recalled Caledonian telling him he could use a cash builder which would mean if he put in 
£350 a month it would be worth £420/month. He didnt recall FPI being mentioned. He said 
Caledonian told him there was no risk, he was guaranteed to get back at least what he put in 
and it was insured. Mr C said he thought Caledonian was the pension company and was 
managing it all.
On 11 Jun 2012 Mr C signed the following documents:
A partly-pre-populated Options SIPP application form for direct clients (meaning 
clients without an adviser) giving his address as a residence in the UK and saying he 
wanted to transfer his pension entitlement from the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 
to an Options SIPP and invest in FPI. The application form also said amongst other 
things that Mr C was a direct client who hadnt received advice and that Options 
hadnt given advice and Options wasnt responsible for his investment decisions. And 
it recommended Mr C seek advice.
A member declaration which said I confirm that I have received full and appropriate 
advice from Caledonian International and following this advice I wish to proceed with 
the transfer and that Options would act on an execution-only basis and would not be 
liable for any loss.
A letter to Options which said Mr C authorised and instructed Options to provide 
Caledonian with any information they may so request in relation to [his] Scheme and 
[his] Schemes purchase of investments.Options said it received the application on 14 Jun 2012 and sent Mr C a welcome pack on 
15 June 2012, with SIPP terms and conditions and SIPP key features.
On 20 July 2012 Mr C of Caledonian signed a non-solicitation letter for FPI in respect of 
Mr C. The non-solicitation letter said:
We have to-day submitted an application for a policy on behalf of the above named 
client, where the life assured is also resident in the UK. Since the life assureds 
address is / the client has signed the proposal form in the United Kingdom we 
understand that under the Rules of the Financial Services Authority you must treat 
the application as business regulated by the Financial Services and Markets Act. 
Accordingly you will send post-sale information and notice of the right to cancel the 
contract to the client following issue of the policy.
The company is not authorised to conduct investment business in the United 
Kingdom. We acknowledge that this means that you are only able to accept the 
introduction from us if we have not been carrying on investment business in the 
United Kingdom. We therefore certify that:
(i) We do not have a permanent place of business in the United Kingdom; and
(ii) We did not approach the above named client
(iii) The advice was given in Jordan
(iv) The client approached us directly and request us to give him advice
On 31 July 2012 Options trustees signed a Trustee application form for the FPI investment. 
Information entered on the form indicated amongst other things that:
The amount to be invested was nearly £70,000
An investment adviser was to be appointed
The application form was signed in the UK
Advice was given in the UK
Caledonian was appointed as the adviser
Caledonians address was in Chile
Part 2 of the FPI application was headed For completion by the Adviser. It was signed by 
Mr C of Caledonian on 12 June 2012.
On 8 August 2012 FPI wrote to Options saying it had paid commission of 7% (nearly £5,000) 
to Caledonian for introducing Mr C to FPI, and saying if Options had any questions it should 
contact its financial adviser.
Mr Cs complaint
In April 2019 Mr C complained to Options via a representative. In summary his 
representative said the following:Caledonian advised Mr C to transfer his pension funds to the SIPP and invest them 
in the FPI investment; Caledonian said Mr C would be better off by doing so
Mr C wasnt an experienced or sophisticated investor or a high net worth individual; 
hed never dealt with a financial adviser before, nor had any other investment 
experience, and he had a very low knowledge of investments
The investment wasnt suitable for Mr C. And Mr C suffered significant financial 
losses
Options failed to identify risks and shouldnt have accepted the introduction from 
Caledonian; Options had a duty of care to protect its customers and assess the 
sources of its business.
In July 2019 Options responded to Mr Cs complaint and didnt uphold it. In summary 
Options said the following:
COBS 11.2.19 obligated Options to carry out Mr Cs instruction to facilitate his 
pension transfer and invest his funds in the FPI investment.
Options provided execution-only services and made Mr C aware of that.
Options treated Mr C as a direct client and wasnt aware he received any advice.
The regulators publications on SIPPs were guidance only, not rules.
Caledonian wasnt known to Options as an advice firm and Options wasnt aware that 
Caledonian held itself out as an advice firm. Caledonian was an introducer only and 
that was made clear to Mr C.
Options didnt and wasnt permitted to give advice.
Options gave Mr C sufficient warnings and recommended he take advice.
Mr C didnt tell Options that Caledonian advised him.
In July 2019 Mr C referred his complaint to us. In summary his representative said that 
Options shouldnt have accepted Mr Cs application. And Options failed to identify risks. The 
representative said Mr C had thought he was receiving advice from Caledonian and he 
trusted Caledonian. And Caledonian recommended both the transfer and the FPI 
investment, and said the transaction would give him a much better pension. The 
representative said Mr C was not experienced in financial products; he has no experience in 
investments and does not understand financial jargon like execution only.
The relationship between Options and Caledonian
Ive set out above the background to Mr Cs complaint and his dealings with Caledonian and 
Options. But alongside those events its important to understand the underlying relationship 
between Caledonian and Options.
Options said it carried out due diligence checks on Caledonian, and its provided evidence of 
the checks it made.
The relationship between Options and Caledonian began in early 2012. Options said that 
between 27 April 2012 and 20 May 2013 Caledonian made 509 introductions to Options. Ive set out below a summary of what I consider to be the key events and/or actions during 
the relationship between Options and Caledonian, which Ive observed from the available 
evidence (including evidence from Mr Cs case file and submissions Options has made to us 
about its due diligence on, and its relationship with, Caledonian).
A business profile was completed which recorded the first meeting between Options and Mr 
C of Caledonian in March 2012. It set out Caledonians proposed business model. It said 
Mr C of Caledonian was preferred adviser for the Armed Forces occupational pension 
scheme. It said the profile of Caledonian clients was:
30 to 50 year olds
Had been in the armed forces for between 6 to 10 years
Had left the armed forces and wanted to transfer their pension arrangements
They had no expectation of long life expectancy
They were living today so wanted to access funds earlier then they could if their 
pension stayed in the armed forces pension scheme
They were generally still resident in UK but some were now living abroad in various 
countries such as Thailand, Germany, Spain etc.
They were now earning quite large salaries circa £70k plus
The business profile said clients were referred to Mr C of Caledonian from his Armed Forces 
pensions contact or by other clients, and he was currently putting them into an international 
Friends Provident Bond, the underlying investments were regulated. It said:
[Mr C of Caledonian] himself was not a regulated adviser, he was a consultant to 
these clients and advised them on their armed forces transfers only, he was a 
qualified accountant and was a member of the Chartered Institute of Accountants.
His company was trading as Caledonian although the holding company was a BVI 
company called MMG Associates 
[Mr C of Caledonian] was looking at volume business in the region of 50 schemes a 
month.
On 16 March 2012 Mr C of Caledonian signed and dated the Options Non-Regulated 
Introducer Profile. The form described its purpose as follows:
As an FSA regulated pensions company we are required to carry out due diligence 
as best practice on unregulated introducer firms looking to introduce clients to us to 
gain some insight into the business they carry out.

by Referral and the sales process would be: Referral  Visit  Analysis  Visit.
A question about the typical commission structure was answered: 7% up front from bond

Under Training and Information, in response to the question, What training is provided to 
the agents within the Firm? the answer was: Ongoing product training and accompanied

Caledonian didnt work with any FSA regulated company or adviser, wasnt a member of any 
professional or trade body, had no professional indemnity cover in place, and hadnt recently 
been and wasnt currently subject to any FSA supervisory visits, reviews or other regulatory 
action or censure.
In response to the question What measures are in place to ensure the Firm engage legal 
advice on the activities it carries out to ensure regulated activities are not carried out? the 
answer was: Majority of business carried out in unregulated jurisdictions but where 
regulations apply we are licensed to carry out our activities.
In response to how Caledonian demonstrates it treats its customers fairly, it was said: 
Compliance & Procedures in current alignment with FSA TCF.
Information entered said Caledonians objectives for the coming 12 months were: To 
continue to develop a fully compliant business of PT to HM Forces. And with regards to 
member-directed pension scheme business, Caledonian was looking to achieve a 
Compliant business in a Regulated structure.
On 23 March 2012 Options asked Mr C of Caledonian for a copy of Caledonians latest 
company accounts and a certified copy of each directors/principals passport. Options 
chased a response to this on 3 April 2012. A senior consultant at Caledonian replied on the 
same day and provided a copy of Mr C of Caledonians passport (uncertified). About the 
company accounts she said shed speak to Mr C of Caledonian when he returned from a 
trip. On 4 April 2012 Mr C of Caledonian emailed Options:
my apologies for not having replied before now  I am back tomorrow Thursday 
and will have te [sic] appropriate documents over to you early next week 
On 27 April 2012 Options started to receive introductions from Caledonian. On 1 August 
2012, ahead of a compliance audit, a Team Leader at Options asked Caledonian again for 
the certified passports and annual accounts. In an internal email the Team Leader said shed 
spoken to Mr C of Caledonian and hed be sending an urgent request for the documentation 
we require.
On 4 September 2012 Mr C of Caledonian and the CEO of Options signed and dated a 
Non-regulated Introducer Agreement Terms of Business document between Options and 
MMG Associates Ltd T/A Caledonian International Associates. Amongst other terms the 
agreement included the following undertaking:The Business Introducer undertakes that they will not provide advice as defined by 
[the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000] in relation to the SIPP  for the 
avoidance of doubt this includes reference to advice on the selection of The SIPP 
Operator, contributions, transfer of benefits, taking benefits and HMRC rules
Options has said Caledonian received the terms of business on 21 March 2012  and so it 
seems there was a delay in Mr C of Caledonian signing and returning the document.
On 1 November 2012 Options did a background check using World Check (a risk 
intelligence tool which allows subscribers to conduct background checks on businesses and 
individuals) on two Caledonian employees, one of whom was Mr C of Caledonian. The 
check didnt reveal any issues.
Options has said that in early 2013, it appointed a dedicated in-house compliance officer 
and they enhanced the compliance framework within the firm, compliance monitoring 
programme and risk assessment.
On 7 March 2013 a manager at Options sent an internal email to other Options employees, 
including its CEO, summarising a call Options had held with Mr C of Caledonian. In 
summary, it said:
Options had noted that, following recent FSA reviews and guidance, SIPP operators 
were being asked to look at the business received from their introducers against their 
expectations of type and profile.
Options had noted that several applications it received recently had moved away 
from the expected profile. And Options asked whether the profile was changing.
Mr C of Caledonian had said that predominantly the members were in the close 
protection industry which as@ 5 years ago they all went into. He said that foreign 
operatives were now coming in in a more organised structure. Some were getting 
promoted into senior positions. Many were previously divers in the military and so 
going into Diving elsewhere.
Options had asked Mr C of Caledonian to put together a note to update Caledonians 
business profile and expectations.
On 20 March 2013 the Options manager followed up the conversation with Mr C of 
Caledonian by email. Options asked again for an update as to the changes in profile, and 
noted it had received a further two applications for individuals outside the expected profile.
Options has also provided an undated document called the Overseas Introducer 
Assessment Proforma. The document listed a number of criteria and labelled its 
assessment as low risk, medium risk or high risk with supporting notes on each. This 
document isnt dated but I think its likely to have been completed in March 2013 as it refers 
to Options recently having seen consumers introduced which fell outside the expected 
profile, which seems to refer to the 7 March 2013 email.  Ive set out below what I consider 
the most relevant sections of this document and the level of risk that was noted.

committee before proceeding.
The overall result at the end of the Advice/Client Profile/Investment section was recorded 
as Red, a result described as Decline.On 26 April 2013 an Options Compliance Officer emailed several other Options employees, 
with the title Review of relationship with Caledonian. She said:
We have a responsibility to proactively monitor our distribution channels to ensure 
our products do not end up with customers for whom it is not suitable. Based on 
recent correspondence with Caledonian I am increasingly concerned by their 
business practices and therefore believe we should review our relationship with them 
and the business they have introduced. I will arrange a meeting for next week to 
discuss. In the meantime we need to determine the answers to the questions below 
to help facilitate our discussions.
The Compliance Officer set out 18 questions and statements about Caledonian and its 
relationship with Options and invited the other employees who received her email to please 
provide answers to the following where you can.

A further reply was made later on 30 April 2013 by the CEO of Options. The CEO wrote:
To add to [Options employee]s information. I attach a business profile which details 
how the relationship emerged with Caledonian which provides background

clients, do we have concerns that Caledonian is providing poor advice/ information? I 
am not sure it is our place to comment on this maybe on the information but not on 
advice, if we commented on whether we thought even our regulated advisers were 
providing poor advice I would probably think we would say yes. Think we need to be 
careful what questions we are looking to answer comfortable on the information piece 
but not on the advice pieceDo Caledonian provide advice on investments within the SIPP? No they don't, they 
consult with the client on the feasibility of transferring their Armed Forces Pension 
Scheme into a SIPP and their partner to manage the investment is [Business C]
On 10 May 2013 the Options CEO emailed Caledonian requesting further information. The 
email said Options was reviewing its terms of business in light of recent announcements 
from the FCA and our internal compliance reviews. Options said it was keen to continue to 
do business with Caledonian but that it must do so: in a framework that is robust and 
compliant and will satisfy the regulators, Options said, so we must start with ensuring we 
understand each stage of the process, to enable us to develop a robust and compliant 
process for this business moving forward. Options asked Caledonian the following 
questions:
1. Can you provide your organisational structure and the jurisdiction in which each is 
registered and the regulation/regulator that each company operates within. If you are 
relying on any exemptions please state which exemptions and the reasons you 
believe you can operate within those exemptions.
2.Are you giving advice and if so in what capacity and under what regulatory 
environment are you providing this advice.
3.What offices do you have and where, do the jurisdictions in which you have offices 
have a regulatory regime, if so can you provide details of the regulators in those 
jurisdictions.
4.On what basis are you providing illustrations and the reasons for this basis
5.Do you meet all your clients in Jordan, if not why do your Non Solicitation forms 
signed by yourself confirm the advice was given in Jordan
6.Please confirm the profile of your clients
7.Please confirm how you receive introductions to your clients
8.Can you update information about your team their background, expertise in dealing 
with pensions
9.On the Non Solicitation letters you note that Caledonian does not have a permanent 
place of business in the UK. However, you request correspondence to be sent to The 
Pensions Service Centre, [UK city]. Please can you clarify Caledonian's presence in 
the UK and the nature of the office in [UK city].
Options said that from 1 May 2013 it had implemented changes to its requirements, and that 
Caledonian had to have a UK FCA regulated adviser providing the TVAS and the sign off for 
the suitability of transfers from occupational schemes of any values.
On 15 May 2013 Options sent an internal email which was a summary of a telephone 
conversation with Business C. The summary recorded that Business C confirmed an FCA 
Regulated Adviser would provide TVAS reports on all Caledonian-introduced clients and on 
the back book of business with Caledonian. And that on this understanding Options had 
agreed it would continue to process applications where the TVAS report was currently being 
issued by Business C.
Options says the last introduction made to it by Caledonian was on 20 May 2013.On 23 May 2013 Options met with Caledonian and Business C. A summary of the meeting 
said:
Mr C of Caledonian said he was a consultant to the Armed Forces and not an adviser 
in the FCA sense.
Caledonians UK office was a postal address only and not a working office.
Mr C of Caledonian met with clients in the UK but initial contact was abroad. It was 
noted that documents completed by Caledonian had said he met them in Jordan. 
And FPI needed a letter about where advice was given.
Caledonians website didnt mention that it would give advice. And its documents said 
no advice was given and clients should take advice from a regulated adviser.
Caledonian said the reason for lots of transfers was because of the market and its 
relationship with providers.
The proposal going forward involved an appointed representative of a UK-based IFA 
being the pension specialist of Business C and the UK-based IFA dealing with 
business moving forward.
Options agreed to allow Caledonian a four-week window to put the changes in place.
The question about Caledonian providing a letter stating where advice was being 
given was irrelevant to Options as Caledonian didnt provide advice.
Caledonian said its illustrations were provided for clients to facilitate the business. 
Options queried whether this was advice.
I havent seen evidence that any of these actions was completed. As noted, Options didnt 
accept business from Caledonian after 20 May 2013.
Options has provided a copy of a document headed, Caledonian Relationship Review 
2013. Ive reviewed the document in full, but have only quoted below what I consider to be 
the key part:
Following a detailed review of the process and documentation concerns were 
raised regarding whether the clients could be deemed to be receiving advice through 
an unregulated entity. 
Following a request for further clarification on these points we have not been able to 
satisfy ourselves that this is not the case.
We have insisted that they move to a model that all cases are fully advised by an 
FCA regulated firm/individual, which has been accepted.

Following a meeting in the Milton Keynes office with ourselves [Options staff at the 
meeting] where [Mr C of Caledonian], and [Business C] explained their current 
process and documentation and described their future process, further discussions 
between [initials of various staff members at the businesses] it was decided that they 
had not satisfied us enough with their current processes for us to continue to allow taking on new business in the interim without the use of a UK regulated firm or 
individual who was suitably qualified.
[Options Chief Executive] has instructed the team of this decision so from week 
beginning 28th May any new business received will be rejected unless it comes 
through an FCA regulated firm 
It set out a detailed process, by which Caledonian proposed to move to a model where all 
clients would be fully advised by an FCA regulated firm/individual, and it highlighted the 
benefits of this new approach as being:
all schemes are coming in on an advised basis; it brings the process and client into 
the UK regulated process; it brings the clients into the FSCS and FOS protections; 
and ensures all occupational schemes undergo analysis and advice
I havent seen evidence that this approach was enacted  again, as noted, Options accepted 
no business introduced by Caledonian after 20 May 2013.
Our Investigators view
One of our Investigators looked into Mr Cs complaint and said it should be upheld. The 
Investigator acknowledged that Options as the SIPP operator wasnt responsible for 
assessing the suitability of any advice Mr C may have received. But the Investigator said 
Options was responsible for due diligence on Caledonian as an introducer of business to 
Options. And the Investigator said Options hadnt done enough and/or hadnt drawn fair and 
reasonable conclusions from what it knew. If it had acted fairly and reasonably, the 
Investigator said, Options shouldve refused to accept applications from Caledonian, 
including Mr Cs application.
The Investigator set out that Options should put things right by comparing Mr Cs current 
position to the position he wouldve been in had he not transferred from his defined benefit 
pension scheme. And Options should pay him compensation. The Investigator also 
recommended Options pay Mr C £500 for distress and inconvenience caused by its failings.
Mr C accepted the Investigators view.
Options didnt agree. In summary it said the following:
The Investigators view didnt reflect the regulatory and legal regime in which Options 
acted, or the contractual relationship that Options had with its members.
Options wasnt permitted to and didnt give advice.
Regulatory publications were only relevant if they were published before the events 
that were the subject of the complaint; guidance published after the events didnt 
simply reflect what the industry was doing; it introduced new expectations.
Options acted on the basis that Caledonian wasnt giving advice. Its terms of 
business prohibited that and Caledonian knew that.
References to advice in paperwork were an oversight.
Consideration of whether Caledonian gave advice requires: consideration of the 
relevant law and application of the Regulated Activities Order as considered by the 
Court of Appeal in Adams; and investigation of the circumstances of Mr Cs case.If advice was given, the jurisdiction where that happened was relevant.
It wasnt mandatory at the time for consumers to get advice before transferring their 
defined benefit pensions.
Options was permitted to deal with unregulated introducers.
The reason Options ceased accepting applications from Caledonian without advice 
being offered to the consumer wasnt because Options became aware that 
Caledonian was providing advice; it was a broad policy decision in February 2014.
Mr C wouldve gone ahead with the transfer and FPI investment even if Options had 
refused his application.
Any calculation of redress should take into account that the investment was no cause 
for concern.
If Options cant take ownership of the investment, its value should be taken into 
account in any calculation of compensation to be paid by Options to Mr C.
An oral hearing should be held, to explore, in particular:
oThe extent of Caledonians role in Mr Cs decisions
oMr Cs understanding of the investment and the roles of the parties
oMr Cs motivation for the transaction.
Because no agreement could be reached, Mr Cs complaint was passed to me to review 
afresh and make a decision.
My provisional decision
In advance of this final decision, I issued a provisional decision in which I said I thought 
Mr Cs complaint should be upheld.
I also explained why Im satisfied its not necessary for me to hold an oral hearing. My 
conclusion about that remains unchanged so I shant repeat it here.
Options didnt respond to the provisional decision. Mr C responded to say he accepted the 
provisional decision.
Because I havent received any further submissions from either party and I havent been 
persuaded to depart from my provisional findings, Ive repeated my provisional findings 
below, with a few minor changes, as my final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding Mr Cs complaint. Ill explain why.
In considering whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint, Ive 
taken into account: relevant law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry 
practice at the relevant time.
The purpose of this decision is to set out my findings on whats fair and reasonable, and 
explain my reasons for reaching those findings, not to offer a point-by-point response to 
every submission made by the parties to the complaint. And so, while I have considered all 
the submissions from both parties, Ive focussed here on the points I believe to be key to my 
decision on whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
With that in mind Ill start by setting out what I have identified as the relevant considerations 
to deciding what is fair and reasonable in this case.
Relevant considerations
The Principles
In my view the FCAs Principles for Businesses are of particular relevance to my decision. 
The Principles for Businesses, which are set out in the FCAs handbook are a general 
statement of the fundamental obligations of firms under the regulatory system (PRIN 
1.1.2G). I consider that the Principles relevant to this complaint include Principles 2, 3 and 6 
which say the following:
Principle 2  Skill, care and diligence  A firm must conduct its business with due 
skill, care and diligence
Principle 3  Management and control  A firm must take reasonable care to 
organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk 
management systems
Principle 6  Customers interests  A firm must pay due regard to the interests of its 
customers and treat them fairly.
Ive carefully considered the relevant law and what it says about the application of the 
Principles. In R (British Bankers Association) v Financial Services Authority [2011] EWHC 
999 (Admin) (BBA) Ouseley J said at paragraph 162:
The Principles are best understood as the ever present substrata to which the 
specific rules are added. The Principles always have to be complied with. The 
specific rules do not supplant them and cannot be used to contradict them. They are 
but specific applications of them to the particular requirement they cover. The general 
notion that the specific rules can exhaust the application of the Principles is 
inappropriate. It cannot be an error of law for the Principles to augment specific 
rules.
And at paragraph 77 of BBA Ouseley J said:
Indeed, it is my view that it would be a breach of statutory duty for the Ombudsman 
to reach a view on a case without taking the Principles into account in deciding what 
would be fair and reasonable and what redress to afford. Even if no Principles had 
been produced by the FSA, the FOS would find it hard to fulfil its particular statutory 
duty without having regard to the sort of high level principles which find expression in 
the Principles, whoever formulated them. They are of the essence of what is fair and 
reasonable, subject to the argument about their relationship to specific rules.In (R (Berkeley Burke SIPP Administration Ltd) v Financial Ombudsman Service [2018] 
EWHC 2878) (BBSAL), Berkeley Burke brought a judicial review claim challenging the 
decision of an Ombudsman who had upheld a consumers complaint against it. The 
Ombudsman considered the FCA Principles and good industry practice at the relevant time. 
He concluded that it was fair and reasonable for Berkeley Burke to have undertaken due 
diligence in respect of the investment before allowing it into the SIPP wrapper, and that if it 
had done so, it would have refused to accept the investment. The Ombudsman found 
Berkeley Burke had therefore not complied with its regulatory obligations and had not treated 
its client fairly.
Jacobs J, having set out some paragraphs of BBA including paragraph 162 set out above, 
said (at paragraph 104):
These passages explain the overarching nature of the Principles. As the FCA 
correctly submitted in their written argument, the role of the Principles is not merely to 
cater for new or unforeseen circumstances. The judgment in BBA shows that they 
are, and indeed were always intended to be, of general application. The aim of the 
Principles-based regulation described by Ouseley J. was precisely not to attempt to 
formulate a code covering all possible circumstances, but instead to impose general 
duties such as those set out in Principles 2 and 6.
The BBSAL judgment also considers section 228 of FSMA and the approach an 
Ombudsman is to take when deciding a complaint. The judgment of Jacobs J in the Berkeley 
Burke case upheld the lawfulness of the approach taken by the Ombudsman in that 
complaint, which I have described above, and included the Principles and good industry 
practice at the relevant time as relevant considerations that were required to be taken into 
account.
As outlined above, Ouseley J in the BBA case held that it would be a breach of statutory 
duty if I were to reach a view on a complaint without taking the Principles into account in 
deciding what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of a case. And, Jacobs J 
adopted a similar approach to the application of the Principles in BBSAL. So the Principles 
are a relevant consideration here and I will consider them in the specific circumstances of 
this complaint.
The Adams court cases and COBS 2.1.1R
I confirm I have taken account of the judgment of the High Court in the case of Adams v 
Options SIPP [2020] EWHC 1229 (Ch) and the Court of Appeal judgment in Adams v 
Options UK Personal Pensions LLP [2021] EWCA Civ 474. I note the Supreme Court 
refused Options permission to appeal the Court of Appeal judgement.
Ive considered whether these judgments mean that the Principles should not be taken into 
account in deciding this case. And I am of the view they do not. In the High Court case, HHJ 
Dight did not consider the application of the Principles and they did not form part of the 
pleadings submitted by Mr Adams. One of the main reasons why HHJ Dight found that the 
judgment of Jacobs J in BBSAL was not of direct relevance to the case before him was 
because the specific regulatory provisions which the learned judge in Berkeley Burke was 
asked to consider are not those which have formed the basis of the claimants case before 
me.
Likewise, the Principles were not considered by the Court of Appeal. So, the Adams 
judgments say nothing about the application of the FCAs Principles to the Ombudsmans 
consideration of a complaint.I acknowledge that COBS 2.1.1R (A firm must act honestly, fairly and professionally in 
accordance with the best interests of its client) overlaps with certain of the Principles and 
that this rule was considered by HHJ Dight in the High Court case. Mr Adams pleaded that 
Options SIPP owed him a duty to comply with COBS 2.1.1R, a breach of which, he argued, 
was actionable pursuant to section 138(D) of FSMA (the COBS claim). HHJ Dight rejected 
this claim and found that Options SIPP had complied with the best interests rule on the facts 
of Mr Adamss case.
Although the Court of Appeal ultimately overturned HHJ Dights judgment, it rejected that 
part of Mr Adamss appeal that related to HHJ Dights dismissal of the COBS claim on the 
basis that Mr Adams was seeking to advance a case that was radically different to that found 
in his initial pleadings. The Court found that this part of Mr Adamss appeal did not so much 
represent a challenge to the grounds on which HHJ Dight had dismissed the COBS claim, 
but rather was an attempt to put forward an entirely new case.
I note that, in the High Court case, HHJ Dight found that the factual context of a case would 
inform the extent of the duty imposed by COBS 2.1.1R. HHJ Dight said at para 148:
In my judgment in order to identify the extent of the duty imposed by Rule 2.1.1 one 
has to identify the relevant factual context, because it is apparent from the 
submissions of each of the parties that the context has an impact on the 
ascertainment of the extent of the duty. The key fact, perhaps composite fact, in the 
context is the agreement into which the parties entered, which defined their roles and 
functions in the transaction.
The facts in Mr Cs case are very different from those in Adams. There are also significant 
differences between the breaches of COBS 2.1.1R alleged by Mr Adams and the issues in 
Mr Cs complaint. The breaches were summarised in paragraph 120 of the Court of Appeal 
judgment. In particular, HHJ Dight considered the contractual relationship between the 
parties in the context of Mr Adams pleaded breaches of COBS 2.1.1R that happened after 
the contract was entered into. In Mr Cs complaint, I am considering whether Options ought 
to have identified that the introductions from Caledonian involved a risk of consumer 
detriment and, if so, whether it ought to have ceased accepting introductions from 
Caledonian prior to entering into a contract with Mr C.
On this point I think it is also important to emphasise that I must determine this complaint by 
reference to what is, in my opinion, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. 
And, in doing that, Im required to take into account relevant considerations which include: 
law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, 
where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time. 
This is a clear and relevant point of difference between this complaint and the judgments in 
Adams. That was a legal claim which was defined by the formal pleadings in Mr Adamss 
statement of case.
To be clear, I have proceeded on the understanding that Options was not obliged  and not 
able  to give advice to Mr C on the suitability for him personally of a pension transfer or its 
SIPP or the FPI investment. But I am satisfied that the obligations of Options included 
deciding whether to accept particular investments into its SIPP and/or whether to accept 
introductions of business from particular businesses. And this is consistent with Options own 
understanding of its obligations at the relevant time. As noted above, the Options Non-
Regulated Introducer Profile completed at the outset of the relationship between Options and 
Caledonian said:As an FSA regulated pensions company we are required to carry out due diligence 
as best practice on unregulated introducer firms looking to introduce clients to us to 
gain some insight into the business they carry out.
Regulatory publications
The FCA (and its predecessor, the FSA) has issued the following publications which remind 
SIPP operators of their obligations and set out how they might achieve the outcomes 
envisaged by the Principles, namely:
The 2009 and 2012 thematic review reports
The October 2013 finalised SIPP operator guidance
The July 2014 Dear CEO letter
The 2009 report
The 2009 report included the following statement:
We are very clear that SIPP operators, regardless of whether they provide advice, 
are bound by Principle 6 of the Principles for Businesses (a firm must pay due 
regard to the interests of its clients and treat them fairly) insofar as they are obliged 
to ensure the fair treatment of their customers. COBS 3.2.3(2) states that a member 
of a pension scheme is a client for COBS purposes, and Customer in terms of 
Principle 6 includes clients.
It is the responsibility of SIPP operators to continuously analyse the individual risks to 
themselves and their clients, with reference to the six TCF consumer outcomes.
We agree that firms acting purely as SIPP operators are not responsible for the SIPP 
advice given by third parties such as IFAs. However, we are also clear that SIPP 
operators cannot absolve themselves of any responsibility, and we would expect 
them to have procedures and controls, and to be gathering and analysing 
management information, enabling them to identify possible instances of financial 
crime and consumer detriment such as unsuitable SIPPs. Such instances could then 
be addressed in an appropriate way, for example by contacting the member to 
confirm the position, or by contacting the firm giving advice and asking for 
clarification. Moreover, while they are not responsible for the advice, there is a 
reputational risk to SIPP operators that facilitate the SIPPs that are unsuitable or 
detrimental to clients.
Of particular concern were firms whose systems and controls were weak and 
inadequate to the extent that they had not identified obvious potential instances of 
poor advice and/or potential financial crime. Depending on the facts and 
circumstances of individual cases, we may take enforcement action against SIPP 
operators who do not safeguard their clients interests in this respect, with reference 
to Principle 3 of the Principles for Business (a firm must take reasonable care to 
organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk 
management systems).
The following are examples of measures that SIPP operators could consider, taken 
from examples of good practice that we observed and suggestions we have made to 
firms:Confirming, both initially and on an ongoing basis, that intermediaries that advise 
clients are authorised and regulated by the FSA, that they have the appropriate 
permissions to give the advice they are providing to the firms clients, and that 
they do not appear on the FSA website listing warning notices.
Having Terms of Business agreements governing relationships, and clarifying 
respective responsibilities, with intermediaries introducing SIPP business.
Routinely recording and reviewing the type (i.e. the nature of the SIPP 
investment) and size of investments recommended by intermediaries that give 
advice and introduce clients to the firm, so that potentially unsuitable SIPPs can 
be identified.
Being able to identify anomalous investments, e.g. unusually small or large 
transactions or more esoteric investments such as unquoted shares, together 
with the intermediary that introduced the business. This would enable the firm to 
seek appropriate clarification, e.g. from the client or their adviser, if it is 
concerned about the suitability of what was recommended.
Requesting copies of the suitability reports provided to clients by the intermediary 
giving advice. While SIPP operators are not responsible for advice, having this 
information would enhance the firms understanding of its clients, making the 
facilitation of unsuitable SIPPs less likely.
Routinely identifying instances of execution-only clients who have signed 
disclaimers taking responsibility for their investment decisions, and gathering and 
analysing data regarding the aggregate volume of such business.
Identifying instances of clients waiving their cancellation rights, and the reasons 
for this.
The later publications
In the October 2013 finalised SIPP operator guidance, the FCA said:
This guide, originally published in September 2009, has been updated to give firms 
further guidance to help meet the regulatory requirements. These are not new or 
amended requirements, but a reminder of regulatory responsibilities that became a 
requirement in April 2007.
All firms, regardless of whether they do or do not provide advice must meet Principle 6 
and treat customers fairly. COBS 3.2.3(2) is clear that a member of a pension scheme is 
a client for SIPP operators and so is a customer under Principle 6. It is a SIPP 
operators responsibility to assess its business with reference to our six TCF consumer 
outcomes.
The October 2013 finalised SIPP operator guidance also set out the following:
Relationships between firms that advise and introduce prospective members and SIPP 
operators
Examples of good practice we observed during our work with SIPP operators include the 
following:
Confirming, both initially and on an ongoing basis, that: introducers that advise clients are authorised and regulated by the FCA; that they have the appropriate permissions 
to give the advice they are providing; neither the firm, nor its approved persons are 
on the list of prohibited individuals or cancelled firms and have a clear disciplinary 
history; and that the firm does not appear on the FCA website listings for 
unauthorised business warnings.
Having terms of business agreements that govern relationships and clarify the 
responsibilities of those introducers providing SIPP business to a firm.
Understanding the nature of the introducers work to establish the nature of the firm, 
what their business objectives are, the types of clients they deal with, the levels of 
business they conduct and expect to introduce, the types of investments they 
recommend and whether they use other SIPP operators. Being satisfied that they are 
appropriate to deal with.
Being able to identify irregular investments, often indicated by unusually small or 
large transactions; or higher risk investments such as unquoted shares which may be 
illiquid. This would enable the firm to seek appropriate clarification, for example from 
the prospective member or their adviser, if it has any concerns.
Identifying instances when prospective members waive their cancellation rights and 
the reasons for this.
Although the members advisers are responsible for the SIPP investment advice given, 
as a SIPP operator the firm has a responsibility for the quality of the SIPP business it 
administers.
Examples of good practice we have identified include:
conducting independent verification checks on members to ensure the information 
they are being supplied with, or that they are providing the firm with, is authentic and 
meets the firms procedures and are not being used to launder money
having clear terms of business agreements in place which govern relationships and 
clarify responsibilities for relationships with other professional bodies such as 
solicitors and accountants, and
using non-regulated introducer checklists which demonstrate the SIPP operators 
have considered the additional risks involved in accepting business from 
nonregulated introducers
In relation to due diligence the October 2013 finalised SIPP operator guidance said:
Due diligence
Principle 2 of the FCAs Principles for Businesses requires all firms to conduct their 
business with due skill, care and diligence. All firms should ensure that they conduct and 
retain appropriate and sufficient due diligence (for example, checking and monitoring 
introducers as well as assessing that investments are appropriate for personal pension 
schemes) to help them justify their business decisions. In doing this SIPP operators 
should consider:
ensuring that all investments permitted by the scheme are permitted by HMRC, or 
where a tax charge is incurred, that charge is identifiable, HMRC is informed and the 
tax charge paidperiodically reviewing the due diligence the firm undertakes in respect of the 
introducers that use their scheme and, where appropriate enhancing the processes 
that are in place in order to identify and mitigate any risks to the members and the 
scheme
having checks which may include, but are not limited to:
oensuring that introducers have the appropriate permissions, qualifications and 
skills to introduce different types of business to the firm, and
oundertaking additional checks such as viewing Companies House records, 
identifying connected parties and visiting introducers
ensuring all third-party due diligence that the firm uses or relies on has been 
independently produced and verified
good practices we have identified in firms include having a set of benchmarks, or 
minimum standards, with the purpose of setting the minimum standard the firm is 
prepared to accept to either deal with introducers or accept investments, and
ensuring these benchmarks clearly identify those instances that would lead a firm to 
decline the proposed business, or to undertake further investigations such as 
instances of potential pension liberation, investments that may breach HMRC tax 
relievable investments and non-standard investments that have not been approved 
by the firm
The July 2014 Dear CEO letter provides a further reminder that the Principles apply and an 
indication of the FCAs expectations about the kinds of practical steps a SIPP operator might 
reasonably take to achieve the outcomes envisaged by the Principles.
The Dear CEO letter also sets out how a SIPP operator might meet its obligations in 
relation to investment due diligence. It says those obligations could be met by:
Correctly establishing and understanding the nature of an investment
Ensuring that an investment is genuine and not a scam, or linked to fraudulent 
activity, money-laundering or pensions liberation
Ensuring that an investment is safe/secure (meaning that custody of assets is 
through a reputable arrangement, and any contractual agreements are correctly 
drawn-up and legally enforceable)
Ensuring that an investment can be independently valued, both at point of purchase 
and subsequently
Ensuring that an investment is not impaired (for example that previous investors have 
received income if expected, or that any investment providers are credit worthy etc)
Although Ive referred to selected parts of the publications, to illustrate their relevance, Ive 
considered them in their entirety.
I acknowledge that the 2009 and 2012 reports and the Dear CEO letter arent formal 
guidance (whereas the 2013 finalised guidance is). However, the fact that the reports and 
Dear CEO letter didnt constitute formal guidance doesnt mean their importance should be 
underestimated. They provide a reminder that the Principles for Businesses apply and are an indication of the kinds of things a SIPP operator might do to ensure it is treating its 
customers fairly and produce the outcomes envisaged by the Principles. In that respect the 
publications, which set out the regulators expectations of what SIPP operators should be 
doing, also goes some way to indicate what I consider amounts to good industry practice 
and I am, therefore, satisfied it is appropriate to take them into account.
Its relevant that when deciding what amounted to have been good industry practice in the 
BBSAL case, the Ombudsman found that the regulators reports, guidance and letter go a 
long way to clarify what should be regarded as good practice and what should not. And the 
judge in BBSAL endorsed the lawfulness of the approach taken by the Ombudsman.
Like the Ombudsman in the BBSAL case, I dont think the fact the publications (other than 
the 2009 Thematic Review Report) post-date the events that took place in relation to Mr Cs 
complaint, mean that the examples of good practice they provide were not good practice at 
the time of the relevant events. Although the later publications were published after the 
events subject to this complaint, the Principles that underpin them existed throughout, as did 
the obligation to act in accordance with the Principles.
Its also clear from the text of the 2009 and 2012 reports (and the Dear CEO letter in 2014) 
that the regulator expected SIPP operators to have incorporated the recommended good 
practices into the conduct of their business already. So, whilst the regulators comments 
suggest some industry participants understanding of how the good practice standards 
shaped what was expected of SIPP operators changed over time, it is clear the standards 
themselves had not changed.
I note that HHJ Dight in the Adams case didnt consider the 2012 thematic review, 2013 
SIPP operator guidance and 2014 Dear CEO letter to be of relevance to his consideration 
of Mr Adams claim. But it doesnt follow that those publications are irrelevant to my 
consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Im 
required to take into account good industry practice at the relevant time. And, as mentioned, 
the publications indicate what I consider amounts to good industry practice at the relevant 
time.
That doesnt mean that, in considering what is fair and reasonable, I will only consider the 
actions of Options with these documents in mind. The reports, Dear CEO letter and 
guidance gave non-exhaustive examples of good industry practice. They didnt say the 
suggestions given were the limit of what a SIPP operator should do. As the annex to the 
Dear CEO letter notes, what should be done to meet regulatory obligations will depend on 
the circumstances.
To be clear, I dont say the Principles or the publications obliged Options to ensure the 
pension transfer was suitable for Mr C. I accept Options wasnt required to advise Mr C, and 
couldnt advise him. And I accept the publications dont alter the meaning of, or the scope of, 
the Principles. But theyre evidence of what I consider to have been good industry practice at 
the relevant time, which would bring about the outcomes envisaged by the Principles.
What did Options obligations mean in practice?
In this case, the business Options was conducting was its operation of SIPPs. Im satisfied 
that meeting its regulatory obligations when conducting this business would include deciding 
whether to accept or reject particular investments and/or referrals of business. The 
regulatory publications provided some examples of good industry practice observed by the 
FSA and FCA during their work with SIPP operators including being satisfied that a particular 
introducer is appropriate to deal with.As noted above, its clear from Options non-regulated introducer profile, that it understood 
and accepted that its obligations meant it had a responsibility to carry out due diligence on 
Caledonian.
Im satisfied that, to meet its regulatory obligations, when conducting its business, Options 
was required to consider whether to accept or reject particular referrals of business, with the 
Principles in mind. This seems consistent with its own understanding  as the Options 
Compliance Officer noted in email on 26 April 2013:
We have a responsibility to proactively monitor our distribution channels to ensure 
our products do not end up with customers for whom it is not suitable.
And I note in submissions on other complaints Options has told us that adherence to TCF 
(treating customers fairly) is something it had in mind when considering its approach to 
introducer due diligence i.e. the question of whether it should accept business from a 
particular introducer.
All in all Im satisfied that, to meet the appropriate standards of good industry practice and 
the obligations set by the regulators rules and regulations, Options shouldve carried out due 
diligence on Caledonian which was consistent with good industry practice and its regulatory 
obligations at the time. And in my opinion Options shouldve used the knowledge it gained 
from its due diligence to decide whether to accept or reject a referral of business or particular 
investment.
Summary of my decision
Taking into account the evidence of Options relationship with Caledonian, mentioned above, 
Ive considered what due diligence Options ought to have undertaken and what it ought to 
have concluded about Caledonians business.
The 2009 Thematic Review Report dealt specifically with the relationships between SIPP 
operators and introducers or intermediaries. And it gave non-exhaustive examples of good 
practice. In my view, to meet these standards, and its regulatory obligations, set by the 
Principles, Options ought to have identified a significant risk of consumer detriment arising 
from the business model Caledonian described to it at the outset. And so, Options ought to 
have ensured it thought very carefully about accepting applications from Caledonian.
I think its fair and reasonable to say that Options shouldve obtained a full understanding of 
Caledonians business model and put in place a clear agreement with Caledonian 
addressing the risk generally posed to consumers by the introducer.
Although I think Options understood and accepted it had a responsibility to carry out due 
diligence on Caledonian (as shown by the opening statement of its Non-Regulated 
Introducer Profile), I dont think it identified as it should have several issues which ought to 
have given it cause for concern until it was too late and it had already accepted Mr Cs 
application.
Whilst I accept Options did take some steps which could be argued did amount to good 
practice consistent with its regulatory obligations, I think, with its regulatory obligations and 
good industry practice in mind, Options ought to have done more at the outset of its 
relationship with Caledonian. And Options didnt, in any case, draw fair and reasonable 
conclusions from the information available to it by the time of Mr Cs application. And, had 
Options done more at the outset and/or drawn fair and reasonable conclusions from what it 
knew, it ought in my view to have concluded that it shouldnt accept Mr Cs application from 
Caledonian.It follows that its fair and reasonable to uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Because Ive decided to uphold Mr Cs complaint on the basis that Options shouldnt have 
accepted his introduction from Caledonian, its not necessary for me to consider whether or 
not Options shouldve allowed the FPI investment in Mr Cs SIPP. I make no findings about 
the appropriateness of the FPI investment for the Options SIPP which Mr C opened.
Ive set out my findings in more detail below.
What activities did Caledonian undertake and what should Options have concluded?
Advice
I note Options has said it did not become aware that Caledonian was giving advice to 
Options clients. This is a surprising assertion, given Options recorded in March 2013, when 
assessing Caledonian, under the heading Advice:
No details of how advice given. No regulatory bodies / permissions seen. Although 
suggested on email that advice given in Jordan?
Advice possibly given in Jordan, although not sure if true for UK based clients.
And so, it seems Options understood at this point that advice was being given. To ask 
questions about how and where advice was being given, the conclusion must first have been 
reached that advice was being given. There is nothing to suggest this was a view it had 
recently reached  rather it seems that it was an existing understanding which was being 
flagged as an issue for the first time.
When further action on this point was eventually taken by Options a member of its staff said 
on 30 April 2013:
No they [Caledonian] don't [give advice], they consult with the client on the feasibility 
of transferring their Armed Forces Pension Scheme into a SIPP
This seems to be an effort to back-track on the earlier answers given to the questions in the 
26 April 2013 email, which appear to accept Caledonian was giving advice, although much 
else was unknown. But, to my mind, describing Caledonians role as consulting on the 
feasibility of doing something is simply another way of describing an advisory role. It would 
also have been clear to Options that Caledonians role wasnt limited to advice on the 
transfer out of the consumers existing scheme  it was declared on the FPI applications that 
Caledonian was giving advice on the bond too, and so any consulting was not solely limited 
to the transfer out from the existing scheme. This was clearly not viewed by Options as a 
satisfactory answer to this point in any event as its enquiries continued and, on 10 May 
2013, Options asked Caledonian:
Are you giving advice and if so in what capacity and under what regulatory 
environment are you providing this advice.
This shows Options was clearly of the view at this point that, at the very least, Caledonian 
might be giving advice as there is no other basis on which it could have sought clarification 
from Caledonian as to whether advice was being given.
It seems this was a view Options maintained. As set out above, it later noted:Following a detailed review of the process and documentation concerns were raised 
regarding whether the clients could be deemed to be receiving advice through an 
unregulated entity.
Following a request for further clarification on these points we have not been able to 
satisfy ourselves that this is not the case
And it ultimately concluded in May 2013 that all business should come to it through a UK IFA 
with permissions to give pension transfer advice  an unusual step to take if it did not remain 
of the view there was at least a risk Caledonian was giving advice. Although Options has 
said it took that step as a wider policy decision and not as a response to concerns about 
Caledonian, the evidence it gave about that wider policy decision suggested that the wider 
policy decision was made in 2014, and was based on reviews and considerations which 
mostly took place after May 2013. The decision as it related to Caledonian appears to be set 
out in a document from May 2013 headed Caledonian Relationship Review 2013.
The above suggests to me that Options knew  or suspected  that advice was being given 
from the outset, but that it took a reactive, piecemeal approach to addressing this obvious 
risk.
Furthermore, from the information available to Options at the outset of its relationship with 
Caledonian, there was a clear identifiable risk that Caledonian was giving advice. 
Caledonian said, at the outset, it was:
preferred adviser for the Armed Forces occupational pension scheme
a consultant to these clients and advised them on their armed forces transfers only
currently putting them into an international Friends Provident Bond
And Caledonians sales process was described as:
Referral  Visit  Analysis  Visit
Finally, as mentioned, many of the FPI applications I have seen confirm Caledonian was 
giving advice (in Jordan  a point Ill turn to below) and Options would have been privy to 
many of these forms from an early stage in its relationship with Caledonian.
I note it was recorded that Caledonian advised on the transfer only but it was also recorded 
that it was selecting the investment vehicle (the FPI bond). And it is also very difficult to see 
how advice on a transfer out did not encompass advice on where to transfer to (i.e. the 
SIPP)  particularly when it was clearly anticipated that all consumers would be transferring 
to an Options SIPP. It is not clear how this could happen without those consumers being 
advised to take this course of action.
Furthermore, the Referral  Visit  Analysis  Visit process Caledonian describes is a 
typical advice process involving an initial meeting, information gathering and analysis, and a 
further meeting.
Options should also have been aware that its not usual for pension transfers to happen 
without the consumer receiving advice or a recommendation  and very unusual for this to 
happen at a rate of 50 a month, which Caledonian was proposing. Options shouldve 
concluded that it was simply implausible that such a large volume of consumers were 
deciding to transfer out of their existing schemes, open a SIPP with Options, and make the 
same FPI investments within the SIPP without being advised to do so.I note the Options terms of business with Caledonian, signed September 2012 (but, Options 
says, in place since March 2012) said:
The Business Introducer undertakes that they will not provide advice as defined by 
the Act in relation to the SIPP  for the avoidance of doubt this includes reference to 
advice on the selection of The SIPP Operator, contributions, transfer of benefits, 
taking benefits and HMRC rules
I also note the SIPP application form which was signed and dated by Mr C said:
This Form should be used if you are a client establishing a SIPP without advice. You 
have made this decision independently and are aware of the implications of this 
decision.
And:
As you do not have a Financial Adviser, your investment choices are your sole 
responsibility. You will instruct us and we will act on those instructions as long as it is 
an accepted investment in the Carey Pension Scheme.
But the Options members declaration included the following:
I confirm that I have received full and appropriate advice from Caledonian 
International and following this advice I wish to proceed with the transfer.
And, as already mentioned, the FPI application documents confirmed advice had been 
given.
So I dont think the application documents in this case gave Options any basis to conclude 
advice hadnt been given  particularly given what I say above. They present a confused, 
inconsistent, picture. And where the documents expressly said that Mr C had not been 
advised, they said in most instances that Options hadnt advised Mr C, rather than that 
Caledonian hadnt advised Mr C.
Taking account of the available evidence I consider that, in this case, Caledonian did provide 
advice to Mr C on the merits of transferring his pension to the SIPP and investing in the FPI 
bond. It appears more likely than not that Caledonian proactively suggested to Mr C he 
consider transferring his occupational pension. Mr C indicated that he recalled initiating 
contact with Caledonian because everyone was signing up to them. But he also said he had 
no investment experience and no intention of transferring his pension but that Caledonian 
gave him a number of reasons why he would be better off transferring and investing in FPI, 
including that he could expect a high return on his investment and could access his pension 
sooner if he transferred it. And Mr C transferred to the same SIPP and made the same 
investment as many other consumers who Caledonian introduced  the SIPP and 
investment that Caledonian had said it was putting its customers into.
So Im satisfied advice was given to Mr C by Caledonian in this case, and that, from the 
outset of its relationship with Caledonian, Options was (or at the very least ought to have 
been) aware, generally, that Caledonian was offering advice to consumers, or there was a 
significant risk it might be doing so.
Arranging
It is also clear from what Options was told by Caledonian at the outset  and from the 
available evidence in this complaint and others  that Caledonian was heavily involved in the arrangement of the transfer out of Mr Cs existing pension scheme to the SIPP and the 
investment of the cash transferred to the SIPP in the FPI bond. It clearly was not simply 
introducing Mr C to Options and leaving it to him to proceed with the application. It was 
involved in arranging the transfer out of Mr Cs existing pension to the SIPP, the setting up of 
the SIPP and in arranging the FPI bond and associated investments. It was involved in 
gathering all the information and documents needed for things to proceed. It sent Mr Cs 
application to Options, and was authorised by Mr C to receive any information it requested 
about Mr Cs SIPP or the purchase of investments in his SIPP. Mr C said Caledonian was 
managing it all.
I think Options ought to have been aware of this. The extent of Caledonians involvement 
was clear from the application documentation Caledonian sent to Options.
Where were the activities taking place?
I havent seen any evidence that, prior to May 2013, Options established where Caledonian 
was carrying out its activities in relation to each application  including Mr Cs. As set out 
above, Caledonian told Options at the outset that They [the consumers] were generally still 
resident in UK but some were now living abroad in various countries such as Thailand, 
Germany, Spain etc. It was also recorded that Caledonian had branches in Chile, Peru, 
Columbia, Argentina, Brazil and Switzerland. And, as Options later noted, Caledonian also 
used a UK address.
Caledonian also told Options at the outset the Majority of business carried out in 
unregulated jurisdictions but where regulations apply we are licensed to carry out our 
activities.
And, as mentioned, the sales process adopted by Caledonian was set out as Referral  Visit 
 Analysis  Visit. So it was clear Caledonian was meeting consumers in person.
Furthermore, the Certificate of Non-Solicitation signed by Caledonian for FPI  to which 
Options was privy  said in each instance (as far as Im aware) The advice was given in 
Jordan.
Caledonian therefore gave what appears to be conflicting information. But Options ought to 
have been aware, from what was said by Caledonian, that it was possible Caledonian might 
be dealing with a UK resident consumer in the UK, or dealing with a consumer in any one of 
a number of different countries, all of which might have different financial services regulatory 
regimes (or no such regime).
It is fair to say the picture was far from clear  and Options shouldve been aware it was 
unlikely all of the information provided by Caledonian could be correct. It is not, for example, 
clear how the advice in every instance could have been given in Jordan when, by 
Caledonians own account, it had a number of offices around the world (none of which were 
in Jordan), was dealing with consumers who were generally still resident in UK or living 
abroad in various countries and said elsewhere that it was carrying out business in various 
jurisdictions.
Options did not however check any of this at the outset. It was therefore in no position to 
know what, if any, regulatory regimes applied, and whether Caledonian required any 
authorisations to conduct the activities it did. Caledonian itself appears to have suggested it 
needed licences in some jurisdictions, but I have seen no evidence of it having given details 
of any such licences.I think Options shouldve been particularly concerned  given that, as mentioned, 
Caledonian told Options the consumers it dealt with were generally still resident in UK - 
about whether advice was being given (or any other regulated activity carried on) in the UK 
as Caledonian was not authorised by the FSA nor, later, the FCA. There was reason, as Ive 
explained, to think Caledonian might be breaching the general prohibition against persons 
carrying on a regulated activity in the UK without authorisation.
Despite this, Ive seen no evidence to show Options identified this risk until March 2013 
when, as set out above, it was noted:
No details of how advice given. No regulatory bodies / permissions seen. Although 
suggested on email that advice given in Jordan?
Advice possibly given in Jordan, although not sure if true for UK based clients.
Then no further action appears to have been taken until 26 April 2013 when, in a further 
internal email exchange at Options, the following questions were asked, and answers were 
received on 30 April 2013 (the below, in bold, are the first set of answers provided on this 
date):
Do they have a business address in the UK? They confirm that they do not have a 
permanent place of business in the UK, however they have a business address 
for correspondence and [Mr C of Caledonian] is based in the UK.
Where do they meet with clients, i.e. in the UK? Unknown. 
What is Caledonian's regulatory status, i.e. are they regulated in their home 
jurisdiction? [Mr C of Caledonian] - The Chartered Insurance Institute  [ID 
Number provided]. [Mr C of Caledonian] certifies all ID and signs the 
investment Application Form.
Are they regulated to provide advice in their home jurisdiction? Unknown
They have confirmed that they provide advice in Jordan. How does this work? Do 
they have a place of business in Jordan? Do they need to be regulated in Jordan to 
provide advice?  Unknown - Caledonian provide a Non Solicitation Letter which 
is sent to Friends Provident with the investment App. A copy of a Non 
Solicitation Letter is attached
Despite the uncertainty it was not until 10 May 2013, when Options finally challenged 
Caledonian on this point (amongst others):
Can you provide your organisational structure and the jurisdiction in which each is 
registered and the regulation/regulator that each company operates within. If you are 
relying on any exemptions please state which exemptions and the reasons you 
believe you can operate within those exemptions
What offices do you have and where, do the jurisdictions in which you have offices 
have a regulatory regime, if so can you provide details of the regulators in those 
jurisdictions.
Do you meet all your clients in Jordan, if not why do your Non Solicitation forms 
signed by yourself confirm the advice was given in JordanOn the Non Solicitation letters you note that Caledonian does not have a permanent 
place of business in the UK. However, you request correspondence to be sent to The 
Pensions Service Centre, [UK city]. Please can you clarify Caledonian's presence in 
the UK and the nature of the office in [UK city].
Given what I say above, acting fairly and reasonably, Options shouldve made these 
enquiries at the outset. And as set out in the background, these enquiries (along with the 
other points of query put to Caledonian and then discussed with it) led to Options quickly 
concluding it should not accept further applications from Caledonian unless they came 
through a UK IFA with permissions to give pension transfer advice  a restriction which it 
seems had the effect of no further business being introduced by Caledonian. I think it fair to 
say that Options wouldve reached the same conclusion had it taken this action at the outset 
of its relationship with Caledonian. And it certainly should have done so, to act fairly and 
reasonably to meet its regulatory obligations and standards of good practice.
In Mr Cs case, his home address in 2012 was in the UK but he said he worked abroad at 
the time of his dealings with Caledonian. He said his dealings with Caledonian were by email 
and phone. Its not clear whether Caledonian carried out regulated activities in the UK in 
Mr Cs case. Although his pension was in any event arranged in the UK. But even if 
Caledonian didnt give advice in the UK, that doesnt mean that, in the interests of its 
customer, Options shouldnt have taken steps to establish the regulatory regime or regimes 
Caledonian was operating under. I think its also fair to say that in relation to other 
applications, from customers other than Mr C, Options ought to have been aware that 
regulated activities were taking place in the UK. And if Options had developed that 
awareness, as I believe it should have, through taking appropriate steps at the start of its 
relationship with Caledonian, its more likely than not it either wouldnt have entered into a 
relationship with Caledonian at all, or it would have ended its relationship with Caledonian 
before accepting Mr Cs application. 
Caledonians expertise
Caledonians proposed business model, as documented at Options first meeting with its 
representative, involved former members of the armed forces who, it said, worked in security 
related jobs in dangerous areas. The business model was not one involving, say, former 
financial advisers or other finance professionals. Mr C was working for a private security 
company when he met Caledonian.
There was therefore no reason to think the typical client Caledonian proposed to introduce to 
Options had a good understanding of pensions or was in a position to work out for 
themselves if a pension transfer was in their best interests. Theyd be reliant on 
Caledonians advice.
The introductions involved transfers out of a defined benefit pension scheme into a UK SIPP 
for investment in several investments within an FPI bond. The transfer of defined benefit 
pensions are usually not in customers best interests, are complex and present a variety of 
consequences and matters which the ordinary individual would be hard pressed to 
understand without professional financial advice. Those giving such advice in the UK are 
required by the FCA to pass specialist exams, reflecting the risks and complexities involved. 
Options, as a provider of SIPPs, would or ought to have been aware of this.
Not only did Caledonians advisers not have the qualifications required by the FCA (or FSA 
as it then was) to give advice on pension transfers, but theres also no evidence they had 
any relevant qualifications. The only qualification of any kind which was mentioned was that 
Mr C of Caledonian was a qualified accountant.Ive seen no evidence to show Options noted this obvious risk until March 2013 when it 
reviewed its relationship with Caledonian and Professional Qualification was assessed as 
high risk. The reason for this assessment was No qualifications documented other than 
meeting note from March 2012 where [Mr C of Caledonian] stated he was a qualified 
accountant and member of Chartered Institute of Accountants.
And, despite this high risk flag, Ive seen no evidence Options took any action until 26 April 
2013 when it asked How did we establish Caledonians knowledge of SIPPs and UK 
pension rules? The answer to this was initially recorded on 30 April as unknown. The later 
answer on 30 April was, By meeting with them twice and by running a workshop for them 
output from which is attached. But I do not think this is enough to show Options had 
sufficiently addressed this risk  it does nothing to show Caledonian's staff had adequate 
qualifications or capabilities.
Again, this (along with the other points of query raised at the time) was a point which led to 
Options concluding it should not accept further applications from Caledonian unless they 
came through a UK IFA with permissions to give pension transfer advice  a restriction 
which had the effect of no further business being introduced by Caledonian. And I think it fair 
to say Options wouldve reached the same conclusion had it taken this action at the outset of 
its relationship with Caledonian. And it certainly shouldve done so to meet its regulatory 
obligations and standards of good practice.
The transfer process
As mentioned above, a defined benefit transfer is a complex transaction. It also involves 
many risks, and potentially the loss of significant guaranteed benefits. For this reason, 
advice on such transactions is tightly regulated in the UK and there are standards of good 
practice that those giving the advice are expected to follow. This means several steps need 
to be taken as part of the advice process and documentation such as fact-finds, suitability 
reports, transfer analysis reports (TVAS), and illustrations generally feature in the advice 
process. The purpose is to ensure any advice given takes into account all relevant factors, is 
suitable, and the recipient of the advice is in a fully informed position, where they understand 
the benefits they are giving up and the risks associated with the transfer.
Ive seen no evidence to show Caledonian followed such a process. In my opinion it 
wouldve been fair and reasonable for Options to have identified this as a clear risk of 
consumer detriment  particularly given that Caledonians starting point appears to have 
been that the consumers it dealt with would be transferring out of the defined benefit scheme 
(i.e. it seems to have taken the view a transfer was suitable for all).
Had Options taken steps to ascertain whether a reasonable process was in place it wouldve 
become aware no such process was in place, and consumers were not therefore fully 
informed before agreeing to make the transfer to the SIPP and the associated FPI bond 
investments.
The reference by Options to Illustrations in the list of questions in the 26 April 2013 email 
and the initial answers to those questions appears to be an acknowledgement of this risk: 
Based on our contact with Caledonian and reviewing the illustrations they provide to 
clients, do we have concerns that Caledonian is providing poor advice/ information? 
Yes due to illustrations
Again, this (along with the other points of query raised at the time) appears to be a point 
which led to Options concluding it shouldnt accept further applications from Caledonian 
except through a UK IFA with permission to give pension transfer advice  a restriction which had the effect of no further business being introduced by Caledonian. And I think it fair 
to say Options wouldve reached the same conclusion had it taken this action at the outset of 
its relationship with Caledonian. And it shouldve done so, on a fair and reasonable basis to 
meet its regulatory obligations and standards of good practice.
Volume of business
At the outset of the relationship between Options and Caledonian, Options was told 
Caledonian would introduce about 50 applications a month (and I note a similar volume was 
introduced, once the relationship began).
I think on a fair and reasonable basis, Options shouldve been concerned that Caledonian 
intended to (and did) make such a high volume of introductions, relating only to occupational 
pension schemes. In my view this was a further reason for Options to conclude there was a 
significant risk of consumer detriment  particularly when considered alongside the other 
points Ive set out here.
Firstly, its not clear how Caledonian would be, or was, bringing about such a high volume of 
applications without giving advice. It was simply implausible it could bring about this number 
of applications without influencing consumers actions through a positive recommendation. 
Options also ought to have considered Caledonians competence to deal with this volume of 
transfers  theres no evidence to show it had the significant resources this would require.
Further, Options shouldve been aware of the very low likelihood that the transfers would all 
be suitable. At the outset of the relationship between Options and Caledonian (and at the 
time of Mr Cs application) COBS 19.1.6G said:
When advising a retail client who is, or is eligible to be, a member of a defined 
benefits occupational pension scheme whether to transfer or opt out, a firm should 
start by assuming that a transfer or opt out will not be suitable (my emphasis). A firm 
should only then consider a transfer or opt out to be suitable if it can clearly 
demonstrate, on contemporary evidence that the transfer or opt out is in the clients 
best interest.
I accept this aims to define the expectation of a regulated financial adviser when determining 
suitability of a pension transfer but Id expect Options, as a pensions provider, to have been 
aware of this and taken account of it.
Finally, Options had cause to question the motivations of Caledonian, if it were bringing 
about such a high volume of applications. There was a clear risk that Caledonian was putting 
its own interests above those of Mr C.
Commission
I also think the level of commission that was being paid to Caledonian shouldve given 
Options cause for concern.
It appears Caledonian was typically taking around 7% of the transfer amount in commission, 
and Options was told this was the case at the outset of its relationship with Caledonian. As 
noted earlier in my findings, theres no evidence to show Caledonian carried out any of the 
usual work associated with a defined benefit transfer that would justify such a fee. Nor have I 
seen any other evidence to show there was any justification for such a high level of 
commission in the circumstances. I think this level of commission ought to have been 
another cause for Options to be concerned that Caledonian was putting its own interests 
ahead of the interests of consumers, including Mr C. And of course it was further reason to consider Caledonian might be giving advice, as commission at this level wouldve been very 
likely to motivate it to encourage consumers to proceed, through a positive recommendation. 
Overall, when considered alongside the high volumes of near identical introductions of 
business being made by Caledonian I think this level of commission raises questions about 
the motives and role of Caledonian.
Caledonians Accounts
I note that Options made repeated requests for Caledonian's accounts. It sent several emails 
to Caledonian between March and August 2012. Options also explained in its email of 23 
March 2012 that, to comply with its own compliance procedures, it needed the accounts.
Nevertheless, on 27 April 2012 Options started accepting introductions from Caledonian 
having not received the accounts  seemingly in breach of its own procedures. Acting fairly 
and reasonably, Options shouldve met its own standards and shouldve checked 
Caledonians accounts at the outset before accepting any business from it. And, based on 
Caledonians conduct, it seems very unlikely accounts would ever have been forthcoming. 
Caledonians reluctance to provide basic information should also have been a further factor 
which ought to have led Options to question whether it should enter into or continue a 
relationship with Caledonian. This again calls into question the competence and motivations 
of Caledonian and it also calls into question the ability of Caledonian to organise its affairs. It 
also meant Options was missing information which might be critical to the decision about 
whether to enter into business with Caledonian, such as, for example, information about the 
nature, volume and location of Caledonians business, and its resources to carry on that 
business.
It is notable that Options accepted and set up Mr Cs SIPP when it was still waiting for this 
information from Caledonian.
In conclusion 
Taking all of the above into consideration  individually and cumulatively  I think in the 
circumstances its fair and reasonable for me to conclude that Options ought reasonably to 
have concluded, had it complied with its regulatory obligations which required it to conduct 
sufficient due diligence on Caledonian and draw fair and reasonable conclusions from what it 
discovered, that it shouldnt accept business from Caledonian, including Mr Cs application. I 
therefore conclude that its fair and reasonable in the circumstances to say Options shouldnt 
have accepted Mr Cs application from Caledonian.
Did Options act fairly and reasonably in proceeding with Mr Cs instructions?
In my view, for the reasons given, Options simply shouldve refused to accept Mr Cs 
application. So things shouldnt have got beyond that. However, for completeness, Ive 
considered whether it was fair and reasonable for Options to proceed with Mr Cs 
application.
I acknowledge Mr C was asked to sign a members declaration. I note this document gives 
warnings about the loss of benefits that would result in the transfer to the SIPP. And the 
indemnities sought to confirm that Mr C wouldnt hold Options responsible for any losses 
resulting from the investments. However, I dont think this document demonstrates Options 
acted fairly and reasonably by proceeding with Mr Cs instructions.Asking Mr C to sign a declaration absolving Options of all its responsibilities when it ought to 
have known that Mr Cs dealings with Caledonian were putting him at significant risk was not 
the fair and reasonable thing to do. I also note that the declaration was based on Mr C 
having received full and appropriate advice from Caledonian International where, for the 
reasons Ive given, Options ought to have been aware Caledonian didnt have the 
competency to give such advice and there were questions about its motivations and 
integrity.
Asking Mr C to sign declarations was not an effective way for Options to meet its regulatory 
obligations, given the concerns Options ought to have identified about his introduction. So, it 
was not fair and reasonable to proceed, on the basis of these. I make this point only for 
completeness  the primary point is Mr C should simply not have been able to proceed, as 
his application should simply not have been accepted.
Fair compensation
I note Options says, in its response to the Investigators view, that its evident that Mr C 
wished to transfer his pension, whether through Options or another provider and would 
therefore have suffered the same loss as he did even if it had rejected his application. 
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr C wouldve proceeded even if Options had rejected 
his application. Ive seen nothing to suggest he was looking to make a transfer prior to his 
contact with Caledonian. Mr C had not previously dealt with a financial adviser and had no 
investment experience which I think makes it unlikely that he would seek to transfer and 
invest the pension entitlements held in his defined benefit Army pension without the advice 
of a third party. And Mr C said he wasnt thinking of changing his pension but he trusted 
Caledonians advice. So I dont think Mr C was sufficiently determined to make the transfer 
and the investment that he wouldve done so even if Options had refused to facilitate it.
I have not, in any event, seen any evidence that any other SIPP operator dealt with 
Caledonian. And any operator acting fairly and reasonably shouldve reached the conclusion 
that it shouldnt deal with Caledonian. I dont think itd be fair to say Mr C shouldnt be 
compensated based on speculation that another SIPP operator might have made the same 
mistakes as Options.
For similar reasons, Im not persuaded Mr C shouldnt be compensated by Options, or his 
compensation should be reduced, because I havent made the finding that the FPI bond 
investment, in itself, was not something Options should have accepted. Or because the 
benefits from Mr Cs existing pension were lost once the transfer request was made. If 
Options had acted fairly and reasonably to meet its regulatory obligations and good industry 
practice, the application wouldnt have proceeded at all. So no transfer request or FPI bond 
investment would have been made.
So, Im satisfied that Options failure to comply with its regulatory obligations and industry 
best practice at the relevant time have led to Mr C suffering a loss to his pension. And my 
aim is therefore to return Mr C to the pension position he would now be in but for Options 
failings.
Putting things right
My aim is to return Mr C to the position he would now be in but for what I consider to be 
Options failure to carry out adequate due diligence checks before accepting his SIPP 
application. I appreciate that Options might not think Mr C has suffered a loss. But it cant 
know that until the requisite calculations have taken place. And I doubt very much that the benefits Mr C will get from the SIPP are equivalent to what he would have got from his 
Armed Forces pension.
In light of the above, I require that Options should calculate fair compensation by comparing 
the current position to the position Mr C would be in if he had not transferred from his 
existing pension.
In summary, Options should:
1. Calculate the loss Mr C has suffered as a result of making the transfer.
2. Take ownership of any investments which cant be surrendered, if possible.
3. Pay compensation for the loss into Mr Cs pension. If thats not possible, pay 
compensation for the loss to Mr C direct. In either case the payment should take into 
account necessary adjustments set out below.
4. Pay Mr C £500 for the distress and inconvenience caused by its failure to act fairly 
and reasonably.
Ill explain how Options should carry out the calculation set out at 1-3 above in further detail 
below.
(1) Calculate the loss Mr C has suffered as a result of making the transfer (the loss 
calculation)
On 2 August 2022, the FCA launched a consultation on new defined benefit transfer redress 
guidance and has set out its proposals in a consultation document - CP22/15- calculating 
redress for non-compliant pension transfer advice.
In this consultation, the FCA has said that it considers that the current redress methodology 
in Finalised Guidance (FG) 17/19 (Guidance for firms on how to calculate redress for 
unsuitable defined benefit pension transfers) remains appropriate and fundamental changes 
are not necessary. However, its review has identified some areas where the FCA considers 
it could improve or clarify the methodology to ensure it continues to provide appropriate 
redress.
A policy statement was published on 28 November 2022 which set out the new rules and 
guidance  https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps22-13.pdf. The new rules will come 
into effect on 1 April 2023.
The FCA has said that it expects firms to continue to calculate and offer compensation to 
their customers using the existing guidance in FG 17/9 for the time being. But until changes 
take effect, firms should give customers the option of waiting for their compensation to be 
calculated in line with the new rules and guidance.
Weve previously asked Mr C whether he preferred to have any redress calculated now in 
line with current guidance or to wait for the new guidance/rules to come into effect.
Hes said he would like his complaint to be settled in line with new guidance/rules. I consider 
its fair that Options calculates Mr Cs redress in line with new guidance and rules when they 
come into effect. 
The basic objective of the amendments to the redress methodology still remains to put a 
consumer, as far as possible, into the position they would be in if theyd remained in the defined benefit pension scheme. Having reviewed the FCAs consultation and policy 
statement, Im satisfied that the changes still reflect a fair way to compensate Mr C.
Options must undertake a redress calculation in line with the updated methodology as soon 
as any new rules and/or guidance come into effect (rather than to calculate and pay any due 
compensation now in line with FG17/9).
In accordance with the regulators expectations, this should be undertaken or submitted to 
an appropriate provider promptly once any new guidance/rules come into effect.
(2) Take ownership of any investments held within the SIPP which cannot be surrendered 
In order for the SIPP to be closed and further SIPP fees to be prevented, the investment(s) 
need(s) to be removed from the SIPP. To do this, Options should calculate an amount it is 
willing to accept as a commercial value for any investments that cannot be surrendered and 
pay that sum into the SIPP and take ownership of the relevant investments. This amount 
should be taken into account for the loss calculation.
If Options is unwilling or unable to purchase the investment(s) the value of them should be 
assumed to be nil for the purposes of the loss calculation if the investments are not readily 
realisable (or for any portion of the investments which is not readily realisable).
I appreciate such investments may have a realisable value in the future. Provided Mr C is 
compensated in full, Options may ask Mr C to provide an undertaking to account to it for the 
net amount of any payment the SIPP may receive from the investment(s). That undertaking 
should allow for the effect of any tax and charges on the amount Mr C may receive from the 
investment(s) and any eventual sums he would be able to access. Options should meet any 
costs in drawing up the undertaking and any reasonable costs for advice required by Mr C to 
approve it.
If Options doesnt take ownership of the investment(s), and it/they continue to be held in 
Mr Cs SIPP, there will be ongoing fees in relation to the administration of that SIPP. Mr C 
wouldnt be responsible for those fees if Options hadnt accepted the transfer of his 
occupational pension into the SIPP. So, I think its fair and reasonable for Options to waive 
any SIPP fees until such time as Mr C can dispose of the investment(s) and close the SIPP.
(3) Pay compensation to Mr C for loss he has suffered calculated in (1)
Since the loss Mr C has suffered is within his pension it is right that I try to restore the value 
of his pension provision if that is possible. So, if possible, the compensation for the loss 
should be paid into his SIPP. The compensation shouldnt be paid into the pension if it would 
conflict with any existing protection or allowance. Payment into the pension should allow for 
the effect of charges and any available tax relief. This may mean the compensation should 
be increased to cover the charges and reduced to notionally allow for the income tax relief 
Mr C could claim. The notional allowance should be calculated using Mr Cs marginal rate of 
tax.
On the other hand, Options may not be able to pay the compensation into the SIPP. If so 
compensation for the loss should be paid to Mr C direct. But had it been possible to pay the 
compensation into the pension, it would have provided a taxable income.
Therefore, the compensation for the loss paid to Mr C should be reduced to notionally allow 
for any income tax that would otherwise have been paid. The notional allowance should be 
calculated using Mr Cs marginal rate of tax in retirement. For example, if Mr C is likely to be 
a basic rate taxpayer in retirement, the notional allowance would equate to a reduction in the total amount equivalent to the current basic rate of tax. However, if Mr C would have been 
able to take a tax-free lump sum, the notional allowance should be applied to 75% of the 
total amount.
Pay Mr C £500 for the distress and inconvenience caused by their failure to act fairly and 
reasonably
Mr C transferred his pension away from a valuable defined benefits pension to a SIPP and 
had to suffer the loss of those benefits. I think its fair to say this would have caused Mr C 
some distress and inconvenience. He will clearly have been worried that his retirement 
provision will have been reduced. So, I consider that a payment of £500 is appropriate to 
compensate for that upset.
Interest
The compensation resulting from the loss assessment must where possible be paid to Mr C 
within 90 days of the date Options receives notification of his acceptance of any final 
decision I make. Further interest must be added to the compensation amount at the rate of 
8% per year simple from the date of my final decision to the date of settlement for any time, 
in excess of 90 days, that it takes Options to pay Mr C this compensation.
Its possible that data gathering for a SERPS adjustment may mean that the actual time 
taken to settle goes beyond the 90 day period allowed for settlement above  and so any 
period of time where the only outstanding item required to undertake the calculation is data 
from DWP may be added to the 90 day period in which interest wont apply. 
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If Options deducts income tax from the 
interest, it should tell Mr C how much has been taken off. Options should give Mr C a tax 
deduction certificate in respect of interest if Mr C asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax on 
interest from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Reassignment of rights
If Options believes other parties to be wholly or partly responsible for the loss, it is free to 
pursue those other parties. So if Mr Cs loss doesnt exceed £160,000, or if Options accepts 
my recommendation below that it should pay the full loss as calculated above, the 
compensation payable to Mr C should be contingent on the assignment by him to Options of 
any rights of action he may have against other parties in relation to his transfer to the SIPP 
and the investments, if Options is to request this. Options should cover the reasonable cost 
of drawing up, and Mr Cs taking advice on and approving, any assignment required.
If the loss exceeds £160,000 and Options does not accept my recommendation to pay the 
full amount, any assignment of Mr Cs rights should allow him to retain all rights to the 
difference between £160,000 and the full loss as calculated above.
Where I uphold a complaint, I can award fair compensation to be paid by a financial 
business of up to £160,000, plus any interest and/or costs/interest on costs that I think are 
appropriate. If I think that fair compensation is more than £160,000, I may recommend that 
the business pays the balance.
I do not know what award the above calculation might produce. So, whilst I acknowledge 
that the value of Mr Cs original investment was within our award limit, for completeness I 
have included information below about what ought to happen if fair compensation amounts 
to more than our award limit.Decision and award: I uphold this complaint. I think that fair compensation should be 
calculated as shown above. I require that Options UK Personal Pensions LLP pay Mr C the 
amount produced by that calculation  up to a maximum of £160,000 (including the £500 to 
compensate for the distress and inconvenience Options actions caused) plus interest at the 
rate of 8% per year simple from the date of my final decision to the date of settlement for any 
time, in excess of 90 days, that it takes Options to pay Mr C this compensation.
Recommendation: If the amount produced by the calculation of fair compensation is more 
than £160,000, I recommend that Options pays Mr C the balance. 
I further recommend interest be added to this balance at the rate of 8% a year simple for any 
time, in excess of 90 days, that it takes Options to pay Mr C from the date it receives 
notification of his acceptance of this decision, as set out above.
If Mr C accepts my final determination, the money award and the requirements of this 
decision will be binding on Options. My recommendation wont be binding on Options.
Its unlikely that Mr C can accept my decision and go to court to ask for the balance after the 
money has been paid. Mr C may want to get independent legal advice before deciding 
whether to accept this final decision.
My final decision
For the reasons given, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. To put things right 
Options UK Personal Pensions LLP must take the actions and calculate and pay Mr C the 
award set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2023.
