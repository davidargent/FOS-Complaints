The complaint
Mr J complains about the amount that hes been charged by Volkswagen Financial Services 
(UK) Limited, trading as Audi Financial Services, for an early settlement of a hire purchase 
agreement under which a car had been supplied to him. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr J electronically signed a hire purchase agreement in November 2018 which said 
that he would make 24 monthly payments of £463.33 for a used car to be supplied to 
him;
the agreement clearly set out that the interest rate was 11%; the amount of credit 
was £10,000 and the total amount payable was £36,379.92  which included 
£11,119.92 from the 24 payments that he was to make;
hes provided a handwritten note of some numbers relating to the agreement but 
which refers to an interest rate of 5.6% - but I dont consider that that note is enough 
to be a legal agreement between Mr J and either the dealer or Audi Financial 
Services  and I dont consider it to be reasonable for Mr J to expect that a car would 
be supplied to him solely on the basis of that handwritten note;
Mr J electronically signed the hire purchase agreement and in doing so he agreed to 
the terms that it contained  I consider that it was his responsibility to check the 
agreement before he signed it  even if it was only signing on a screen  and that it 
was reasonable to expect him to have raised any concerns about it with the dealer 
before he signed it;
he contacted Audi Financial Services in March 2019 about an early settlement of the 
agreement and it said that his outstanding balance was £9,739.93 and that hed have 
to pay £9,107.88 to settle the agreement as there would be an early settlement 
rebate of interest of £632.05;
Audi Financial Services has said that the rebate was calculated correctly and in 
accordance with the Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations 2004  but 
Mr J has asked for a more detailed explanation of the calculations;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the early settlement 
figure has been calculated incorrectly, that Audi Financial Services has acted unfairly 
or unreasonably in its dealings with Mr J or that the agreement was mis-sold to him; 
and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Audi Financial Services to provide Mr J with a more detailed explanation of the 
settlement figure, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Js complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 August 2020.
