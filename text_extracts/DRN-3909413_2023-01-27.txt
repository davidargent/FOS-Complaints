The complaint
S complains about National Westminster Bank Plcs decision to close its accounts.
What happened
S opened a business account with NatWest in June 2021. The day after, NatWest informed 
S it was closing its accounts with immediate notice. 
S wanted to know why. NatWest confirmed that all new accounts were subject to further 
checks and as a result of those checks, theyd made the decision to end their banking 
relationship with S. NatWest confirmed theyre not obliged to provide any details to S.
S brought the complaint to our service. Ss director explained, on Ss behalf, that he believes 
NatWest closed Ss accounts due to a judicial error made against him previously. Ss 
director provided evidence to show he had no criminal records against him, nor any pending 
charges. He said NatWest closing Ss account caused a lot of distress and he wasnt able to 
run the business in the way he wanted to.
While the complaint was waiting to be allocated, NatWest made a proactive offer of £100 to 
resolve things. S didnt accept it.
Our adjudicator reviewed things and thought NatWests offer of £100 was fair in the 
circumstances. He explained NatWest were entitled to close the accounts but felt they 
should have given S 60 days notice instead of closing it immediately. Our adjudicator 
recognised there hadnt been any activity on either of the accounts and hadnt seen any 
evidence of financial loss to S. So, he didnt think NatWests offer needed to be increased.
S disagreed. Ss director sent evidence of a contract which he says S lost out on through not 
having a bank account. Our adjudicator confirmed that he hadnt seen any reason why S 
couldnt have opened an alternative account to continue with his business and therefore 
couldnt reasonably ask NatWest to compensate S for this potential loss.
S remained unhappy. As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed 
to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal and 
regulatory obligations. Theyre also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of new and 
existing relationships. Having looked at whats happened, Im satisfied NatWest was 
complying with their legal and regulatory obligations when they reviewed Ss account. So, I 
cant fairly say theyve done anything wrong.
At times, following a review, banks sometimes choose to end their relationship with 
customers. This can be due to a number of reasons and a bank isnt obliged to give a reason 
to the customer. Just the same as if S decided to stop banking with NatWest, it wouldnt 
have to explain why. However, NatWest can only close accounts in certain circumstances 
and if its in the terms and conditions of the account. NatWest have relied on the terms and 
conditions when closing Ss account. The terms explain that the bank can close the account 
immediately  or give notice of around 60 days. Ive considered the full circumstances of this 
complaint and I agree a notice period of 60 days would have been more appropriate than an 
immediate closure. I say that because I havent seen any substantial evidence to show why 
an immediate closure was necessary in the circumstances of this complaint. I think the two 
months would have also given S sufficient time to make alternative banking arrangements 
and would have prevented any impact on its business.
Putting things right
Ive thought carefully about the impact NatWests actions had on S. I recognise the accounts 
hadnt had any activity carried out on them  but I do recognise S says it lost out on a 
contract because it didnt have a bank account. I dont doubt NatWest closing the accounts 
the day after they agreed to open would have had a detrimental effect on S and any potential 
business. But I havent seen enough to satisfy me that I can fairly hold NatWest responsible 
for the loss of a contract. Like our adjudicator, I think S could have mitigated its losses by 
opening another account to allow its business to continue to operate.
I appreciate Ss director wants NatWest to confirm the real reason for the closure  but Ive 
explained above why theyre not obliged to do that.
Overall, considering the full circumstances of this complaint, I consider NatWests offer of 
£100 fairly reflects the inconvenience caused to S by its accounts being closed immediately. 
And therefore, I wont be asking them to pay anything more.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. 
To put things right, National Westminster Bank Plc should pay S £100 compensation for the 
distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask S to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2023.
