K822xcomplaint
Miss H complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) wont refund her the price  
she paid for a holiday cottage  using her RBS credit  card. She brings her complaint  under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit  Act 1974 (section 75).
background 
In 2017 Miss H booked  a holiday  cottage  (for 6 adults) at a cost of £1,486 (inclusive  of a £30 
booking fee) for 14 nights, commencing Saturday 9 June 2018.
In July 2017 Miss H paid a £100  deposit  for the accommodation using her RBS credit card. 
She cleared her card balance (inclusive  of this sum) in August 2017.
In April 2018 Miss H paid the balance of £1,386 for the accommodation  using her RBS credit 
card. She cleared  her card balance (inclusive of this sum) in May 2018.
Miss H says:
that when  she arrived at the accommodation  on Saturday 9 June 2018 it was dirty 
and not of the standard she was expecting, or had paid for
on Monday 11 June 2018,  and in order to carry out a clean of the accommodation 
herself, she purchased a vacuum cleaner at a cost of £59.99
on Wednesday 13 June 2018,  and after some cleaning of the accommodation by the 
owners agents, she needed  to get medical assistance for her allergic asthma
on having sought medical assistance she was prescribed steroids
on Thursday 14 June  2018, and after the sofa had been cleaned  by the owners  
agents, she undertook  a further  clean of the accommodation herself
she spent her holiday from Thursday  14 June 2018 without front room curtains and 
rug, both which had been removed on Thursday 14 June 2018 by the owners agents 
for cleaning
Following her return from holiday Miss H submitted a claim to RBS under section 75 for 
breach of contract and/or misrepresentation.
RBS responded  to say that it didnt  believe a valid debtor-creditor-supplier (d-c-s) 
relationship existed for it to have to consider a section  75 claim.
Unhappy with RBSs  response to her complaint Miss H referred it to our service.
In January 2019 one of our investigators  wrote to RBS (and Miss H) to say that he believed 
there was a valid d-c-s relationship and that it should give due consideration to Miss Hs 
section 75 claim.
Then in February  2019 the investigator wrote to RBS (and Miss H) to say that in his view 
Miss Hs complaint should be upheld and that RBS should pay compensation of £312, being  
a 50% refund of the first six days accommodation  cost.
Ref: DRN10605802RBS responded  to say that it accepted the investigators view.  
Miss H responded  to say that she didnt  accept the investigators view but was prepared to 
settle her complaint on payment  of £559.99  being  £500 plus £59.99 for the cost of the 
purchased vacuum  cleaner.
The investigator asked  RBS whether it was prepared to pay the sum Miss H said she was 
looking for. But RBS said it wasnt prepared to pay more than the £312  already 
recommended by the investigator.
As Miss H was unhappy  with RBSs refusal  to pay her £559.99, and with the investigators 
conclusion that RBS should pay her £312, the complaint has been passed  to me for review  
and decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear Miss H has very strong feelings about this complaint. She has provided detailed 
submissions in support  of her view which I can confirm  Ive read and considered  in their 
entirety. However, I trust that Miss H will not take the fact that my findings focus on what  I 
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as 
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every  point  raised. The purpose 
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them.
It doesnt appear to be in dispute, but for the avoidance of doubt I can confirm that Im 
satisfied that there has been a breach of contract  here and that Miss H should be fairly 
compensated for this breach by RBS under section 75.
I accept that Miss H suffered distress and inconvenience in having  to liaise with the owner  
and/or its agents  over the cleanliness of the accommodation and in having to clean the same  
herself. But equally I note that Miss H (and those holidaying with her) still had the benefit  of 
the 14 nights  accommodation paid for. 
I dont dispute  Miss H had to seek medical  assistance for her allergic asthma and that she 
bought a vacuum cleaner.  
But Im not persuaded that Miss H has been  able to sufficiently  demonstrate  that she 
required medical assistance for her allergic  asthma as a direct result of the cleanliness of the 
accommodation. 
Nor am I persuaded  she needed to purchase a vacuum cleaner when it may well have been  
possible, amongst  other things, to borrow one from the owner or its agents  at no cost.  I also 
cant ignore the fact that although Miss H says she hasnt used the vacuum cleaner since 
her holiday,  nor does  she intend to, she still retains ownership of it.
I appreciate that Miss H will be disappointed.  But based on everything the parties have said 
and submitted I think a fair and reasonable outcome to this complaint is for RBS to rework 
her credit card as if she paid nothing  in July 2017 (rather  than £100) and £1,174 in 
April 2018 (rather than £1,386), a credit of £312.
Ref: DRN10605803my final decision
My final decision is that The Royal Bank  of Scotland Plc must rework Miss Hs credit card as 
if she had paid nothing  in July 2017  (rather than £100) and £1,174 in April 2018 (rather  than 
£1,386). Where  this recalculation results  in the refund of a credit balance,  The Royal Bank of 
Scotland Plc should also pay Miss H interest  on that amount at a rate of 8% simple per year, 
from the date that credit  balance arose  to the date of settlement
If The Royal  Bank of Scotland Plc considers  it necessary to deduct  tax from the interest  part 
of this award then it should provide Mrs H with a certificate of tax deduction so she might 
claim the amount  back from HMRC  if appropriate.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 February  2020.
