The complaint
Mr A says Evergreen Finance London Limited - trading as MoneyBoat - irresponsibly lent to 
him.
What happened
This complaint is about three instalment loans MoneyBoat provided to Mr A between      
June and December 2019. A summary of Mr As borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date 
TakenDate 
RepaidInstalments Amount Repayment
1 10/06/2019 23/08/2019 3 £200.00 £86.57
2 27/08/2019 20/12/2019 5 £400.00 £136.17
3 23/12/2019 outstanding 5 £850.00 £295.01
Mr As complaint was reviewed by one of our adjudicators and they didnt think it should be 
upheld. They thought there wasnt anything in the information MoneyBoat had asked Mr A to 
provide that should have prompted MoneyBoat to do more checks. So, the adjudicator 
couldnt say MoneyBoat was wrong to have given the loans to Mr A.  
Mr A disagreed. He said he was returning to borrow larger amounts each time and 
MoneyBoat was providing these without doing appropriate checks. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr A 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr As complaint. Having done this, Im not upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Mr A disagreed with the adjudicators view because he thought MoneyBoats checks didnt 
go far enough and it should have been aware that he was struggling financially. So, it 
shouldnt have lent to him.
MoneyBoat has told this service about the checks it carried out before approving any of the 
borrowing. It has said it asked Mr A about his employment status and he confirmed he was 
employed and had a monthly income of between £1,550 and £2,000. MoneyBoat also 
checked Mr As normal monthly living costs. Mr A declared these to be between £800 and 
£1,000 a month. MoneyBoat says it also searched Mr As credit file and it has provided the 
results of its search. There werent any recent adverse entries like defaults or county court 
judgements (CCJs) recorded on it at the time the loan was taken out. So there didnt look 
like there was anything that ought to have caused MoneyBoat any concern. 
Mr A has provided a copy of his credit report. It should be noted that Mr As credit report will 
have more detail than the one MoneyBoat is likely to have. Ive reviewed Mr As report 
carefully and whilst I can see that he had some outstanding unsecured loans these were 
taken out a couple of years prior to him borrowing the loans from MoneyBoat. 
Mr A borrowed all three loans within six months. So, he was very early on in his lending 
relationship with MoneyBoat. Even though he had to make monthly repayments, the highest 
repayment would have appeared affordable based on the information he declared to 
MoneyBoat. And there wasnt anything in the information Mr A provided at the time which 
would have given MoneyBoat cause for concern, so I think it was reasonable of MoneyBoat 
to have relied on what Mr A gave it. 
I think these factors had an impact of what level of checks would have been appropriate for 
MoneyBoat to carry out. Given these, I think the checks MoneyBoat did before lending the 
loans went far enough and I wouldnt have expected it at this stage to undertake any more 
in-depth checks. 
The information Mr A declared to MoneyBoat at the time of the loans may not have been an 
accurate reflection of his financial circumstances, but I think MoneyBoat was entitled to rely 
on that information. At this stage of the lending relationship, and what MoneyBoat knew 
about Mr A, I wouldnt have expected MoneyBoat to verify the information Mr A gave it. 
However, looking at loan 3 in isolation, it could be argued that a pattern was beginning to 
emerge which might suggest Mr A was struggling to repay his loans sustainably. Mr A 
returned to borrow again only a few days after he repaid the previous loan. And he was 
asking to borrow larger amounts each time. For loan 3, he returned again about three days 
after hed repaid loan 2 and he was asking to borrow over double the amount. So, based on this behaviour I think MoneyBoat should have been looking to build a clearer 
picture than it did about Mr As finances before lending him this loan. Asking to see things 
such as his bank statements, or for copies of his payslips and/or bills. 
But, in saying this, Mr A hasnt provided this service with any information about his financial 
position at the time, such as bank statements. And as Ive mentioned above, Mr As credit 
file doesnt show anything that ought to have caused MoneyBoat any concerns. So, without 
any further information, I can only conclude that while MoneyBoats checks didnt go far 
enough, I cant say an error has been made as I dont know whether it would have thought 
the loan was affordable for Mr A. Therefore, I cant say MoneyBoat was wrong to have 
provided Mr A with loan 3. 
I appreciate that my findings are likely to disappoint Mr A, but I hope my explanation will help 
him understand why Ive reached this conclusion.
My final decision
I do not uphold Mr As complaint and make no award against Evergreen Finance London 
Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 December 2020.
