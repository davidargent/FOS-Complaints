The complaint
 Mr M complains about how PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA dealt with a dispute after he 
sold an item in an online market forum.
What happened
 On 22 June 2020 Mr M sold a set of golf clubs to a buyer (B) via an online market forum, 
which Ill refer to here as G. Mr M sold the golf clubs for £260 and paid £28 postage and 
packaging costs in sending them to B. Mr M said he only received payment of £252.16 as he 
was charged a transaction fee of £7.84 because B made their payment via PayPal. 
On 1 July 2020 B contacted PayPal in order to raise a dispute. B informed PayPal that the 
golf clubs theyd received were not as had been described in the advert Mr M had placed. 
So, PayPal initiated an investigation.
PayPal invited Mr M to provide evidence relating to the disputed transaction. Mr M said he 
sent PayPal the advert from G and disputed that B had raised a valid claim. He said hed 
sent B the advertised golf clubs. And he said hed received many emails from B suggesting 
theyd requested a return because theyd changed their mind after committing to purchase 
the golf clubs. Mr M said, under PayPals user agreement, B had no valid reason to request 
a refund.
PayPal assessed the information Mr M and B had provided but it said it didnt receive a copy 
of the advert showing the golf clubs that had been advertised for sale. And, on 21 July 2020, 
PayPal advised Mr M that it had found in Bs favour and informed them theyd be eligible for 
a full refund provided they returned the golf clubs.
B returned the golf clubs to Mr M. But Mr M said, when the golf clubs were returned, they 
showed significant signs of usage and damage. Mr M informed PayPal of this and said the 
value of the returned golf clubs had diminished, which would impact on him financially when 
he came to resell them. He also continued to dispute that B was entitled to a refund. But 
PayPal told Mr M hed have to refund B the money theyd paid in full.
Mr M was unhappy with how PayPal had decided this dispute and complained. He said 
PayPal had made an error in deciding the claim in Bs favour as the golf clubs hed sold had 
been as described in the advert. He said PayPal hadnt provided a proper explanation of 
how it had reached its decision and it was unfair that hed been instructed to return the 
money B had paid in those circumstances. Mr M also reiterated his concerns regarding the 
condition in which the golf clubs had been returned to him. And he raised concerns that, in 
refunding £260 to B, he was paying the £7.84 transaction fee twice. 
On 26 August 2020 PayPal issued its final response to Mr Ms complaint. It explained that it 
hadnt made an error as it had followed its process relating to disputed transactions correctly 
and fairly. But it invited Mr M to appeal its decision with supporting evidence confirming the 
golf clubs had been returned in a worse condition that they were in prior to being sold and 
showing how their value had diminished as a result. 
Mr M was unhappy with PayPals response to his complaint. So, he referred it to our service. 
After this complaint was brought, PayPal agreed to refund the postage costs and seller fees 
Mr M had incurred. But it maintained that it had dealt with the disputed transaction claim 
fairly. Our investigator agreed and informed Mr M they werent intending to ask PayPal to 
take any further action. But Mr M rejected our investigators view of their complaint and 
asked for it to be considered by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Im sorry to hear about the difficulties Mr M experienced here. I can see hes experienced a 
significant degree of upset and frustration in trying to raise his concerns about this disputed 
transaction.
I recognise Mr M feels very strongly about the issues raised in this complaint and I can see 
hes gone to some trouble to provide our service with some detailed submissions. I want to 
assure him that Ive read everything hes sent us. I hope he will understand if I dont address 
every comment hes made in this decision. I intend to concentrate on what I consider to be 
key to this complaint; namely whether PayPal acted fairly and reasonably here.
Here, B raised a disputed transaction claim with PayPal on the basis that the golf clubs they 
received from Mr M were significantly not as described. And PayPal decided the claim in Bs 
favour. So, the issue here is whether PayPal acted unfairly in reaching that decision.
Ive seen evidence that satisfies me that PayPal informed Mr M in writing on 1 July 2020 that 
B had raised a claim on the basis that the golf clubs were not as described. The guidance 
PayPal sent Mr M on that date said please help us to resolve this issue by logging into your 
Resolution Centre and providing us with any information that can assist us with our 
investigation. Your participation is essential to the claims process.
Mr M told our service he provided PayPal with a copy of the advert he placed with G. He 
said this was uploaded to PayPals website. But PayPal disputes this. Ive seen a copy of the 
advert in question. But this was provided to our service after Mr M had referred his complaint 
to us. And, by this time, PayPal had already determined the disputed transaction claim 
against Mr M.
In considering whether PayPal was provided with a copy of Mr Ms advert before it 
determined the outcome of this disputed transaction Ive carefully reviewed the records 
PayPal provided our service. These records show the information that was provided during 
its initial investigation of this dispute from 1 July until 31 August 2020. 
Based on those records, I can see evidence of written communication between Mr M, B and 
PayPal. Theres no record showing that Mr M provided PayPal with a copy of the advert he 
placed with G. And Mr M hasnt provided our service with evidence confirming it was 
provided at the relevant time via PayPals Resolution Centre or communication thread. Im 
sorry to disappoint Mr M but I havent seen enough to persuade me that he provided PayPal 
with a copy of the advert in question before it determined the transaction dispute.
As Im not persuaded PayPal received a copy of the advert Mr M placed with G I cant safely 
conclude it made an error in upholding Bs claim that the golf clubs received werent as 
described. It could only assess the claim based on the evidence it had available. And I think, 
on balance, that if it had received a copy of Mr Ms advert it would have reviewed that 
evidence before determining the outcome of the claim B had made. It follows that I cant fairly find that PayPal made an error in telling B they were eligible for a refund on returning 
the golf clubs.
Mr M told PayPal and our service that his golf clubs were returned to him in a worse 
condition that they were in prior to being sold, which caused their value to diminish. So, Ive 
considered how PayPal dealt with that issue.
I can see that PayPals final response to Mr Ms complaint acknowledged what hed said 
about the condition of the returned golf clubs. It explained he was entitled to appeal its 
transaction dispute decision and urged him to do so. PayPal also provided Mr M with advice 
as to how he could lodge an appeal and the strict timescales involved. I dont think PayPal 
could have done anything more to assist Mr M with the appeal process.
Thereafter, I understand that PayPal rejected Mr Ms appeal. This was confirmed on 20 
September 2020 and PayPal stated this outcome was reached because Mr M hadnt proven 
that the condition of his returned golf clubs was such that their value had diminished. As Mr 
M didnt provide the evidence that was required by PayPal in order to uphold an appeal I 
cant fairly say it made an error here.
I can see Mr M raised concerns about how long PayPal took to determine the outcome of the 
dispute B raised. But I can see it made a decision in Bs favour on 21 July 2020. This was 20 
days after the dispute was reported to PayPal. Ive seen evidence of some unpleasant and 
hostile messages that B sent Mr M during that period, which I appreciate would have caused 
concern and upset. But I dont think an investigation of just under three weeks is excessive 
or protracted. 
Mr M has raised concerns about whether the amount of money hes had to refund B is 
correct. PayPals user agreement states it will subject transactions to a 2.9% charge in 
addition to a fixed fee. Here the fixed fee was £0.30, and the charge was £7.54. This 
explains why Mr M received a payment of £252.16 when he sold his golf clubs to B. As the 
deduction PayPal made was in line with its user agreement, I cant say it made an error in 
deducting a seller fee of £7.84 from the payment Mr M received. 
When PayPal instructed Mr M to refund B it told him hed need to return £260. Mr M said this 
would lead to him incurring a duplicate transaction fee of £7.84. But, in order to put B back in 
the position they started from, Mr M would have had to refund the full amount they paid. So, 
Im not persuaded that PayPal made an error in asking Mr M to refund B £260. 
Putting things right
 I can see that, in order to resolve this complaint, PayPal has offered to credit Mr Ms 
account with the seller fees he incurred and £28 to cover his postage costs. This presents a 
change in the outcome of this complaint as, when Mr M referred his concerns to us, this 
resolution wasnt offered by PayPal in its final response correspondence. 
Like our investigator, I think the offer that PayPal has now made is fair and reasonable. 
PayPal should therefore credit Mr Ms account with the seller fees and postage costs he 
incurred. Im not going to direct it to do anything further.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should 
credit Mr Ms account with the seller fees he incurred and £28 to cover his postage costs.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or reject my decision before 21 April 2021.
