The complaint
Mr Q complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) has not properly compensated 
him for a mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) policy.
What happened
Mr Q complained to RBS about PPI that was attached to his credit card. 
RBS responded to his complaint and offered Mr Q £0.10p compensation. Mr Q remained 
unhappy with RBS response to his complaint so he asked this service to step in.
Following our involvement RBS increased its offer to £0.18p. 
RBS said it had only charged Mr Q for PPI in one month - £14.13 in December 2003. And it 
said it refunded Mr Q £14.03 in January 2004. So it had originally offered to refund the 
additional £0.10p it had not refunded in 2004. Later it added interest to make the total offer 
£0.18p.
Our adjudicator thought RBS offer was fair. Mr Q disagreed with the adjudicators 
assessment and has asked for an ombudsman to review his complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where there is limited information, I will make my decision based on whats more likely to 
have happened, taking into account  the evidence available and what  both parties have told 
me.
Having done so I am not upholding this complaint and Ill explain why.
Mr Q has told us he used the card for many years and believes he was charged PPI in more 
than one month.
Mr Q applied for the credit card in 1998. RBS has been able to show us a copy of the 
original application form. Ive looked at this and I can see that Mr Q did not tick the box that 
would have added PPI to his account. So I think it unlikely that PPI would have been added 
to Mr Qs account when it was opened.
Unfortunately RBS does not hold detailed statement data from 1998 to 2001. This isnt 
surprising or unusual. Banks are not required to keep records indefinitely. 
Ive looked at the statements provided by RBS from 2001 onwards. And I can see that from  
2001 there are no charges for PPI except for £14.13 on the statement for December 2003. 
And I can see an insurance refund for £14.03 in January 2004.
I can see Mr Q didnt apply for PPI in 1998 and it wasnt being charged in 2001. So on 
balance I think it is unlikely he was charged for PPI in the intervening years.
And from 2001 onward Ive only seen evidence of one PPI premium in December 2003 
which was refunded (less £0.10p) in January 2004. 
RBS has said it doesnt know why or how PPI was added to the account briefly in December 
2003. However , from experience I am aware that RBS occasionally contacted account 
holders by telephone and PPI was sold in this way. So I think thats most likely what 
happened here. 
I do accept it is possible PPI could have been added between 1998 and then removed again 
before the statement data began in 2001. But Ive not seen any evidence that this happened. 
And based on the fact that PPI was declined at the outset in 1998 and wasnt on the account 
in 2001 I think its more likely that PPI wasnt charged during this period.
Some statements are missing from after 2001. RBS has explained this is because there was 
a zero balance and no activity during those months. Looking at the statements from either 
side of those gaps I think that is the most likely explanation.
In summary, after considering all the evidence I think Mr Q was only charged only once for 
PPI in December 2003 and the premium was refunded in January 2004 (less £0.10p).
RBS has now offered to refund the £0.10p plus interest and I think that is a fair way to 
resolve this complaint. So I wont direct RBS to do anything more.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Q to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 September 2020.
