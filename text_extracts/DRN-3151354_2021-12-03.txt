The complaint
Mr Y complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and closed his accounts. He 
wasnt provided a reason for the accounts closing. He would like compensation. 
What happened
Mr Y had a current account and an ISA account with NatWest.
Mr Y applied to open a savings account with NatWest. Following this application NatWest 
decided to block and close Mr Ys accounts.
NatWest wrote a letter to Mr Y on 5 March 2020. NatWest gave Mr Y 14 days notice to 
close his accounts. The accounts remained blocked. NatWest relied on their terms and 
conditions to stop offering banking facilities.
Mr Y complained to NatWest he was unhappy his account had been blocked and closed and 
he hadnt been given a reason. NatWest didnt uphold his complaint.
Unhappy Mr Y complained to our service. One of our investigators looked into his case. He 
said that NatWest hadnt acted fairly when they blocked and closed Mr Ys account giving 
him 14 days notice. The bank had relied on the terms for immediate closure and he didnt 
see that these terms had been met. He thought NatWest should have given Mr Y 60 days 
notice. He thought that Mr Y had other accounts and the closure hadnt impacted him as 
much. So, he thought Mr Y should get compensation of £150.00.
Mr Y disagreed with the view. He said that he didnt have other accounts and he thought that 
£150.00 compensation was not enough.
As there was no agreement the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill start by setting out some context for the review of Mr Ys account. UK legislation places 
extensive obligations on regulated financial businesses. Financial institutions must establish 
the purpose and intended nature of transactions as well as the origin of funds, and there 
may be penalties if they dont. This applies to both new and existing relationships. These 
obligations override all other obligations. NatWest have said this is what they were doing 
when they reviewed and blocked Mr Ys accounts.
NatWest proceeded to close the accounts. A bank is entitled to close an account with a 
customer just as a customer may close an account with a bank. But before a bank closes an 
account, it must do so in a way, which complies with the terms and conditions of the 
account.
I can see that NatWest let Mr Y M know of their decision to close the accounts- they sent 
him a letter dated 5 March 2020. 
Ive considered whether NatWest acted fairly in closing Mr Ys accounts. Ive looked at the 
terms and conditions of the accounts. The terms and conditions outline that the bank can 
close a customers account with two months notice, and in certain circumstances they can 
close an account immediately. In this case NatWest closed Mr Ys accounts giving 14 days 
notice and blocked the account with immediate effect. For NatWest to act fairly here they 
needed to meet the criteria to apply their terms for immediate closure  and having looked at 
these terms and all the evidence Im not satisfied that the bank has applied the terms fairly. 
I have therefore gone on to consider the impact that having the account closed without 
notice had on Mr Y. NatWest should have given Mr Y 60 days notice to close the account, 
this would have given Mr Y time to find a new account. Our investigator offered £150.00 
which Mr Y didnt think was enough. Mr Y has said that he didnt have another account and 
he had difficulty opening a new account because of the closure.
I appreciate Mr Y was inconvenienced by the closure of his account. He has told us he didnt 
have another account. But the impact is in relation to the shorter time Mr Y had in which to 
find another account. He would have had to find a new account in any event as NatWest had 
decided to withdraw banking facilities from him which they are entitled to do. Mr Y hasnt 
provided any further evidence of impact and in view of this I think the amount of £150.00 is 
fair.
Mr Y has said he wants to know the reasons why NatWest closed his accounts. Whilst Mr Y 
mayve expected to be given the reasons for the account closure. NatWest isnt required to 
give him a specific reason. And I can understand Mr Ys frustration that he hasnt been 
provided a detailed explanation. But NatWest is under no obligation to provide this 
information to him, as much as hed like to know. So, I cant say NatWest have done 
anything wrong by not giving Mr Y this information. 
Putting things right
National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr Y £150.00 compensation.
My final decision
For the reasons mentioned above I uphold this complaint. I require National Westminster 
Bank Plc to pay Mr Y £150.00 in compensation for his material distress.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 December 2021.
