The complaint
Mr C complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA refused his request for a refund, after 
he raised a claim under its Buyer Protection policy.
What happened
Mr C had a free trial period with a digital magazine website. When the trial came to an end, 
the seller of the subscription took around $239 (USD) from Mr Cs PayPal account.
After the seller refused his request for a full refund, Mr C raised a dispute under PayPals 
Buyer Protection Policy. But PayPal refused his claim.
Mr C complained to PayPal, but it maintained its position. PayPal said it had reviewed and 
investigated the dispute and had closed it in the sellers favour. The seller was able to 
provide proof that the service had been provided to Mr C. The seller had also provided their 
websites terms and conditions. PayPal said Mr C had signed up to a billing agreement with 
the seller which meant the fees would be automatically debited from his PayPal account.
Mr C remained unhappy and asked our service to consider his complaint. Our investigator 
looked into Mr Cs concerns but didnt think his complaint should be upheld. He thought it 
was fair for PayPal to have declined Mr Cs claim.
Mr C disagreed with our investigators view. He said that when hed signed up for the 
subscription it didnt say anything about being charged so he assumed it was free. He was 
also concerned that PayPal had given multiple reasons for its decision and these werent 
clear. So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Cs complaint. Ill explain why.
PayPals user agreement says that buyers may be eligible for a refund under its Buyer 
Protection policy, in certain circumstances, if the purchase is not received or is considered 
Significantly Not as Described.
I can see that Mr C contacted the seller on 10 January 2022 and asked for a refund. He said 
this was because he no longer used the service. In response the seller told him that active 
trial periods or subscriptions needed to be cancelled before running out or they would be 
automatically renewed according to their terms of service. They said Mr Cs subscription was 
renewed on 8 January and he cancelled it on 9 January. They offered to refund Mr C part of 
what hed paid as a gesture of goodwill, but Mr C rejected their offer. 
Mr C raised a significantly not as described dispute, a couple of days after the payment 
was made to the seller. This was investigated by PayPal who contacted the seller.
The seller confirmed what it had told Mr C to PayPal. They provided an invoice with Mr Cs 
details for $0 USD with the product description Trial period for PayPal adFREE New  
Period: 09-12-2021  08-01-2021. They also gave PayPal an invoice addressed to Mr C 
dated 8 January 2022 for $239.40 for the period 08-01-2022  03-01-2022.
The seller told PayPal that the features included in Mr Cs subscription would be usable for 
the full remainder of the current service period which expired on 3 January 2023 regardless 
of the cancellation.
The information Mr C has sent us supports what the seller told PayPal. Mr C has provided 
screenshots to show what he saw when he applied for the free trial online. At the top of the 
screenshot it refers to an ad free plan and says: Try it now 30 days for free. There was the 
option to choose between a 30 day and a 360 day billing cycle, with a 20% discount on the 
latter. Mr C has indicated that he chose the 360 day cycle. 
Mr C was required to enter his contact and payment details, which included the option of 
PayPal. At the bottom of the screen it says: By completing my purchase I agree to the 
Terms of Service. *$19.95 / month billed in a single payment of $239.4. The terms of 
service make it clear that if the agreement isnt terminated within the trial period, the first 
direct debit is taken at the end of the trial period. So, Im satisfied that Mr C authorised for 
the payment to be taken after the 30 day free trial was up. 
When Mr C raised his dispute with PayPal, he said the service was not as expected and half 
the items werent available. But I havent seen any evidence to support this and he doesnt 
appear to have raised this as an issue when he asked the seller for a refund. So, I think it 
was reasonable for PayPal to have declined Mr Cs Buyer Protection claim.
I appreciate Mr C is unhappy that the seller didnt remind him that his free trial was about to 
expire. However, this isnt something that is covered under the terms of PayPals Buyer 
Protection policy.
I know my answer will be disappointing for Mr C. But Im satisfied that PayPal has acted 
fairly and in line with its user agreement. So, I dont require it to do anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2022.
