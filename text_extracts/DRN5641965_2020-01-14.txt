K821x#15complaint
Miss S says PDL Finance  Limited   trading as Mr Lender - irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about seven short-term high-cost loans Mr Lender  provided to Miss S 
between September  2013  and March 2015.  Miss Ss borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Repayment Rollovers
1 18/09/2013 29/10/2013 1 £200.00 £270.00 1
2 04/11/2013 13/11/2013 1 £150.00 £195.00 0
3 24/11/2013 27/01/2014 1 £80.00 £86.00 2
4 05/02/2014 10/07/2014 1 £300.00 £390.00 4
5 17/10/2014 19/12/2014 3 £250.00 £145.83 0
6 31/12/2014 27/02/2015 2 £300.00 £224.40 0
7 24/03/2015 11/09/2018 2 £200.00 £160.80 0
Mr Lender has agreed to uphold Miss Ss complaint about loan 4 and has offered to refund 
all the interest and charges shed paid on this loan. Mr Lender has also agreed to partially  
uphold loan 7. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Ss complaint  and thought the loans  from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the overall  pattern  of the borrowing  suggested  that 
Miss S was becoming reliant  on short-term  loans. Mr Lender disagreed and the complaint 
was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure     
Miss S could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner. These  checks  could consider several 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN56419652the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Miss S could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Ss complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Miss Ss complaint about loans 1 to 3. Miss S didnt respond  to 
the adjudicators  opinion.  As there is no dispute  with the adjudicators  findings about  these 
loans, I wont be making  any further findings on them other than they formed part of Miss Ss 
overall borrowing. 
Mr Lender has offered to refund all the interest  and charges  Miss S paid on loan 4 so I wont 
consider this loan any further. Ive noted that Mr Lender has also offered to partially refund 
loan 7. But I dont  think its gone  far enough  in what it has offered. I also think  Mr Lender  
shouldnt have lent to Miss S on loans 5 and 6 either.  Ill explain why. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders  lending history with Miss S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender  should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Mr Lender should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ss case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 5. I say this because:
At this point Mr Lender  ought  to have realised  Miss S was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss S had taken out five loans within 13 months and she had 
struggled to repay loan 4 on time. So Mr Lender  ought to have realised it was more  
likely than not Miss S was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  her 
previous loan was leaving  in her finances  and that Miss Ss indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN56419653Miss Ss first loan was for £200  and loan 5 was for £250.  At  this point Mr Lender 
ought to have known that Miss S was not likely  borrowing  to meet  a temporary  
shortfall in their income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
Miss S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Mr Lender.  Loan 7 
was taken out 18 months after Miss Ss first. Miss S had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Mr Lender over an extended period.
I think that Miss S lost out because  Mr Lender  continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ss indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss S borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ss ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5, 6 and 7 and Mr Lender  should put things  
right.
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss S paid on loans 5, 6 and 7. And if it hasnt done 
so already also on loan 4;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 4 from Miss Ss credit  file if it hasnt 
already done so;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5, 6 and 7 should  be removed from 
Miss Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest.  Mr Lender must  give 
Miss S a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ss complaint.  PDL Finance 
Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 14 February  2020.
