K821x#15Complaint
Mr M says Elevate Credit  International (trading as Sunny) didnt carry out sufficient 
affordability checks before approving his loans.  
Background
Mr M was given  one running credit  facility and 21 loans by Sunny. A summary  of the 
borrowing, based on the information provided to us by Sunny can be found  in the appendix  
at the end of the decision. 
Mr M appears to have had some  problems repaying  his final four loans, and at the time the 
complaint was brought to our service he was making  payments via a repayment  plan. 
The running credit account  (RCF) is different to the instalment loans that Mr M took. The 
RCF allows a consumer could either request  funds  up to their agreed  credit limit in one go or 
take multiple drawdowns up to their limit. Each  withdrawal was required to be repaid in five 
monthly instalments.  
Sunny initially said that it hadnt made  an error by providing Mr M with his loans, unhappy 
with this response, he brought his complaint to us. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mr Ms complaint and she thought  Sunny shouldnt  have 
provided the fifth instalment loan (loan 6 in the table below) because  the repayment  to this 
loan, plus the ones he had outstanding at the time took up a significant  portion of his 
declared income. And from loan 6 (loan  7 in the table in the appendix), the adjudicator 
thought a pattern of lending had developed  which shouldve indicated to Sunny that any 
further borrowing  was unsustainable. 
Mr M appears to have agreed with the adjudicators  recommendation.
Sunny disagreed with our adjudicators opinion. Sunny  says it completed enough checks  to 
show it that Mr M could afford  the loans. However,  it accepted  that something may have 
gone wrong when it provided loans 15  22, so it agreed to refund these with 8% simple  
interest. It also agreed to write off the outstanding principal on loan 22.  Mr M appears to 
have rejected this offer.  
Sometime later Sunny reviewed the case again,  this time it agreed to uphold loan 6  21 
(based on the numbering  in the loan table  in the appendix).  It would add 8% simple  interest 
to this sum as well as updating Mr Ms credit file. It also said it would use the refund to offset 
the outstanding balance  due for loan 22. We didnt hear from Mr M so as no agreement  was 
reached, the case has now been passed  to me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to reasonably 
conclude whether Mr M could repay the loans  in a sustainable manner.
Ref: DRN98053952These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. Certain factors  might  
point to the fact that Sunny should  fairly and reasonably have done more  to establish that 
any lending  was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  include, but are not limited  to:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Mr M didnt  disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans  1 to 5. Because of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So, I wont be making a finding 
about them  in this decision. But as they were part of the borrowing  relationship  Mr M had 
with Sunny, I will take them into account  when  considering the other  loans, he took.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan six would most likely have 
shown that:
the loan repayment required represented  a significant proportion  of Mr Ms monthly  
income. In these circumstances, there was a significant risk that Mr M wouldnt have  
been able to repay this loan without undue difficulty or borrowing  further.
I dont think that Sunny could reasonably have believed that Mr M would be able to 
make the repayments over the term of the loan when taking into account that he had 
a number of loans running concurrently. This presented a significant risk that Mr M 
wouldnt be able to repay this loan, or any later loans without undue difficulty. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.   
I do think Sunny shouldve realised this at the time it provided loan seven. I say this 
because:
Ref: DRN98053953At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr M was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr M had taken  out six instalment loans  and one RCF loan within  20 
months and Mr M had been indebted to Sunny for 16 of these months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr M was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that 
Mr Ms indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr M was provided with a new loan normally within  a few days 
of settling a previous  one. 
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  22 was 
taken out around 30 months after Mr Ms first drawdown on the RCF. And loan 22 
was for twice the amount. Mr M had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect,  
service a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
I think that Mr M lost out when Sunny provided loans 6 - 22 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time and;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ms
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost
loans
So Im upholding  Mr Ms complaint about loans 6  22 and Sunny should put things right as 
detailed below.
putting things right  what I currently  think Sunny  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  6 and 18;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
for loans  19 - 22, Sunny  should  remove all unpaid  interest,  fees and charges from the 
current outstanding  balance, meaning  Mr M only has to repay the principal  sum for 
each loan. 
Sunny must then apply any repayments already made towards  these loans as if they 
were made towards the principal sum. If after doing  this, Mr M has already paid 
enough for these  loans  to be fully repaid, then any overpayment needs to be 
refunded, from the date the over payment became due to the date of settlement. 8% 
simple interest per year should also be added to any overpayment*
If after doing this, an outstanding balance  remains  then Sunny can use the refund  
from loans 6  18 to offset this outstanding principal  sum
remove any negative information  about loan 6 from Mr Ms credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 - 22 should be removed from 
Mr Ms credit file.
Ref: DRN98053954*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ms complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2020.
