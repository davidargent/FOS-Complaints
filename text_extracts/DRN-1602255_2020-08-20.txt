The complaint
Mrs L complains that National Westminster Bank Plc has treated her unfairly as it wont write 
off her loan.
What happened
Mrs L took out an £18,000 loan with NatWest over a 120-month term in August 2016. Her 
repayments were £250.04 per month, and the reported reason for the loan was home 
improvements.
In summer 2017, Mrs L contacted NatWest about setting up a £50 per month repayment 
plan. She explained her finances were affected as her husbands business had liquidated. 
NatWest explained that such an arrangement would likely cause the loan to default due to 
the arrears that would be incurred. And, after reviewing her income and expenditure, it didnt 
think the plan would be affordable. Mrs L accrued arrears during this period as she didnt 
make all her expected repayments. But after she found new employment, an affordability 
plan was agreed. Mrs L would repay £250 per month for six months  with a view to 
consolidate the outstanding borrowing at the end if the plan was successful. 
Mrs L made all her expected payments under the plan, so in April 2018 she had a call with 
NatWest about consolidating the outstanding borrowing. It ran through the details with her, 
explaining that nothing would be set up until she signed and returned the paperwork it was 
sending out to set up the new loan. Mrs L complained that she didnt receive this. NatWest 
issued final responses in July and August 2018. It didnt uphold the complaints, and these 
werent referred to us. 
After that, the paperwork wasnt completed, and no payments were made towards the 
existing loan. NatWest sent a default notice and formal demand before defaulting the 
account in January 2019. Later that year, Mrs L told NatWest that her husband had sadly 
passed away and queried whether there was anything left to pay. After being told there was, 
she said she didnt have enough funds from the estate to pay it off  and that our service and 
NatWest had previously told her it should be written off. NatWest didnt agree, so she 
referred the matter to us.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He considered the crux to be about how Mrs L 
had been treated by NatWest in light of her financial difficulties and the death of her 
husband. He didnt find anything to substantiate that NatWest had agreed to waive the debt. 
And he was satisfied it had tried to engage with her and given fair warning before defaulting 
the account. He said that, if Mrs L thought the loan had been mis-sold in the first place, she 
could raise that as a separate complaint with NatWest  as he had only considered how it 
had treated her in light of her changed circumstances.
Mrs L didnt accept this. She disputed that NatWest had been in touch with her. And she said 
it had stopped her standing order. Our investigator explained that the payments had stopped 
because her plan ended and she hadnt finished setting up the consolidation loan. Mrs L has 
recently paid off the outstanding borrowing. There was a problem with the settlement, but 
that has been dealt with separately. As requested, Im now making the final decision on this 
case - about how NatWest treated Mrs L in light of her circumstances and her request for it 
to write off the loan.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I'm very sorry to hear about the difficult circumstances Mrs L has faced, and Id like to pass 
on my sympathies for the sad loss of her husband. I'd like to reassure Mrs L that I've taken 
these sensitive circumstances into account when considering whether NatWest has acted 
fairly and reasonably.
I also want to clarify that Im not commenting on how the loan was sold or settled. Mrs L can 
raise these complaints separately with NatWest if she hasnt already, and we may be able to 
investigate them afterwards if shes unhappy with its responses. Im also not commenting on 
the complaint about whether the consolidation loan documents were initially sent  as that 
wasnt referred to us. In the context of this case, what Ive considered is whether NatWest 
treated Mrs L fairly in light of her changes in circumstances. Having reviewed everything, Im 
satisfied it did  so Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why. 
When a lender knows its customer is in financial difficulty  as NatWest did following Mrs Ls 
contact in 2017  it has a duty to treat them with forbearance and due consideration. Ive 
thought about whether NatWest did that in Mrs Ls case. When she first contacted it about 
her financial difficulties, it wouldnt agree to the plan she wanted. But, as it explained at the 
time, that was because the plan wasnt affordable and would cause the arrears to continue 
accruing further. It directed her to seek advice from a debt charity she was speaking and, 
after completing a plan to make sure it was affordable, agreed to consolidate the debt. Im 
satisfied this was a fair and reasonable response in the circumstances. I say this because 
NatWest considered the impact on Mrs L. Allowing a consolidation loan would prevent 
further arrears from accruing and being reported on Mrs Ls credit file (so long as she set up 
and made her expected payments on the new loan).
However, the consolidation loan was never set up. NatWest says this was because Mrs L 
didnt return the paperwork. She says she never received it. She complained a few months 
after the call, and NatWest said the paperwork had been sent via email as agreed during the 
call, and shed also been sent text messages and a letter of formal demand. This complaint 
wasnt referred on to us, so I wont address it within this decision. But I do think its relevant 
that NatWests final responses from summer 2018 reinforced that Mrs L needed to contact 
the relevant team to repay the loan. 
Mrs L says that NatWest cancelled her payments. But, as our investigator explained, it 
seems this was because her affordability plan finished. And she was told during the call that 
shed need to complete the paperwork to set up the new consolidation loan  so that 
payments could be taken for this. In any event, Mrs L had a duty to ensure she made the 
expected payments. Despite NatWests subsequent attempts to chase up the missing 
payments, none were made after the arrangement ended  including after it responded to 
her complaint. When she next got in touch, around eighteen months had passed since shed 
made any payments. I cant hold NatWest at fault for this.For NatWest to make any further arrangements to help Mrs L, it would need to make sure 
they were appropriate for her and that it had her agreement. I can see it offered support and 
gave her time to contact its team and/or make payment. As she didnt do so, it defaulted the 
account. This prevented further interest and charges from accruing. Im satisfied this was 
done fairly and that NatWest made reasonable attempts to resolve the relationship first.
Mrs L says NatWest told her it would write off her loan. Having listened to the calls and 
reviewed the contact notes, I havent found anything to substantiate this. Mrs L says, 
regardless, it should write off the debt due to her circumstances. I appreciate that shes been 
through difficult circumstances, which Id expect NatWest to show due consideration for. But 
Im not persuaded it would be reasonable to direct it to write off the borrowing. When Mrs L 
told NatWest about her husbands passing, the account had already defaulted  meaning no 
further costs were accruing. The loan was only in her name. And, crucially, shed been able 
to use the money it lent her  even if, as shes told us, she didnt use it for the planned 
improvements and instead put it towards general living costs/their business. So, I consider it 
reasonable that NatWest expected her to pay this back (as I understand she now has). 
I appreciate this will be disappointing for Mrs L, but I hope Ive been able to explain clearly 
why Im not directing NatWest to write off the debt. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 September 2020.
