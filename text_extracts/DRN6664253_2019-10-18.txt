Mr G says he shouldnt have been given loans by CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading as 
QuickQuid because he says these loans were unaffordable for him.
 
background
Mr G took 1 payday loan and one flex credit facility  from QuickQuid between January and 
September 2013. It looks as though Mr G has had some  problems  repaying  his final loan 
and an outstanding balance remains, which QuickQuid has confirmed has been sold to a 
third party. 
A summary  of Mr Gs borrowing,  based  on the information given to us by QuickQuid can be 
found below;
loan number loan amount received date actual repayment date
1 £200.00 22/01/2013 31/01/2013
£200.00 13/09/20132*£200.00 03/10/2013outstanding 
*this was a flex credit facility which operates differently to a payday loan. 
When it investigated Mr Gs complaint QuickQuid offered to:
 
waive £79.85  worth of fees and charges from the current  outstanding balance of 
£216.85
offer to set up an affordable repayment plan for the remaining balance (£140) and
remove any negative information  about loan 2 from Mr Gs credit file. 
Mr G was dissatisfied and QuickQuids offer and referred his complaint to us.  Mr Gs 
complaint was then reviewed by one of adjudicators who thought that QuickQuids offer to 
resolve matters was fair and reasonable and so QuickQuid hadnt treated Mr G unfairly.  
QuickQuid appears to have accepted the adjudicators findings.  But, Mr G wasnt  happy  with 
this offer.  
No agreement could  be reached,  so the case  has been passed to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Having carefully thought  about everything  provided, I think that what  Quick Quid has already 
offered to do is fair and reasonable and so Im not asking it to do any more. Id like to explain 
why this this is the case in a bit more detail.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out reasonable checks  to understand whether 
Ref: DRN66642532Mr G could repay his loans in a sustainable manner. These checks  could take into account  a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less thorough  in terms of 
how much  information  it gathers and what it does to verify that information  in the early  
stages of a lending relationship. 
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, the consumers income  was low or 
the amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the 
risk of it becoming unsustainable  and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed 
expect a lender  to be able to show that it hasnt continued to provide these loans to a 
customer irresponsibly. 
Given the gap in lending of almost  eight months between  loan 1 and the flex credit account, I  
consider it reasonable that QuickQuid  could treat Mr Gs second loan as a new chain of 
lending, and so QuickQuid could treat Mr Gs application afresh. 
QuickQuid says it agreed to Mr Gs application  after he provided  details  of his monthly 
income which he declared to be £1,600. QuickQuid also appear to have carried  out some 
sort of credit  check before both the payday  loan was approved.  And, based on what he 
declared, this information suggested that Mr G would be able to make the repayment he was 
committing to. And in these circumstances  it wasnt irresponsible to provide the payday loan. 
I accept that Mr Gs actual circumstances may not have been reflected either in the 
information he provided, or the other information QuickQuid obtained. And Mr Gs actual 
financial position might  well have  been apparent if further information   such  as bank 
statements or detailed  credit checks  had been obtained. 
But QuickQuid could  only make its decision based  on the information it had available at the 
time. And as it was still in the early stages of a lending relationship (bearing in mind the 
break between loan 1 and the flex credit  facility) and taking into account how long each loan 
was due to run, with Mr G. I dont think it had reached the stage where there was a greater 
risk of the loan or the flex credit facility being unsustainable for Mr G. In these  
circumstances, I dont  think  QuickQuid  needed to take further steps to verify the information 
provided  such as asking Mr G for evidence of his income and outgoings which  QuickQuid 
couldve gathered  from his bank statements or other  evidence. 
Im only able to uphold a complaint where I can safely say that a lender has done  something 
wrong. And, in this case, I think that QuickQuid carried out reasonable checks  even though  it 
looks like the information it mightve  been  provided wasnt  reflective of Mr Gs actual financial 
position. 
Ref: DRN66642533Id just add that the flex credit facility  is different to a payday loan, and Ive explained more  
about this below.
This flex credit  loan allowed Mr G to drawdown funds up to a set limit and his repayments 
would include interest and charges and 10% of either the total principal draw down or 10% of 
the most  recent drawdown. But unlike a payday loan - where  the repayments are due usually  
within one or two paydays the balance of the flex credit account is repaid  over a longer 
period of time, for example 10 months. So because the flex credit account  worked  differently  
to a payday loan  QuickQuid needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that Mr G could  
make the repayments  when they became due.
Having looked  at the credit agreement, I can see QuickQuid gave Mr G a credit limit of £200. 
And had Mr G kept to the repayment  schedule  outlined in the credit  agreement then his 
largest monthly repayment  wouldve been £68.41. 
However, based on everything  Ive seen, I think the offer that QuickQuid has made in order  
in relation to the flex credit if fair and reasonable and reasonable, and Ive explained why 
below. 
Mr G declared  the same  monthly  income  (£1,600)  as he had done  for his first loan. 
QuickQuid also carried out some sort of credit check, but it hasnt been able to provide me 
with the results.  However, having  looked at Mr Gs credit file, I dont  think there wouldve 
likely have been anything  on their which wouldve given QuickQuid cause for concern to 
either have  prompted  it to have carried out further, more detailed  checks or to have not 
approved the facility.  
Id like to reassure Mr G that Ive considered all the points he has raised. As Im not able to 
ask QuickQuid to do any more, other than what it has agreed to do. But I hope  that hell at 
least feel his concerns have been  listened to.
Overall Im satisfied that what  QuickQuid  has already agreed to do is fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. So Im not requiring QuickQuid  to do anything  more. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive, explained, my final decision is that the offer made by CashEuroNet LLC 
to put things right for Mr G is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this case. So I 
make no further award.   
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 November  2019.
