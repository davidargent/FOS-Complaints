The complaint
Mr H complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he paid for a holiday club membership. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr H and his partner entered into a purchase agreement to buy a holiday club membership 
from a holiday company in April 2016. The purchase price of the membership was £26,270 
and, with other the costs, the total amount payable by them was £26,623. I understand that 
Mr H entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of 
£26,623 and that he agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £299.99 to Barclays 
Partner Finance. 
Mr Hs representative made claims, on Mr Hs behalf, to Barclays Partner Finance under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in January 2020. It said that: there 
were breaches of contract and negligence by the holiday company; the membership was 
misrepresented to Mr H and his partner; commission was paid by Barclays Partner Finance 
to the holiday company but it didnt obtain Mr Hs and his partners informed consent so 
there was a breach of fiduciary duty; and Mr Hs relationship with Barclays Partner Finance 
was unfair.
Barclays Partner Finance didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so Mr H 
complained to this service. His complaint form says that: the holiday company and Barclays 
Partner Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan; 
Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared 
to Mr H; and the holiday company unduly pressured Mr H and his partner into entering into 
the purchase agreement and unduly pressured Mr H into entering into the loan agreement; 
all rendering the loan agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Hs complaint should be upheld. She wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think that the 
holiday company had breached the contract. She said that she hadnt seen enough to 
suggest that the relationship between Mr H and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and 
she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was 
unfair. She also said that she didnt consider that Barclays Partner Finance had acted 
incorrectly in connection with any commission paid to the holiday company. She then said 
that she wasnt persuaded that the money lent to Mr H was likely to have been unaffordable. 
Mr Hs representative, on behalf of Mr H, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. It has raised its serious concerns about the way that the finance was sold to 
Mr H. It says, in summary and amongst other things, that; the membership was a fractional 
property ownership as the contract clearly states that the property will be sold after the 
expiration of Mr H and his partners certificate and the net proceeds of the sale will be 
distributed between the members of good standing; and the finance company didnt comply 
with its obligations to conduct assessments of the affordability of the loan for Mr H and his 
creditworthiness.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Hs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr H and his partner signed the purchase agreement in April 2016 and bought a 
holiday club membership which gave them the right to occupy a two bedroom 
premier suite at a specified resort for seven days each year until December 2050 
(unless extended)  the purchase agreement also referred to 9,600 membership 
points;
they also signed the holiday companys standard information form and Mr H would 
have signed the loan agreement but Ive not been provided with a copy of the loan 
agreement;
Mr Hs representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in February 2019 
and Mr H then made a complaint to this service in April 2019  his complaint form 
referred to claims under section 140A and there was no reference to claims under 
section 75 but his representatives claim letter referred to claims under sections 75 
and 140A;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Hs claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays 
Partner Finances response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances  and, as it didnt provide a substantive response to those claims, I 
cant say that its response was fair or reasonable;
Mr Hs representatives February 2019 letter described the misrepresentations that it 
says were made to Mr H and his partner, including that they were advised that: they 
would be acquiring free holidays for the next 20 years", but that they only became 
aware that they would have to pay ever-increasing maintenance fees following the 
conclusion of the contract; and the products they were purchasing were worth the 
sum paid, but the membership is worth little or nothing;
neither Mr H nor his representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to them;
the purchase agreement that was signed by Mr H and his partner says that the first 
year's total maintenance/management charge was £864.45 and: The 
maintenance/management charge for the current year will be due by me/us when 
payment is requested by the [holiday company]. The maintenance/management 
charge for the following and each subsequent year will be due in each year on such 
date as the Management Company may determine and information about the 
maintenance/management charge was also included in the standard information 
form;I consider that Mr H and his partner were aware, or ought reasonably to have been 
aware, of the maintenance and management charges before they signed the 
purchase agreement so would have been aware that they were required to pay those 
charges each year;
Mr H and his partner were prepared to pay £26,270 for the membership and the 
purchase agreement gave them the right to occupy a two bedroom premier suite at a 
specified resort for seven days each year until December 2050 (unless extended) 
and 9,600 membership points;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership was 
misrepresented to Mr H and his partner by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the purchase agreement by any such misrepresentations;
the February 2019 letter also says that, because of the misrepresentations, Mr H and 
his partner are entitled to rescind their contract with the holiday company but it hasnt 
provided any more information about a breach of contract by the holiday company or 
its negligence - and Im not persuaded that theres been a breach of contract by the 
holiday company for which Barclays Partner Finance would be liable under section 
75;
Mr Hs representative says that commission was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to 
the holiday company but it didnt obtain Mr Hs and his partners informed consent so 
there was a breach of fiduciary duty by Barclays Partner Finance;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid 
by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company but, from what this service has 
seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less 
than 15% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner Finance wouldnt have breached 
any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any regulatory duty to 
disclose the amount of any commission paid in these circumstances - and I dont 
consider that the level of any commission that was normally paid in this type of 
situation would have been sufficiently high to mean that Barclays Partner Finance 
should have appreciated that not disclosing the amount of the commission to Mr H 
risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Im not persuaded that theres been a breach of any fiduciary duty in these 
circumstances;
Mr Hs representative says that the holiday company and Barclays Partner Finance 
failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mr Hs ability to afford the loan - but neither 
Mr H nor his representative has provided detailed evidence about Mr Hs financial 
position in April 2016 or to show that the loan wasnt affordable for him at that time;
Mr H sent an e-mail to the holiday company about the 2018 
maintenance/management charge in which he said that the timeshare had been mis-
sold and that he was being milked for pretend fees but there was no reference in 
that e-mail to the fees not being affordable for him  he wrote to his representative in 
October 2018 and asked for feedback about the action that it could take on both the 
timeshare loan and the maintenance fee and he said that he felt ripped off and the 
annual maintenance fee wasnt explained to him and his partner, but there was no 
reference in that letter to the loan and maintenance fee not being affordable for him;
the loan was made to Mr H in April 2016 but Ive seen no evidence to show that he 
asked Barclays Partner Finance for any information about the affordability 
assessment that it conducted before his representative made claims to it in February 
2019, nearly three years later, and if the loan wasnt affordable for him at the time 
that it was made to him I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have raised any concerns about the affordability of the loan with Barclays Partner Finance 
before then;
Im not persuaded that enough evidence has been provided to show that the loan 
wasnt affordable for Mr H when it was made to him in April 2016 or that the loan was 
mis-sold to him;
Mr Hs complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured Mr H and his 
partner into entering into the purchase agreement and unduly pressured Mr H into 
entering into the loan agreement but the standard information form that was signed 
by Mr H and his partner said that they had the right to withdraw from the purchase 
agreement without giving any reason within 14 calendar days;
if Mr H and his partner were concerned about the way that the membership had been 
sold to them and didnt want to buy it, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
them to have contacted either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance 
within the withdrawal period to withdraw from the purchase agreement  but Ive 
seen no evidence to show that they did so;
Mr H and his partner entered into the purchase agreement in April 2016 but Ive seen 
no evidence to show that they raised any concerns about the way that the 
agreements had been sold to them with either Barclays Partner Finance or the 
holiday company until Mr Hs representative made claims to Barclays Partner 
Finance in February 2019, nearly three years later, and if theyd been unduly 
pressured into entering into the agreements I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect them to have raised their concerns before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr H and his partner 
were unduly pressured into entering into the purchase agreement, that Mr H was 
unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mr Hs representative says that the membership was a fractional property ownership 
as the contract clearly states that the property will be sold after the expiration of Mr H 
and his partners certificate and the net proceeds of the sale will be distributed 
between the members of good standing;
fractional ownership products were sold as an investment and related to a specified 
property but the membership that was bought by Mr H and his partner didnt relate to 
a specified property and wasnt sold to them as an investment  so even though the 
standard information form says that the property will be sold after the expiration of 
Mr H and his partners certificate and the net proceeds of the sale will be distributed 
between the members of good standing, Im satisfied that the membership that was 
bought by Mr H and his partner isnt a fractional ownership product;
both fractional and non-fractional products were often sold in similar ways and may 
have had similar contractual documentation but the operation and effect of the 
contractual documentation would be significantly different for a fractional product 
than for a non-fractional product;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Hs relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr H and Barclays 
Partner Finance in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt issue a substantive response to Mr Hs claims so I 
cant say that its response to his claims was fair and reasonable  but if it had 
properly responded to his claims I consider that it would have been fair and 
reasonable for it not to have upheld them; andI sympathise with Mr H for the issues that he and his partner have had with their 
membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to him any of the money that 
he's paid for under the loan agreement, to cancel his loan agreement, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 August 2023.
