The complaint
Miss H is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) wouldnt open a business 
account for her. NatWest says that Miss H didnt meet the criteria to apply for a business 
account at the time of her application. 
Background
what Miss H says happened
In July 2020, Miss H says that she attended a branch of NatWest to ask if it would be 
possible to open a business account if her only other account with it was dormant. She says 
that the representative confirmed that she could.
Miss H subsequently applied online for a business bank account but her application was 
denied on the grounds that she didnt have a personal account with NatWest at the time. 
NatWest says that having a personal account was a criterion for obtaining a business 
account, at that time. It says that it no longer has the actual application made online by Miss 
H but it sent us samples of what Miss H would have received including the 
acknowledgement email from 2 July 2020 and an email on 6 July 2020 saying that due to the  
high number of new account applications, it is prioritising existing customers and so not 
taking Miss Hs application any further.
Miss H said she has a dormant personal account but NatWest has told us that it hasnt been 
able to locate any dormant accounts in her name.
Miss H says that NatWest delayed her in applying for a business account by insisting she 
had a personal account first. Further, when she did open a personal account NatWest 
rejected her application for a business bank account.
From December 2020, NatWest updated its guidance so that it could start accepting new 
customers to the bank and their applications for a business account. NatWest says that - as 
long as the business wasnt considered high risk by it. NatWest says that Miss Hs 
application was declined because she is receiving a number of customer payments from a 
high risk country where payments cannot be verified. NatWest added that as all of the 
businesss turnover was from abroad, it wouldnt be possible to open a UK business current 
account if there is no trading activity within the UK. 
Miss H says that in denying her a business account and in delaying her application, NatWest 
has discriminated against her. 
An investigator here assessed the case and didnt uphold Miss Hs complaint. She 
acknowledged that NatWest provided contradictory information about Miss H being able to 
apply for a business account without having a live personal account but she was satisfied 
that NatWest had apologised for this and attempted to put things right. As Miss H disagreed, 
the case has come to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome reached by the investigator albeit for slightly 
different reasons - I will explain why below.
Where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or contradictory, as some of it is here, I 
have to base my decision on the balance of probabilities. Ive read and considered the whole 
file, but Ill concentrate my comments on what I think is relevant. If I do not comment on any 
specific point its not because Ive failed to take it into account, but because I do not think I 
need to comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right outcome in this case. 
NatWest has confirmed that Miss H wasnt eligible to apply for a loan until December 2020 
(when it changed its guidance) because she didnt have an existing current account with it. 
Miss H says she had a dormant account with NatWest; NatWest says that it cannot find a 
record of this. There is some disparity here in whether a dormant account existed or not 
however, I do not consider that this is material to the outcome I have reached because in 
order for Miss H to be eligible for a business account, she needed to have a personal 
account in operation which she didnt  and this isnt in dispute. 
Once Miss H became eligible and opened a personal account with it, she applied for a 
business bank account and this was declined. NatWest has explained that it isnt possible to 
open a business current account if there is no trading activity within the UK and payments 
cannot be verified. In the circumstances, I do not consider NatWests position on this to be 
unreasonable. 
I acknowledge that at the time in question, many businesses were applying for the 
government backed Bounce Bank Loan Scheme and NatWest says this is why initially, it 
only allowed existing customers with personal accounts with it to apply for this. As 
mentioned above, it opened up the opportunities for new customers to apply for a current 
account with it from December 2020. 
NatWest has shared with us the criteria required to be met by customers who wished to 
open an account in order to be able to apply for a government backed Bounce Back Loan. 
One of these is that the business must have been established before 1 March 2020. 
Companies House data shows that Miss Hs business was incorporated three months after 
this date  and so she didnt meet the criteria in order to be able to apply for this loan. 
I acknowledge that NatWests representatives initially erred in their advice to Miss H that she 
could apply for a business account and I can see that NatWest has apologised for this. Im 
not minded to ask NatWest to do anything further in this regard. 
For the reasons stated above, I dont agree that NatWest delayed Miss Hs application for a 
business bank account; Miss H didnt have an existing personal account with it so she didnt 
meet the criteria to be able to apply for one. Once she was able to apply for one, NatWest 
considered her application but for commercial reasons decided that it wasnt one which it 
could approve. From the evidence I have seen, I do not consider NatWests position on this 
to be unreasonable and for this reason, Im not upholding this complaint. 
Miss H says she feels NatWest has discriminated against her given the problems shes 
experienced. I can understand why Miss H feels this way but having looked at all the 
evidence I dont think NatWest has done so. Nor do I think NatWest has acted unfairly or 
unreasonably. I hope that it helps Miss H to know that someone impartial and independent 
has looked into her concerns.I acknowledge that there have been some difficulties in the interactions between NatWest 
and Miss H resulting in NatWest saying it wont accept applications from Miss H moving 
forwards. Im saddened that matters escalated to this degree and Ive considered whether 
NatWests stance in this particular case is fair and reasonable. Having reviewed all the 
evidence, I can see why NatWest has taken this decision and I cant say that it is 
unreasonable. Im sorry if this disappoints Miss H, this isnt my intention and I hope Miss H 
can see why Ive reached this conclusion. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, my final decision is that I dont uphold Miss Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 April 2021.
