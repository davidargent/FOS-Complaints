The complaint
Mr H complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles defaulted his credit card account,
although it had told him it wouldnt.
What happened
Mr H said hed been unwell, and his finances slipped. He had missed some payments onto
his credit card. He contacted NewDay, and it said that he still had time to avoid the card
being closed and a default applied. So he made the payment NewDay asked for. But he said
NewDay still closed his card, and defaulted the debt. He wanted NewDay to reopen the card
account.
NewDay said that it starts collections work on a customers account once a payment has
been missed. If only two payments have been missed, the customer can clear arrears and
use the card again the next day. But once three payments are missed, the account is treated
differently. Its terminated then, and the card can no longer be used again regardless of
whether the arrears is cleared.
NewDay said this is in line with the terms and conditions of the account. And it said it writes
to its customers about this.
NewDay said Mr H hadnt paid between December 2018 and March 2019. His account was
in arrears, so it went through this process. The account was terminated on 21 March 2019.
NewDay said Mr H was told, during a call on 20 March, that a payment of £128.24 he made
then would prevent the account from terminating. NewDay said that payment hadnt posted
to the account until the 21st (the statement showed the payment on the 20th, but NewDay
said a statement will always show the actual payment date) which was coincidentally the
same day the account terminated.
NewDay said unfortunately the payment didnt prevent the account from terminating and it
cant reverse this process. NewDay said it had paid Mr H £20 for giving out wrong
information, but NewDay didnt think it had to do more than that.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. He said Mr H was clearly
misadvised about what would happen on his account. He didnt think NewDay had to remove
the default it had applied, because it had followed the process it had set out in its terms and
conditions. But he thought that it should pay Mr H £100 to make up for the wrong information
he was given, when he was told his debt was paid off and his card wouldnt default.
NewDay didnt agree. it understood it had given some wrong information, but it didnt think it
had to pay any more compensation for that. It said that it had taken the correct actions on Mr
Hs account, and nothing that was said on the phone would have changed the outcome. The
account would still have been defaulted. So if our investigator still thought NewDay should
pay £100, then NewDay said it wanted an ombudsman to consider this complaint.
Mr H didnt agree either. He said that he had wanted NewDay to write off some or all of the
balance, but hed since had to pay off the whole of the outstanding balance, because he was
trying to get a mortgage. So he wanted to know how he could get some or all of that money
back. Mr H also wanted this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman.
The case was then passed to me for a final decision
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Mr H didnt pay NewDay between 15 December 2018 and 20 March 2019. So 
NewDay was entitled to take steps to start to enforce the debt. But there are clear 
requirements on NewDay before it can record a default on Mr Hs credit file. I dont 
think those requirements have been met here.
NewDays notice of default was issued on 28 February, and asked for payment by 21 
March 2019. That letter said You must pay £92.27 by 21st March 2019, using one of 
the ways shown overleaf.
Like our investigator, I think it wouldve been better if this notice had been clearer 
about NewDays intention to register a default if this payment wasnt made. But thats 
not the key problem here.
Our investigator said that the notice gave Mr H 22 days to pay, so it was in line with 
the regulations set out in the legislation. Thats right. But guidance drawn up by the 
credit industry in collaboration with the Information Commissioners Office (called 
Principles for the Reporting of Arrears, Arrangements and Defaults at Credit 
Reference Agencies) says that lenders will give their customers longer than this.
That guidance says The lender must have notified you of their intention to register a 
default against you at least 28 days before doing so, in order to give you time to 
make an acceptable payment or reach an agreement with them on an arrangement.
I think that it was particularly important to allow this length of time before the default 
notice was enforced in this case, as a default notice had been issued relatively early, 
before Mr H was three months in arrears.
The default notice stated that Mr H had to pay £92.27 by 21 March 2019. I think he 
shouldve been given until 28 March, in line with the relevant guidance. I dont think 
NewDay shouldve tried to record a default on Mr Hs file before then.
Mr H called, and made a payment on 20 March. He paid £128.24.
When NewDay wrote to Mr H about this complaint, it said he owed £152.24 it but 
only paid £128.24, so he hadnt cleared his debt. NewDay appears to have added to 
Mr Hs debt, the amount of his March minimum payment.
But neither the amount Mr H paid, nor the amount NewDay said he owed, are the 
same as the amount requested on the default notice. The default notice said he had 
to pay £92.27 by 21 March.
The purpose of issuing a default notice is to give customers a last chance to pay, and 
avoid a default. Both the legislation and the guidance Ive referred to set out that 
customers can avoid a default by paying the amount listed on the notice. Mr H paid rather more than the amount listed on the notice. And he paid it the day before it was 
due.
I also note that Mr H was given a very clear reassurance on the call where he made  
this payment, that no default would be issued. In fact, he was told his account would 
be reopened and would be available for use.
NewDay doesnt have to reopen Mr Hs account if it doesnt want to. But for all of the
reasons given above, I dont think that NewDay can rely on the default notice it 
issued on 28 February to record a default on Mr Hs credit file on 21 March. Or at all.
I think NewDay should remove this default from Mr Hs credit file.
I also note that NewDay has made a number of mistakes in this case, not least of 
which was giving Mr H entirely wrong information about what was going to happen 
after he made a payment on 20 March. For that reason, I agree with our investigator 
that NewDay should pay Mr H £100 in compensation.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
NewDay said it could confirm that there wasnt a default marker on Mr Hs credit file for this 
account. It would pay the compensation I proposed. Mr H said that he was happy with the 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
For the avoidance of doubt, I wouldnt expect NewDay to take steps to amend Mr Hs credit 
file if it has not registered a default, so Ill make this clear in my decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd must remove the default marker on Mr Hs credit file for 
this account, if it has registered one, and pay him £100 in compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2021.
