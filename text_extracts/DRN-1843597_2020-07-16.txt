The complaint
Mr Ws complaint is about the balance payable on his finance agreement with Volkswagen 
Financial Services (UK) Limited (VWFS) trading as Audi Financial Services.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator.
When Mr W signed the finance agreement the monthly instalments and final payment were 
clearly set out on the front page of his hire purchase agreement. If the agreement was paid 
in full, and a final payment of a little over Â£8,500 was paid, the car would become his at the 
end of the 48-month term.
There was no promise that the residual value of the car Mr W was financing would be linked 
to the agreement. So, when he endeavoured to trade it in there was no guarantee the 
amount outstanding on the loan would have been covered by the trade in value of the 
vehicle.
So, whilst I understand that its come as a surprise to Mr W that there is a deficit, I cant say 
VWFS have been unreasonable as there was never an agreement that the vehicle part 
exchange value would keep pace with what was outstanding on the loan. And, I havent 
been provided with sufficient information that Mr W was told otherwise.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 August 2020.
