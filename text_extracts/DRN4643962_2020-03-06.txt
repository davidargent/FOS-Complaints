Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Gs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because it was apparent  Mr G was reliant on short-term loans. Sunny 
disagreed but offered to uphold Mr Gs complaint about loans 7 to 12. Mr G declined  the offer. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
Ref: DRN46439622the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint. Having done  so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 4. Mr G 
didnt respond  to the view. As there no longer appears to be a dispute about these loans, I 
wont be making any findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 5 to Mr G and the results of these checks 
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Gs fifth loan in less than two months, I think  
Sunny should  have  been looking to build a clearer picture about  Mr Gs finances  before 
lending him this loan. 
Had Sunny  carried  out proportionate checks before lending loan 5, its likely to have found 
that Mr G was borrowing  from other short-term lenders as well as having out-standing loans 
with Sunny itself.  The repayments for these  other  loans and his existing  commitments  to 
Sunny would have  been  increasing his monthly  outgoings by nearly  £800.  Given  Mr Gs 
declared income was £1,150, I think Sunny ought to have realised that it was unlikely Mr G 
would have been able to repay his commitments  without  having to borrow more. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr G, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Our adjudicator thought this point  was reached  by loan 6 because Mr G was rapidly borrowing. 
But given the circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 9. 
Ref: DRN46439623I say this because:  
At this point Sunny  ought to have realised Mr G was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr G had taken out nine loans in three months  and he was borrowing in 
rapid succession. Loans  2 to 5 were  taken out over a 10-day period. Loans 6 to 8 were 
taken out over 14 days.  And loan 9 was his fourth loan in the same calendar month. So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  that Mr Gs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably. 
Mr Gs first loan was for £200  and loan 9 was for £250.  At  this point Sunny ought to 
have known  that it was unlikely Mr G was borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but more  to meet  an ongoing  need. 
From loan 9 onwards Mr G was provided with a new loan within  days of taking out a 
previous one. 
He also wasnt really  making any inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 12 was 
taken out six months after his first loan. Mr G had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect; service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny provided  borrowing for loan 9 onwards because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The length of time over which Mr G borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Gs ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts Sunny should buy these back  if Sunny is able to do 
so and then take the following steps.  If Sunny cant buy the debts back, then Sunny should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
A)Sunny should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr G towards  interest, 
fees and charges  on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding  balance,  not including  
anything Sunny  has already refunded.
B)Sunny should calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by Mr G 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr G originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint  is settled.
C)Sunny should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr G as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr G having made 
overpayments then Sunny  should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments  would have arisen, to 
the date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated  in 
A and B and move to step E.
Ref: DRN46439624D)If there  is still an outstanding  balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding  loans. If this results  in a surplus, 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr G. However, if there  is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny  should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr G. Sunny shouldnt 
pursue outstanding  balances made  up of principal Sunny has already written-off.
E)Sunny should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Gs credit file in relation 
to loans 5 to 8. The overall pattern of Mr Gs borrowing for loans 9 to 12 means any 
information recorded about  them is adverse, so Sunny  should remove these loans  
entirely from Mr Gs credit file. Sunny does not have to remove  any outstanding loans 
from Mr Gs credit  file until these  have been  repaid,  but Sunny should still remove  any 
adverse information recorded about  these loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Elevate Credit International Limited  to take off tax from this 
interest. Elevate Credit  International  Limited must give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its 
taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 April 2020.
