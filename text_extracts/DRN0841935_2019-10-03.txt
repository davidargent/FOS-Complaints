Mr L says that at the time of loans he was stuck in a borrowing cycle, taking out loans with 
multiple lenders  and using new loans to pay off existing ones. He says he took out short  
term loans over an extended period and was not challenged  as to why he kept taking out 
new loans. He says he credit file has been damaged  which  is causing  him issues  in getting a 
mortgage.
Sunny says that before the loans were  provided  it carried out creditworthiness and 
affordability checks and considered how Mr L was managing his debt. It says based  on the 
results of these checks it was reasonable that the loans were provided.
Our adjudicator didnt  think that there was enough evidence to say that the first five loans  
shouldnt have been provided. However  she thought that by loan six, Mr Ls overall  pattern of 
borrowing suggested he had become  persistently reliant on short-term loans and that loans 
six onwards werent  sustainably affordable.  
Sunny didnt accept  our adjudicators view.  It said that that largest loan amount was £250 
compared to Mr Ls income of £1,400.  It said that its product allows  customer  flexibility by 
allowing more than one loan to be taken out at a time, it said that when there  were  existing 
loans these were taken into account in its assessments. 
Ref: DRN08419352my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr L could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower  a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
Our adjudicator said that she hadnt enough  evidence to say that the first five loans shouldnt  
have been provided. I have  looked  at the information gathered  and I agree with this. 
By the time loan six was provided I think that Sunny should have been concerned that Mr L 
had become persistently dependent on short term loans.  I say this because  Mr L took out six 
instalments loans within three months. Many  of the loans were  taken  out before previous 
loans had been repaid  and while I note the comments made  by Sunny about the nature of its 
Ref: DRN08419353product, I think that Mr Ls pattern of borrowing  showed he was struggling to manage his 
finances. 
Given Mr Ls pattern of borrowing I think that Sunny  should have  realised by loan six that 
lending to Mr L wasnt sustainably affordable.  There were no significant breaks between 
Mr Ls loans and the amounts he borrowed over the remainder of his borrowing relationship  
with Sunny didnt  significantly  reduce. Therefore I find it reasonable to say that loans six to 
17 shouldnt have been provided.  
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans  six to 17. Elevate Credit 
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should:
A) add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr L towards interest, fees and charges 
on loans six to 17, including payments made to a third party  where applicable, but not 
including anything that has already been  refunded.
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr L which  were  
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr L originally made the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled.
C) pay Mr L the total of "A" plus "B".
D) the overall pattern  of Mr Ls borrowing  for loans six to 17 means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse, so all information  about these loans should be removed from Mr Ls 
credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit  International Limited to deduct  tax from 
this interest. Elevate  Credit International Limited should give Mr L a certificate showing how 
much tax its deducted, if he asks for one. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 November 2019.
