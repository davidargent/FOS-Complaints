The complaint
Miss Js complaint is about two credit cards that she says were irresponsibly lent by NewDay 
Ltd.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, and have been summarised by 
our investigator, so I wont repeat them again here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus 
on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
NewDay was required to lend responsibly. And it needed to check Miss J could afford 
to make her credit card repayments sustainably on both accounts, and in line with the 
rules set out by the FCAs Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), specifically 
CONC 5.3.1. There was no set list of checks NewDay needed to do, but the checks 
should have been proportionate to the circumstances of each card application (and 
subsequent credit limit increase), which might include considerations about the 
amount borrowed, Miss Js borrowing history, and so on.
More specifically, I think that NewDays checks needed to be more thorough; the 
lower a customers income; the higher the amount to be repaid; the longer the term of 
the repayments; and the greater the number of cards, and the longer the period of 
time Miss J held an outstanding credit balance on each card.
NewDay says it believes it acted fairly, and that sufficient checks were done at the 
time of each credit increase. It says there wasnt anything shown which indicated 
Miss J was under financial strain, nor that she had any arrears, defaults, overlimit 
fees, or late payment fees.
Ive first considered whether NewDay did everything it should have when assessing 
Miss Js application and subsequent credit increases. And if I dont think it did, Ive 
gone on to consider whether or not any assessment failings resulted in NewDay 
agreeing to lend to Miss J when it shouldve known it was difficult for her to repay.
For the Marbles account, I am persuaded NewDays checks were proportionate for 
Miss Js initial application and her credit limit increase around October 2015. I find 
NewDays checks for the next credit increase in March 2016 werent proportionate. I 
say this because:
oNewDays own data shows Miss Js credit card debt had increased from £100 
to over £22,000.
oMiss J was using short-term lending.
I think this was sufficient to prompt NewDay to carry out further checks to ensure 
Miss J could sustainably make the repayments required for an increased credit limit  
for example requesting evidence of her income and expenditure. 
Based on Miss Js evidence, Im persuaded that had NewDay done so, it wouldve 
seen that her outgoings exceeded her income, leaving no disposable income to 
sustainably make the repayments required. So, I dont think NewDay shouldve 
provided Miss J with any further credit increases after March 2016.
For the Aqua account, Im not persuaded NewDays checks were proportionate for 
the initial application. Ive already determined that had NewDay carried out 
proportionate checks on the Marbles account in March 2016 it wouldnt have lent 
further to Miss J. 
In any event, I can see that if NewDay had verified the income Miss J stated on her 
Aqua card application, it wouldve likely raised further questions as to whether this 
additional borrowing could be sustainably repaid. And Miss Js evidence shows that 
had NewDay asked further questions around her income it wouldve determined the 
borrowing wasnt affordable for her. So, I dont think NewDay shouldve lent the Aqua 
card to Miss J either.
For these reasons, I uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that this complaint is upheld. In order to resolve Miss Js complaint, 
NewDay Ltd should:
Refund any interest and charges paid by Miss J on the Marbles account for any 
credit amount above £1,100. NewDay should apply this refund on any charges which 
fall between March 2016 until the account was sold. 
As the Marbles account has been sold to a third party, NewDay should do one of the 
following:
Buy the debt back from the third-party purchaser and reduce it to ensure Miss J 
doesnt pay any interest or charges; or 
Make a payment to the third-party purchaser so that the outstanding debt is reduced 
to ensure Miss J doesnt pay any interest or charges; or
Make a payment to Miss J to reflect any interest and charges that shell now have to 
pay the third-party debt purchaser as a result of the outstanding balance having been 
sold.
It is up to NewDay to decide which of the above options it would prefer to take. It should let 
Miss J know its proposed course of action if Miss J accepts my final decision.If Miss J has made any payments to the third party and ended up paying more than the 
amount she initially borrowed, then NewDay should:
Clear any outstanding balance with the third party.
Refund any extra amount over and above what Miss J borrowed.
Add interest at 8% per year simple on this amount from the date the extra amount 
was paid to the date of settlement.
In addition, New Day must:
Refund any interest and charges paid by Miss J on the Aqua account from 
September 2017.
oNewDay says the Aqua account has been charged off. If NewDay has written 
off any capital from the Aqua account as part of the charge off, it can use the 
refund to repay any written off capital as well as any outstanding capital.
oIf, after this, the refund results in a positive balance on the Aqua account, 
NewDay must refund this to Miss J and add interest at 8% per year simple 
from the date of each payment until the date of settlement.
And:
Remove any adverse information about the accounts up to the date Miss J tells us 
she accepts my final decision from her credit file.
HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to take off tax from this interest. NewDay must 
give Miss J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 July 2022.
