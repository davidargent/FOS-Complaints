*Apfin has explained that for these loans Miss A had telephoned in or contacted it to 
rearrange the payment date. 
Apfins final response to Miss As complaint was issued in September 2020 and overall 
Apfins view was that it had not done anything wrong for most loans. It went on to make an 
offer to Miss A in relation to five loans but without indicating which loans the proposed refund 
was for. It also offered to amend and/or remove loans from Miss As credit file. 
Miss A referred her complaint to this Service and said on her complaint form:
The credit file shows three defaults and many payday loans before getting CASH ASAP 
loan. There was no break from month to month I was in and out of these payday loans. 
Some payday loans were still open when I made application, any settled followed with 
another payday loan application. Repaying and then getting another payday loan is a sign, 
as a lender, CASHASP should not have lent. Eleven short term loans from CASHASAP 
between 2016 -2017. 8 loans received between three-seven days after prior loan settled.
Apfin summarised its position to this Service as:
Looking at the overall pattern of [Miss As] borrowing from us, her monthly repayments 
remained consistent and low. The contractual loan repayments ranged between 8% and 
24% of her monthly income and she left a 131 day break in her borrowing during her two 
relationship with us. Even within her two borrowing chains [Miss A] never borrowed 
sequentially and always left around a week between repaying one loan and taking a new 
one. We saw [Miss A] as a reliable customer who made her payments in a timely manner 
and based on our proportionate assessment of her applications her loans appeared 
affordable.
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and in his first view he thought that by loan 4 
Apfin ought to have realised that Miss A was having problems managing her money and so 
he thought that it should put things right for Miss A from loan 4. And from Loan 8 he thought 
that the overall pattern of borrowing suggested shed become reliant on the credit and so 
Apfin should put things right for Miss A for those too. 
Having received some additional submissions from Apfin Ltd, our adjudicator revised his 
opinion and felt that the uphold point should be from loan 6. Miss A was unsure why and 
asked for explanations. These were given.
In the meantime, in August 2021, Apfin had agreed with our adjudicators second letter of 
opinion and its resolution and had said it would do as he had outlined in that view letter. This 
was:
Refund on loans 6 to 11: £1,003.90
8% interest on the refund less tax: £263.68
Total refund: £1,267.58
We will remove any adverse information in relation to loans 6 and 7 and will remove 
records of loans 8 to 11 from [Miss As] credit file.
Miss A did not accept that resolution and so the complaint remained unresolved and was 
passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
 
Apfin needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss A could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure.
 
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that Apfin should 
fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the 
consumer. 
These factors include:
having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting 
the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable);
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Apfin was required to establish whether Miss A could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being the 
ability to repay without undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments.
 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss As complaint.
Current position
Apfin has agreed with our adjudicators second view and has said it will refund interest and 
charges in relation to loans 6 to 11 and amend and/or remove the loans from Miss As credit 
file. So, these appear to have been resolved and subject to the figures and calculations 
being redone at the end of this complaint (the current calculations by Apfin were done in 
August 2021) then it seems theres no dispute here. I have not reviewed those and I endorse 
the adjudicators view on those loans. 
Miss A has made articulate submissions throughout her complaint and has said that she 
thinks loans 4 and 5 ought to be ones that Apfin puts right for her as well as loans 6 to 11. 
From that, I think Miss A has no issue with the outcome in respect of the earlier loans, and 
her concern relates to loans 4 and 5. In the circumstances it is those I have reviewed. 
Loans 4 and 5
Miss A says her view is that it was a repeat cycle of loan applications, repayments and then 
reapplications with short periods between the loans. Miss A also relies on information on her 
credit file and says that her late repayments for loans 1 and 2 ought to have alerted Apfin. 
Apfin had information about Miss As income (approximately £2,300 a month) and her 
declared expenditure, which included outgoings for rent, utilities, clothing and food, internet, 
landline/mobile phone bills, council tax, travel and other expenditure. Miss A informed Apfin 
that she was spending money on other loans and credit card payments. It carried out credit 
searches before loans 4 and 5 (as well as the other loans). Apfin said that these search 
results indicated to it that Miss A was in control of her finances. I know that Miss A feels that the credit file she has indicated that she had three defaults and 
many payday loans before getting the Apfin loans and so her view is that should have 
influenced Apfin.
 
At the point at which Miss A applied for loan 4, I do think that Apfin ought to have known 
about her income, expenditure, other regular credit commitments and any other short -term 
loans she had. And I say this as it was the fourth loan after two late repayments for 
loans 1 and 2. And I think Apfin did these proportionate checks. I have reviewed the 
information I have from Apfin about loan 4.
At the point at which Miss A applied for loan 5, I think that a full financial review ought to 
have been carried out. One way of doing this would have been to have verified her income 
and all her expenditure and seen individual bills and invoices. Another way is to review 
Miss As bank account statements which can give a decent insight into a persons financial 
position. As I have Miss As bank statements then I did review those for the period covering 
her payday on 27 May 2016 to her payday on 27 June 2016 being the month leading up to 
her application for loan 5. 
Having looked at all these things, I can see that Miss A did have other loans and other 
commitments and that she had been taking payday and high cost short term loans in earlier 
years. But at the time I have reviewed I dont think there was enough there for me to think 
that Apfin would likely have declined the loan applications for loans 4 and 5. Having defaults 
on a credit file is not an automatic reason not to lend. And Miss As income, expenditure and 
loan repayment commitments (of varying sorts) looked to have been affordable at the point 
at which she applied for loans 4 and 5. 
I do not uphold Miss As complaint about loans 4 and 5. 
Loans 6 onwards
I endorse the outcome given by our adjudicator and agreed by Apfin for loans 6 to 11.  
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Apfin should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Miss A from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought to 
have. Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Miss A may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real 
and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Miss A in a 
compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable to conclude that Miss A would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. 
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Apfins liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right.
Apfin ought to do as follows: 
refund all interest and charges Miss A paid on loans 6 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple a year* on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 6 and 7 from Miss As credit file;
the number of loans taken from 8 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 8 to 11 should be removed from Miss As 
credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Apfin to take off tax from this interest. It must give Miss A 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss As complaint in part and I direct that APFIN LTD, 
trading as cashasap.co.uk, does as I have outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 November 2021.
