Mr B and Mrs A are unhappy  National  Westminster Bank Plc closed their 
joint savings
account.
background 
Mrs As, banking relationship  with NatWest had broken  down.
NatWest gave Mr B and Mrs A 60 days notice it would be closing their 
account. It didnt close the account until quite some time afterwards, so 
Mr B and Mrs A were unaware of the exact date the account would  be 
closed. NatWest  issued a cheque to the for the balance  of the account 
but this couldnt  be cashed as they no longer had a joint account. Mr B 
was very unhappy with the way the matter had been handed,  he 
believed NatWest  had breached Mrs As confidence as he was made 
aware of her difficulties. He complained to NatWest on behalf of them 
both.
NatWest looked at the complaint  but didnt feel it had done anything 
wrong. It had provided Mr B and Mrs A with notice it would be closing 
their account  in line with its terms and conditions. It  explained  it took 
longer than 60 days to close the account as it was speaking with Mrs A. 
NatWest  didnt agree it had breached Mrs As confidence, as it didnt 
disclose the reasons why the account  was being closed. NatWest said 
the cheque had to be issued in joint names, as it didnt  have any signed 
authority from Mrs A that the money  could be paid to Mr B only.
Mr B and Mrs A were unhappy with NatWests response so brought the 
complaint to our service.
Our investigator looked at the complaint  but didnt think  it should  be 
upheld. She said NatWest was entitled  to close  the account as long as it 
gave reasonable notice it was going  to do so. As it did this, she didnt 
think it had done  anything  wrong.  She also didnt  think Mrs As 
confidence had been broken, she accepted the fact the account was 
being closed would  have alerted  Mr B to an issue  but as none of Mrs As 
personal information  was provided by NatWest, she  didnt think it had 
acted incorrectly. Our investigator also didnt think NatWest had done 
anything wrong  by issuing the cheque in both names.
Ref: DRN64240812Mr B and Mrs A didnt  agree with the investigator, they didnt  feel 
NatWest had dealt  with the matter  sensitively.  They pointed out they still 
didnt have access to the money despite giving  authority for the funds  to 
be paid to Mr B some seven months  earlier. They  asked for the matter to 
be passed to an ombudsman.
NatWest has now sent a cheque for the account balance to Mr B.
my provisional findings
I issued my provisional findings  on this complaint on 15 October 2019. I 
said I intended to uphold the complaint  in part, for the following reasons:
Mr B, Mrs As father, has made several points about the way NatWest 
has dealt with her difficulties overall and the effect it has had on her. I 
wont be considering  that here as its more appropriate to be dealt with 
as a separate complaint. My consideration  here will be limited to the 
closure of the joint savings account they had.
Having reviewed all of the information,  I think NatWest acted reasonably  
in the way it closed  the joint savings  account, but I do think  it could have 
reissued the cheque for the account balance to Mr B quicker  than it did. 
Ill explain why under the headings below.
Account closure
According to the terms and conditions of Mr B and Mrs As account 
NatWest is entitled to close it as long as it provides  them with at least  60 
days notice. It isnt in dispute that NatWest gave the required  notice to 
Mr B and Mrs A, so I dont need to consider that further here, other  than 
confirm NatWest was entitled to take this action.
The issue here is that NatWest didnt finally close the account until May. 
And, it issued a further 60 day notice  letter in February, after it had sent 
a joint cheque, which caused some  confusion.
For an account to be closed  it has to be at zero balance, so NatWest 
would have needed  to send the cheque to Mr B and Mrs A before  it 
could physically  close the account. Ive seen evidence  to show that Mrs 
Ref: DRN64240813A was in contact with NatWest around this time and it had agreed  to put 
a temporary hold on closing the account. When this time ended,  a new 
60-day notice  letter was issued and the account was finally closed in 
May. Given this was a joint account, I realise Mr B may not have been 
aware of the temporary hold that was placed on the closure  and so the 
new letter may have  caused  some  confusion, especially given  a cheque 
had been  issued and he had returned  this.
Having looked at the overall situation,  I dont think  NatWest acted 
unreasonably here. It had to give at least 60 days  notice  which means 
it didnt have to shut the account immediately after the 60 days had 
passed. The fact it left the account open longer than this doesnt mean it 
acted incorrectly.
Was Mrs As confidentiality  breached?
NatWests letter to Mr B came from its debt management department 
and referred to its banking relationship with Mrs A having broken down. 
Because of this, Mr B feels that Mrs As confidentiality was broken. He 
became aware of the difficulties  Mrs A was having which he previously 
had no knowledge of and this caused him some distress.
The issue at hand  here is whether NatWest  beached any duty of 
confidentiality it owed to Mrs A by sending  the letters it did to Mr B. 
While such a duty is an implied term of the bank/customer relationship 
that duty isnt absolute, Case law recognises that there are some 
circumstances in which  disclosure  might be lawful,  theyre are commonly 
known as the Tournier principles, and permit disclosure:
where the bank is compelled by law to disclose  the information
if the bank has a public duty to disclose information
if the banks own interests require disclosure
where the customer has agreed  either expressly  or implicitly   to 
the information
being disclosed.
In its letter, NatWest  did make reference to its banking  relationship  with 
Mrs A having  broken down. While I do agree with Mr B this would have 
made him aware that something was happening  with Mrs A, based on 
Ref: DRN64240814the above, even if NatWest did breach  a duty of confidentiality, it would 
most likely be considered an acceptable breach.
Had NatWest not given  any reasons  why it was closing  the account, I 
think this would  likely also have led Mr B to question why it was 
happening. And he probably would  have  been entitled to an explanation 
of why the action  was being  taken, and to complain about it if the bank 
didnt explain. I find theres a persuasive basis for saying  that the banks 
own interests required disclosure to Mr B of the breakdown  of its 
relationship with Mrs A.
The reason why the account had to be closed is unfortunate, but I dont 
think NatWest acted incorrectly in giving  the reason it did.
Cheque issue
NatWest originally issued a cheque for the balance  of the account in 
joint names. Mr B and Mrs A have provided us with a letter they sent to 
NatWest returning the cheque, which asked for it to be reissued to Mr B 
only. This didnt happen  until seven months later despite  them  raising a 
complaint to NatWest directly and NatWest being provided with a 
complaint form from our service signed by both of them,  asking for this 
to happen.
Because of this, I think Mr B and Mrs A either  lost the opportunity to earn 
interest on the amount outstanding  or they lost the use of those funds for 
seven months.  I believe  they were also caused  some inconvenience by 
having to repeatedly chase the matter up. In light of this, I intend to 
direct NatWest to pay them  jointly, £50 compensation.
As its clear Mr B and Mrs A no longer  have joint banking  facilities,  I think 
NatWest should pay Mr B directly. He can then liaise with Mrs A as 
needed.
my provisional decision
I intend to uphold this complaint in part and direct National Westminster 
Bank Plc to pay Mr B £50 compensation.
responses to my provisional  decision 
Ref: DRN64240815NatWest has responded saying it accepts  my recommendation. 
Mr B has said that he understands what  Ive said but thinks they should 
receive £50 each. He reiterated the matter has caused a lot of distress 
and they had to wait a long time to get access to the money. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence and arguments to decide 
whats fair and reasonable  in the circumstances of this complaint. And 
having done so, I see no reason  to change  my provisional decision. Ill 
explain why.
I dont doubt it wouldve  caused Mr B some upset when he became 
aware of Mrs As difficulties but I dont think NatWest can be held 
responsible for this. It simply  wrote to him, as it was required to do, to let 
him know  the joint account was to be closed. As I explained at the start 
of my provisional  decision, the way in which NatWest dealt with Mrs As 
difficulties overall,  has not been considered  as part of this complaint.
Im awarding compensation in part to reflect the fact Mr B and Mrs A lost 
the opportunity  to earn interest  on the amount outstanding or they lost 
the use of those funds  for seven months. The interest the money could  
have earned would likely have been a minimal amount  and they could 
have only spent the money once. Mr B was the party who mainly chased 
for the cheque to be issued. Although I dont doubt Mrs A was also 
updated on progress.   
Because of this, I will not be altering  or making  any further award of 
compensation. NatWest should pay compensation of £50 jointly to Mr B 
and Mrs A. However, as they no longer have  joint banking facilities it 
should pay Mr B directly. He can then liaise with Mrs A as needed.
my final decision
I uphold Mr B and Mrs As complaint against National Westminster Bank  
Plc in part and direct it to pay Mr B £50 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial  Ombudsman  Service, Im required to 
ask Mr B and Mrs A to accept or reject  my decision before 
12 December 2019.
