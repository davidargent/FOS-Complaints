K821x#15complaint
Mr T says Elevate  Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny),  irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr T says that if Sunny had properly checked his financial situation it would have 
seen he had borrowing  with other  short-term lending  providers. He had to borrow  more  to 
repay his debts and his borrowing got out of control.

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ts complaint and thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. Sunny disagreed but later offered redress  at loan 13. 
We put the offer to Mr T but he didnt want to accept  it. 
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN47115522Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr T could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr T didnt  comment  on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt  be upheld.  
Because of this, I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  these  loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But the loans were  part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr T had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint. After  doing so I am going  to uphold 
Mr Ts complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN47115523Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ts case,  and like the adjudicator, I think  that this 
point was reached by loan six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr T was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr T had taken out six loans  within  just over six months. So Sunny ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not Mr T was having  to borrow further  to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ts 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr T had borrowed twice in April at loans four and five and the total for that month  
was for £400, the highest amount Mr T had borrowed within any month. Such 
borrowing can be an indication that he was becoming persistently reliant and was 
having to borrow  more to make  ends meet.
Mr T was repaying his loans early.  And while I accept this would have saved Mr T 
interest charges,  it can equally  be a suggestion of someone juggling  their finances  to 
stay on top of their financial  situation.  
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  17 was 
taken out 16 months after Mr Ts first. Mr T had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.  
I think that Mr T lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ts ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans six to 17 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  six to 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from six onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  six to 17 should be removed from Mr Ts credit  
file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ts complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN47115524Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 May 2020.
