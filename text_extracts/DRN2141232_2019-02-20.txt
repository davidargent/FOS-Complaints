K821x#15complaint
Mr M says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent both Mr M and QuickQuid my provisional decision on this complaint on 
5 February 2019.  A copy of it is attached and it forms part of this final decision. The full 
background to the complaint is set out in my provisional decision, so I wont reiterate that 
here.
I explained why I was planning  to uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and asked both parties to 
let me know  if they had anything to add. Mr M didnt  send  me anything else to consider.
QuickQuid responded,  saying  it did conduct  appropriate and proportionate affordability  
assessments, including validation of Mr Ms income  and expenses  before funding all of the 
loans. It also provided  generic information about its lending  policy  and processes. Finally, for 
loans 9-15,  it provided some information  about  the data it used to assess the affordability of 
these loans. This information included its estimate  of Mr Ms disposable income at the time 
of loans 9-15 and what it calls validated credit commitment data.
As QuickQuid didnt accept my provisional findings, Ive reconsidered  the complaint in full.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account our general 
approach to complaints about  short-term  lending, which is set out on our website.
While Im grateful to QuickQuid for its response  to my provisional decision, I dont think  that it 
has really engaged with my key findings. I proposed to uphold the complaint about loans 
6-13  but did not do so purely  because I thought QuickQuid  hadnt carried  out proportionate 
affordability assessments.
The second  key question I posed in my provisional  decision  was: taking  into account the 
short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of lending  increase Mr Ms 
indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
My full thoughts on the answer to that question are set out in my provisional decision. But in 
summary I said I planned to uphold the complaint about loans 6-13, because the overall 
pattern of lending increased or prolonged [Mr Ms] indebtedness in a way that was 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful and he lost out as a result.
QuickQuid hasnt addressed  directly or indirectly  the points I made about the pattern of 
lending in Mr Ms case.
As QuickQuid hasnt given me anything new to think about, in terms of the overall  pattern of 
lending and the unsustainable  or harmful way it increased Mr Ms indebtedness,  I havent 
changed my mind on the answer to the above  quoted question.
My final decision is therefore  the same  as my provisional decision and Im upholding Mr Ms 
complaint in part.
Ref: DRN21412322putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
QuickQuid must:
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  6 to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove all entries about  loans 6-13 from Mr Ms credit file as the number of loans 
taken from July 2014 to July 2016  means any information recorded about  them  is 
adverse.
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must  give 
Mr M a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 March  2019.

complaint
Mr M says CashEuroNet UK LLC,  trading  as QuickQuid,  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr M had 15 loans with QuickQuid  Ive set out some of the details the business  provided about  
these loans in a table  attached as an appendix to this decision.
An adjudicator considered this complaint but didnt recommend it be upheld.  Mr M didnt agree  with 
the adjudicator.  He said it obvious he was in financial  difficulty and QuickQuid  just carried on lending 
him money whenever he asked for it.
As there  was no agreement, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website  and Ive 
taken this into account in deciding  Mr Ms case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and have explained why below.
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr M could repay  his loans 
in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and Mr Ms income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages  of 
a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion of their 
income 
the amount, or amounts,  due to be repaid are higher  
there is a larger number  and/or frequency of loans 
the period of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind,  I think that there are three key questions for me to consider in order to fairly 
and reasonably determine  Mr Ms complaint. These questions are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy 
itself that Mr M would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those  checks have 
shown that Mr M would have  been  able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase  Mr Ms indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other  way?
Ref: DRN21412324Ive carefully thought about  all of these questions and what they mean  for Mr Ms complaint.
Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself that 
Mr M would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those  checks have shown that Mr M 
would have been able to do so?
Throughout the period  of lending QuickQuid obtained information about Mr Ms income. For the first 
nine loans, Mr Ms net monthly  income  was recorded  as £1,500. This increased to £2,000 from loan 
10 onwards.
QuickQuid started asking  Mr M questions about  his expenditure as of loan six. The questions  included  
asking Mr M about his monthly housing  costs;  his utility transport and food expenses; his other 
monthly credit commitments  and other  general expenses.  For loans 6-12, the total of these  
outgoings was £625. For loans 13 and 14 the total reduced to £525.  And for loan 15 the total reduced 
to £475.
Ive also seen  that QuickQuid carried out credit checks, but Ive not seen the results of these checks.
I think  the checks for the first three loans  went far enough. Although QuickQuid only had information 
about Mr Ms income and employment status, I dont think it had reason to believe  the repayments  
wouldve been  unaffordable.  The repayment for loan 1 was £250  a reasonably large  portion of 
Mr Ms net monthly income. But this was his first loan with QuickQuid and at this time it had no reason  
to believe Mr M was in financial difficulty. Loans 2 and 3 had repayments of just £119  less than 10% 
of Mr Ms income.
I think  the checks were  also proportionate for loans  14, 15 and their top-ups. There was a gap in the 
borrowing of a little over seven  months  (231 days)  after loan 13. So although 
Mr M had been borrowing regularly  up until loan 13, that pattern was then broken. This means  that 
when he applied for loans  14 and 15, it wouldve been reasonable for QuickQuid to place less weight 
on the frequency of Mr Ms previous  borrowing  and the signs of financial difficulty previously  
demonstrated by the number of loans  taken.
This leaves loans 4-13 and the associated top-ups. I dont think the checks QuickQuid carried  out 
were proportionate in the circumstances of these  loans. 
Loan 4 was approved just a day after loan 3 was repaid and was for an increased amount.  It was also 
the fourth loan Mr M applied for in about five months. These  factors suggest  Mr M may have been  
struggling to repay  his debts sustainably.  So I think  it wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid to 
have asked him questions about his expenditure   particularly looking at the details of his other short-
term debt (if any).
Similarly, loan 5 was approved only around two weeks after Mr M repaid loan 4. Although it was for a 
lower amount, I think the frequency of lending alone shouldve been a concern. So again, it wouldve  
been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask Mr M to provide  information about his income  and 
expenditure. And I think it ought to have asked him for some evidence  like bank statements  and/or 
payslips  to support what he declared.
As QuickQuid  didnt carry out proportionate checks for loans 4 and 5, Ive considered what checks like 
those Ive described above  wouldve shown.
It doesnt  appear that Mr M had any other substantial short-term debt at the time of loan 4  although  
I think  he did have some other loans  to repay. But I dont think  the amounts  he owed other lenders 
wouldve made  loan 4, or the top-ups,  look unaffordable to QuickQuid.
Ref: DRN21412325In respect of loan 5, had QuickQuid asked Mr M for evidence of his income,  I think  its likely it 
wouldve seen Mr M was being paid what he declared  about £1,500 a month.  I also think a full 
review of his finances wouldve indicated that he was borrowing from another  short-term  lender at the 
same time as borrowing from QuickQuid.  
I can see from Mr Ms bank statements that in April 2014 Mr M spent  around 40% of his income 
repaying short-term  lenders.  Thats quite a high proportion of his income  to be repaying  creditors in 
general and seems  particularly high in the context of high-cost credit.  After repaying QuickQuid  and 
the other short-term lender, Mr M was overdrawn  and borrowed £1,000 from a bank. The repayments 
for that loan were about £98 a month. Mr M also had an existing loan for which  he paid £280 a month
However, its not clear that Mr M owed other short-term lenders anything  when  he applied for loan 5 
and the top-ups.  So his main  credit commitments  were the loans  I mentioned above  which  total 
about £378 a month. The highest repayment (after top-ups) for loan 5 was £262. This would  leave 
about £860 for Mr M to meet  his other living  costs. On balance,  I dont think a full review of Mr Ms 
finances at this time wouldve suggest Mr Ms other living  costs exceeded  this amount.
So Im not planning on upholding  the complaint about loans 4 and 5.
I havent recreated  individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans  6 to 13 because I dont think  
that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of lending 
increase Mr Ms indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of lending.   Ive looked to see if there was a point at which 
QuickQuid should reasonably have seen that further  lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. 
And so QuickQuid should have  realised that it shouldnt have provided any further lending. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ms case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. By 
this time Mr M had been borrowing from QuickQuid  for about ten months.  There were often only 
short-gaps between the loans, many of which  were  topped-up. This suggests  Mr M was struggling to 
repay his loans sustainably  without the need to borrow  again.
By borrowing in this way, Mr M wasnt making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed  QuickQuid 
over time. And he was in effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended 
period. The period  of borrowing from loans  6-13 lasts for about two years  and its about  three years  
from loans 1-13.  During this time there were  22 lending  decisions. So I think there was clear  evidence 
of Mr M being  unable  to reduce his indebtedness within a reasonable timeframe.
I think  that Mr M lost out when QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loans 6-13 because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  over an extended period of time
the sheer number of loans  was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ms ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost  loans
So Im upholding Mr Ms complaint about  loans 6 to 13 because the overall pattern of lending 
increased or prolonged his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and he 
lost out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  everything provided. Having  done  so, Ive not seen anything  here that 
leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards  Mr M in some other way. 
Ref: DRN21412326putting things  right  what Quick  Quid needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  6 to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number of loans taken from July 2014 to July 2016 means any information  recorded  about  
them is adverse. So all entries about 6-13 should be removed from Mr Ms credit file
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must  give 
Mr M a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
I plan to uphold the complaint in part and to tell CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
