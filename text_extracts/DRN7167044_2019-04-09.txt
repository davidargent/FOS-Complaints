K821x#15complaint
Ms P complains  that Gain Credit LLC trading as Lending Stream approved  loans for her 
which trapped her in a debt spiral with the repayment taking so much of my wages that I had 
to borrow again  to cover the monthly  expenses.  
background
A table  I prepared of the approved loans for Ms P appears at the end of this decision. 
I attach my provisional decision dated 8 March 2019, which forms part of this final decision 
and should be read in conjunction with it. In my provisional decision I explained why 
I intended to uphold Ms Ps complaint in part. I invited both parties to provide any further 
comments they may have  by 21 March 2019 before I reached a further decision.
my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Lending Stream has accepted my provisional  decision and made an offer to Ms P to put 
things right which accords with the recommended actions set out in my provisional  decision. 
Specific calculations  have been  presented and Ms P has agreed to that offer.  It is set out 
here: 
we would like to confirm  that we agree to refund  the interest  and charges paid 
towards the loans  10 to 42 amounting  to 1672.97  GBP [1464.07 GBP for Interest 
paid, 15.00 GBP for fee Paid, 193.90 GBP for 8% annual interest on the interest paid 
net of 20% mandatory tax withholding  (amounts to 48.48 GBP) per HMRC 
regulation]. Furthermore,  we will remove all the entries in reference to the above-
mentioned loans from Ms [Ps] credit file.
In the circumstances where  Lending  Stream has indicated that it agrees with my provisional 
decision I make no alteration to the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision on 
8 March 2019. 
putting things right
I have decided that Lending Stream was irresponsible to lend to Ms P between June 2016 
(Loan 10) and November  2017 (Loan 42), and in order to put Ms P back in the position she 
would have been in, had it not agreed  to this number of loans over this length of time,  
Lending Stream should: 
-refund  all interest and charges for Ms Ps loans agreed in this period;
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to 
the dates of settlement;
-the number  of loans taken from Loan 10 means any information recorded about  them  
is adverse. So all entries about  loans 10 to 42 should be removed from Ms Ps credit 
file.
Ref: DRN71670442Lending Stream is entitled to set off any monies arising from the redress  against any monies  
Ms P may owe it, but to be clear  this should  only be in respect  of the principal sum 
borrowed. Any unpaid  charges and interest would need to be removed first and any 
payments made to either  loan treated  as if Ms P had paid down the principal.
If a third party owns any debt then in order to do the set off I have outlined  above, Lending 
Stream will need to repurchase that debt. If it does not do that then it cannot do the set off 
and the full amount due will be repayable to Ms P directly.  And in those circumstances the 
third party will need to be directed by Lending Stream  to remove  the entries from Ms Ps 
credit file, so far as it is able to do so. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Ms P a certificate  showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision  dated 8 March  2019, I uphold 
Ms Ps complaint in part. 
Gain Credit LLC,  trading as Lending  Stream, should  put things right for Ms P as Ive outlined  
above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision  on or before 9 May 2019.

Ref: DRN71670444the main  part of my provisional decision dated  8 March 2019
background
From the information Lending Stream has supplied  I have created a table of the 42 approved  loans 
and it appears  at the end of this decision. I refer to the loans by the numbering in that table. 
All of these loans were  repayable in instalments over six months.  Many were repaid  early.  
Having complained  to Lending Stream it responded to Ms P in January 2018 by offering to waive 
about £640 interest and to reduce the outstanding balance (from  two loans)  to £560. Lending Stream 
said it was satisfied to receive  the balance  through an affordable repayment plan. 
Ms P did not proceed with this as she brought her complaint to this service. Having  seen Lending 
Streams file of information  it sent to her she said that her credit score was never as high as Lending 
Stream said it was as she was in a DMP  - debt management plan at the time. 
Ms P has explained that the reason she could pay off 40 of the 42 loans  she took was she had been 
taking money  from her private pension funds. In addition she has explained to Lending Steam and to 
us that she had a gambling compulsion. Ms P goes on to say that Lending stream should have  
realised I had serious problems and should not have lent to me 42 times.
One of our adjudicators  considered the complaint and she thought that in relation to Loans 1 to 7 then 
proportionate checks were carried out. This was a period  of lending when there were two large gaps 
in the lending.  She did not uphold the complaint  in relation to these loans. Ms P did not object to these  
loans not being upheld and so I do not plan to consider them again. 
Our adjudicator thought that Lending Stream ought to have done more checks  in relation to Loans 8 
to 42. And for Loans  8 and 9 still, if better checks had been carried out, she thought that Lending 
Streams decision to lend would not likely  be different. Again, Ms P did not dispute  the adjudicators 
opinion in relation to these  and so I do not plan to review them. 
From Loan 10 our adjudicator thought that Lending Stream ought to have carried out more  thorough 
checks in proportion to the loan amounts being applied for, bearing in mind  that this would have been 
the fifth loan in three months. The combination of the four earlier instalment loans  in this particular 
lending chain  (since April 2016) meant that Ms Ps indebtedness to Lending Stream stretched from 
April 2016 to the end of September 2016. And then Ms P applied for a fifth which was Loan 10.
Our adjudicator calculated that Ms P would  not have  been able to afford  Loan 10 and carrying  out the 
checks she felt ought to have been carried  out would  have revealed many issues surrounding Ms Ps 
financial circumstances which our adjudicator felt ought to have been considered.  And having  done 
that, her view was that Lending Stream ought not to have lent from Loan 10 to Loan 42. She set out in 
her letter what she felt Lending Stream  should do to put things right for Ms P for Loans 10 to 42.
Lending Stream did concede in relation to some of the loans but disputed  the others.  Those  conceded 
on I take to be resolved as there does not appear to be a dispute about them now. These are Loans 
10, 11, 14, 16, 38 and 39. 
The complaint overall remains unresolved and has been passed to me for a decision.  
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding Ms Ps case. 
Ive come to a provisional decision to uphold Ms Ps complaint in part and have explained why below.
Ref: DRN71670445Lending Stream needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice 
this means that it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Ms P could repay  her 
loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and Ms Ps income  and expenditure.  With this in mind, in the early  stages of 
a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion of their 
income 
the amount, or amounts,  due to be repaid are higher  
there is a larger number  and/or frequency of loans 
the period of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
The rules (Financial Conduct Authority Consumer Credit Source  Book  CONC) say that in 
assessing affordability a lender needs to consider whats appropriate in the circumstances  for 
example the type and amount of credit  being sought and the potential risks to the consumer.   It also 
clearly states that lenders should not refinance short-term loans where it would be unsustainable for 
the consumer or otherwise  harmful  for them.
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I am aware  that Lending Stream does not consider the type of loan it offers to its customers are 
payday loans but they do fall within  the definition  of high-cost short-term  credit. And in Ms Ps case 
often she repaid them  early  (often  within 30 days) and so in effect many of them  were the equivalent 
of payday loans.  
In coming to a decision  on Ms Ps case, I have  considered the following  questions:
did Lending  Stream  complete reasonable  and proportionate checks  when assessing each of 
Ms Ps loan applications to satisfy itself that she would be able to repay  the loan in a 
sustainable way?  And if not, would  those checks have  shown that Ms P would have been  
able to do so? 
taking  into account the high-cost and relatively short-term purpose of the loans provided, did 
the overall pattern  of lending increase  Ms Ps indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable 
or otherwise harmful?
did Lending  Stream  act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some other way?
Having done so, Ive concluded that Lending Stream was irresponsible  to lend to Ms P from her tenth 
loan onwards.  I plan to uphold his complaint  in part and ask Lending  Stream to refund  the interest and 
charges she paid for Loan 10 and all her subsequent loans. Ive explained  below. In fact Lending 
Stream has conceded in relation to Loans 10 and 11 already. 
Did Lending Stream, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that Ms P would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would  those checks  have shown that 
Ms P would have been  able to do so?
In view of the matters outlined in the background  section  of this provisional decision then I do not plan 
to review the Loans up to Loan 10. 
Ref: DRN71670446I havent recreated  individual, proportionate affordability checks for Loans 10 to 42 because I dont 
think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of lending 
increase Ms Ps indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of lending.  Ive looked to see if there was a point at which  
Lending Stream should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise 
harmful. And so Lending Stream ought, in my view, have realised that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further lending. Given the particular circumstances  of Ms Ps case, I think  that this point was reached 
by Loan 10. I say this for a number  of reasons and I explain further  below.  
Ms P was asking for loans (sometimes several  in one month) when  she had just received  funding 
from an earlier loan. So I think that should raise  the question as to the intended purpose of the loans.  
And for Ms P that lending relationship overall  had been  two years since June 2014. And it would have 
been the fifth loan in four months 
After Loan 10 I think that Lending Stream ought to have seen that Ms P was dependant on the loans 
and kept coming back for more. In fact, later in the summer it seems that Loan 9 had fallen into 
arrears and Ms P emailed  Lending Stream  to say that she was having difficulty  paying it and her other 
outstanding loan around that time which  was Loan 12. So Lending Stream  was on notice that already 
things were getting difficult for Ms P. And yet it continued to lend to Ms P for an additional 20 loans in 
the next fourteen months until November  2017. 
I think  that the sheer number of loans was likely  to have had negative  implications on Ms Ps ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost  loans.
I think  agreeing  this number of loans  over this length of time had the effect of unfairly increasing Ms 
Ps indebtedness to Lending Stream by allowing her to take expensive credit  which the rules and 
guidance make clear  are only intended for short-term use  over an extended period  of time.
So Im upholding Ms Ps complaint about Loans 10 to 42 because the overall pattern of lending 
increased her indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and she lost out as 
a result.
Did Lending Stream  act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  everything provided. Having  done  so, Ive not seen anything  here that 
leads me to conclude Lending Stream acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Ms P in some other 
way.  
putting things  right
As Ive made  a provisional decision that Lending Stream  was irresponsible to lend to Ms P between 
June 2016 (Loan 10) and November 2017 (Loan 42), then in order to put Ms P back  in the position 
she would have been in, had it not agreed to this number  of loans  over this length of time,  Lending  
Stream should: 
-refund all interest and charges for Ms Ps loans  agreed in this period;
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to the dates  
of settlement;
-the number of loans taken from Loan  10 means any information recorded about them  is 
adverse. So all entries about loans 10 to 42 should be removed  from Ms Ps credit file.
Ref: DRN71670447Lending Stream is entitled  to set off any monies  arising  from the redress against  any monies Ms P 
may owe it, but to be clear this should only be in respect of the principal sum borrowed.  Any unpaid 
charges and interest would need to be removed  first and any payments made  to either  loan treated  as 
if Ms P had paid down the principal.
If a third party owns any debt then in order to do the set off I have  outlined above, Lending Stream  will 
need to repurchase that debt. If it does not do that then it cannot do the set off and the full amount 
due will be repayable to Ms P directly. And in those circumstances the third party will need to be 
directed by Lending Stream  to remove the entries from Ms Ps credit file, so far as it is able to do so. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest.  Lending  Stream 
must give Ms P a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
