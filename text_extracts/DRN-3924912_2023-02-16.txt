The complaint
Mr H complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC trading as Barclaycard (Barclaycard) took 
£1,000 from his account.
What happened
Mr H had a current account with Barclays, and a Barclaycard. The Barclaycard was settled 
each month by direct debit from his Barclays current account. In July 2022, the direct debit 
for £456.72 was taken - but Mr H also made a manual payment of £456.72. So a double 
payment was made. Barclaycard refunded one amount of £456.72 to the current account on 
21 July 2022.
Mr H complained. He said Barclays removed £1,000 from his account. He showed us a 
statement which showed a debit to his Barclays account of £1,365.63  but this was 
undated. He also went through his calculations for the period from July 2022 to August 2022 
 and he said this showed he had overpaid his Barclaycard account by £1,000.
Barclaycard said that a double payment of £456.72 was made because the direct debit 
payment was claimed, as well as Mr H making a manual payment of the same amount. So 
they returned one amount of £456.72 to the bank account (from the Barclaycard account). 
They went through the other transactions on Mr Hs Barclaycard account for the months of 
July 2022 and August 2022. They apologised that some of the calls made by Mr H had 
dropped out and said Barclaycards call handlers had tried to help Mr H each time he called. 
Barclaycard didnt uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Mr H brought his complaint to us. Our investigator went through the transactions on Mr Hs 
current account and Barclaycard account  both in his view and subsequently. He couldnt 
find any evidence that an amount of £1,000 had been taken from Mr Hs accounts. He 
referred to the photo sent to us by Mr H  which showed a debit to Mr Hs current account of 
£1,365.63 - and said he couldnt comment on that as it wasnt dated. Our investigator agreed 
that there had been some poor service by Barclaycard - as some calls had been cut off. For 
that, he said Barclaycard should pay compensation of £50.
Mr H didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive read Mr Hs file thoroughly and considered his complaint. Because Mr H has put his 
calculations to our investigator for the period from July 2022 to August 2022  I have 
focused on these, as it seems clear that is the period he is concerned about. I looked at the 
transactions between Mr Hs Barclays current account and his Barclaycard account:
Date of transaction to bank 
accountBank account Barclaycard account
15 July 2022 Debit £456.72 Credit £456.72
18 July 2022 Debit £456.72 Credit £456.72
21 July 2022 (refund from 
Barclaycard account to bank 
account)Credit £456.72 Debit £456.72
28 July 2022 Debit £400 Credit £400
15 August 2022 Debit £288.75 Credit £288.75
Cash in/out £1,145.43  cash out £1,145.47  cash in
Therefore, the cash paid out of Mr Hs current account was the same as paid into his 
Barclaycard account. The figures Ive set out show that there wasnt an amount of £1,000 
missing from Mr Hs Barclays current account or Barclaycard account. Therefore, I do not 
uphold this part of Mr Hs complaint.
Its not clear if the double payment of £456.72 caused the confusion. Barclaycard explained 
that the reason for this was that the direct debit was taken for that amount, and Mr H also 
made a manual payment  but as can be seen, this was refunded a few days later.
Mr H showed us a photo of his Barclays current account which showed a debit of £1,365.63. 
Ive considered whether this is relevant to his complaint.  But in correspondence between Mr 
H and our investigator, he set out his understanding of the transactions between his current 
account and Barclaycard account for the period Ive shown  so I have looked his complaint 
on that basis.
Barclaycard have agreed that some of the quality of their call handing caused some 
inconvenience for Mr H  several calls dropped out. Barclaycard apologised for that. But I 
agree with our investigator that it is reasonable to ask Barclaycard to pay compensation of 
£50. I accept that Mr H feels that more should be done, but Im satisfied that my final 
decision here is the correct one. (continued)
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. Barclays Bank UK PLC trading as Barclaycard must:
Pay compensation of £50 for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2023.
