The complaint
Miss N complains that MoneyGram International Limited (MoneyGram) released funds 
intended for her, to an unknown third party.
What happened
Miss N says that her sister, who lives abroad, sent her 1057.39 USD through MoneyGram 
(plus a processing fee) when she experienced some financial difficulty. Miss Ns sister 
provided Miss Ns name and the country she wanted funds to be transferred to and was 
provided with a unique transaction code that would be needed to collect the funds. The 
receiver would also need to provide ID.
When Miss N went to collect the funds, she was told they had already been picked up. Miss 
N is unhappy that this has happened and has asked MoneyGram for a refund. She is also 
unhappy that MoneyGram hasnt provided her with any information about where in the UK 
the funds were collected, by who and what ID was used or surveillance footage to show who 
withdrew the funds. Miss N believes she was at work when the funds were collected. 
MoneyGram says that an individual who identified themselves as the intended receiver of 
the transaction visited a MoneyGram location in the UK on 18 January 2021 and completed 
a receive form requesting the payment of funds. The correct reference was provided, 
together with required identification (in this case a passport) so MoneyGram was 
contractually required to release the funds. MoneyGram says it isnt required by its terms 
and conditions to retain a copy of the passport. The agent that released the funds in the UK 
searched for the transaction on its system by the reference number and it isnt possible to 
search by any other attribute. 
MoneyGram also explained that the sender only needs to supply the receivers name and 
the country to send funds to. Its agents dont know what the receiver should look like and 
this is why the recipient is required to provide the reference and the name of the sender. 
Our investigation so far
The investigator who considered this complaint didnt recommend that it be upheld. In 
summary, she said that MoneyGram acted fairly and in accordance with its terms and 
conditions when it released the payment. 
Miss N didnt agree with the investigators findings. She said:
- Fraud has taken place and this service is allowing it to happen.
- If the funds had come from a different country the outcome would be different.
- Nobody else has ever had her identity details except her and she has evidence that 
she was in a different place when funds were collected. In the circumstances, she 
needs to see the identification used and CCTV footage of when the funds were 
collected.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
And where there is a dispute about what happened, and the evidence is incomplete or 
contradictory, I reached my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other words, on what 
I consider is most likely to have happened in light of the available evidence. 
Having done so, my review of the evidence has led me to the same overall conclusion as the 
investigator and I will explain why. But first, I need say that the outcome doesnt depend on 
whether Im persuaded the funds were fraudulently collected but whether I think MoneyGram 
has done anything wrong. 
From the information I have seen Im satisfied MoneyGram was provided with the unique 
reference number which was only known to MoneyGram, Miss N and her sister, and with a 
passport that met MoneyGrams identification requirements. MoneyGram hasnt retained a 
copy, and its terms dont require it to. 
So the most likely explanation here is that the collection details were compromised or 
intercepted somewhere along the way. I havent seen any evidence as to how that might 
have happened. Ive based my decision on whether MoneyGram took reasonable care to 
release the funds to the correct person and followed the correct process in doing so.
MoneyGram knew an individual called Miss N was due to collect some money in the UK. An
individual arrived at one of its collection points, with photo identification matching the name
of Miss N and who knew the individual transaction reference number. Taking this into 
account, Im satisfied the MoneyGram agent followed the correct process when paying out 
the money. I appreciate a fake identification may have been used, as Miss N has explained it 
wasnt her who collected the money. But Im satisfied MoneyGram wasnt required to take a 
copy of the passport, so I havent seen any details of the passport that was used when the 
payment was collected and cant provide Miss N with any further details about it. 
I would expect MoneyGram to take reasonable care in checking the identification presented 
to it. Having said that, I dont think its reasonable to expect every MoneyGram agent to be 
an expert in identifying passport forgeries. As the agent didnt raise any concerns, I think its 
more likely than not the passport appeared genuine.
I think its reasonable for MoneyGram to expect the recipients personal details, along with
the reference number will only generally be known to the intended recipient of a
transfer. And I dont consider theres anything in this case that indicates MoneyGram could 
have known this information had been obtained fraudulently. I also understand why Miss N 
would like to see CCTV footage, but I dont think it would be helpful here given 
MoneyGrams requirements for funds to be released. 
Overall, Im satisfied MoneyGram followed its procedures when handing over the money to
the individual collecting it. I say that because the individual was able to provide the
information MoneyGram needed (and which are set out in its terms and conditions) and had 
photo identification matching the name of the intended receiver. The requirements are the 
same whichever country the funds have been sent from. 
Im very sorry for what Miss N has been through, and that shes found herself without this
money. But I havent seen sufficient evidence to persuade me that MoneyGram ought to
have known the person collecting the funds wasnt Miss N or was doing so fraudulently.
My final decision
For the reasons I have set out above, I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss N to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 March 2022.
