The complaint
Mr and Mrs M complain that First Holiday Finance Limited has rejected the claims that 
theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr and Mrs M entered into an acquisition agreement in July 2003 to buy some holiday club 
membership points. The purchase price of the points was £14,213 and there was a trade-in 
value of £6,300 so the balance due from them was £7,913 which they paid using credit 
provided by First Holiday Finance. First Holiday Finance says that the credit was repaid in 
May 2004 and that its relationship with Mr and Mrs M ended then. 
Mr and Mrs M complained to First Holiday Finance in January 2020 that the holiday 
company wasnt authorised to act as a credit broker. First Holiday Finance said that the 
holiday company had the relevant licenses when brokering finance. Mr and Mrs Ms 
representative then made a complaint to this service in March 2021 about a number of 
issues, including that the holiday company wasnt authorised to arrange the credit, the 
membership had been misrepresented to Mr and Mrs M, no credit checks were carried out 
and the interest rate was high  and it referred to an overseas court judgment about the 
structure of the group of companies that included the holiday company. This service 
forwarded that complaint to First Holiday Finance and it said that it had responded to Mr and 
Mrs Ms query about the authorisation, all relevant checks at the time of Mr and Mrs Ms 
purchase were completed, its relationship with them ended in 2004 and it didnt accept their 
complaint.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Ms complaint should be upheld. He 
thought that First Holiday Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of their 
misrepresentation claim to turn it down. He didnt think that Mr and Mrs M were able to make 
a claim under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 but he thought that First 
Holiday Finance was also entitled to rely on the timing of the claim to turn it down. He said 
that he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr 
and Mrs M.
Mr and Mrs Ms representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst other 
things, that:
Mr and Mrs Ms claim is a speciality so section 8 of the Limitation Act 1980 is 
applicable;
issues were concealed from Mr and Mrs M at the point of sale and the 
misrepresentations were fraudulently made so the limitation period is extended under 
section 32 of the Limitation Act;
the transitional period for a section 140A claim doesnt preclude the assessment of 
unfairness taking account of the matters of a related agreement, even if the related 
agreement came to an end before the transitional period; and
First Holiday Finance was required to assess Mr and Mrs Ms creditworthiness before 
arranging the credit.
It has also referred to a decision on another complaint concerning the marketing practices of 
the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Ms complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr and Mrs Ms complaint is that First Holiday Finance turned down the claims that 
theyd made to it and those claims were made under sections 75 and 140A of the 
Consumer Credit Act;
section 140A was introduced under the Consumer Credit Act 2006 and came into 
effect in 2007 but it doesnt apply to loans that started before 6 April 2007 and ended 
before 6 April 2008;
First Holiday Finance says the credit was provided to Mr and Mrs M in July 2003 and 
was repaid in May 2004 when its relationship with them ended  Ive seen no 
evidence to show that the credit agreement continued after May 2004 so I dont 
consider that section 140A applies to the credit that First Holiday Finance provided to 
Mr and Mrs M and Im unable to consider a complaint about its response to their 
section 140A claim  even if section 140A was applicable, I consider that any claim 
under section 140A in these circumstances would be time-barred under the 
Limitation Act;
I accept that Mr and Mrs M referred their complaint about First Holiday Finances 
response to their section 75 claim to this service within six years it turning down their 
claim - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to that claim;
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not First Holiday Finances 
response to that claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr and Mrs Ms claim under section 75 is that the holiday club membership was 
misrepresented to them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to them - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, First 
Holiday Finance would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was 
brought outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would 
be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr and Mrs M could have made a claim to the holiday company or 
First Holiday Finance about the misrepresentations that they say induced them into 
buying the membership points in July 2003 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made to them and any loss would have been 
incurred as that was when they also entered into a credit agreement with First 
Holiday Finance;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or First Holiday Finance  but they didnt complain to First Holiday Finance 
until January 2020 and a claim under section 75 wasnt made until March 2021, 
which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that 
their claim under section 75 is now time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Ms representative says that Mr and Mrs Ms claim is a specialty so 
section 8 of the Limitation Act is applicable  but its provided no evidence to show 
that their claim is a specialty and Im not persuaded that its likely in these 
circumstances that their claim is a specialty;  
Mr and Mrs Ms representative says that Mr and Mrs M only became aware that they 
could make a misrepresentation claim to First Holiday Finance after they took legal 
advice - but when they had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist them for the 
purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of 
that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the 
cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr 
and Mrs Ms claim;
Mr and Mrs Ms representative says that information was deliberately concealed from 
Mr and Mrs M and that the misrepresentations were fraudulently made to them so the 
time limits are postponed under section 32;
section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been 
deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the 
debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have 
been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a 
breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate 
concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
I dont consider that Mr and Mrs M, or their representative, have set out what the 
false statements of fact were that they say could amount to fraudulent 
misrepresentations and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
theres been a deliberate concealment of any relevant information in these 
circumstances - I consider that many of the things that Mr and Mrs M say werent 
right ought reasonably to have been known to them at the time of the sale - so I dont 
consider that section 32 is applicable in these circumstances; 
Mr and Mrs M say that the holiday company acted as an unauthorised broker  but 
First Holiday Finance says that the holiday company had the requisite authorities in 
place under its Office of Fair Trading licence and Im not persuaded that Mr and Mrs 
M, or their representative, has provided enough evidence to show that the holiday 
company acted as an unauthorised broker in arranging the credit for Mr and Mrs M;
Mr and Mrs M say that no credit checks were carried out by First Holiday Finance 
and their representative says that it was required to assess their creditworthiness 
before arranging the credit for them  but First Holiday Finance says that all relevant checks at the time of Mr and Mrs Ms purchase were completed and that the credit 
was repaid in May 2004 - Ive seen no evidence to show that the credit wasnt 
affordable for Mr and Mrs M when it was made available to them or that theyve 
experienced any financial difficulties since then;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs M asked First Holiday Finance for any 
information about its credit checks before March 2021  as the credit was made 
available to them in July 2003 I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them 
to have raised any concerns about the credit checks before then and I consider it to 
be more likely than not that any complaint about the credit checks or the affordability 
of the credit would now be time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Ms representative has referred to an overseas court judgment which 
commented on the unlawful structure of a group of companies which included the 
holiday company  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
the structure of those companies was unlawful and I consider that any such claim 
would now also be time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Ms representative has referred to a decision made by this service 
concerning the marketing practices of the holiday company but this service considers 
each complaint on its individual merits and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that Mr and Mrs M were unduly pressured into buying the 
membership points or entering into a credit agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable commercial practices against them  no complaint was made to 
First Holiday Finance until January 2020 and I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect them to have complained to it about any such issues before then;
I consider that First Holiday Finances response to Mr and Mrs M claims was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs M for the issues that theyve had with their holiday club 
membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require First Holiday Finance to refund to them any of the money that they 
paid under the acquisition agreement, to pay them any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ms complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M and Mrs M to 
accept or reject my decision before 2 January 2023.
