The complaint
Mr G complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA acted unfairly when it said he would need 
a mobile phone in order to log into his account.
What happened
Mr G has a PayPal account and has done so for several years.
Mr G says he couldnt log into his account after PayPal made changes to its processes in 
November 2020. He says those changes meant he needed a smartphone in order to receive 
one-time passcodes (OTPs) which hed in turn need in order to log in. He said he was 
visually impaired and so didnt have a mobile. Mr G complained to PayPal in January 2021 
saying that it was discriminating against him, and visually impaired and elderly people 
generally.
PayPal investigated Mr Gs complaint and said that it had made changes to its processes in 
order to implement strong customer authentication. PayPal also says it emailed Mr G to 
explain that it offered alternative ways of receiving OTPs, including an automated call to 
customers landlines. Mr G says he never received an email from PayPal explaining that if 
offered landlines as an alternative option. So, he complained to us saying that PayPal was 
discriminating against him and others.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Gs complaint and said that they didnt think PayPal 
had acted unfairly as theyd seen evidence that PayPal had emailed Mr G explaining that it 
offered alternative ways of receiving OTPs, including an automated call to customers 
landlines. Mr G didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to look into his complaint. So 
thats what Ive done.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal made changes to its processes in order to implement strong customer authentication 
 an important measure to combat fraud. Mr G complained about those changes because 
PayPal explained to its customers that in order to log into their account theyd sometimes 
need to receive an OTP which would be sent to their mobile phone. He complained because 
he doesnt have a mobile  I accept that he doesnt. Hes visually impaired. I dont think it 
was unreasonable of PayPal to implement strong customer authentication  as Ive already 
mentioned its an important measure to combat fraud. And I dont think Mr G believes this 
was unreasonable. His complaint is about PayPal relying on mobile phones to deliver OTPs.
Had PayPal only offered one way to receive OTPs, namely on a mobile phone only, then Id 
agree with Mr G that this would be unfair, particularly on him. Had it done so, it would also 
not be in line with guidance the FCA has issued on what it expects of payment service 
providers when they implement strong customer authentication. But I dont agree that this 
was the only option PayPal offers  it offers a number of alternatives including an automated 
landline call. Thats an option that Mr G has told us would work for him. Theres a dispute 
about whether or not PayPal emailed Mr G to let him know about this alternative. I am, 
however, satisfied that Ive seen a copy of that email. In the circumstances, I agree with our 
investigator that this complaint ought not to be upheld. 
My final decision
My final decision is that Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 October 2022.
