The complaint
Ms S says Short Term Finance Limited (STF) lent to her irresponsibly. She says she was in 
a debt spiral and couldnt afford the loan repayments. She thinks that STF shouldnt have 
lent to her.

Our adjudicator partly upheld the complaint. She said that STF hadnt done anything wrong 
when it approved loans 1 to 5. She thought the checks it made couldve been better for loan 
5, but she didnt have enough from Ms S to say this loan was unaffordable. She thought STF 
should pay compensation for loans 6 to 25 as the lending pattern itself looked harmful.  
STF disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It said that it didnt think it did anything wrong 
in the way it dealt with Ms S, and it adhered to all of the regulations that were applicable at 
the time. It went on to say that it properly assessed her circumstances before lending.
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms S could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that STF should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Ms S complaint in part and have explained why below.
Ms S didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 5. Because of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Ms S had with STF. So, 
they are something I will take into account when considering the other loans she took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 6 to 25 because I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of STFs lending 
history with Ms S, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which STF should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so STF should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Ms S case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point STF ought to have realised Ms S was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Ms S had taken out six loans over 17 months. So STF ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Ms S was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying her previous loans was leaving in her finances and that Ms S 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ms S first loan was for £200 and loan 6 was for £400.  At this point STF ought to 
have known that Ms S was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her 
income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Right from the outset Ms S was provided with a new loan within a few days of settling 
a previous one. And she sometimes had more than one loan running at the same 
time. 
And going forward Ms S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed 
STF. Loan 25 was taken out over five years after Ms S first. Ms S had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to STF over an extended period.
I think that Ms S lost out because STF continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms S indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended for shorter term use over an extended period of 
time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Ms S borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Ms S ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 to 25 and STF should put things right.
  
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms S from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Ms S may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Ms S in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Ms S would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Im satisfied 
it has done wrong and should put right.
STF shouldnt have given Ms S loans 6 to 25.
A) STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms S towards interest, fees 
and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where applicable, but 
not including anything it has already refunded.
B) STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms S 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms S originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) STF should pay Ms S the total of A plus B.
D) The overall pattern of Ms S borrowing for loans 6 to 25 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Ms S credit file. If STF 
has sold any of the loans STF should ask the debt purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. STF should give Ms 
S a certificate showing how much tax STF has deducted, if she asks for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Ms S complaint.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2021.
