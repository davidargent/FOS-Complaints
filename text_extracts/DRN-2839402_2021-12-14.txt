The complaint
Ms B is unhappy with how NewDay Ltd handled her request for a refund for flights she had 
booked using her credit card.
What happened
Ms B booked flights with a travel agent who I will refer to as T. The outbound flight was 
booked for 18 March 2020 with a return date of 9 April 2020. The total cost of the flights was 
£1,289.14.
On 16 March 2020 Ms B said she tried to call T but was unable to get through, so she 
emailed it instead. She explained that she was due to travel in a few days but given that the 
UK government began issuing guidance on restricting movement, in light of the Covid-19 
pandemic, she didnt believe it would be safe for her to travel. And so, she requested a full 
refund for the flights. 
T responded on 3 April 2020 to say that whilst Ms B could make changes to her flights, Ms B 
may need to speak with her travel insurance provider to claim any money back for a refund. 
Ms B responded to say she didnt consider the proposal reasonable and still wanted a full 
refund. She continued to correspond with T but didnt receive any responses back. Ms B 
also emailed and phoned the airline directly. She said she was told the flights shed booked 
had been cancelled and the flight cost had already been refunded to T in March 2020. Ms B 
was unhappy as T hadnt informed her about this at any stage.
Ms B contacted NewDay to ask it to help get her money back on 8 April 2020. NewDay sent 
her a disputed transaction disclaimer form to complete. On 27 April 2020 Ms B emailed 
some further information back to NewDay but didnt provide the disclaimer form. NewDay 
sent a chaser to Ms B on 29 April 2020 for the disclaimer form, and whilst it received further 
evidence from Ms B, it still didnt receive the disclaimer form. 
On 4 May 2020 Ms B emailed NewDay attaching the disclaimer form as requested. A 
chargeback was then processed on 6 May 2020 by NewDay and a temporary credit was 
applied on 21 May 2020. The amount appeared on Ms Bs June 2020 account statement. 
Ms B continued to email NewDay saying she was unhappy with the delays, was looking for 
an update and asked NewDay to speak to her daughter. On 21 May 2020, after receiving Ms 
Bs authorisation, NewDay spoke to Ms Bs daughter and explained the progress of the 
chargeback claim and how it had been raised successfully. 
On 24 May 2020 Ms B emailed again asking for an update and also for information NewDay 
had on her complaint. On 10 June 2020, Ms B requested a copy of NewDays complaints 
process. She explained why she was unhappy with its handling of her chargeback claim and 
how neither her or her daughter had been updated or contacted. 
NewDay sent an acknowledgement letter on 3 July 2020 to Ms B. On 4 July 2020, Ms B 
emailed NewDay to say it had failed to respond to her and asked it to forward a copy of all 
the information it held on her regarding her complaint and its complaints procedure.
A response was sent by NewDay explaining it had already sent an acknowledgement, with 
the complaints procedure to her home address on 3 July 2020. It provided Ms B with a 
complaint case reference and asked if she wanted all the information related to her 
complaint, and if so, it could submit this request as a General Data Protection Regulations 
information request, or otherwise known as a Data Subject Access Request (SAR).
On 7 July 2020, Ms Bs account was permanently credited with the cost of the flights, as T 
didnt defend the chargeback, with the funds then being transferred to her current account.
On 10 July 2020 Ms B asked who had logged her complaint and asked for the SAR to be 
processed. She also said if the chargeback matter was resolved by then, then NewDay 
potentially may not need to forward this to her.
On 13 July 2020 NewDay responded to say it had submitted her SAR. It also said it had 
eight weeks to investigate her complaint, and that a response would be provided, but this 
wouldnt be by email. There continued to be an exchange of correspondence between Ms B 
and NewDay about her complaint. 
On 22 July 2020 NewDay sent an update letter advising it was sorry, but its investigation 
was taking longer than expected. Ms B then contacted our service on 25 July 2020 because 
she didnt receive a response to her complaint.
On 6 August 2020, NewDay sent its final response letter to Ms B. NewDay in summary said 
her claim had taken a long time to resolve and she wasnt always contacted as requested. It 
apologised and credited her account with £40 for the trouble and inconvenience caused.
In relation to the SAR, which was requested by Ms B in July 2020, NewDay explained that it 
had sent this to her email address on 13 August 2020. Ms B explained she hadnt received 
this, so NewDay sent a further email on 30 December 2020, with details on how to access 
the information under the SAR. Ms B emailed on 31 December 2020 to say as nothing had 
been received again, she wanted a response from NewDays data protection officer.
A final response letter for the SAR was sent on 13 January 2021. NewDay said the previous 
SAR request had been sent to an incorrect email address held on the account. However, 
NewDay explained that this incorrect email address had been present on Ms Bs account 
records since 2015 and was the same one used for when her account was registered for its 
online account manager services. NewDay went on to say that the first email from 13 August 
2020 hadnt been opened and it had since taken steps to ensure her information couldnt be 
accessed via this email. NewDay acknowledged its error and sent the information by post to 
Ms B and awarded her £70 compensation for the error.
Ms B remained unhappy and referred her complaint to our service. When our investigator 
looked at the complaint she thought whilst there appeared to be an initial delay in the 
chargeback being raised, NewDay was waiting for further information from Ms B, which she 
thought was necessary. Once NewDay received this information, the investigator thought it 
had progressed the chargeback and applied a permanent credit without any unreasonable 
delays. 
With regard to Ms B requesting updates and not always receiving the service she should 
have received, the investigator felt NewDays £40 compensation offer was fair. In relation to 
the SAR and the error with the email address, the investigator thought the additional £70 
offered by NewDay was also fair.Ms B disagreed with the investigators view. In summary, she said NewDay didnt update her 
and was unwilling to speak to her daughter. She said she didnt receive the letters NewDay 
claimed to have sent, and NewDay had also admitted the SAR was incomplete and therefore 
failed to comply with the request. She also mentioned how she felt her complaint shouldve 
been logged earlier than it was.
The investigator provided further clarification and evidence to demonstrate NewDay had 
spoken to her daughter with her authorisation and had kept her updated. For any other 
shortcomings she still felt the £40 offer was fair. In terms of the SAR the investigator 
explained the Information Commissioners office was the correct organisation to look at any 
failings NewDay had done in relation to the SAR and the £70 NewDay had offered was fair.
As Ms B remained unhappy with the investigators view, the case has now been referred to 
me to make a final decision on.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered everything very carefully, Ive reached the same conclusion as our 
investigator. 
Ms B has made a number of points, but were an informal dispute resolution service, set up 
as a free alternative to the courts. In deciding this complaint Ive focused on what I consider 
to be the heart of the matter rather than commenting on every issue in turn. This isnt 
intended as a discourtesy to Ms B. Rather it reflects the informal nature of our service, the 
remit of the Financial Ombudsman Service and my role in it.
It might be helpful if I start by explaining that in some cases, a bank may be able to request a 
refund from the supplier through the chargeback scheme. This is a way in which payment 
settlement disputes are resolved between card holders and suppliers/merchants. They are 
dealt with under the relevant card scheme rules and in this case thats Mastercards. In 
certain circumstances the process provides a way for NewDay to ask for a payment Ms B 
made to be refunded. Those circumstances include where goods or services arent supplied 
by the company Ms B paid. 
Theres no obligation for a card issuer to raise a chargeback when a consumer asks for one. 
But I would consider it good practice for a chargeback to be attempted where the right exists 
and there is reasonable chance of success. 
In this case, it appears that Ms B wasnt provided with the service that she originally paid for. 
And in normal circumstances, it would seem reasonable to expect NewDay to raise a 
chargeback for her, as Im satisfied that this scenario is one that is covered within 
Mastercards chargeback rules. 
Its not unusual for a chargeback to take some time to process. It can take time for a bank to 
gather the correct and necessary information needed to raise the claim, and the chargeback 
rules also require banks to give suppliers time  usually around a month - to respond to any 
chargeback raised, in case they want to dispute it. 
I can understand that this whole experience was worrying and stressful for Ms B. Shed paid 
for flights, and from what shes said, the experience with T wouldve caused her anxiety 
when it offered her the chance to only change her flights to a future date, and not a full 
refund, and then later stopped communicating with her. But I cant hold NewDay responsible for any of this and ultimately it was T who caused the initial problems here when it didnt give 
her money back when it seems it should have. 
I also need to take into account that these werent normal circumstances; it was an 
unprecedented and unusual time for the banks, when Ms B first contacted NewDay, dealing 
with significant numbers of enquires from consumers looking to get money back as the 
global pandemic unfolded. Many of these claims will have brought up issues which were 
relatively novel, and the banks were having to digest new information, rules and guidance at 
a very unusual time. And many firms faced operational challenges during this period.
Although both Ms B and NewDay have confirmed that the chargeback was ultimately 
successful, and Ms B received a full refund for the flights, Ms B has made a number of 
comments regarding the poor service she received from NewDay. She has spoken about the 
delays with her chargeback being raised, not being kept updated when requested, not 
receiving NewDays update letters, and NewDay failing to comply with the SAR request.
I will deal with each of these concerns in turn:
Delays with raising the chargeback
Ms B first contacted NewDay to raise a chargeback dispute in April 2020. NewDay explained 
that whilst it logged the chargeback in April 2020, it couldnt progress this further without the 
disclaimer form, which it only received from Ms B on 4 May 2020. Once this was received, it 
processed the chargeback two days later, on 6 May 2020, and applied a temporary credit on 
her account on 21 May 2020. The temporary credit was then made permanent in July 2020 
when T didnt defend the chargeback. 
I appreciate Ms B has questioned the disclaimer form NewDay was relying on and explained 
that she provided information to NewDay when it was requested. However, having reviewed 
all the emails and correspondence between her and NewDay, I am firstly satisfied that the 
disclaimer form was only sent by Ms B on 4 May, and secondly that NewDay had processed 
the chargeback without causing any unreasonable delays following receipt of the form. 
Whilst I appreciate Ms B had provided other information to NewDay, prior to the disclaimer 
form being sent on 4 May 2020, with all that was going on, I can understand why in this 
particular case NewDay mightve needed to stick to a strict process, to ensure the efficient 
operation of refunding claims. 
NewDay in its initial letter sent to Ms B, explained how to proceed with the investigation and 
refund her claim, it required Ms B to complete the form, to support her claim. NewDay sent a 
chaser letter when it hadnt received the form, and once Ms B sent this, it processed the 
chargeback two days later and applied a temporary credit around two weeks after. So, all in 
all from when Ms B first contacted NewDay and provided all the relevant and required 
information, she was waiting just under a month for a temporary credit to be applied, which 
was then made permanent after T didnt defend the chargeback. And so, I cant agree that 
NewDay caused any unreasonable delays when processing the chargeback.
Not being kept updated 
Ms B has expressed her unhappiness at how NewDay didnt keep her updated and didnt 
speak to her daughter when she requested. Having reviewed all the evidence and system 
notes, I am satisfied that overall NewDay did keep her updated with her chargeback claim. I 
can see that the investigator provided Ms B a copy of the screenshot notes of 
communication between her and NewDay, and from this it can be seen that on 21 May 2020, 
after receiving Ms Bs authorisation, NewDay spoke to her daughter and explained the progress of the chargeback claim and how it had been raised successfully. And so, I am 
satisfied that Ms Bs daughter, who Ms B gave authorisation for NewDay to speak to, knew 
her chargeback claim had been processed and would have been made aware about what 
was happening with the chargeback claim and the next steps too.
Although I am satisfied NewDay did keep Ms B updated overall, I can see that when she 
raised a complaint with NewDay, and was contacting it for updates, NewDay sometimes took 
a little longer to respond to her emails. There was also some confusion and delays caused 
because of the email address Ms B was using to ask NewDay for updates. 
However, I can see that NewDay in its final response letter also agreed that she was not 
always contacted when requested and provided her £40 as compensation for this. I also 
consider £40 to be fair and reasonable in the circumstance of the complaint. 
I appreciate Ms B has explained that she didnt receive all the acknowledgement and update 
letters NewDay claims to have sent her. However, NewDay has provided evidence to show 
that these letters were sent at the address it held on file for her, which is Ms Bs current 
address. And so, I am satisfied these letters were sent by NewDay and that it did 
communicate and try and keep her updated throughout the process. 
SAR
Ms B has explained that NewDay failed to comply with her SAR request, but my role isnt to 
penalise NewDay it if has committed any potential breaches of information rights law. 
Rather, Im deciding how NewDay handled Ms Bs request for information  and the impact 
on her if it didnt provide this, how or when it was supposed to. 
NewDay doesnt dispute it made an error  it acknowledged that it responded to Ms Bs SAR 
request initially, and although this was sent to the email address it had on file for her from 
2015, and from when her account was registered for online account manager services, this 
email address was later found to contain a mistake. I appreciate that following contact from 
Ms B, and NewDay updating her email address, Ms B has now received the response to her 
SAR, albeit later than it should have been from when she first raised her initial SAR request.
Ive thought about the impact on Ms B of having to wait to receive what shouldve been sent 
earlier and also for the SAR being sent to another email address. However, Ive also given 
consideration to the fact that NewDay recognised its error, apologised for how it handled her 
SAR, took appropriate steps to ensure information from the previous SAR couldnt be 
accessed, and offered £70 compensation to recognise the trouble and upset caused to Ms 
B. And taking everything into consideration, I think this is a fair and reasonable amount of 
compensation to reflect the distress and inconvenience caused to Ms B.
Although I appreciate Ms Bs strength of feeling about how NewDay handled things, Im not 
persuaded any further compensation needs to be made in respect of the error for the SAR. 
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, my final decision is that the £110 compensation NewDay 
Ltd offered to pay Ms B is fair and reasonable and I make no further awards. 
On Ms Bs acceptance of this decision, NewDay Ltd should pay Ms B this sum if it hasnt 
already.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 January 2022.
