The complaint
Mr K complains that National Westminster Bank Plc mis-managed the interest rate on his 
account.
What happened
Mr K has a Business Term Loan secured by a commercial mortgage over business premises 
with NatWest which he took out in 2008 and is to be repaid in 2033. The loan amount was 
£166,650. The interest rate is 1.50% above Base Rate and the original monthly repayments 
were £1,121.58 when the base rate was 5%. Mr K complains that when the Bank of England 
Base Rate changed that he got no correspondence from NatWest as to how this would affect 
his account. So, when the base rate went down, this didnt transfer automatically to changes 
in his interest rate but when the base rate went up, the interest rate that NatWest applied to 
his account increased. 
Mr K also says that NatWest provided inadequate information to assess how his account 
was managed. Mr K also feels that the loan servicing account or Sole Trader Business 
Current Account which he had to pay for was mis-sold as he only used it to repay the loan 
and says that he could have used an account that didnt charge a fee.
NatWest says that when the Base Rate changes it would advise Mr K and tell him to contact 
the bank should he want to change his repayments. The bank says that the repayments 
arent automatically amended if the base rate changes and that the loan was on track to be 
repaid in 2033. NatWest agreed that it should not have charged for the business current 
account which Mr K only used to repay the loan and not for trading purposes and refunded 
all the charges incurred from June 2010 of £667.00. 
NatWest said that in 2020 it reviewed this account in line with a remediation project to 
ensure that this loan was on track to be repaid by the maturity date and that loan 
repayments had been amended along with Base Rate movements. NatWest said that it 
wrote to Mr K in October 2020 to tell him the loan was on track.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld as she felt that 
NatWests system would have meant that Mr K was informed of the Base Rate changes. Mr 
K disagrees and says that his main complaint with NatWest were the delay in applying the 
Bae Rate changes which were mainly decreases.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr K has a number of complaints about the way NatWest managed his account. As I 
understand it Mr Ks main complaint is that when there was a Base Rate change  and Mr 
Ks interest rate was related to the Base Rate, NatWest didnt tell him about it. He also 
complains about the way it implemented the changes. If there were increases it would 
implement them immediately and if the Base Rate decreased there would be a time lag until 
the new payment was put in place.
Mr Ks initial complaint was that NatWest didnt tell him that the Base Rate had changed as it 
should have done under the terms of the mortgage offer. I note that in his email to us of 4 
July 2022 that the complaint is somewhat different in that Mr K says that he was aware of 
the Base Rate changes but that the changes were implemented only after he chased the 
relationship manager. NatWests position is that it informed Mr K of the Base Rate changes 
and left it to Mr K to contact it if he wished to have the standing order amended. Usually, I 
could investigate this with the help of the contact notes in relation to the matter, but NatWest 
havent kept any.
In this case I can look at firstly whether, accepting what Mr K says, did he suffer any financial 
detriment because of what NatWest did? It seems that NatWest was concerned that its 
process of leaving the decision on the repayments to Mr K would have led to the mortgage 
being underpaid but in October 2020 NatWest went through a remediation exercise and 
confirmed that the account, apart from a small underpayment, was on track to be repaid by 
2023. The underpayment was credited by NatWest. So, theres no evidence that NatWests 
actions led to an underfunding of the mortgage so that the mortgage wasnt on track to be 
paid or that Mr K had been overfunding the mortgage and depriving himself of money that he 
could use elsewhere. 
Mr K also says that he was treated unfairly because NatWest increased his payments when 
the Base Rate rose but didnt decrease them when the Base Rate fell. During the course of 
the mortgage, I can see that there were interest rate changes on eleven occasions and the 
standing order was amended on seven occasions. That would suggest that the standing 
order wasnt automatically changed by NatWest but left for Mr K to amend. And how would 
Mr K know to amend the standing order if, as he says, NatWest didnt make him aware of 
the Base Rate changes? Again, that would suggest Mr K was made aware of the changes 
as does his complaint about the delay in response from the relationship manager. From my 
observations of these changes, its not always the case that Mr K increases his payments 
when the Base Rate increases. For example, Mr K was paying £696.36 per month from 23 
August 2016 until 25 June 2018 although there was a Base Rate increase on 2 November 
2017 and at that time no increase in his payments. My view is that NatWest is likely to have 
made contact with Mr K to advise him of the Base Rate changes and that it was left to Mr K 
to contact NatWest to amend his payments. So. I dont uphold that part of the complaint. 
In his email of 4 July 2022 Mr K says that when he contacted the relationship manager that 
there were delays in NatWest implementing the change to his repayments because of the 
change in the Base Rate. Ive already established that Mr K didnt suffer a financial loss 
because of this. Of course, Mr K could have suffered some distress and inconvenience 
because of that but I note that Mr K didnt feel it necessary to make a complaint at the time 
when there were these delays so I cant fairly say that his inconvenience was such that 
would lead us to award compensation for it. I note that NatWest fully repaid Mr K all charges 
that he paid on the trading account and that seems fair compensation although I see that 
there is some suggestion that it was in fact used for the collection of rent. But, for the above 
reasons I cant fairly uphold this complaint.    
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold your complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 February 2023.
