The complaint
K complains that its business bank account and associated overdraft facility was unfairly 
terminated by National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest).
What happened
K held a business bank account with NatWest for several years and had an overdraft facility 
of Â£7,500. In September 2022 NatWest reviewed Ks account and contacted its director, 
Mr R. Ks account was referred to NatWests Specialist Business Management team to 
review and discuss with Mr R due the reduced business activity. 
At the end of September 2022 NatWest contacted Mr R to say Ks overdraft facility would be 
removed in a month and requested contact to discuss repayment options. Mr R spoke with 
NatWest and gave some background, explaining why there was a reduced level of activity 
on the account. NatWest discussed Mr Rs circumstances and options but no way forward 
was found. 
At the beginning of October 2022 NatWest requested an income and expenditure 
assessment from Mr R along with documents showing Ks finances and projections for future 
income. Paper forms were sent to Mr R to complete on 24 October 2022. 
Mr R requested an extension to 22 November 2022 to respond which was agreed. But on 23 
November 2022 NatWest contacted Mr R again to explain the overdraft would be removed 
and requested contact. 
Further extensions were agreed and on 13 December 2022 Mr R advised he was waiting for 
information from Ks accountant. An overdraft extension was approved by NatWest to end on 
1 February 2023 to allow Mr R time to respond. A further extension was agreed by NatWest 
which ended on 15 February 2023. 
On 22 February 2023 NatWest issued a termination notice and request for repayment of the 
outstanding balance. Mr R spoke with NatWest on 3 March 2023 and NatWest requested the 
income and expenditure assessment. But NatWest says the required information wasnt 
provided so on 28 March 2023 a final demand was issued requiring the full overdraft balance 
to be repaid within seven days. NatWests letter explained that if the balance wasnt repaid 
by 5 April 2023 a default would be registered. 
NatWest says it received the income and expenditure assessment from Mr R on 10 April 
2023. Mr R says the information was supplied around three weeks earlier but not uploaded 
to his account. 
The account was ultimately closed by NatWest and Mr R raised a complaint on Ks behalf. 
NatWest issued a final response but didnt agree it had made an error by terminating Ks 
account. NatWest said it had granted several extensions before closing Ks account and said 
it needed the income and expenditure assessment and supporting documents to check 
whether the overdraft could be extended. NatWests final response said no income and 
expenditure assessment had been supplied by Mr R. 
Mr R referred Ks complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They said 
NatWests final response had incorrectly claimed Mr R had failed to return the income and 
expenditure assessment. The investigator said NatWests evidence showed the information 
had been supplied on 10 April 2023 but, by that point, it was too late to stop it requesting the 
full balance of Ks overdraft. The investigator didnt uphold Ks complaint. 
Mr R asked to appeal and said hed had difficulties with Ks accountant which impacted his 
ability to respond to NatWest. Mr R asked to appeal, so his complaint has been passed to 
me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware Ive summarised the events surrounding this complaint in less detail than the 
parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by my approach which reflects the informal 
nature of this service. I want to assure all parties Ive read and considered everything on file. 
Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every point raised to fairly reach my decision. And if 
I dont comment on something, its not because I havent considered it. Its because Ive 
focused on what I think are the key issues. My approach is in line with the rules we operate 
under. 
NatWest says it took the step of reviewing Ks business account after the level of activity 
dropped and a lack of business related credits were made. The review was completed 
around September 2022 and from that point, NatWest asked Mr R for income and 
expenditure assessments along with supporting information regarding Ks finances. I 
appreciate Mr R has told us he experienced delays in receiving information from Ks 
accountant and that impacted his ability to respond. But the information as originally 
requested in October 2022 and NatWest didnt take the step of formally terminating Ks 
account until April 2023, around six months later. I can see NatWest agreed to extend the 
deadline on several occasions to allow time for the required information to be supplied. And I 
think that shows NatWest was willing to work with Mr R on Ks behalf to see whether it could 
continue to provide an overdraft facility. Im sorry to disappoint Mr R but I havent been 
persuaded that NatWest acted unfairly in the way it requested information from him about K. 
The business account terms and conditions confirm the overdraft facility can be reviewed by 
NatWest to see whether it can be extended. The terms allow NatWest to ask for further 
documentation to verify affordability and also say the overdraft is repayable on demand. The 
terms go on to say that if the overdraft facility isnt extended, NatWest can demand 
immediate repayment in writing. So whilst I understand Mr R wanted NatWest to extend the 
overdraft facility, Im satisfied NatWests terms allowed it to complete a review and ultimately 
take a decision to withdraw it and demand repayment. 
Mr R has told us that he was able to supply the required information but it wasnt reviewed 
by NatWest in time to stop the account being terminated. But NatWests records show the 
income and expenditure assessment was received on 10 April 2023 and by that time it was 
too late for the account to avoid closure. I appreciate why Mr R wanted to agree an 
extension to Rs overdraft facility, but Im satisfied NatWest provided fair opportunity for the 
required information to be supplied before taking the step of terminating the account and 
overdraft facility. As NatWest wasnt able to complete the necessary review, despite 
providing several extensions, Im also satisfied it was reasonable for it to terminate Ks 
account and overdraft facility. Mr R has queried how the closure of Ks business account will impact his credit. Weve been 
given a copy of Mr Rs credit file and Ks business account isnt shown. The business 
account was set up in the name of K, a limited company. So it doesnt show on Mr Rs 
personal credit file. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr R but as Im satisfied NatWest allowed reasonable time for 
the information it needed to be supplied before taking the step of terminating Ks business 
account and overdraft facility I havent been persuaded it acted unfairly. As a result, Im not 
upholding Ks complaint. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ks complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask K to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 September 2023.
