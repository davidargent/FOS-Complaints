K821x#15Complaint
Mr F (by way of a representative)  says Elevate  Credit International Limited (trading as 
Sunny) failed to identify that he had become dependent on payday  loans  and had become 
stuck in a cycle of borrowing. 
Background
Mr F took out a running credit facility  and 28 instalment loans between July 2014  and 
July 2018. A summary of Mr Fs borrowing, based on the information  provided to us by 
Sunny, can be found in the appendix  at the end of this decision.
In our adjudicators most recent findings,  she thought the checks  Sunny carried out before 
granting Mr Fs facility were proportionate.  But she felt the way Mr F used his facility, should
have caused Sunny concern. She thought Sunny should have stopped  allowing  Mr F to 
drawdown from 1 December 2014 and halted any further borrowing going  forwards  which 
included loans 2-25. And from loan 6, she thought Mr Fs pattern of lending suggested he 
couldnt sustainably  repay his loans.
 
However, our adjudicator  didnt think Sunny was wrong to provide Mr Fs last four loans 
(loans 26-29). She explained that Mr F didnt request further loans from Sunny for two years  
after repaying loan 25. 
Mr F agreed  with our adjudicators most recent  findings. 
Sunny made an offer for loans 6-25. The offer was to refund  the interest on these loans 
along with 8% simple  interest and to amend Mr Fs credit file. But Sunny didnt respond to 
our adjudicators most recent  recommendations about loans 2  5 and the RCF drawdowns  
from December 2014.  
As no agreement could be reached  the complaint has been passed  to me for a final 
decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to reasonably 
conclude Mr F could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN51627332the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
To begin with, Sunny  has already accepted that something may have gone wrong when 
loans 6  25 were given to Mr F. And Mr F has accepted  our adjudicators  opinion  about the 
checks completed at the start of his RCF (loan1) and loans 26-29  that Sunny wasnt wrong 
to approve them.
As loans  6-29 are no longer in dispute  I have  no reason to reach any findings  about them  in 
this final decision.  However, I have included these loans in the section where I direct Sunny 
as to what it needs to do to put things right for Mr F.
The relevant  regulations  in place at the time Mr F was given  his RCF (loan  1)
When Mr F had this facility, Sunny was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA). The consumer  credit sourcebook (section  6.7.2) says: a firm must monitor the 
customers repayment record  and take action where  there  are signs of actual or possible 
repayment difficulties. So Ive thought about whether Sunny did enough to monitor the 
facility was it was approved.
Our adjudicator thought Sunny shouldve seen this by the time Mr F applied for his 16th 
drawdown on 1 December 2014.  By this point,  our adjudicator thought  that Sunny would 
have seen that Mr Fs borrowing history showed  he was potentially  reliant on the facility.
I dont think Sunny had a cause for concern about the way Mr F used his facility at the very 
start of the relationship. Mr F repaid his full balance of £232.86 at the beginning of 
September 2014 but went on to drawdown £250  two days later. This suggests Mr F may 
have potentially been struggling financially resulting in him needing  to access  further funds 
available to him within a few days. I think this is something which should have put Sunny  on 
notice. 
However, this is where Mr Fs borrowing  started to become  more  frequent, drawing up to his 
full credit limit. Mr F repaid his balance in full a few weeks later weeks  but proceeded to 
request his full limit again within the same month. To me, this suggested he was struggling 
to meet  the repayments and his normal monthly  living costs without the need to keep  
borrowing the same  amount he repaid.
Mr F went on to repeat  the same behaviour as before by repaying  what he owed and then 
requesting his full credit  balance within a few weeks. Mr F had used his account  this way on 
three occasions. When he repaid what he owed at the end of November 2014  and went  on 
to start the same pattern  of behaviour by requesting a drawdown three days later on 
Ref: DRN516273331 December 2014, this is where  Sunny should have halted any further  lending.  
What appears to have  happened is that Mr F was borrowing further  from Sunny  in order  to 
fill a hole in his finances that was made by making repayments to Sunny. And so this isnt a 
sustainable form of borrowing.
As Ive explained above, Sunny was required to monitor Mr Fs account  and step in where  
financial difficulty became  apparent. From 1 December 2014,  I think Sunny should have 
halted any further drawdowns but it didnt. So Im upholding Mr Fs complaint about his 
running credit facility (loan 1) from 1 December 2014.
Loans 2-5
Mr F repaid his running credit facility on 23 January 2015. But around two weeks  later,  he 
had requested an instalment loan from Sunny. From what we know  about  Sunny,  it stopped  
allowing drawdowns  on the running credit  facility product and started providing instalment 
loans instead.  So effectively, Sunny approving  any further loans  was the same as still 
allowing Mr F to continue  drawing down on his running credit facility.
Ive explained  the reasons why Sunny shouldnt have allowed Mr F to continue drawing 
down on his running credit facility  with a £500  credit limit. And I can see Mr F was exhibiting  
the same  pattern of behaviour by applying for these four instalment  loans  worth  £500 within 
the month of February 2015. So Im also upholding Mr Fs complaint about loans 2-5 for the 
same reasons.
Putting things  right  what  Sunny needs to do
In addition to what Sunny has already  agreed  to do:
refund  all interest and charges Mr F paid on drawdowns from 1 December 2014 
and refund all interest and charges  on loans  2-25.
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  from Mr Fs credit file about his running  credit
facility from 1 December  2014 and loans  2-5. 
remove loans 6 - 25 from Mr Fs credit file entirely. This is because  the period of time 
Mr F owed Sunny money means that any information still recorded  about these loans 
is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN51627334My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr Fs complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  pay Mr F compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 May 2020.
