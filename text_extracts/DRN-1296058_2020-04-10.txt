*combined repayments on overlapping loans
Miss C complained that Sunny didnt carry out reasonable and proportionate checks. She 
said if it had done, it wouldve realised she was reliant on payday loans and couldnt afford to 
repay loans in a sustainable way. 
Our adjudicator didnt feel that hed seen enough to say it was unfair for Sunny to provide 
loans 1 - 4 to Miss C. But he thought that loan 5 onwards shouldnt have been lent to her  
and he explained how hed come to this view. Our adjudicator also gave some detailed instructions about the way he thought Sunny 
should settle the complaint. 
When Sunny looked at Miss Cs complaint, it said that it had carried out full affordability 
checks on all the loans and it didnt uphold Miss Cs complaint. 
What I've decided - and why 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss C could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Miss C could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Cs complaint.Ive looked at what it appears Miss C told Sunny about her financial circumstances and the 
repayment amounts she had to make for loans 1  4. Taking this information into account, 
and bearing in mind that this was early on in her lending relationship with Sunny, I dont think 
it wouldve been proportionate for Sunny to ask Miss C for the amount of information that 
would be needed to show the lending was unsustainable before agreeing these loans. 
These loans all looked affordable for Miss C, based on what shed said to Sunny about her 
finances - even taking into account the combined monthly repayments. So I agree with our 
adjudicator that there isnt enough information for me to be able to say that Sunny shouldnt 
have lent Miss C any of the first four loans. 
Like our adjudicator, I dont agree it was reasonable for Sunny to provide loan 5. At this 
point, I think Sunny shouldve realised that it was clear from looking at Miss Cs borrowing 
history that she was likely having money problems. 
I say this because by the time she asked for loan 5, Miss C already had three other 
outstanding short term loans with Sunny  and now she was asking for further borrowing. 
Ive taken into account that loan 5 was for just £50  a relatively small loan compared to the 
other loans Miss C had taken out. And Sunny had recorded that Miss C had declared 
disposable monthly income of £640 when she asked for loan 5. But even so, taking out this 
loan on top of loans 2, 3 and 4 (which had all started within the last two weeks) meant that 
Miss C now owed £550. This suggests to me that Miss C was finding it hard to get on top of 
her money problems and her financial difficulties were likely ongoing  and escalating.   
Although the loan mightve appeared affordable, I think that Sunny shouldve realised that 
Miss Cs borrowing record painted a picture of someone struggling with debt. And despite 
what shed told Sunny about her finances, it showed that Miss C was having serious 
problems managing her money. So Sunny shouldve seen that the indications were that 
loan 5  and any further lending, wasnt likely to be sustainably affordable for Miss C. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Cs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
Miss C wasnt managing to repay her loans sustainably - she had taken out 6 loans 
in the 6 months or so since shed first borrowed from Sunny. Even allowing for the 
gap between loans 1 and 2, I think this was a sign that she was having money 
problems 
 
whilst she had repaid some loans early, she was taking out loan 6 just eleven days 
after paying loans 2, 3, 4 and 5
 
the loan amounts went up and down  but loan 6 was for twice as much as loan 5 so 
the signs were that she was struggling with debt. 
 
I think that Miss C lost out when Sunny provided loan 6 because:this loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Cs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time. 
 
the number of loans Miss C borrowed was likely to impact adversely on her ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept Miss C in the market for high-cost loans. By 
loan 6 any further borrowing was likely to be detrimental to Miss Cs credit rating. 
 
So Im upholding Miss Cs complaint about loan 5 onwards.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do 
A) add together the total of the repayments made by Miss C towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 5 - 9, but not including anything already refunded
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss C which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss C originally made the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled
C) pay Miss C the total of A plus B
D) remove any adverse information Sunny recorded on Miss Cs credit file in relation to 
loan 5. The overall pattern of Miss Cs borrowing for loans 6 - 9 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans entirely from Miss Cs 
credit file. 
*HMRC requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. If Miss C asks Sunny for a 
certificate showing how much tax has been taken off, Sunny should provide this. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Miss Cs complaint about loans 5 - 9. 
Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) should take the steps Ive set out 
above to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 May 2020.
