The complaint
Ms X is unhappy with how PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA dealt with a claim against a 
transaction she made. 
What happened
In December 2018, Ms X purchased goods from an online retailer using her PayPal account. 
But she says she didnt receive what she ordered  she ordered three pairs of adult shoes 
but only received one pair of baby shoes. Ms X raised a claim with PayPal in April 2019 and 
PayPal denied her claim for a refund. And the retailer say that, when Ms X returned the baby 
shoes to them, the box was empty.
Ms X has complained that she didnt get the goods she ordered and paid for, and PayPal 
have refused to refund her what shed paid.
Our investigator said that PayPal had acted reasonably. He said the evidence showed the 
items Ms X had ordered were sent to her and signed for at the address shed given. And 
there was no evidence to support exactly what Ms X had returned to the retailer. Because of 
this the investigator said PayPay had acted within its terms by refusing to refund Ms X the 
amount she paid the retailer.
The investigator also said we were only able to look into what PayPal had or hadnt done. 
We couldnt consider the actions of the retailer, as they didnt fall under our jurisdiction.
Ms X didnt agree with the investigator. She says never received the goods and that she was 
experiencing personal issues which meant she couldnt raise the issue with the retailer until 
March 2019. But she raised her claim with PayPal within the six months she has to do so. 
And she feels that, if the retailer received an empty box, this is down to the delivery company 
(she used the retailers official return service) and not herself.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having reviewed the evidence, while I 
appreciate this will come as a disappointment to Ms X, I agree with the investigators findings 
on this complaint for broadly the same reasons. And if I havent commented on any specific 
point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right outcome.
This complaint stems from a dispute between Ms X and an online retailer, about what was or 
wasnt delivered, and about what was or wasnt returned. Its not my role to say whether Ms 
X received the shoes she ordered, or whether she returned what she said she did. My role is 
to consider whether PayPal acted reasonably when dealing with this dispute.
Ive seen a copy of PayPals terms and conditions. These say that, in order to resolve a 
problem between a buyer and retailer, PayPal requires:The Payment Recipient to present evidence to PayPal in a timely manner that the Payment 
Recipient delivered to / performed for the buyer the purchase as agreed with the buyer, even 
where the purchase is not eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection  If the payment Recipient 
does not present such evidence in a timely manner, PayPal may find in favour of the buyer. 
If the Payment Recipient presents such evidence in a timely manner, PayPal may find in 
favour of the Payment Recipient even if the buyer claims to have not received the purchase.
PayPal have provided the evidence they received from the retailer, and this shows the shoes 
were sent out by two tracked deliveries, using different couriers. And emails from the retailer 
show these were delivered and signed for on 11 and 12 December 2018. Although the 
person signing for each of these parcels is different, one of them was signed for by someone 
who gave the same name that Ms X commonly uses. 
Because the shoes were dispatched in three separate parcels, using two different couriers, 
and these parcels were all signed for at the delivery address Ms X gave the retailer; PayPal 
concluded that it wasnt possible for Ms X to have only received a single pair of shoes 
(whether these were one of the pairs she ordered or not). PayPal also said that because the 
retailer are a reputable company it would be highly unlikely they would be making a false 
claim about having received an empty box. So they found in favour of the retailer.
Based on the terms and the evidence theyve seen, I agree with the investigator that PayPal 
didnt act unreasonably when they refused to refund Ms X the cost of the goods shed 
ordered.
In her comments on the investigators view, Ms X said shed spent some time in hospital 
during December 2018. So its possible she didnt sign for the receipt of one or both of the 
deliveries. But this isnt enough for me to say that the deliveries werent therefore made  
someone else at the property couldve signed for them.
Ms X has also explained that she found a pair of baby shoes after shed reported the issue 
to PayPal and I guess they might be from {the retailer}, as such a similar situation happened 
before between me and another company. While Ive no doubt, to the best of her memory, 
Ms X returned these shoes to the retailer; three parcels, in two deliveries, were signed for at 
the address she given for delivery, but she only returned one parcel to the retailer. Which 
leaves two signed for parcels unaccounted for.
Given the above, I cant say that the goods Ms X ordered werent delivered, and I cant say 
that all of the delivered goods were returned to the retailer. So theres no compelling 
evidence for me to say that PayPal should reverse their decision and refund the cost of the 
goods to Ms X.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I dont uphold Ms Xs complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl 
& Cie, SCA. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms X to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 June 2020.
