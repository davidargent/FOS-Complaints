The complaint
Miss S complains that Monzo Bank Ltd wont reimburse the money shes lost to a scam.
Whats happened?
Miss S has fallen victim to a cryptocurrency investment scam. She says that a man 
befriended her on a popular social media platform, and, after a while, he suggested that she 
invest in a company which Ill refer to as (A), with his assistance. Between 23 August and   
4 September 2021, Miss S made: 
20 faster payments into her Monzo account from a current account she held with a 
third-party bank which Ill refer to as (H)  totalling £78,305.00.
21 debit card payments from her Monzo account to a cryptocurrency trading account 
held in her name  totalling £78,340.00.
All of the money paid into her cryptocurrency trading account was invested with A.

Eventually, when Miss S ran out of money, the man stopped contacting her and she realised 
shed been scammed. She reported the matter to Monzo in September 2021, and it told her 
that it was unable to instigate chargebacks in this instance because Miss S received the 
service she paid for. Miss S has asked this Service to investigate.
Miss S has said that:
She researched A online and it looked legitimate  it had a compelling website with 
24-hour online customer service.
The man was convincing, professional and knowledgeable  he gave her no reason 
to doubt the investment opportunity. She was vulnerable at the time and she believed 
everything he said.
She had no knowledge of these types of scams and didnt have much experience 
with investments.
She made two small debit card payments to her cryptocurrency trading account from 
her account with H before making payments to A, and these returned some small 
dividends. This convinced her of the legitimacy of the investment opportunity.
It was unusual for her to transfer large amounts of money out of her Monzo account 
in a short timeframe.
She wouldnt have proceeded to make the relevant debit card payments if Monzo 
had told her it was likely she was being scammed.
Our investigator considered all of the evidence and upheld Miss S complaint in part. In 
summary, they said that:
Miss S ought reasonably to have done more to protect herself from financial harm in 
the circumstances, so she should bear the responsibility for 50% of her loss. 
The activity on Miss S Monzo accounts was unusual enough from 23 August 2021 
that the bank ought reasonably to have been concerned and intervened to ensure 
that Miss S wasnt at risk of financial harm. 
If Monzo had intervened, the scam would probably have been uncovered. 
H could also have intervened and uncovered the scam, so Monzo should share 
responsibility for the remaining 50% of Miss S loss with H.
Monzo should refund 25% of all the debit card payments to Miss S cryptocurrency 
trading account as part of this scam. 
Monzo didnt agree with our investigators conclusions. It said:
The debit card payments were authorised and didnt trigger its fraud detection 
system.
Miss S made the debit card payments to a cryptocurrency trading account held in her 
own name, so it had no suspicions of criminal activity.
Miss S case has now been passed to me for a final decision.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account; relevant law 
and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where 
appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time.
It's common ground that Miss S authorised the debit card payments to her cryptocurrency 
trading account. She made the payments using the debit card linked to her Monzo account 
and, even though she was the victim of a scam, and she didnt intend the payments to go to 
a fraudster, the payments were authorised under the Payment Services Regulations. So, 
the starting point is that Monzo had an obligation to follow Miss S payment instructions, and 
Miss S is presumed liable for her loss in the first instance. But thats not the end of the story. 
There are circumstances in which a bank should make additional checks before processing 
a payment, or in some cases, decline to make a payment altogether, to help protect its 
customers from the possibility of financial harm. I consider that Monzo should:
Have been monitoring accounts and payments made or received to counter various 
risks, including fraud and scams, money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that 
might indicate that its customers were at risk of fraud (amongst other things). This is 
particularly so given the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years, 
which banks are generally more familiar with than the average customer.
In some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, have taken 
additional steps or made additional checks before processing a payment, or in some 
cases declined to make a payment altogether, to help protect its customers from the 
possibility of financial harm.
Ive thought carefully about what Monzo has said in terms of the payments made from 
Miss S account as part of this scam. In particular, its said that it wasnt suspicious about the 
payments as they went to another account held in Miss S name. I accept this, but Monzo 
should have been on the lookout for signs that customers were at risk of fraud, not just for 
unusual transactions. Ive looked at Miss S account statements in the months leading up to 
the scam and I think that the activity on her accounts as a whole between 23 August and     
4 September 2021 ought reasonably to have caused Monzo some concern. Before the 
scam, Miss S account was used irregularly for payments  she only made a couple of 
relatively low value payments out of her account. But from 23 August 2021, there was a 
flurry of activity on Miss S account. In a short timeframe, over £78,000.00 was transferred 
into, and out of her account in a number of transactions. Additionally, there were no 
transactions occurring on the account that matched with normal activity in this time. Overall, 
I think the activity on Miss S accounts from 23 August 2021 looks unusual, very suspicious 
and is indicative of fraud. I consider it reasonable to expect Monzo to have intervened in the 
circumstances, to ensure that Miss S did not come to financial harm.
Monzo has said that the debit card payments Miss S made went to her own cryptocurrency 
trading account, so it had no suspicions of criminal activity. But cryptocurrency scams often 
involve money passing through more than one account and they were not uncommon at the 
time. I think Monzo wouldve been aware of this. The Financial Conduct Authority and Action 
Fraud published warnings about cryptocurrency scams in mid-2018. By mid-2021, when the 
scam Miss S fell victim to started, I think Monzo ought to have had time to digest these 
warnings and put mechanisms in place to detect and prevent this type of fraud. And Im 
satisfied that Miss S losses ought to have been within the contemplation of, and foreseeable to, Monzo. Im also satisfied that Monzo can be held responsible for the losses if it could 
have prevented the scam by asking Miss S some further questions about the payments.
It doesnt appear that Miss S was coached by the fraudster, as is often the case with scams, 
so I think she wouldve spoken freely if Monzo had asked her some questions about the 
faster payments into her account and debit card payments out of it. And I think it would most 
likely have become apparent that she was being scammed.
By August 2021, I think Monzo had or ought to have had a good enough understanding of 
how cryptocurrency investment scams work  including that customers often move money to 
an account/s in their own name before it is moved on to a fraudster  to have been able to 
identify the risk of harm from fraud. With its industry knowledge, I think Monzo ought to have 
asked Miss S some probing questions and given her information regarding the prevalence 
and typical features of cryptocurrency investment scams before processing the first debit 
card payment instructed on 23 August 2021. Miss S has said she had no concerns about 
investing with A because it had a compelling website and she had no reason to doubt the 
fraudster, and thats what she may have said if Monzo had questioned her. But I dont think 
the conversation shouldve stopped there. Monzo couldve asked more questions in order to 
determine whether the typical features of cryptocurrency scams were present here (and 
I think they were  Miss S was investing in A according to the advice shed received from a 
stranger that had contacted her via a social media platform and she was passing money 
through other accounts in her own name before sending money to A). And it could have 
provided meaningful advice about cryptocurrency investment scams.
If Monzo had done enough, I think it would most likely have been obvious to the bank and 
Miss S that there was a risk of financial harm, and the scam wouldve unfolded without any 
of the debit card payments being made. Of course, Monzo could also have declined to make 
the payments instructed altogether based on the information it had received if Miss S still 
wanted to go ahead with them despite its warnings and, given the circumstances here, 
I think it wouldve been reasonable for it to do so.
I appreciate that Monzo needs to strike a balance in the extent to which it intervenes in 
payments, against the risk of unduly inconveniencing or delaying legitimate payment 
requests and I wouldnt have expected it to interrogate Miss S. I also acknowledge that the 
main perpetrator here is the fraudster. But overall, I think appropriate questions should 
reasonably have been asked in this case, and if they had been, Miss S wouldnt have 
wanted to go ahead with investing with A, the scam would have unravelled and Miss S 
wouldnt have lost her money.
Ive had the benefit of reviewing the evidence presented in Miss S similar case against H, 
and I think it couldve done more to unravel the scam and prevent the loss of funds that 
passed through the accounts Miss S held with it too (the faster payments). So, overall, I think 
its fair for Monzo and H to share responsibility for Miss S losses, and I have taken a slightly 
different approach to redress than I might normally take considering the individual 
circumstances of this case.
Finally, Ive thought about whether Miss S should bear some responsibility by way of 
contributory negligence. In the circumstances, I think she should bear 50% of the loss she 
incurred. I say this because Miss S has said that the man she met was convincing, 
professional and knowledgeable, he gave her no reason to doubt the investment opportunity 
and, as she was vulnerable at the time, she believed everything he said. Shes also said that 
she looked at As website and it appeared legitimate. But she doesnt seem to have taken 
any substantial steps to independently verify the legitimacy of the investment opportunity 
before paying over large sums of money. I appreciate that she received some small returns 
from the first two debit card payments she made to her cryptocurrency trading account before making payments to A, and that shes said this convinced her of the legitimacy of the 
investment opportunity. But, overall, I dont think she did enough to protect herself from 
financial harm in this case.
For completeness, I will add that banks dont have to raise chargebacks if it looks clear that 
the cardholder would lose. Here, Im satisfied thats the case because Miss S received the 
service she paid for. So, Im not persuaded that Monzo has done anything wrong in this 
respect.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and 
instruct Monzo Bank Ltd to reimburse 25% of all the debit card payments Miss S made to 
her cryptocurrency trading account as part of this scam, and pay 8% simple interest per 
annum from the date of each payment to the date of settlement.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 August 2022.
