The complaint
Mr and Mrs F complain that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) failed to properly look 
into some unrecognised transactions. 
What happened
In November 2019, Mr F noticed three payments of Â£20 had debited his account and then 
refunded around the same time. The payments were to a third party, who Ill refer to as M. 
Mr F was concerned by this as he says hes never shared his card details with M. 
After Mr F contacted NatWest to query this, the bank said it couldnt determine how M was 
able to take a payment from his account. The bank later cancelled Mr Fs card and referred 
him to M, if he wanted to find out how M obtained his card details.
Mr F complained to NatWest because he felt the bank didnt do enough to look into this 
matter. Mr F wanted an explanation as to how the payments were authorised. NatWests 
response explained that M wouldve needed Mr Fs card number, card expiry date and three-
digit security number to debit these payments. The bank explained that the transactions 
didnt trigger its fraud prevention system and added that it didnt need to investigate this 
matter further, given it had already cancelled Mr Fs card and the payments had been 
refunded. 
Mr F remained unhappy and asked this service to get involved. One of our investigators 
decided that NatWest had acted fairly. Mr F didnt agree so the complaint has been passed 
to me for a final review. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I think NatWest acted fairly  Ill explain why.
NatWest says it doesnt have the information to determine how M was able to obtain Mr Fs 
card details. The audit information NatWest has sent to us provides details of how the 
transactions were carried out, so this is something the bank can give more information 
about. Based on this, as the bank points out, Mr Fs card number, card expiry date and 
three-digit security number wouldve been required to complete these payments. But 
NatWest says there is no way for it to establish how Mr Fs card details were made available 
to M.
I can see from listening to a telephone conversation Mr F had about this with NatWest, that 
the bank cited possible ways his card may have been compromised. But it seems this was 
merely speculation and the only way to confirm what had happened was to contact M.
NatWest referred Mr F to M so he could find out this information. Mr F thinks NatWest 
shouldve done this on his behalf and says the bank seemed disinterested to help him given 
it didnt contact M. But I cant fairly conclude that NatWest acted unfairly when it didnt 
contact M. In this instance, theres no relationship between NatWest and M and the bank 
had already done all it could by cancelling Mr Fs card. The payments had already been 
refunded, so there was no loss for the bank to look in to. Moreover, I understand Mr F did 
indeed ask M to look into this matter, but he later decided not to pursue things given hed 
need to share his bank statements with M. So I think NatWest did enough to help Mr F. 
Mr F questions why the bank allowed the payments to process without his consent. But, as 
the bank points out, these transactions were made using Mr Fs card details and this is 
enough to authenticate a payment. The three payments were for a relatively low amount 
and, looking at the other transactions on Mr Fs account  it seems Mr F often made 
payments using his card details  so it wouldnt have seemed unusual that Mr Fs card was 
being used in this way. So I dont think NatWest did something wrong when it didnt check if 
Mr F consented to these payments. 
In summary, I think NatWest acted fairly after Mr F got in touch about the payments he didnt 
recognise. NatWest cancelled the card and there was nothing more for it to do, given the 
payments had already been refunded. I think NatWest acted reasonably when it directed 
Mr F to M if he wanted this issue looked in to further.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F and Mrs F to 
accept or reject my decision before 31 March 2022.
