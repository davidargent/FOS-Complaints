K820x#14complaint
Mrs B complains that Lloyds Bank plc wont refund to her the £508.50 that she paid in 
September 2017 for a high visibility  motorcycling  jacket.
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
In certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit  Act 1974 gives a consumer an 
equal right to claim against the supplier of goods  or services or the provider of credit if 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation  by the supplier. To be able to uphold 
Mrs Bs complaint about Lloyds Bank, I must  be satisfied that theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the jacket  and that Lloyds Banks response 
to her claim  under section  75 wasnt fair or reasonable. Im not determining the outcome of 
Mrs Bs claim under section  75 as only a court would be able to do that.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mrs B bought the jacket  in September 2017 and was able to use it whilst overseas 
and then made a claim to the supplier in September 2018  and then to Lloyds Bank;
she says that it was a reasonable  expectation that the jacket  wouldnt deteriorate  
within nine months and that she took good  care of it but the irregular and faded 
highlighter fabric  is not acceptable   and she wouldnt have bought it if shed been 
advised that it would fade during her travels;
the manufacturer gave a warranty for the practical lifetime of the jacket but said that 
the intensity under  which  the product is used determines its practical lifetime and 
materials will deteriorate  and fade over time;
theres no independent evidence to show that the jacket wasnt of satisfactory quality 
or fit for purpose and Mrs B was able to use the jacket  for nine months;
I can understand Mrs Bs disappointment  and frustration that the high visibility fabric 
on the jacket hasnt  lasted as long as she expected that it would  but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier about the jacket; 
in its final response  letter to Mrs B, Lloyds  Bank  offered  her £50 compensation 
because of some issues with the way that it had dealt  with her complaint  she says 
that she hasnt  accepted any compensation but, if she now wants to accept that offer, 
I suggest that she contacts Lloyds Bank  to see if the £50 is still available  to her; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Lloyds Bank to refund to Mrs B the £508.50  that she paid for the jacket   or to take 
any other action in response  to her complaint.
my final decision
Ref: DRN41538172For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 May 2020.
