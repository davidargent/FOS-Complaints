The complaint
Ms D complains that Starling Bank Limited wont refund to her the money that she paid for a 
watch.
What happened
Ms D made a payment of Â£5,345.72 in October 2020 from her bank account with Starling 
Bank using a payment transfer system to buy a watch from a seller on an internet shopping 
site. The watch was delivered to her address when she was away from home and the 
delivery company left it outside her front door. When she returned home she says that the 
parcel wasnt there. She contacted the seller, the provider of the payment transfer system 
and the delivery company but the seller was able to provide tracking details confirming that 
the parcel was delivered. Ms D then complained to Starling Bank but it said that it wouldnt 
be possible to dispute the transaction through the applicable card scheme because Ms D 
hadnt shown sufficient due diligence in relation to the delivery of the parcel.
Ms D wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She thought that if a chargeback had been 
raised the seller wouldve defended it as it would be able to provide the tracking number to 
confirm delivery. She said that she couldnt fairly ask Starling Bank to do any more as it 
hadnt made any errors in dealing with Ms Ds chargeback dispute. 
Ms D has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has responded 
in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
the delivery company didnt follow its procedure and should have left a delivery card 
instead of a parcel in front of her door and its the sellers duty to contact the delivery 
company for a refund as the delivery contract is with it;
she paid an additional amount for the watch to be insured; and 
the sellers refusing to help and not responding to her so its for Starling Bank to ask 
for a refund for an item non received.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome reached by our investigator for these reasons:
Ms D made a payment from her account with Starling Bank using a payment transfer 
system to pay for the watch  she didnt buy the watch using credit so she cant 
benefit from the protections provided by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974;
if a consumer disputes a card payment, the card issuer may be able to make a 
chargeback claim to the merchant under the relevant card scheme to try to settle the 
dispute;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made but if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules  and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success  I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made (and those rules set out the disputes that can be 
considered and the time limits for making a claim);
the seller has provided evidence from the delivery company to show that the parcel 
was delivered to Ms Ds address and there doesnt seem to be any dispute that the 
parcel was left outside her door  but Ms D says that it wasnt there when she 
returned home;
Ms D contacted the seller  as well as the provider of the payment transfer system 
and the delivery company  about the watch but the seller provided tracking details 
and a photo to confirm that the parcel was delivered to her;
as Ms D had already contacted the seller, I consider that it was likely that the seller 
would have defended any chargeback claim that was made by Starling Bank - and 
Starling Bank said that Ms D hadnt shown sufficient due diligence in relation to the 
delivery of the parcel - so Im not persuaded that there was a reasonable prospect of 
a chargeback claim being successful in these circumstances;
I dont consider that there was any requirement for Starling Bank to make a 
chargeback claim for the payment that Ms D had made for the watch and Im not 
persuaded that it acted unfairly or unreasonably in not doing so;
Ms D says that she paid an additional amount for the watch to be insured but Ive not 
seen enough evidence of that insurance to show whether there would be any 
insurance cover in these circumstances;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to pursue that issue with the 
seller and the delivery company but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that Starling Bank is liable in these circumstances for the loss that Ms D has 
suffered; and
Ms D has described the difficulties that these events have caused her  and I 
sympathise with her for what shes experienced  but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Starling Bank to refund to her the amount that she paid 
for the watch, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ds complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 January 2022.
