The complaint
Miss B complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money lent to her 
irresponsibly.
What happened 
Miss B applied for a credit card with 118 118 Money. 118 118 Money approved the 
application.
Miss B complained that 118 118 Money had lent to her irresponsibly. She said that if 118 
118 Money had carried out proper checks, it wouldve seen that she would struggle to repay 
the credit in a sustainable way.
118 118 Money didnt uphold the complaint, so Miss B brought her complaint to this service.
Our investigator upheld the complaint. He said that 118 118 Money hadnt treated Miss B 
fairly.
118 118 Money accepted the investigators view but Miss B didnt reply so Ive been asked to 
make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to complaints about irresponsible and unaffordable lending is set out on our 
website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering this complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say that 118 118 Money had to carry out reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Miss B could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable way. 
The nature of whats considered reasonable and proportionate will depend on various factors 
including the amount of credit, the total sum repayable, the amount of repayments and the 
consumers individual circumstances.
Theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. But lenders are required to consider 
the factors Ive mentioned above when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate.
118 118 Money didnt respond to this service when it was asked to provide information about 
the check it completed before approving the application. So Ive only been able to consider 
the information provided by Miss B.
Based on what Ive seen, Miss B had several credit accounts where she had defaulted on 
payments at the time she applied for the credit card. She was also using her overdraft facility 
regularly and had exceeded her overdraft limit.
Taking this into account, I think if 118 118 Money had carried out reasonable and 
proportionate checks, it wouldve seen that Miss B was unlikely to be able to sustainably 
repay the credit. Im of the view that 118 118 Money treated Miss B unfairly when it lent to 
her. 
Putting things right
To put things right, 118 118 Money should rework the account and remove all interest, fees 
and charges.
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Miss B together with 8% 
simple interest per year calculated from the date of each overpayment to the date of 
settlement.* 118 118 Money should also remove all adverse information regarding the 
account from Miss Bs credit file.
If, after the rework, there is an outstanding balance, 118 118 Money should agree an 
affordable repayment plan with Miss B. Once Miss B has cleared the balance, any adverse 
information regarding the account should be removed from her credit file. 
*HMRC requires 118 118 Money to deduct tax from this amount. It must give Miss B a 
certificate showing how much tax has been taken if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 
Money must take the steps Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 June 2023.
