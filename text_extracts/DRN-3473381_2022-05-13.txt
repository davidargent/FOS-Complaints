The complaint
Ms B complains that Morses Club PLC (Morses) gave her loans she couldnt afford to repay.
As a result of these loans, Ms B says she was forced into a long-term cycle of debt.
What happened
Ms B was advanced 21 home collected loans between September 2014 and November
2020. Ive included some of the information weve received about these loans in the table 
below.

Following a complaint by Ms B to Morses it issued its final response letter in 
October 2021. In it, Morses explained that loans 10, 12, 13, 16 and 17 shouldnt have been 
provided and it offered compensation to settle these loans.
Ms B didnt accept this offer and instead referred the complaint to the Financial
Ombudsman.
The case was then reviewed by an adjudicator. He didnt think it was wrong for Morses to 
have granted loans 1 and 3. But the adjudicator thought loans 4 and 5 shouldnt have been 
provided because of the number of other outstanding loans at the time. And from loan 6, he 
thought the pattern of lending was now harmful for Ms B, so all future loans should be 
upheld as well.
Ms Bs appears to have accepted the adjudicators findings.
Morses partially agreed with the adjudicators assessment and it agreed to uphold and pay 
compensation for loans 6 - 18. Morses offered to settle the complaint in line with the 
adjudicators assessment which would result in a refund of £4,913.29.
But it disagreed with the adjudicators assessment in relation to loans 4, 5 and loans 19 - 21. 
In summary, Morses said;
There is a gap in lending of three months between Ms B repaying loan 3 and when 
loan 5 was advanced, which Morses feels this is sufficient to show there is a break in 
the lending chain.
There is also a gap of around 8 months between loan 17 being repaid and when 18 
loan was advanced.
Although, Morses says that at loan 18, Ms B had poor disposable income it feels 
there are separate lending chains.
None of Ms Bs loans were settled late and the loans Morses has defended all show 
disposable income which indicates the loans were affordable.
Morses didnt issue any arrears letters and it wasnt aware of any financial difficulties 
Ms B may have been having.
Morses offer for loans 6  18 was put to Ms B but she didnt accept it because she said
loans 19  21 should also be included within the redress.
The complaint was then passed to me when no agreement could be reached and I then 
issued a provisional decision explaining why I was still intending to uphold Ms Bs complaint 
but I was just not upholding as many loans as the adjudicator. 
A copy of the background to the complaint and my provisional findings follow this in smaller 
font and in italics and this forms part of this final decision.
What I said in my provisional decision
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant 
rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Ms B agrees with our adjudicators findings that Morses wasnt wrong to lend loans 1  3. So, it seems 
this lending isnt in dispute and so I no longer think that I need to make a finding about it. But I have 
kept these loans in mind when thinking about the overall lending relationship between Morses and Ms 
B.
Morses has also accepted that something went wrong when loans 6  18 were granted, and it offered 
to put things right for Ms B in line with the adjudicators recommendations. So, like loans 1 - 3, these 
loans are no longer in dispute, but for completeness Ive included what Morses need to do to put 
things right in the putting things right section at the end of the decision.
Instead, this decision will focus on whether Morses did anything wrong when it granted loans 4, 5 and 
loans 19 - 21.Morses had to assess the lending to check if Ms B could afford to pay back the amounts shed 
borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was proportionate to the 
circumstances. Morsess checks couldve taken into account a number of different things, such as 
how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and Ms Bs income and expenditure.
With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have 
been proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Morses should have done more to establish that 
any lending was sustainable for Ms B. These factors include:
Ms B having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Ms B having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time 
(reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or 
was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms B coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also suggestive 
of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms B.
Morses was required to establish whether Ms B could sustainably repay the loans  not just whether 
she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money to make the 
repayments could of course be an indicator that Ms B was able to repay her loans sustainably. But it 
doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue
difficulties and in particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without 
having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows that it 
should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and thought 
about what this means for Ms Bs complaint.
Loan 4
When this loan was advanced Ms B declared that she had a weekly income of £331.15 with weekly 
outgoings of £64. Leaving disposable weekly income of £267.15. So, Morses may have felt that this 
was sufficient disposable income to afford the repayment for loan 4 of £5.
However, when loan 4 was approved, loans 1  3 were still running so Ms Bs declared
weekly commitments to Morses was actually £25 per week. This was a significant increase on the 
initial weekly commitment for loan 1 that Ms B had of £5.
As the adjudicator has pointed out, he thought this loan ought to not have been granted
because at the time that loan 4 was granted Ms B had three other loans running with Morses at the 
same time.
Ive thought about this and I do agree with the adjudicator. Part of what Morses was required to do 
was to see whether the loan was actually affordable, and I think for this loan it was reasonable, based 
on what Ms B had declared to show the loan was affordable.
But, by the time that loan 4 had been approved, loans 1  3 were still running and shed
taken on average a new loan each month. In my view, the number of loans running
concurrently, the fact that none of Ms Bs loans to date had run to term and yet she still
needed to return for further borrowing. In my view ought to have led Mores to beconcerned about the possibility that Ms B was likely having problems managing her money given the 
need to continuing need for further credit.
In the circumstances of this case, I think Morses ought to have realised that this loan wasnt 
sustainable for Ms B and therefore it shouldnt have been granted.
Loan 5
The adjudicator upheld this loan for similar reasons as loan 4, but given the lending history it looks 
like to me there may have been a change in Ms Bs circumstances.
Loans 1  4 had now all been fully repaid and as Morses has pointed out there was a break of around 
3 months from when loan 3 had been settled to when Morses granted loan 5. This is important, in the 
context of the lending to date.
This to me shows, that Ms B wasnt needing further funds during this period so I dont think I can fairly 
uphold loan 5 for the same reasons as the adjudicator when the lending pattern had changed, and 
there was a gap where no loans were advanced.
Ms B had been indebted to Morses for 8 months and then hadnt returned for any further loans for 
another three. However, loan 5 was the largest capital loan to date with the highest weekly repayment 
 and Morses needed to think about that when deciding what it needed to do in order to make sure it 
carried out a proportionate check before the loan was advanced.
Ms B had declared similar income and a slight increase in her outgoings to now £150 per week. When 
this loan was approved Morses may have believed that Ms B had sufficient disposable income.
And I cant fairly uphold this loan due to Ms B having outstanding loans with Morses when we know 
this not to the be the case so Ive re-considered this loan afresh.
But that doesnt mean that Morses carried out a proportionate check. Ive already explained some of 
those factors that Morses was aware of at the time this loan was approved, for example it was Ms Bs 
largest loan to date. Thinking about these factors, I cant fairly say a proportionate check has been 
carried out.
Overall, I dont think it was reasonable for Morses to have relied on what Ms B declared to it about her 
income and expenditure. Even though this information suggested Ms B could afford the loan 
repayments.
Instead, I think it needed to gain a full understanding of Ms Bs actual financial position to ensure this 
loan was affordable. This couldve been done in several ways, such as asking for evidence of 
outgoings, or looking at bank statements and/or Ms Bs credit report. This mightve helped verify 
information provided and revealed whether there was any other information that Morses mightve 
needed to consider about Ms Bs general financial position.
However, that isnt the end of the matter. For me to be able to uphold this loan, I have to be satisfied 
that had Morses carried out a proportionate check it wouldve likely discovered that Ms B couldnt 
afford the loan.
Ms B hasnt provided the Financial Ombudsman with a copy of her bank statements or her credit 
report. So, I dont know what further checks may have highlighted about her financial situation at the 
time these loans were approved.
What I do know, after Ms B told us about it and after receiving a letter from the official
receiver is that Ms B had been discharged from bankruptcy in March 2014. This is some 18 months 
before this loan was approved, and I dont think, this on its own is sufficient to uphold the complaint 
given that Ms B was for example no longer under the terms of the bankruptcy order.
So, without any further information from Ms B about her living costs at the time, its difficult for me to 
conclude what Morses wouldve seen had it made better checks. Although Morses didnt carry out proportionate checks, Im not able to conclude that further checks wouldve led it to conclude that 
these loans were unaffordable for Ms B.
Looking at everything together though, Ive not seen quite enough evidence to suggest
Morses shouldnt have lent loan 5. Even considering what Ms B declared to Morses for her income 
and expenditure. Im not minded therefore to think Morses was wrong to have provided these loans.
As this is the case, Im intending to not uphold Ms Bs complaint about this loan.
Loans 6  18
As I said above, Morses has already agreed with the adjudicators assessment as well as making the 
offer that it did in the final response letter. Therefore, these loans are no longer in dispute, and as I 
said above, I no longer need to make a finding on them.
Loans 19  21
In response to the adjudicators assessment Morses said these loans should be treated as part of a 
new lending chain, this is because there is a gap between Ms B repaying loan 17 and taking loan 18 
of around eight months.
Morses conclusions where that because of this gap, and the creation of a new lending chain, it 
wouldnt be fair to conclude that these loans were inherently unsustainable for
Ms B because of the time she spent in debt, the number of loans in this chain and the fact that there 
were no signs of financial difficulties.
It is of course possible, that in some cases as Morses points out that 8 months is a
significant amount of time to show that firstly, a new lending chain had started and secondly would 
show the loans were unsustainable. However, in the circumstances of this case, I dont think I can 
fairly conclude that there is a new lending chain.
While I can see that there is a gap, I cant ignore what went on before that break. Ms B had taken 17 
loans in a three- and half-year period  a not insignificant period of time. With the loans steadily 
increasing in capital value as well as length of time that they were due to be repaid over.
Immediately, after the break Ms B returned for another large loan of £1,000 to be repaid over a year. 
And when loan 19 was granted, this loan remained outstanding meaning
Ms Bs commitment to Morses was £49 per week. In these circumstances, given what went on before 
I dont think the gap in this case isnt enough to have re-set the chain of borrowing.
There is of course a question as to whether this means the loans are no longer sustainable for Ms B. 
But, given the fact that this loan overlapped with loan 18 and Morses has already accepted loan 18 
shouldnt have been granted due to the poor disposable income Ms B declared at the time. I dont 
think that I can ignore or not consider whether loans 19  21 were advanced in a sustainable manner 
to Ms B.
The loan being pounds and pence affordable is only part of the consideration. So, I havent felt the 
need to recreate individual, proportionate affordability checks for this loan because I didnt consider it 
necessary to do so. Although, I accept, based on what Morses provided the Financial Ombudsman 
Service, that this loan wouldve looked affordable to it. Even though Ms Bs declared expenditure was 
significantly less compared to what she declared for loan 18.
So, in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to
Ms B, Morses also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded
during the course of its lending relationship with Ms B.
Having looked at the overall pattern of Morsess lending history with Ms B, I agree with our adjudicator 
that at this point in time, Morses should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided these loans. I say this because;At this point Morses ought to have realised Ms B was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Ms B had taken out 19 loans in almost six years and she had been indebted to 
Morses for almost for the entire time. So Morses ought to have realised it was more likely 
than not Ms B was having to borrow further to cover an ongoing need and that Ms Bs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably and her underlying financial situation didnt seem 
to be improving.
By loan 19, Ms Bs weekly repayments were £49 per week compared to £5 a week for loan 
one. So, Ms Bs weekly repayments had and were increasing which suggests that the loans 
werent sustainable for her and her borrowing didnt significantly decrease  indeed by loan 
20 Ms B was paying Morses £56 per week.
While loan 19 was slightly smaller than loan 18, this loan was running at the same time, so as 
I said above, her weekly commitment to Morses had actually increased.
 Ms B had a history of taking new on the same day as previous loans were repaid for example 
loans 13, 20 and 21. Morses ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms B, on these 
occasions, was having to borrow further to effectively cover a long-term financial need. To 
me, this is indicative of her indebtedness not being sustainable.
I think that Ms B has lost out because Morses continued to provide borrowing because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Bs indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit over an extended period of time.
 the number of loans and the length of time over which Ms B borrowed was likely to have had 
negative implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost loans.
So, Im intending to uphold the complaint about loans 19  21 as well.
Morses has already accepted that it needs to put things right for Ms B in relation to loans 6 - 18 and 
Ive included what it has already agreed to do to put things right in the section below.
Response to the provisional decision
Both Morses and Ms B were asked to provide anything further for my consideration as soon 
as possible, but no later than 6 May 2022. 
Ms B responded to say that she had received the provisional decision and didnt have 
anything further to add. 
Morses hasnt responded to the provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Ms B nor Morses has provided any further information or additional comments for 
me to consider I see no reason to depart from the findings that I reached in the provisional 
decision and for the same reasons. 
So, I still think Morses shouldnt have advanced loan 4 and loans 6  21 for the reasons 
given in the provisional decision. 
Ive outlined below what Morses should do in order to put things right. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Morses should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what mighthave happened had it not provided loan 4 and stopped lending to Ms B from loan 6, as Im
satisfied it ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms B may have simply left matters there, not
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative 
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Ms B in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Ms B would more likely than not have taken up any one of these
options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Morses liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
Morses shouldnt have given Ms B loan 4 and loans 6 to 21.
A. Morses should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms B towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans.
B. Morses should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms 
B which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms B originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Morses should pay Ms B the total of A plus B.
D. Morses should remove any adverse information reported about loan 4 Ms Bs credit 
file. The overall pattern of Ms Bs borrowing for loans 6 - 21 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Ms Bs 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to deduct tax from this interest. Morses should
give Ms B a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in my provisional decision, Im upholding Ms Bs 
complaint in part.
Morses Club PLC should put thing right for Ms B as directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 June 2022.
