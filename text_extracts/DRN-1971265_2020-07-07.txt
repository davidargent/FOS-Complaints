Our adjudicator thought the loans from loan 5 onwards shouldnt have been given. Mr 
Lender didnt agree, but made an offer on loans 10 to 15. Miss M rejected this so the 
complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Miss M could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into 
account a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment 
amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early 
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
    the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of 
time during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that 
repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to 
establish whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this 
is the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be 
able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should 
realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make 
their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in 
this context and what this all means for Miss Ms complaint.
Mr Lender has shared the checks it carried out for affordability and creditworthiness 
before agreeing to lend to Miss M. I have found nothing to indicate Mr Lender needed to 
do more when it approved loans 1 to 4. And I have seen nothing in the information it 
gathered that I think should have led it to make different lending decisions. So I dont 
think Mr Lender was wrong to give loans 1 to 4 to Miss M.
However, like the adjudicator, I dont think that the checks Mr Lender completed for loan 5 
were proportionate. This was Miss Ms fifth loan in six months, taken out only six days after 
repaying loan 4, and I think Mr Lender shouldve carried out a fuller financial review to be 
sure that Miss Ms borrowing was sustainably affordable. Ive looked at copies of Miss Ms 
bank statements to see what better checks would have shown. I can that Miss M was 
frequently borrowing from a number of short term lenders, and she was spending a 
signifcant amount on what seem to be gambling transactions. So I dont think, as a 
responsible lender, that Mr Lender would have thought it was most likley Miss M would 
repay her loan sustainably had it carried out better checks. At this stage Mr Lender should 
have stopped lending to Miss M, at least until it had evidence that her finances had 
stabilised. And I cant see it had this when it approved loan 6. So I think it was wrong to give loans 5 and 6 to Miss M. 
Ive then looked at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders lending history with Miss M, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender should reasonably have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Mr Lender should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ms case, I think that this point was reached at 
loan 7. I say this because:
At this point Mr Lender ought to have realised Miss M was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss M had taken out seven loans within seven months. So Mr 
Lender ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss M was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loans was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Ms indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ms first loan was for £150 and loan 7 was for £250.  At this point Mr Lender 
ought to have known that Miss M was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 7 onwards Miss M was provided with a new loan within days of settling a 
previous one. 
Miss M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Mr Lender. Loan 15 
was taken out 15 months after Miss Ms first. And it was for four times the amount. 
Miss M had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Mr Lender 
over an extended period.
I think that Miss M lost out because Mr Lender continued to provide borrowing from 
loan 7 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ms indebtedness by 
allowing her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an 
extended period of time.
the number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Miss 
Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding the complaint about loans 5 onwards, and Mr Lender should put 
things right.
Putting things right  what Mr Lender needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss M paid on loans 5 to 15;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information about loans 5 and 6 from Miss Ms credit file
the number of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so all entries about loans 7 to 15 should be removed from 
Miss Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender must give Miss M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Ms complaint. PDL Finance 
Limited (trading as Mr Lender) should pay Miss M compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 August 2020.
