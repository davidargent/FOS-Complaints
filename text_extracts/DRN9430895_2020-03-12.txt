Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ls complaint  and thought  the loans  from loan four onwards 
shouldnt have been given. 
Uncle Buck  disagreed, but made an offer on loans eight and nine, but Mr L didnt accept this, 
so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN94308952the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan four would  most  likely have 
shown that Mr L was having  problems  managing  his money.
At this time, Mr L had at least three other  short-term  loans with different  lenders, Uncle  Buck 
shouldve realised that it was unlikely that he would be able to pay this or any subsequent 
loans sustainably.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Uncle Bucks lending  history with Mr L, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Uncle Buck should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Uncle  Buck should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
seven. I say this because:
At this point Uncle Buck ought to have realised Mr L was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr L had taken out seven  loans within  thirteen months, so Uncle 
Buck ought  to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr L was having to borrow  
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Ls indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr Ls first loan was for £100  and loan seven  was for £200. At this point  Uncle Buck 
ought to have known that Mr L was not likely  borrowing  to meet  a temporary  shortfall 
in his income but to meet an ongoing  need.  
From  loan seven onwards Mr L was provided  with a new loan within days  of settling a 
previous one. 
Ref: DRN94308953Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed Uncle  Buck. Loan nine 
was taken out nineteen months  after Mr Ls first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr L 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Uncle Buck  over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr L lost out because Uncle  Buck continued to provide borrowing from loan 
seven onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr L borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ls ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans four to six and loans  seven to nine and 
Uncle Buck  should  put things right.
putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
If you have sold the outstanding debts,  you should  buy these back if you are able to do so 
and then take the following steps. If you are not able to buy the debts back, then you should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
A)You should add together  the total of the repayments made by Mr L towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  
anything you have  already refunded.
B)You should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments  made  by Mr L 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr L originally  made 
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C)You should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made by Mr L as though  they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr L having 
made overpayments  then you should refund these  overpayments with 8% simple 
interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments  would 
have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. You should then refund the amounts 
calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D)If there  is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts  calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans [and any 
principal youve already  written-off].  If this results in a surplus, then the surplus should 
be paid to Mr L. However, if there is still an outstanding balance then you should try 
to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr L. You shouldnt pursue outstanding 
balances made  up of principal you have already written-off.
E)You should remove any adverse information  recorded on Mr Ls credit file in relation 
to loans four to six. The overall pattern of Mr Ls borrowing for seven to nine means 
any information recorded about  them is adverse, so you should remove these  loans 
entirely from Mr Ls credit file. You do not have  to remove loan nine from Mr Ls credit 
Ref: DRN94308954file until this have  been repaid, but you should still remove any adverse information 
recorded about this loan.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Uncle  Buck  to take off tax from this interest.  Uncle Buck  must 
give Mr L a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  Uncle  Buck Finance 
LLP should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 April 2020.
