The complaint
Miss S complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Fluid lent irresponsibly when it approved a
credit card application and later increased the credit limit.
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. I said:
In January 2020 Miss S applied for a Fluid credit card with NewDay. In the application, 
Miss S said she was a tenant, single, employed and had an income of around £23,000. 
NewDay carried out a credit search and found Miss S owed around £4,100. NewDay also 
found that Miss S had defaulted on two debts just over a year earlier with a combined 
balance of £20,900.
NewDay approved the Fluid credit card with a limit of £600. In July 2020 NewDay increased 
the credit limit to £1,350. NewDay says the credit limit increase was approved in line with its 
lending criteria after carrying out the relevant checks.
Last year, Miss S complained that NewDay had lent irresponsibly. NewDay issued a final 
response but didnt uphold Miss S complaint. An investigator at this service looked at 
Miss S case and upheld it. They thought NewDay had lent irresponsibly when it 
approved the credit limit increase to £1,350 in July 2020. NewDay asked to appeal, so 
Miss S complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our investigator thought the credit limit increase in July 2020 was irresponsibly approved. 
But I think the decision to approve the original application was irresponsible as well. Ill 
explain why.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say NewDay had to complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Miss S could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable 
way. These affordability checks needed to be focused on the borrowers circumstances. 
The nature of whats considered proportionate will vary depending on various factors like:
-The amount of credit;
-The total sum repayable and the size of regular repayments;
-The duration of the agreement;
-The costs of the credit; and
-The consumers individual circumstances.
That means theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. But lenders are required to 
consider the above points when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate.
In this case, NewDay asked Miss S for details of her income and residential status when she 
first applied. NewDay has told us it checked Miss S credit file and found she owed around 
£4,100 in January 2020. NewDay also says it found two defaults totalling £20,900 that were 
14 months old. In my view, these figures shouldve caused NewDay to consider completing 
better checks. Whilst I understand NewDays position as a second chance lender the size 
of the two defaults was large. And 14 months is a reasonably short period of time between 
defaulting on over £20,000 of debt and applying for a new credit card. NewDay also found 
Miss S owed around £4,100. Taken together I think the information NewDay found on Miss 
S credit file shouldve caused it to complete better checks.
I also think its reasonable to note that I dont think NewDays initial credit search found all 
Miss S unsecured borrowing. I say this because NewDay found around £4,100 in January 
2020 but in February 2020 NewDays risk data records Miss S outstanding unsecured 
credit as around £25,000. Either Miss S obtained another £21,000 of unsecured credit in 
that period, or the initial checks NewDay completed failed to obtain an accurate figure. 
Regardless, I think the information NewDay did find shouldve caused it to look more 
closely when assessing Miss S application.
NewDay increased Miss S credit limit to £1,350 in July 2020 but by this point its risk data 
showed an increased unsecured borrowing figure of around £25,500. A substantial 
increase from the £4,100 figure contained in the original application. In my view, this 
shouldve caused NewDay to carry out better checks.
Miss S has sent us lots of information setting out her circumstances during this period. Ive 
looked at bank statements and information from Miss S credit file. In my view, had 
NewDay carried out better checks and sought to verify whether Miss S could afford to 
sustainably maintain further credit payments it wouldve declined the application. I think 
NewDay wouldve found Miss S was reliant on credit to make ends meet and unlikely to be 
in a position to sustainably repay further borrowing.
As its my view that NewDay lent irresponsibly both when the Fluid credit card was 
approved and the credit limit was increased I intend to tell it to refund all interest, fees and 
charges applied from inception to date. NewDay should also ensure no future interest is 
applied to the credit card balance and take steps to reach an affordable repayment plan 
with Miss S.
It wouldnt be fair for NewDay to record adverse information on Miss S credit file where its 
lent irresponsibly. So I also intend to tell NewDay to remove all adverse information 
recorded on Miss S credit file.
I invited both parties to respond with any additional comments or information they wanted 
me to consider before making my final decision. Miss S confirmed she had nothing further to 
add. Newday didnt respond. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has provided new information for me to consider, I see no reason to change 
the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. I still think Miss S complaint should be 
upheld, for the same reasons. My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss S complaint and direct NewDay Ltd trading as Fluid to 
settle as follows: 
- Refund all interest, fees and charges applied to the credit card from inception to date
- NewDay should ensure no future interest is applied to any outstanding balance that 
remains
- If the result of the above refund leads to an outstanding balance remaining, NewDay 
should contact Miss S and discuss options for an affordable repayment plan
- If the result of the above refund leads to a credit balance it should be refunded to 
Miss S along with 8% interest from the date the overpayment arose to the date of 
settlement
- NewDay should remove all adverse information recorded about the Fluid credit card 
from inception onwards. NewDay should ensure no future adverse information is 
recorded on Miss S credit file in relation to the Fluid credit card
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 July 2022.
