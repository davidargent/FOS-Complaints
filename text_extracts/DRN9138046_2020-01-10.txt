K820x#14complaint
Mr N complains TSB Bank plc failed to properly record his cash payment into his account.
background
Mr N complained to TSB because he said he had made a cash  payment into his account in 
branch of £500.  However, when he checked his statement, it only showed a credit of £250.
Mr N was certain he had paid in £500  as he says he was covering a payment he had made  
for just under  that amount.
TSB rejected his complaint so he came to this service where our investigator looked  into 
matters for him.  But the investigator did not think TSB had been unfair or unreasonable  in 
how it had dealt with Mr N  so the matter  was referred to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im afraid I have to tell Mr N that based  on the evidence, I cannot  uphold his complaint  
either.  I understand  how strongly he feels about depositing £500  and his account would 
appear consistent with this being  his intention.  But the documentary evidence  suggests 
otherwise and I have  no reason to doubt that the documentary evidence isnt accurate.
The tills at the branch  balanced on that day, and the recorded information  shows  a deposit of 
£250.
Mr N subsequently  produced a receipt  from another shop which  he says should cast doubt 
on the reliability of TSBs information.  But our investigator has explained how the timing  on 
that receipt is not correct and that the timings  from the card issuers  systems has got to be 
the more reliable one.
So, in the circumstances, I cannot see anything  to suggest that TSB has been unfair or 
unreasonable in not upholding Mr Ns complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 February  2020.
