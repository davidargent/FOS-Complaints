The complaint
Mr K is unhappy with the service he received from National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) surrounding a large payment they flagged for further security checks.
What happened
To briefly summarise: Mr K attempted to make a large payment through NatWest online 
banking. The payment was flagged for further security checks by NatWest, and Mr K spoke 
with NatWest on the phone to authorise the payment. NatWests agent asked Mr K to visit a 
NatWest branch to verify his identity in person, which Mr K did. 
While in branch, Mr K was asked to speak with NatWests fraud department on the 
telephone, who wanted to ask Mr K some questions about the transaction. Mr K didnt feel 
this was necessary, and so declined to answer the questions. Because of this, NatWest 
wouldnt process the payment as he had instructed. Mr K wasnt happy about this, so he 
raised a complaint.  
NatWest responded to Mr K but didnt feel theyd done anything wrong by flagging the 
payment for further checks or wanting to question him about the payment as they had. Mr K 
wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel NatWest had acted 
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation and so didnt uphold the complaint. Mr K 
remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr K was attempting to make an unusually large transaction on his account, and this 
transaction was flagged by NatWests automated fraud prevention systems. Such systems 
are used by financial institutions to flag account activity that may be of concern and to 
prevent further usage of an account where its felt that there is a possibility that fraud may be 
potentially occurring. 
Indeed, it must be noted that financial institutions such as NatWest have an obligation to 
employ such systems to comply with banking regulations which require banks to have 
systems in place to protect their customers accounts, as much as possible, from acts of 
attempted fraud. As such, given the unusually large nature of the transaction, Im satisfied 
that it was reasonable for NatWest to flag the payment for further checks as they did.
 
Additionally, its incumbent on banks to employ these systems with a degree of vigilance  to 
err on the side of caution, as it were  which unfortunately means that there will be instances 
where legitimately authorised transfers are flagged erroneously by the fraud prevention 
systems. This is what appears to have happened in this instance. But as alluded to above, I 
feel that such caution is understandable and necessary, and so I dont feel that this is unfair.
When the payment was initially blocked, Mr K spoke with NatWest on the telephone. Mr K 
was unhappy that the payment had been blocked and with the nature of the questions he 
was being asked by NatWests agent. This led Mr K to interact with NatWests agent in a 
way which that agent found to be rude such that they terminated the call with Mr K. Ive 
listened to a recording of this call, and Im satisfied that it was fair and reasonable for 
NatWests agent to have terminated the call as they did.
Mr K was then asked to visit a NatWest branch to verify his identity in person, which Mr K 
did. But he was unhappy that after confirming his identity in branch that he was asked to 
speak with NatWests fraud department on the telephone, who asked him questions about 
the payment which he felt were unnecessary and which he refused to answer.
I dont feel that its unreasonable for NatWest to require Mr K to verify his identity in branch, 
given his reluctance to meaningfully engage with NatWests agents on the telephone. And, 
given NatWests obligations to protect their customers money, I also dont feel that it was 
unreasonable for NatWests fraud department to want to speak with Mr K about the payment 
he was attempting to make and to ask questions designed to confirm, to NatWests 
satisfaction, that Mr K wasnt in the process of being scammed. 
In short, I feel that Mr K unfortunately became frustrated at necessary processes that 
NatWest fairly and reasonably felt they were required to complete to remain in compliance 
with their own obligations before allowing the payment instructed by Mr K to complete. 
It also must be noted that Mr K could have mitigated against the consequences of NatWest 
not processing the instructed payment about which he is now unhappy by simply complying 
with the requests of NatWests agents on the initial phone calls or when he spoke with 
NatWests fraud department in branch. And I can only reiterate that Im satisfied that 
NatWests requests in these regards were both fair and reasonable.
Ultimately, its for NatWest to set their own requirements as to what they require to consider 
a payment to have passed their security concerns, and it isnt for a customer such as Mr K to 
dictate to NatWest the process that they should follow.
All of which means that I dont feel that NatWest have done anything wrong or acted unfairly 
here as Mr K contends. Rather, I feel that NatWest followed a reasonable process, but that 
Mr K of his own volition chose to not comply with that process and thus, by his own actions, 
caused NatWest to be unable to complete their reasonable process and to therefore be 
unable to process the payment as Mr K wanted. And it follows from this that I wont be 
upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further or alternative action.
I realise this wont be the outcome Mr K was wanting, but I trust that hell understand, given 
what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 January 2024.
