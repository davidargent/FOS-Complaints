The complaint
Miss K complains NewDay Ltd has unfairly recorded adverse information with the credit 
reference agencies (CRAs).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here in detail. But in summary:
- Miss K had a credit card account with NewDay. She complained about adverse 
information it recorded with the CRAs while she was on a payment holiday.
- NewDay considered the complaint and concluded it hadnt done anything wrong.
- Miss K asked our service for an independent review and the investigator thought 
NewDay should remove the adverse information it had recorded. 
- Miss K accepted the investigators recommendation. NewDay didnt. So the 
complained has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
To maintain her credit card account  and therefore avoid adverse information being 
reported to the CRAs  Miss K needed to make at least minimum repayments by certain due 
dates each month. 
When Miss Ks 12 April 2020 statement was produced, she was up-to-date and needed to 
make her next minimum repayment of £212.94 by 7 May 2020. Miss K didnt make this 
repayment, so when her 10 May 2020 statement was produced it showed arrears of £212.94 
and the need to make her next minimum repayment of £188.74 by 4 June 2020. 
Miss K didnt make any repayment. But she did call NewDay on 21 May 2020 to say her 
income had been impacted by the pandemic. NewDay then put Miss K on a payment holiday 
for three months. This meant for June, July and August 2020 she didnt need to make a 
payment and no interest or charges would be applied. NewDay followed up the call with a 
letter which said, amongst other things:
If there were any amounts due at the time the payment holiday started, you will have to pay 
these immediately when the payment holiday ends
If you do currently have any payments on your account that are overdue, it is a good idea to 
try and reduce these during your payment holiday as this will reduce the amount due when 
your payment holiday comes to an end.
At the start of the payment holiday Miss K had a £188.74 repayment due, and a £212.94 
repayment overdue. In June, July and August 2020 NewDay didnt send Miss K statements. 
Instead it sent letters to say she was in a payment holiday and a transaction summary, which 
just showed her account balance.
On 31 August 2020 NewDay sent Miss K a reminder her payment holiday was due to end on 
10 September 2020. It said, in summary, shed need to start making minimum repayments 
again and any repayments due before the payment holiday began would be immediately 
payable on 10 September 2020. 
A statement was produced on 10 September 2020. This said arrears of £401.68 (£212.94 + 
£188.74) were due immediately and a minimum payment was due by 5 October 2020 for 
£53.23. This was followed by a default notice on 18 September 2020. Miss K called 
NewDay, said she was still off work, satisfied the default notice and declined a payment 
holiday extension. She then went on to make some large payments to the account to reduce 
her balance, which I understand has since been repaid in full and the account closed.
In October 2020 Miss K found NewDay had recorded missed payments for May, June, July 
and August 2020. She didnt think this was fair as she says during the 21 May 2020 call she 
was clear about the need for the payment holiday not to adversely impact her credit file and 
says she was informed many times her account was up to date. She further says had she 
known adverse information would be reported to the CRAs she wouldnt have entered the 
payment holiday. 
NewDay doesnt have a recording of the 21 May 2020 call and the contemporaneous note 
lacks detail. NewDay hasnt directly challenged Miss Ks recollection of the call. Instead, its 
relied on the contents of its letters. In my view, however, its more likely than not NewDay 
could have done more on the call. Ill explain why.
When Miss K called NewDay in May 2020 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had 
already released guidance on ways lenders could support borrowers impacted by the 
pandemic. Miss K said she was impacted and NewDay ought to have known at this point 
she had some arrears. I consider it would have been fair and reasonable for NewDay to 
have applied the payment holiday to take the arrears into account and therefore set the plan 
to start from April 2020. This would have prevented adverse information being reported to 
the CRAs.
In any case, Im persuaded by Miss Ks testimony about how she would (and could) have 
cleared the arrears and gone without a payment holiday had it been made clear to her the 
impact this matter would have on her credit file. So even if I were to conclude NewDay 
shouldnt have applied the payment holiday from an earlier date, Im satisfied its lack of 
clear information regarding the account position and the impact on Miss Ks credit file has 
caused her to lose out. 
Im therefore going to require NewDay to remove adverse information from Miss Ks credit 
file for May, June, July and August 2020. NewDay offered Miss K £25 compensation in its 
final response letter. Im satisfied thats a reasonable amount in the circumstances so 
NewDay should pay Miss K £25, if it hasnt already done so.
Putting things right
NewDay Ltd should:
- remove adverse information from Miss Ks credit file for May, June, July and 
August 2020; and
- pay Miss K £25, if it hasnt already done so.My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require NewDay Ltd to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 April 2022.
