K820x#14complaint
Ms R complains that shes received post from National Westminster Bank Plc addressed to 
her ex-husband in relation  to a joint account  they previously held. Ms R also complains that 
she thought shed been disassociated from the account and isnt responsible for the 
outstanding debt. 
Ms R has also complained that NatWest didnt respond to her Subject Access Request 
(SAR). 
background
Ms R held a joint account with her ex-husband and has been contacted by NatWest  about 
the outstanding balance.  In December 2017 Ms R complained to NatWest about being  
contacted and asked to repay the outstanding  balance. On 23 January 2018 NatWest 
responded and explained  Ms R was a joint party  to the account  so is liable for the 
outstanding balance. NatWests response told Ms R she had six months to refer her 
complaint to the Financial Ombudsman  Service. 
Ms R referred her complaint to this service and it was looked  at under a different reference.  
But as Ms R hadnt forwarded  her complaint within six months of NatWests  response the 
investigator explained we didnt have  jurisdiction to proceed. 
Over the following months Ms R contacted NatWest and sent in a SAR to obtain information 
it holds about  her. Ms R also contacted NatWest to raise further  concerns  about being asked 
to repay  the outstanding overdraft balance and receiving letters addressed  to her ex-
husband. During this time Ms R says she was given confusing information  by NatWest.
Ms R referred her complaint to this service and an adjudicator looked at what  had happened. 
Around this time NatWest  also responded to Ms Rs complaint about not receiving a 
response to her SAR.  The adjudicator explained wed already advised Ms R under reference 
19926141 that her complaint about  not being  removed  from the account  wasnt  something 
this service could consider as she hadnt referred  her case to us in time.  
The adjudicator also said that they agreed NatWest shouldnt  have sent a letter  addressed to 
Ms Rs ex-husband  to her but didnt ask it to take any further action. The adjudicator 
explained that as Ms R remains liable for the outstanding balance  NatWest was entitled  to 
contact her about it. As Ms R didnt agree with the adjudicator she asked for her case  to be 
appealed so its been passed to me to make a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  There are several  separate parts  to this 
case so Im going to deal with each in turn.
Before I deal with the merits of Ms Rs complaint I need to explain that Im not looking at her 
original complaint (19926141) about  whether shes liable for the outstanding debt on her joint 
account. The investigator on that case explained  that she was out of time to refer her 
concerns to us and the complaint subsequently  closed.  
Ref: DRN13445492Under this reference  my focus is on the correspondence Ms Rs received from NatWest  
about the debt,  whether the SAR was dealt with reasonably and whether despite  being 
disassociated from her ex-husband she remains liable for the outstanding balance.  
Ms R complains that NatWest has continued to contact her about the outstanding debt and 
that it sent her incorrectly addressed letters calling her by her ex-husbands name. NatWest 
also sent Ms R a letter addressed to her ex-husband.  Ms R says she never took her ex-
husbands name but NatWest has provided  evidence to show  her name was changed in 
2010 by providing a copy of her marriage certificate. I understand Ms Rs name  has now 
been amended  on NatWests systems.  
NatWest also wrote to Ms Rs ex-husband at her address and I agree that was a mistake. 
But, like the adjudicator, I dont think the impact on Ms R was sufficient to mean I can fairly 
tell NatWest to pay compensation. I appreciate there  was an error but NatWest has 
completed the process of disassociation and has said Ms R shouldnt receive further  
correspondence of that nature. 
As Ive explained above, I cant comment on whether NatWest  is fairly holding Ms R liable 
for the outstanding debt because that complaint was brought out of time. NatWest  has 
explained that its continued  to write  to Ms R and has ultimately taken the step of applying a 
default because  she remains  liable for the outstanding balance. I think  theres  been  some 
confusion because whilst Ms R has been  disassociated from her ex-husband in terms of 
whether theyre  linked on NatWests systems, that doesnt mean  shes  no longer  liable  for 
the outstanding balance  on a joint account. 
As NatWest says the debt relates to a joint account  Ms R is liable  for, I think  its reasonable 
for it to make  contact  and take the appropriate action to try and recover  the outstanding 
balance. 
Ive listened to a call from May 2018 when Ms R spoke  with NatWest and I can hear there 
was some confusion over whether she was still liable for the outstanding balance.  The call 
handler explained that it wasnt  clear  and asked Ms R to call back the following day for 
confirmation. But Ive not seen any evidence  to show Ms R called back after being  given this 
information. And whilst  I appreciate the situation  couldve  been explained more clearly,  
NatWest has written  to Ms R several times  to explain why shes  been asked to repay the 
overdraft. 
Ms Rs also complained about how NatWest handled a SAR.  But how a business responds  
to a SAR isnt something the Financial Ombudsman  Service can look into. The rules  around 
how businesses handle  information and respond  to SARs are set by the Information  
Commissioners Office,  the regulator. If Ms R remains concerned about the way her SAR 
was dealt with she has the option  of contacting that body. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the evidence available to me and Im satisfied that NatWest 
acted fairly  by writing  to Ms R about the outstanding balance.  I can see theres  been some  
confusion when Ms R asked about  whether she was liable for the outstanding debt but 
overall Im satisfied NatWest has clearly  explained  the situation. As Im satisfied NatWest  
dealt with Ms Rs complaint fairly  Im not telling it to take any further action. 
Ref: DRN13445493my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  Under the rules of the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Ms R to accept or reject  my decision 
before 18 March 2019.
