The complaint
Miss V complains about a number of loans provided to her by Loans 2 Go Limited which she 
says she couldnt afford to repay.
What happened
The agreements Miss V took out with Loans 2 Go spanned many years and some were 
taken out with a different business which Loans 2 Go later acquired. These were all fixed 
sum loan agreements secured on Miss Vs car by way of a bill of sale. The details of the 
loans were as follows:
Loan Date End Date Borrowed Term Repayment Total 
repayable
1 05/2010 ? ? ? £162.37 ?
2 08/2011 12/2011 £1,000 78 weeks £37.47 £2,922.66
3 12/2011 01/2015 £2,100 78 weeks £75.05 £5,853.90
4 04/2016 09/2016 £300 12 months £58 £696
5 09/2016 08/2017 £375 12 months £72.50 £870
6 08/2017 08/2018 £600 12 months £116 £1,392
Loans 1 and 2 were taken out with a previous business which Loans 2 Go has since 
acquired. When Miss V complained to Loans 2 Go about the affordability of the agreements 
she had taken out, it said it couldnt consider her complaints about loans 1 and 2 because 
they hadnt taken responsibility for the sale of those loans.
Loans 2 Go didnt agree it had done anything wrong in providing Miss V with loans 3, 4 and 
5. It said that it had requested copies of her bank statements and completed credit checks 
which showed that she could afford the borrowing. However, it did uphold her complaint in 
relation to loan six and refunded all the interest and charges that had been applied to that 
agreement.
Loans 2 Go didnt consent to our service considering Miss Vs complaint about loans 1, 2 
and 3 because it said she had raised those complaints too late. 
I sent Miss V and Loans 2 Go my provisional decision on 8 September 2021. In summary, 
I said:
I didnt think I could consider any complaint about loans 1, 2 and 3. This was 
because I thought Miss V had brought these complaints too late. 
I explained our rules only allowed me to consider complaints brought within the 
relevant time limits set out in the regulators handbook. I was satisfied that Miss Vs 
complaint about loans 1, 2 and 3 had been brought outside of these time limits and 
that I couldnt see any exceptional reasons for the delay in the complaint being 
raised. For these reasons, I said I was planning to say I didnt have the power to 
investigate her complaint about those loans. 
As Loans 2 Go had already upheld Miss Vs complaint about loan 6 and awarded 
redress in line with our usual approach, I was satisfied it had dealt with her complaint 
about that loan fairly. 
In relation to loan 4, I said that I didnt think Loans 2 Go had completed reasonable 
and proportionate affordability checks. However, had it completed proportionate 
checks, I thought it was more likely than not it would still have concluded the 
borrowing was affordable to her. This was based on the information Miss V had 
provided about her income and expenditure a few months later when applying for 
loan 5. I said it was likely she would have declared similar figures, if asked, when 
applying for loan 4. These indicated loan 4 was affordable to her. 
I thought Loans 2 Go completed reasonable and proportionate checks for loan 5. 
This was because it gathered evidence of Miss Vs income and expenditure through 
bank statements and payslips. I said I didnt think there was anything within the 
evidence and information that Loans 2 Go gathered that ought to have alerted it to 
the possibility that loan 5 wasnt affordable to Miss V. I therefore didnt think it acted 
unfairly in lending to her. 
Miss V didnt respond to my provisional decision and Loans 2 Go had nothing further to add. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has provided any further comments or evidence following my provisional 
decision, Ive seen no reason to depart from the conclusions I previously reached. 
Im satisfied I dont have the power to consider Miss Vs complaint about loans 1, 2 and 3 
because she brought them outside of the relevant time limits. Im also satisfied that 
Loans 2 Go didnt act unfairly or unreasonably in granting loans 4 and 5. It has already put 
things right how I would have expected it to in relation to loan 6 and I therefore dont 
consider it appropriate to make any further award. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss V to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 November 2021.
