The complaint
Mr S is unhappy with the service National Westminster Bank Plc provided after he was the 
victim of an authorised push payment (APP) scam.
What happened
Where the circumstances of the complaint are well known to both parties, I wont detail them 
again here. Rather, Ill focus on setting out the key reasons for my decision. I hope Mr S and 
NatWest wont take this as a discourtesy; its just a reflection of the informal nature of our 
service.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the investigators findings for broadly the same reasons, which 
I will go on to explain. Before I do so, I want to acknowledge that I understand my decision 
will be disappointing to Mr S. But based on the evidence, I am not persuaded that NatWest 
ought to refund the disputed transactions.
Its not in dispute that Mr S authorised the payments in question.  He fell victim to a task-
based job scam where he sent £25,150 to the scammer between 10 and 16 January 2023. 
While I accept that Mr S didnt intend for their money to go to the fraudster, under the 
Payment Service Regulations 2017 (PSRs) Mr S is presumed liable for the loss in the first 
instance as the payments were authorised by him. 
This is unless there is sufficient evidence that NatWest ought to have fairly and reasonably 
have done more to protect him. For example, by failing to act on clear triggers of unusual or 
uncharacteristic activity on an account.
To put it another way, NatWest has a responsibility to monitor accounts and payments, and 
one of the reasons for this is to prevent fraud and scams. NatWest needs to have systems in 
place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that might indicate its consumers 
are at risk of fraud (amongst other things). With that in mind, Ive considered whether 
NatWest should have considered these payments as being so unusual or uncharacteristic 
that it ought to have given the bank sufficient grounds for suspecting fraud.
Having done so, I am satisfied that the £25,150 made to the scammer over a six-day period 
was unusual, uncharacteristic behaviour and expenditure the account. As such, I think it is 
reasonable to conclude that this ought to have triggered NatWests fraud detection system. 
So, I think NatWest ought to have contacted Mr S and asked him to provide further details 
about the payment in question.
However, I have gone on to consider the events that followed the payments in question. Mr 
S tried to make a further payment of £1,000. This did trigger NatWests fraud detection 
systems, and Mr S was asked to contact its fraud department to discuss the payments in 
question. I have listened to that call, and I am satisfied that Mr S was made aware that the 
payment was put on hold by its automated fraud and scams profiling system. The agent 
went on to ask Mr S, what the payment was for, who recommended the company to him. He 
also explained that it had received numerous calls about the company in question from other 
consumers. He went onto explain that based on the consumers answers the payment was 
going to be stopped as he suspected the consumer was a potential victim of a scam. So, I 
am satisfied NatWest made the customer aware the payment was being stopped due to the 
fact it suspected this was a scam. Mr S said he understood but then proceeded to ask 
NatWest if it would authorise another transaction to the same recipient. NatWest explained it 
wouldnt. Mr S then proceeded to make the payment from another account which he had 
with an electronic money institution.
So, I dont think NatWests its failure to intervene sooner or probe further could reasonably 
be considered as the proximate cause of Mr S loss in this circumstance. I say this because, 
despite his payment being stopped because NatWest considered he was a victim of a scam, 
Mr S circumvented the process and still proceeded to make the payment via an EMI, 
resulting in a loss of funds. As such, I find it likely, that if NatWest had intervened sooner and 
stopped the payments going through, due to Mr S concerns about not getting his money 
back, he would have continued to make the payment via his EMI account, resulting in a loss 
of funds.
Therefore, while I agree that Mr S payments ought to have triggered NatWests fraud 
detections systems, I am not persuaded that NatWests intervention would have resulted in 
Mr S doing anything differently. 
I have gone on to consider if NatWest took reasonable steps to try and recover the funds. Its 
important to note that Mr S didnt ask NatWest to send the money directly to the scammers 
account but instead to a crypto currency wallet in his name. And NatWest did as Mr C 
requested. I am persuaded that it was highly unlikely that NatWest would be able to facilitate 
the recovery of the payments after they were moved on from his crypto currency wallet to the 
scammers account. So, I dont think I can hold NatWest responsible for Mr S being unable to 
recover his funds.
All things considered, and despite my natural empathy for this cruel scam and the situation 
Mr S finds himself in having lost his money, Im not persuaded NatWest taking different 
actions would have prevented the payments being made, or the loss that ensued, for the 
reasons I have explained. It follows that I do not consider it fair or reasonable to require 
NatWest to do anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2023.
