The complaint
Mr S has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) withheld funds from 
him and this caused him to end up with a bill of £900 to fix his car.
What happened
Mr S had set up a standing order to pay £40 from his account on the 10th of each month, 
with the first payment taken in March 2022. 
The payments were returned as unpaid between April and October 2022, because Mr S did 
not have enough funds in his account to cover the payments as they were processed.
Mr S called NatWest on 10 October 2022 to cancel the standing order, however as the 
payment was already being processed as returned unpaid, NatWest could not expedite the 
return of the funds to his account. I understand this was not explained to Mr S at the time. 
The request to cancel the standing order was then subsequently processed on 11 October 
2022.
Mr S says that not having access to the £40 standing order money led to his car being 
stranded and damage was caused to the vehicle.
In response to the complaint, NatWest ultimately agreed to pay Mr S £410 compensation in 
total. This represented £300 for damage caused to the car plus £110 compensation for the 
distress and inconvenience caused to Mr S.
One of our adjudicators assessed the complaint and they concluded that what NatWest had 
paid Mr S was reasonable. 
Mr S disagreed, so the matter was referred for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed everything, I think that what NatWest awarded is a reasonable amount of 
compensation in the circumstances, largely for the same reasons that the adjudicator gave.
Mr S says that NatWests actions - its failure to cancel the £40 standing order - left him 
stranded and caused £900 worth of damage to the car. 
However, even though Mr S has had plenty of time in which to do so, Mr S has not provided 
our service with any explanation as to how exactly him being stranded was caused by 
NatWests actions. Mr S has also not provided our service with any evidence to corroborate 
the losses that he says he incurred.  
As such, in the circumstances I cant reasonably ask NatWest to pay Mr S £900  the 
amount he requested, given that there is no evidence to show that he actually incurred such 
costs, and that such costs were incurred due to what happened with his attempt to cancel 
the standing order. 
Indeed, other than saying that he was unable to fix his car and he ended up with a bill of 
£900, which spoilt his birthday, Mr S has provided our service with very little information to 
support his complaint. And I note that the amount Mr S is claiming it cost to repair his vehicle 
is substantially more than what NatWest was willing to pay. Mr S has provided little 
explanation why he thinks that NatWest is responsible for paying him the increased amount.
So, looking at the information that is available (which is largely information provided by 
NatWest), overall, I think that NatWests offer to refund the returned item fee; pay Mr S £300 
towards the costs he said he incurred to repair his vehicle; and pay £110 for the distress and 
inconvenience this matter caused him seems to be reasonable. As NatWest has already 
paid this money to Mr S, I therefore dont think NatWest needs to do anything more than 
what it has already done to put matters right in this situation.
My final decision
Because of the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 July 2023.
