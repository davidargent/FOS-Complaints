The complaint
Mr Q complains about the amount that hes been charged by Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, for damage to a car that he 
returned when he ended his hire purchase agreement.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mr Q under a hire purchase agreement with Mercedes-Benz 
Finance that he electronically signed in August 2019. The car was collected from him in 
September 2021 when the agreement ended by a third party on behalf of Mercedes-Benz 
Finance and a vehicle condition report was prepared. The third party then inspected the car 
at its compound three days later and completed another vehicle condition report. The report 
identified damage to the car and a total charge of £2,055.93 was recommended. 
Mercedes-Benz Finance charged that amount to Mr Q but he complained to it about the 
charges. It agreed to remove the charges for damage to the left rear quarter panel and right 
front door but confirmed that the remaining damage could be seen on the photos from the 
first inspection and that the charges had been raised in accordance with its vehicle return 
standards. It said that the remaining balance was £1,760.93. Mr Q wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that 
Mercedes-Benz Finance had charged Mr Q correctly in line with the British Vehicle Rental 
and Leasing Association guidelines and the vehicle return standards and hadnt made any 
errors  so she said that she couldnt fairly ask it to take any further action to resolve his 
complaint.
Mr Q has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that:
he had this car for two years, during which time he took care of the car, wasnt 
involved in any accidents and any marks or blemishes are a result of normal wear 
and tear;
with the exception of one wheel and tyre, everything else seems incredibly 
unreasonable as there are a few small dents or marks, which could only have been 
caused by stones or something of that nature which surely has to be wear and tear of 
normal driving;
he cant even see any mark on the mirror housing;
hes willing to pay for one of the wheels but the other costs are extortionate and 
completely unreasonable and he doesnt understand how he could possibly be 
charged £1,700; and
he refuses to pay anywhere near that amount and is happy for this to proceed to 
court if need be.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in the hire purchase agreement that Mr Q had electronically signed hed agreed that 
he would pay the reasonable expenses incurred by Mercedes-Benz Finance if he 
breached the requirements relating to the condition of the car on return - and the 
agreement included the vehicle return standards;
the vehicle return standards say: When it is time to return your vehicle  you must 
return the vehicle in line with the Vehicle Return Standards  When the vehicle is 
returned to us a Vehicle Return Standard Inspection will be carried out by trained 
technicians at the nominated Defleet Centre. The vehicle must be: free from any 
broken or damaged items ; free from any defects or condition that would be in 
breach of statutory requirements; free from accident damage; and in good, clean and 
marketable condition  the standards then explain what would be acceptable and 
unacceptable;
the car was collected from Mr Q in September 2021 by a third party on behalf of 
Mercedes-Benz Finance and a vehicle condition report was prepared which identified 
damage to the car and said that the repair method and cost were to be advised  the 
report said that the cars mileage was 25,154 and it included a video and photos 
showing the damage;
the car was then inspected at the third partys compound three days later and 
another vehicle condition report was completed  the cars mileage was recorded as 
25,168 miles and the report identified the following damage and recommended 
charges:
a missing spare key - £335;
replace two damaged wheels - £352.62 each;
refurbish the other two wheels - £110 each;
replace a damaged tyre - £210.69;
repair a scuffed mirror housing - £30;
repair and refinish two dented quarter panels - £260 each; and
repair a dented door - £35;
Mercedes-Benz Finance charged Mr Q £2,055.93 for that damage but then agreed to 
remove the charges for the damage to one of the quarter panels and the door which 
reduced the total charge to £1,760.93;
I consider it to be clear from the videos and photos from the reports that two wheels 
were damaged and needed to be replaced, there was damage to the other two 
wheels which could be refurbished, a tyre is damaged and needed to be replaced, 
the paint on a mirror housing is scuffed and needed to be repaired and one of the 
quarter panels was dented and needed to be repaired and refinished;
I consider that to be unacceptable damage under the vehicle return standards and 
Im not persuaded that it would reasonably be considered to be fair wear and tear;Mr Q says that he has the spare key and was told that he didnt need to return it  but 
the vehicle return standards say: You must return the vehicle together with 
everything originally supplied with the vehicle:  spare/additional keys ;
Mercedes-Benz Finance has contacted the third party and it says Mr Q wouldnt have 
advised that he wouldnt be charged for the missing key  and I dont consider it to be 
likely that he would have been told that he didnt have to return the spare key;
Mercedes-Benz Finance says that its pricing matrix was provided to Mr Q at the 
beginning of his agreement and covers the estimated cost of any repairs and are the 
costs that it incurs to repair the car for re-sale;
Im not persuaded that those charges are excessive or that its unfair or 
unreasonable for Mercedes-Benz Finance to apply those charges for the damage to 
the car that was returned by Mr Q;
I dont consider that Mercedes-Benz Finance has acted incorrectly in these 
circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Mercedes-Benz Finance 
to further reduce or waive the charges that its made to Mr Q, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I don t uphold Mr Qs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Q to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2022.
