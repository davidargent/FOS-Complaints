The complaint
Mrs B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) acted unfairly when it put 
adverse information on her credit file.
What happened
In December 2020 Mrs B entered a forbearance plan with NatWest. She agreed to pay a 
monthly payment of £1 towards her loan. The forbearance plan was initially for three months, 
but she extended it in March 2021 for another three months. She complaints that NatWest 
didnt tell her theyd put adverse information on her credit file in relation to this.
Before Mrs B entered the forbearance plan in December 2020 NatWest had given Mrs B a 
covid payment holiday. The covid payment holiday didnt affect her credit file. 
Mrs B also complained about four letters she received from NatWest in March 2021. These 
letters were in relation to a default, her overdraft being stopped, late payments and returning 
her cheque book. Mrs B says she made the agreed monthly £1 payments so she should not 
have received these letters.
In April 2021 NatWest sent Mrs B its final response. In this NatWest accepted theyd made a 
mistake in relation to the letters it sent in March 2021. NatWest paid her £100 compensation 
for this. NatWest said Mrs Bs credit file would show an arrangement to pay was in place 
for the period in which she was on the forbearance plan. However no default or missed 
payment would be reported if payments were maintained. As a gesture of goodwill NatWest 
refunded Mrs B the £14.99 shed paid to get her credit report. The final response also said 
why Mrs B had paid two pounds for one month of the forbearance plan instead of one 
pound.
Mrs B remained unhappy as she said she could see late payment markers on her Experian 
credit file. 
On 26 April 2021 NatWest issued a second final response to Mrs B. NatWest said they 
couldnt see the data for March 2021 yet as the information wasnt available to them. But 
they would check the available data on 30 April 2021. NatWest acknowledged that Mrs B 
had phoned them on multiple occasions to try to resolve the matter. So they paid her a 
further £50 compensation.
On 30 April 2021 NatWest wrote to Mrs B to discuss the credit file data available to them. 
They confirmed that the March 2021 information showed an arrangement to pay. It thought 
that information was correct. NatWest told Mrs B that the different credit reference agencies 
(CRAs) report data differently despite the same information being provided to them. They 
said they couldnt control how the different CRAs reported the information.
In May 2021 Mrs B phoned NatWest again. She said that late payments had been recorded 
on her Experian credit report in April 2021 and May 2021. 
In July 2021 Mrs B wrote a letter to NatWests Chief Executive Officer. She reiterated her 
point about the late payments being added to her Experian credit report. She said her credit 
rating had dropped significantly. As a result, other lenders had reduced her credit limits. She 
highlighted her health condition and said NatWest had caused her sleepless nights.
Our investigator looked into what happened. She said NatWest had acknowledged it made a 
mistake when it sent Mrs B arrears letters in March 2021. She could see it had apologised 
and paid her £100 compensation for the stress it caused. She thought that amount was fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances. 
Our investigator also thought NatWest had acted fairly when it agreed to the reduce Mrs Bs 
monthly repayments to £1 for a total of six months. She appreciated that Mrs B has told us 
that shed had a good credit rating and that she didnt want the forbearance plan to 
compromise that. However, she said that shed listened to the phone call between Mrs B and 
NatWest on 18 December 2020. In that call the NatWest representative told her that having 
arrears would be noted on her credit file and may affect her ability to get credit from other 
lenders. The representative went on to say that it would be noted that she would be in a 
reduced payment plan with NatWest. So our investigator was satisfied that Mrs B was made 
aware her credit file would be impacted.
Our investigator said NatWest were obliged to report true and accurate information to the 
CRAs. She said NatWest had to report the fact that Mrs B didnt make her contractual 
monthly payments while she was on reduced payment plan. Although she accepted that it 
was likely that the information affected Mrs Bs credit limits with other lenders, she didnt 
think NatWest had made a mistake on that point. She was conscious that Mrs B had entered 
into a reduced payment plan with another lender during this period. She thought that would 
also have had an impact on Mrs Bs credit file.
Our investigator said NatWest have told us theyd reported the same information to all the 
CRAs, but the CRAs reflect this data differently. NatWest werent responsible for that. She 
accepted NatWests position that while Mrs Bs Experian credit file showed late payment 
markers for the relevant period (not an arrangement to pay) there was a further flag on the 
credit file showing there was an arrangement to pay in place for the relevant period. 
However, our investigator could see that Mrs Bs Experian credit file was showing that the 
arrangement to pay was in place between February and June 2020. She asked NatWest to 
amend this to show the arrangement to pay was in place between January and June 2020 
as it should be. NatWest did this in December 2021.
Mrs B remained unhappy and asked for her complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman. 
She thinks her credit score should be higher than it is by now, and that NatWest were 
responsible for late payment markers being put on her Experian credit file.
After this complaint was passed on to me to review our investigator asked NatWest to 
provide us with the exact information it provided to Experian. She did this because she could 
see that Mrs Bs Experian credit file reported the first three months of Mrs Bs forbearance 
plan differently to the second three months of Mrs Bs forbearance plan. Our investigator 
also asked Mrs B to provide us with a copy of her credit file from another CRA. Mrs B 
provided us with a report from Equifax. That credit report showed an arrangement to pay in 
place for the whole six-month forbearance period. 
After this Mrs B provided us with a screenshot from another credit report. That appeared to 
show missed payments on her credit file. She also raised separate complaints about another 
business and the way Experian has recorded information about her.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive come to the same conclusion as our investigator. Ill explain why.
NatWest have accepted they shouldnt have sent Mrs B letters in connection with her arrears 
in March 2021. They paid Mrs B £100 compensation for that, and a further £50 in April 2021 
to reflect Mrs Bs phone costs at that time. Shed phoned NatWest on numerous occasions 
as she was worried about the information that went on her credit fie in March 2021.
Mrs B didnt think the compensation NatWest have paid her is enough to resolve this 
complaint. Her current overriding concern is about the information she can see on her 
Experian credit file in relation to her NatWest loan.
Like our investigator I think NatWest was entitled to let the CRAs know that Mrs B was only 
paying £1 monthly payments towards that debt while she was on the agreed forbearance 
plan. The relevant guidance on this (published by the Information Commissioners Office) is 
clear about this. 
I can see that before Mrs B entered into the forbearance plan in December 2020 shed 
already had a covid payment holiday (also known as a payment deferral) on her loan 
account. This was available to Mrs B because in March 2020 the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) announced guidance to lenders in response to the effects on customers of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. All lenders, including NatWest, agreed to put in place payment 
deferrals on many credit agreements, including personal loans  to help customers who 
were affected. Customers could ask for a total of two payment deferrals, each of three 
months  whereby payments could be suspended. Missed payments would not be reported 
to credit reference agencies, although interest would still be debited to accounts. 
In September 2020, the FCA announced that the support scheme would change from the 
end of October 2020. From then, firms could continue to support customers in difficulty - but 
it was down to their discretion and customers circumstances. Reporting to credit reference 
agencies was reintroduced for people that had already had the maximum six months of 
payment deferrals.
So by the time Mrs B entered into the forbearance plan in December 2020 shed already 
exhausted NatWests covid payment holiday process. Like our investigator Im satisfied that 
NatWest warned Mrs B on the phone that her reduced payment plan would be noted on her 
credit file and may affect her ability to get credit from other lenders. 
Mrs B is worried her Experian credit report shows late payments to her account rather than 
an agreed repayment plan. She doesnt think thats fair, especially as she has made her 
monthly £1 payments. 
I think its worth saying here that NatWest arent responsible for Experians actions and the 
way they record information on credit files. If NatWest had given Experian incorrect 
information about Mrs Bs loan and Experian reported that, NatWest would be responsible 
for that. But I cant see that happened here. Ive considered the information NatWest says it 
sent Experian (that Mrs B was in a payment arrangement for the six month forbearance 
period) and I can see that Mrs Bs Equifax credit report also shows that Mrs B had an 
arrangement to pay in place for the whole six-month forbearance period.
Mrs B has provided us with a screenshot of a further credit report. That shows late payment markers in relation to her NatWest loan. However, Im conscious that Mrs B hasnt provided 
us with the full credit report as we requested. The screenshot she has provided doesnt 
suggest that NatWest made a mistake here either. The late payment markers that can be 
seen on this screenshot reflect that fact that Mrs B was late making her contractual 
payments when she was on the agreed repayment plan.
Taking the matter as a whole I dont think it would be fair for me to say that NatWest have 
made a mistake with the way it has reported information about Mrs Bs account to Experian. 
So it wouldnt be fair and reasonable for me to require NatWest to compensate her for this. 
Ive listened to the phone conversations Mrs B has had with the Financial Ombudsman, and 
it appears that Mrs B thought that once shed completed the forbearance plan, the 
information about her arrangement to pay would be removed from her credit file. Im afraid to 
say that isnt the case. Information properly recorded Mrs Bs credit file will remain on her 
credit file for six years. 
NatWest paid Mrs B £100 compensation for mistakenly sending her arrears letters in March 
2021, and a further £50 in April 2021 to reflect Mrs Bs phone costs. Ive considered what 
Mrs B has said about the impact of those issues on her, and think those amounts are in line 
with what the Financial Ombudsman would recommend NatWest pay to address them. So it 
follows that I dont think NatWest needs to do more to resolve this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, my final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc 
doesnt need to do more to resolve this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 April 2022.
