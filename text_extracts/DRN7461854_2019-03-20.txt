K821x#15complaint
Ms M has complained about short-term loans granted to her by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading either as Quick Quid or Pounds to Pocket  (CashEuroNet  or the lender).
background
CashEuroNet agreed nine loans for Ms M from July 2013 to August 2017.  All except one 
were agreed  by Pounds to Pocket  and were  to be repaid over 9 to 12 months. The one loan 
agreed by Quick Quid was an open-ended revolving  credit agreement called a Flex Credit 
account which ran for about three months from March 2014.  Ms M borrowed additional credit 
for loans  1, 5 and 6. I have included a summary table of these loans below.

* This account was open-ended but the credit agreement contained a sample repayment schedule 
based on Ms M drawing  down to her full limit of £400 and repaying this over 10 instalments.
Ms M says that her loans from CashEuroNet were  unaffordable and led her into a debt  
spiral where she couldnt afford to live from month to month without  borrowing  again. 
Our adjudicator found that Ms Ms complaint should be upheld  in part and recommended 
that CashEuroNet refund the interest  and charges she paid on loans  1, 1a and 3, and loans 
5 to 9 inclusive. 
CashEuroNet responded to say that it agreed with the adjudicators recommendation with 
regard to loans  1 to 5 and offered to refund the interest and charges Ms M paid on loans 1, 
1a, 3, 5 and 5a1. Ms M declined the offer and the complaint has come  to me, as an 
ombudsman, to review and resolve.  
Ms M queried  why our adjudicator didnt recommend that her complaint about  her fourth loan 
be upheld. I have considered this point  carefully  and found  that I am in agreement with our 
adjudicator. Ive let Ms M know and she has accepted this. So, following our adjudication 
1 Plus 8% simple interest per annum and to remove any associated negative  credit file entries.
Ref: DRN74618542and the responses  from both parties,  it seems  loans 1 to 5 are no longer in dispute and so I 
wont revisit these. My decision therefore  focuses on loans 6 to 9 inclusive.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have also taken into account the law, 
any relevant regulatory  rules and good  industry practice at the time.
CashEuroNets refund offer applied to loans  granted to Ms M in 2013 and 2014. In response  
to our adjudication it said:
Whilst I appreciate the points you have made, I am still in the belief that the checks 
CashEuroNet UK carried  out were  adequate  and sufficient to the types and amounts of 
credit provided to Ms [M]. In response  to your assessment which recommends CashEuroNet 
UK uphold  loans which were funded after March 2015, we regret to inform  you that we 
cannot agree to your recommendations. Please note that in CashEuroNet  UKs  initial  
response to FOS we provided detailed information indicating why the loans were  responsibly 
lent to Ms [M]. 
The lender  also said I have now attached the entire  lending process including all the checks 
that we perform prior to lending, the screenshots of customer  applications as well as the 
sample acknowledgement from the contract  that customers have to check  when their 
repayment amount  is greater than their estimated disposable income.
CashEuroNet didnt  comment on our adjudicators  findings about the proportionality  of its 
checks or the affordability of the loans,  nor did it provide any new information for me to 
consider. The lender  said that it carried out adequate and sufficient checks from March 2015 
and, in essence, that its lending from this point onwards cant  have  been  irresponsible.
This Service has responded to CashEuroNet on this generic argument directly  and through  
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to expand on this point any further here, though  I 
have considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. 
I would remind CashEuroNet at this point of the Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA)  guidance 
in how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service  and communicating it to the individuals dealing  with 
complaints in the respondent.
Ref: DRN74618543The document CashEuroNet sent in response to our adjudication is one it seems  to send to 
this Service as a matter of course on most of its complaints. It is a generic document  which 
doesnt directly address  any of the points  made  in the adjudication but explains why it is of 
the view that all of its lending decisions were made responsibly after March  2015. 
As Ive said above,  I am not going  to expand further on this generic argument and I will not 
do so here,  except to reassure CashEuroNet that I have considered  this document when 
making my decision and to point  out that I understand the sample acknowledgement 
highlighted above only applies to customers borrowing deferred payment loans from 
Quick Quid and not to its Flex Credit loans or to instalment loans from Pounds to Pocket. 
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Ms Ms complaint and what both parties  have said 
about this. 
The FCA was the regulator at the time Ms M borrowed the loans I am considering  (loans 
6 to 9). Bearing  in mind the rules and guidance  set out in its Principles for Business (PRIN) 
and its Consumer Credit  Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect a lenders affordability 
assessment to vary with circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here 
because, as before, I would expect CashEuroNet to be conversant  with these through  
previous ombudsman decisions, particularly  recent  decisions  which set these out in detail.) 
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer the lending  relationship.
I agree  with our adjudicator that CashEuroNet ought to have done more  than it did when 
Ms M asked for loans 6 to 9. By the time Ms M asked for her sixth loan, the day after shed 
repaid her fifth, shed  been borrowing continuously from CashEuroNet  for over 18 months. 
Throughout this time CashEuroNet re-lent  to her within  days, and had agreed further capital 
twice. As our adjudicator explained,  by that point the lender should have been  seeking a 
more comprehensive  picture of Ms Ms finances and should not have continued to rely on 
the information she provided because  it ought  to have been concerned about the possibility  
that she wasnt managing to repay  the loans sustainably. 
Ive looked through Ms Ms bank statements and can see that she was paying a 
considerable portion of her income  each month in repaying existing debt,  including credit 
cards, shopping catalogues and several  long term loans.  In addition Ms M was regularly 
borrowing relatively large loans from another short term loan provider each month. And I 
think, had CashEuroNet looked  further into Ms Ms finances to assess  whether or not the 
loans were affordable,  its likely that it would have learnt that she couldnt  afford  to repay  
further credit  in a sustainable manner and, as a responsible lender, would not have agreed  
to lend to her on these  occasions.
So I am upholding Ms Ms complaint about  loans 6 to 9.
Ref: DRN74618544what CashEuroNet should do to put things right
Ive concluded  that CashEuroNet shouldnt  have agreed loans 6 to 9 for Ms M. In order to 
put Ms M back  in the position  she would  have been in, had it not agreed these, 
CashEuroNet should: 
-refund all interest  and charges Ms M paid for loans 6 to 9 inclusive (including any she 
paid on the additional  credit 6a);
-refund all interest  and charges she paid for loans 1, 1a, 3, 5 and 5a as it offered;
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to the 
dates of settlement;
-remove any adverse information about these loans from Ms Ms credit  file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  The lender must 
give Ms M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Ms Ms complaint and direct CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as I have set 
out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 April 2019.
