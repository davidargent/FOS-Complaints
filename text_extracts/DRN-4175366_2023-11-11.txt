The complaint
Mr M complains that PayrNet Limited blocked then closed his account and returned his 
funds to source. Hed like the funds returned and compensation for the impact. 
What happened
Mr M had an account with an agent operating on behalf of PayrNet. For the purposes of my 
decision Ill only refer to PayrNet. 
On 15 June 2022 Mr Ms account was blocked.
PayrNet contacted Mr M and asked him to provide identification, proof of address and proof 
of ownership of the funds in his account  just over £3,700.
PayrNet accepted Mr Ms identification and address information however werent satisfied 
with the evidence Mr M supplied for the source of the funds.
Mr M explained the payments into his account were from a group of his friends. He knew 
them through playing professional poker and the funds were paid in to collect for a holiday 
they were planning. Amongst other documents Mr M provided a handwritten note with a list 
of his friends names and amounts theyd paid in  however he couldnt provide any 
conversations between him and his friends agreeing the transfer of funds. 
PayrNet werent satisfied with his explanation, and also had concerns that the funds were 
moved out to third parties after being received  which they didnt think matched with Mr Ms 
explanation.
Mr M complained to PayrNet about the block, and lack of access to his funds. But, PayrNet 
thought theyd acted fairly in reviewing his account and deciding to return to the funds to 
source  so they didnt uphold his complaint. 
On 13 July 2022 PayrNet returned all of the funds in Mr Ms account to source. 
Mr M brought his complaint to our service. An investigator was allocated to his complaint. 
Our investigator asked Mr M for further evidence and explanation for the funds, however 
Mr M didnt provide any new evidence. He explained hed managed to recover the majority 
of his funds, however he was still missing £1,400 in total from PayrNet, as these funds were 
returned by PayrNet to closed accounts.
He advised £400 of this was due to be returned to an account in his name with a business Ill 
call R, and £1,000 was to a friends account. They asked Mr M for evidence of these returns, 
however Mr M wasnt able to provide anything. 
Our investigator contacted R and asked for confirmation about whether £400 had been 
returned to them from PayrNet. However, R confirmed this wasnt the case. And as Mr Ms 
account was closed any attempted returns would have bounced back to source. 
Overall, our investigator thought PayrNet had acted fairly in blocking and closing Mr Ms 
account. However once the funds to Mr Ms account with R had bounced back to PayrNet, 
they thought the business should have acted more quickly and released them to Mr M. But, 
they hadnt seen any evidence the £1,000 had also bounced back to PayrNet, and therefore 
didnt recommend this was released to Mr M. 
In conclusion, our investigator asked PayrNet to pay Mr M £400 plus 8% interest from 
13 July 2022 to the date the funds are released, and £100 for the inconvenience caused. 
Mr M accepted our investigators view  however, he remained unhappy about not receiving 
the £1,000. I understand PayrNet have recently returned this to him. 
PayrNet havent been clear on whether they accepted our investigators view or not. Theyve 
argued that the £400 was returned to Mr M  however havent provided evidence of this.
As it isnt clear if PayrNet accepted our investigators view its been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered PayrNets actions in restricting and closing Mr Ms account. 
PayrNet are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal and 
regulatory obligations. Theyre also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of new and 
existing relationships. That sometimes means they need to restrict customers accounts  
either in full or partially while they carry out their review. Having looked at whats happened I 
appreciate why Mr M may have found this inconvenient, but PayrNet must ensure they keep 
their due diligence checks updated at all times. 
As part of their review, PayrNet asked Mr M for detailed information about the money in his 
account and where it came from  which theyre entitled to do under their obligations. Having 
reviewed everything, I think PayrNets requests were reasonable in the circumstances. 
Ultimately its PayrNet who decide what information they do or dont require as part of a due 
diligence review and they have a duty to protect their customers money and understand 
where it came from. Because of that, I cant fairly conclude PayrNet acted inappropriately.
At times, following a review, businesses sometimes choose to end their relationship with 
customers. This can be due to a number of reasons and a business isnt obliged to give a 
reason to the customer. Just the same as if Mr M decided to stop banking with PayrNet, they 
wouldnt have to explain why. Based on what PayrNet has shared with me, Im satisfied their 
actions were appropriate in the circumstances.
Funds returned to source
On 13 July 2022 the funds in Mr Ms account were returned to source. Mr Ms managed to 
get the majority of these back now, bar £400 which was due to be sent to his account with R. 
But, I still need to consider if PayrNet acted fairly in initially making the decision to return 
them. For me to say PayrNet acted unfairly Id need to be satisfied Mr M was entitled to the 
funds. And for me to do this Id need sufficient proof.
Ive reviewed the documents Mr M supplied PayrNet and his explanation for why he received 
the funds but having done so Im not satisfied that the evidence he provided is sufficient. It 
follows I cant say PayrNets initial decision to return the funds to source was unfair.On 13 July £400 of the funds were sent back to Mr Ms account with R. Ive seen the 
evidence provided by R which shows these funds werent received, and most likely bounced 
back to PayrNet. As PayrNet made the decision to return these funds to Mr Ms account with 
R on 13 July 2022 I see no reason why these funds werent released to him, using 
alternative account details, soon after they were sent back from R.
Ive also considered whether PayrNet caused Mr M any detriment in not releasing the £1,000 
payment to him sooner. However, I dont think they did. I say this as these funds werent 
returned to an account in Mr Ms name  and as Ive explained the proof of entitlement Mr M 
provided for the funds wasnt sufficient. As Mr M wasnt able to demonstrate his entitlement 
to the £1,000 I cant conclude PayrNet acted unfairly in not returning the £1,000 to Mr M 
sooner.  
Putting things right
As Mr M has been deprived of the use of his funds since 13 July 2022 I think PayrNet should 
pay Mr M 8% simple interest from 13 July 2022 to the date the funds are released to him. 
Mr M has experienced a small amount of inconvenience here, in attempting to chase the 
release of £400. Im satisfied that £100 is fair compensation for this. 
Mr Ms informed our service that hes received £126.39 in redress from PayrNet so far. 
PayrNet havent been clear with Mr M or our service what this payment covers. 
My final decision
My final decision is I partly uphold Mr Ms complaint and direct PayrNet Limited to:
Pay Mr £400 plus 8% interest from the 13 July 2022 to the date the funds are 
released
If they havent done so already pay Mr M £100 in distress and inconvenience
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 December 2023.
