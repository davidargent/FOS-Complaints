The complaint
Mr F is unhappy about the fee Allay Claims Limited is asking him to pay for a successful 
payment protection insurance (PPI) claim.
What happened
In October 2018, Mr F had a successful PPI claim with one of his lenders Ill call M. And 
shortly afterwards Allay asked him to pay their success fee. But Mr F said he hadnt received 
any redress from M. And despite telling Allay this they continued to ask him for their fee 
while also saying they were chasing M for updates. Mr F said after a lengthy investigation it 
was found that his redress had been sent by M but cashed fraudulently.  In July 2020 after 
hed received the redress he paid Allay £800 in recognition of the work theyd done. But said 
the remainder of the fee £702.47 should be waived for the poor service hed received. He 
complained to Allay.
Allay said Mr F had several claims for PPI and theyd provided updates about each case, 
which clearly referenced which claim they were providing the update about. They said theyd 
asked for their success fee for one of Mr Fs claims after M had told them it was successful. 
And that Mr F would receive his redress within 28 days. Allay said the delay in Mr F 
receiving his redress wasnt because of anything theyd done. Allay said at times theyd put 
chasing for their fee on hold while the investigation by M was being carried out but agreed 
their customer service could have been better. To compensate Mr F for this they said theyd 
reduce their fee. As hed already paid £800 the balance left owing would be reduced to 
£530.38 instead of £702.47.
Mr F wasnt happy with Allays response he said the offer hed made was fair and reflected 
Allays lack of service and the amount of time hed spent trying to get the matter resolved. He 
referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator said that Allay had acknowledged their poor customer service but didnt 
think the reduction reflected the trouble and upset caused to Mr F. She asked Allay to pay in 
total £300 for this.
Mr F didnt agree and reiterated the time hed spent and the trouble that had been caused in 
getting his redress. He said Allay should  have done more. He asked for an ombudsman to 
decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so. I partially uphold this complaint. Ill explain why.
I can understand Mr Fs frustration as he was being asked to pay a fee for a claim he said he 
hadnt received any redress for. Being a victim of fraud can be a very distressing time so Im 
pleased that after an investigation Mr F has now received his rightful redress. 
Its not in dispute that Mr F authorised Allay to act on his behalf in pursuing mis sold PPI 
claims. Allay has accepted that their customer service had been poor at times which has 
added to the trouble and upset Mr F has experienced. Whats still in dispute is the level of 
compensation Mr F should be paid to compensate him for this.
In March 2018 Mr F authorised Allay to act on his behalf. Mr F had three accounts with M. 
a loan account, and two credit cards, ****6013 and ****9590. In September 2018 Allay 
updated Mr F about the loan account saying M hadnt found a PPI policy for this account. 
M confirmed they would investigate the mis-sold PPI claims for  ***6013 and ***9590. In 
late November 2018 M said they didnt accept that there was a mis-sold PPI policy for 
****6013.
I can see in September 2018 Allay sent a letter of complaint to M about ***9590. And in 
October 2018 M upheld this complaint and told Allay about the redress theyd pay Mr F to 
compensate him for this. I can see from Ms notification that theyd said the redress would 
be paid to Mr F within 28 days. In early November 2018 Allay sent Mr F an invoice asking 
him to pay their fee for his successful claim.
The agreement Mr F would have had with Allay was on a No win No fee basis. This means 
Allay charged a percentage success fee, not a fee based upon the amount of work they did. 
This meant any work done on any unsuccessful claims would be done for free. Where a 
claim was successful, Allays fee maybe more or less than the value of the work they 
actually did. This is the risk taken by all parties in this type of agreement. Allays terms and 
conditions say:
The fee will be payable to us immediately upon receipt of your refund.
So, I dont think Allay acted unfairly or unreasonably in seeking their success fee after they 
were told by M the claim was successful and theyd expected the redress to have been 
paid within 28 days. Allay asked for a fee in line with their terms and conditions that Mr F had 
agreed to, 24% inclusive of VAT - £1,502.47. 
But in December 2018 I can see Mr F told Allay he hadnt received any redress. And Allay 
put his account into a grace period. This meant they wouldnt send any emails or text 
messages about their fee for a 28-day period. Giving Mr F time to check with M about his 
redress. At the end of the grace period, Mr F told Allay that he still hadnt received any 
redress.
While I can understand Allay asking Mr F for their fee they didnt ask M directly as to what 
was happening until October 2019. I can see M would no longer discuss Mr Fs claim with 
them as the claim had been decided upon. This meant that any updates about the payment 
of the redress was for Mr F to provide to Allay.  I think Allay should have taken this action 
sooner and to have made Mr F aware it would be his responsibility to keep them updated 
about the ongoing investigation into the missing redress. Instead Mr F I think was of the 
understanding that Allay was checking in with M about what was happening.
Allay has accepted they fell short in their customer service and should have made greater 
use of the grace period option while Mr Fs missing redress was being investigated. And by 
not doing so they did add to the trouble and upset Mr F experienced during this time. Allays 
terms and conditions say:We have the right to reduce the % fee charged to you upon successful completion of your 
claim(s).
Allay has used this term to reduce Mr Fs fee in recognition of their shortfall in customer 
service. As Mr F has already paid £800 this meant the outstanding fee has been reduced 
from £702.47 to £530.38. 
As outlined above the agreement Mr F had with Allay was on a No Win No Fee basis and his 
claim was successful, so I think Allay is justified to claim their fee. But I dont think the 
reduction in the fee fully compensates Mr F for the trouble and upset hes experienced. His 
claim was successful in October 2018 but it wasnt until July 2020 that he received his 
redress. I cant hold Allay responsible for the delay as the missing redress wasnt as a result 
of anything theyd done. But they could have provided a better customer service to Mr F 
while he was going through this difficult time. And I agree with our investigator that £300 in 
total (inclusive of the fee reduction) would be a fair and reasonable amount to compensate 
Mr F. 
I know Mr F will be disappointed by my decision, but it isnt our role to punish a business. 
And I think £300 is fair and reasonable.
My final decision
I partially uphold this complaint. And ask Allay Claims Limited to:
pay Mr F an additional £127.91 for the trouble and upset thats been caused on top of 
the £172.09 fee reduction  in total £300 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2022.
