The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank plc wont refund to him the money that he 
paid for a holiday right. His wife is also involved in his complaint and hes being represented 
by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr M and his wife entered into a sales contract in July 2017 to purchase the right to use a 
specified apartment at a specified resort for a specified week of the year. The purchase price 
payable under the sales contract was £3,750 and Mr M made a payment of £400.05 using 
his NatWest credit card in July 2017. Mr Ms representative says that the balance was 
payable by instalments and that Mr M and his wife paid a total of £2,617.40 to the holiday 
company before they ceased making payments after returning from their holiday in 2018.
Mr Ms representative made a claim to NatWest in June 2019 under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the holiday company was in breach of the contract 
and misrepresented the holiday right to Mr M and his wife. NatWest said that the 
documentation received from Mr Ms representative didnt prove that a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation had occurred so it was unable to consider Mr Ms claim and that there had 
been no bank error in the handling of his claim. Mr M wasnt satisfied with its response so a 
complaint was made to this service that the holiday company was in breach of the contract 
by misrepresenting the contract to Mr M and his wife and breaching the EU Timeshare 
Directive. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that NatWests decision to turn down his claim was unfair or unreasonable. She wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think that the 
holiday company had breached the contract agreed between it and Mr M and his wife. 
Mr Ms representative, on Mr Ms behalf, says that it doesnt accept our investigators 
recommendation and would like the matter to be referred to an ombudsman for further 
investigation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ms complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Ms claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right to 
claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);
Mr Ms claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company and that the holiday right was misrepresented to him and his wife and that 
they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented to them;
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not NatWests response to Mr Ms 
claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr Ms complaint form says that the holiday company was in breach of the contract 
by misrepresenting the contract to Mr M and his wife, and his representatives letter 
to NatWest in June 2019 describes the misrepresentations that it says were made to 
Mr M and his wife, including that:
they were advised that the one bedroom apartment would be to the same 
standard as the two bedroom apartment that they viewed;
they were assured that there was evening entertainment and a bar which 
would be open late at night; and
they believed they would be buying into an exclusive membership;
and it says that those promises were untrue;
Mr M and his wife signed the sales contract which included the terms and conditions 
in July 2017 and it identified the apartment for which they were purchasing a right to 
use and said that it was for a maximum of four persons;
Mr Ms representative says that apartment was considerably inferior to the apartment 
that Mr M and his wife had viewed during their tour of the resort, it only had two 
single beds and a sofa (which wasnt suitable to sleep on), there was no table to eat 
from, there was no oven, there was only one wardrobe and the air conditioning was 
faulty  it also says that Mr M and his wife complained to the holiday company but 
were told that there was nothing that could be done;
other than the description of the issues in his representatives claim letter, Mr M 
hasnt provided any other evidence to support his claim about the issues with the 
apartment or to show that he and his wife complained to the holiday company about 
those issues and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
standard of the apartment was misrepresented to them;
Mr Ms representative says that all facilities were closed by 7pm, the resort wasnt 
suitable for a family and Mr M and his family had to go outside of the resort to find 
entertainment;
neither Mr M nor his representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which those alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to them and Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
assured Mr M and his wife that there was evening entertainment and a bar which 
would be open late at night;
Mr Ms representative says that the resort can be booked by non-members via third 
party booking agencies and it has provided evidence of that;
neither Mr M nor his representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the holiday company told Mr M and his wife that the resort 
was exclusive to members, the conversations that took place or the information that 
was provided to them and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that the holiday company told them they the resorts were exclusive to members; 
I dont consider that Mr M or his representative has provided enough evidence to 
show that Mr M and his wife havent received the holiday right that they purchased 
under the sales contract that they signed in July 2017 and Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the holiday right was misrepresented to them by the holiday company or that they were induced into entering into the sales 
contract by any such misrepresentations;
Mr Ms representatives June 2019 letter to NatWest says that the holiday company is 
in breach of the contract between it and Mr M and his wife and Mr Ms complaint form 
says that the holiday company was in breach of the contract by misrepresenting the 
contract to Mr M and his wife and breaching the EU Timeshare Directive;
Mr Ms representative says that the contract is illegal as the holiday right lasts for a 
period in excess of 50 years and there is no fixed accommodation nor a fixed time to 
use it;
the sales contract identifies the apartment and week of enjoyment and it says that the 
duration of the agreement is limited to 50 years (and the terms and conditions says 
that the sales contract will automatically terminate as of a specified date in December 
2048) and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the sales 
contract is illegal or that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday company in 
these circumstances;
Mr Ms representative says that the holiday company demanded and accepted a 
deposit payment on the date that Mr M and his wife signed the sales contract and is 
in breach of the EU Timeshare Directive and other laws and regulations;
its clear that Mr M made a payment of £400.05 using his NatWest credit card on the 
day that he and his wife signed the sales contract  but the sales contract says that 
the purchase price was payable by 36 monthly instalments of £117.34 from October 
2017;
theres no reference in the sales contract to a deposit being payable or to a payment 
of £400.05 and I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show why Mr M 
made the payment of £400.05 using his NatWest credit card at that time  but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of any 
applicable EU directive, regulation or law for which NatWest would be liable under 
section 75 in these circumstances;
Mr M and his wife had signed the sales contract and agreed that theyd:  been 
informed before signing this Sales Contract of his/her/their right of withdrawal within 
fourteen (14) calendar days and that no advanced payments or deposit, no 
guarantees no reservation of monies in accounts, no express acknowledgment of 
debt or any other consideration in favour of the Seller or a third party shall be 
accepted during this period;
even if the holiday company had demanded and accepted a deposit payment on the 
date that Mr M and his wife signed the sales contract in breach of the EU Timeshare 
Directive, Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr M and his wife tried to withdraw from 
the sales contract within the applicable withdrawal period or that they wouldnt have 
gone ahead with the purchase if the deposit payment hadnt been made  so I dont 
consider that any such breach would entitle them to rescind the sales contract or to 
cause there to be an unfair debtor-creditor relationship;
NatWest said that the documentation received from Mr Ms representative didnt 
prove that a breach of contract or misrepresentation had occurred so it was unable to 
consider Mr Ms claim and that there had been no bank error in the handling of his 
claim  I consider that its response to Mr Ms section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable; 
Mr Ms representative says that Mr M and his wife paid a total of £2,617.40 to the 
holiday company before they ceased making payments after returning from their 
holiday in 2018; andI sympathise with Mr M and his wife for the issues that theyve had with the holiday 
right that they purchased, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require NatWest to refund to Mr M any of the money that he 
paid to the holiday company, to pay him any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 October 2023.
