The complaint
Ms H and Mr Y complain that Barclays Bank UK PLC didnt allow them to port their 
mortgage product when they wanted to downsize from their existing property. Ms H and Mr 
Y want Barclays to honour the agreement to port the mortgage product
What happened
Ms H and Mr Y had an interest only mortgage with Barclays which they had for 10 years. 
The mortgage product was a tracker type mortgage at an interest rate of 1.49% per annum 
and was portable subject to conditions. Ms H and Mr Y sold their existing property for 
£1.175m on 23 July 2019 discharging a Barclays mortgage of £600,000.00. Most of the 
equity went on discharging a mortgage they had on a property abroad. They wanted to buy 
a new property for £300,000 with a Barclays repayment mortgage of £285,000 to be repaid 
over 10 years. Barclays quoted them a monthly payment of £2,600. They previously paid 
about £744 per month.
On 2 September 2019, Barclays wrote to Mr Y to say that it had refused their application as 
your income is insufficient to support the level of borrowing you have requested. Ms H and 
Mr Y complained to Barclays which again declined the application. In its final response letter 
Barclays broadened the reasons for its refusal saying that its decision was based on the 
information you have provided during the application process. Based on my investigation 
you do not meet the criteria for lending. Ms H and Mr Y brought their complaint to us.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld as she felt that 
Barclays had given fair and reasonable consideration to Ms Hs and Mr Ys application. But 
Ms H and Mr Y disagreed saying in summary that its unfair to be refused an application 
without an adequate reason and suspect that it maty be because of the favourable rate of 
interest they were on.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms H and Mr Y wanted to port their mortgage product when they were downsizing after 
selling their property. The proposed new mortgage was substantially less than their existing 
mortgage and the overall risk to Barclays would be less on the new property than on their 
existing one. But as a new mortgage, it required a new mortgage application. So, Ms H and 
Mr Y, as is common in most porting applications would have to meet Barclays lending 
criteria at the time that they applied for the new mortgage.
Ms H and Mr Y both owned 50% of the shares in a consulting company, which was their 
main business and source of income in the UK. In order to assess the affordability of the 
mortgage, Barclays were relying on what Ms H and Mr Y told them about their income, the 
companys accounts, information supplied by their accountants and their tax returns.  Ive 
reviewed the application and the documentation supplied by Ms H and Mr Y and summarise 
as follows:
 Ms H and Mr Y completed an application on 27 July 2019. Both held a 50% 
shareholding in an IT consulting company and in their application set out their share 
of the net profit from this company. Ms Hs says in the year to April 2018, her share 
of the net profit was £125,484.00 and in the year to April 2019, £135,829.50. Mr Y 
said his share of the net profits was £173,899.00 to April 2018 and £161,641.50 to 
April 2019.
 In support of the application Ms H and Mr Y supplied accounts from the company for 
these years. The net after tax profit for the company for the last three years to 
November 2018 were £23,458.00, £31,097.00 and £33,287.00. The accounts to 
November 2018 were draft at that stage.
 These accounts supplied show that the shareholders jointly took a dividend income 
of £22,000 to November 2016, none to the year November 2017 and £54,000 
dividend income to November 2018.
 In support of the application Ms H and Mr Y provided a letter from their accountant 
dated 16 April 2019 saying that the dividend income for each shareholder was in 
2016 £20,867.00, in 2017 £10,999,00 and in 2018 £27,000,00.
 Barclays asked for further information from Ms H and Mr Y looking for the last 2years 
tax calculations and tax overviews and for the final accounts for 2018.
 Mr Y produced a tax computation showing a total income of £25,000 to April 2017 of 
which £11,000 was dividend. The remainder was £8,000 from his employment and 
£7,000 described as UK pension and state benefits, For the following year to 5 April 
2018 his taxable income was £48,000 of which £8,000 was employment and 
£40,000 Pension and state benefits. No dividend income was recorded as paid in 
that year
 The updated accounts to November 2018 show that the company instead of making 
a £33,000 profit made a loss a loss of £12,959 to November 2018. The loss in the 
accounts occurred because the £54,000 which was to be paid as a dividend was in 
fact paid to sub-contractors which increased the cost of sales and meant that the 
company went from a net profit of £33,000 to a loss.
Barclays initial letter said that it refused Ms H and Mr Ys application because the mortgage 
was unaffordable. I have gone through the accounts information provided by Ms H and Mr 
Y.I note that the income they were relying on to repay the mortgage was the profit from their 
company. In the last three years of trading, according to the final accounts, that company 
made an average profit of £17,000 per annum. Ms H and Mr Y were applying for a 
mortgage that would cost over £30,000 per year. With this information I dont believe that 
Barclays initial conclusion that the mortgage was unaffordable was unreasonable. 
But this was a mortgage application which fell within the MCOB Rule 11.7.1. The effect of 
that is that Barclays didnt have to consider the affordability of the mortgage if the mortgage 
was in Ms H and Mr Ys best interests - although of course affordability might be a factor to 
consider in working out what those best interests were. Its not clear to me, however, that 
such an assessment of Ms H and Mr Ys best interests was done, and I would have 
concerns about the refusal of the application if affordability alone was the sole basis for the 
refusal.
But I note that Barclays, in response to the complaint, widened its reasoning for refusing the 
application and I can see that there is a more serious issue here. Firstly, its clear that the 
drafts accounts to 2018 that were presented to Barclays gave a misleading picture of a 
profitable company and were intended to convey to Barclays that the accounts were sound enough to allow the shareholders to draw a £54,000 dividend. This information was 
repeated to Barclays by their accountants. In act that £54,000 had been paid by the 
company to contractors and so was a cost to the company and not available to be paid as a 
dividend.
But I have a greater concern about the credibility of the documentation provided to Barclays.  
Clearly there is a major gap between what Ms H and Mr Y said about the company profits 
and what was recorded in the accounts. Ms H and Mr Y told Barclays that the company was 
making profits of about £300,000 per year in 2017/18 and 2018/19. Indeed, they provide 
precise figures as to their individual shares in those profits down to the last 50p. But the 
stated profits bear no relationship to either what appears in the company accounts or the tax 
information provided to HMRC and then to Barclays. 
With that divergence I can understand Barclays concerns that the documentation provided 
to it didnt reflect accurately the true financial position of the company. In those 
circumstances I believe it was reasonable for Barclays to widen the grounds of its refusal 
based on its concerns with the credibility of the information produced during the application 
process. I dont doubt that any responsible lender faced with such a divergence would have 
acted as Barclays did in these circumstances in refusing the application. So, although I have 
concerns, as stated above, about how Barclays applied the rules to the application, when I 
consider what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances, I dont find fault with Barclays 
and so I dont uphold this complaint.
I also note, although it wasnt part of the complaint, that Mr Y mentioned to our investigator 
that the reason they applied for a repayment mortgage was that Barclays told them they 
wouldnt get an interest-only mortgage. It seems to me that even if such a mortgage should 
have been made available to them, Barclays objections to lending to Ms H and Mr Y - due 
to its concerns with the credibility of the information it was being given - would equally have 
applied if they had in fact made such an application which would have led to a refusal. So, I 
cant see that Ms H and Mr Y would have benefited even if they had been able to apply for 
an interest-only mortgage. There is one final matter. Barclays offered to pay Ms H and Mr Y 
£150 because of a delay in processing the application. Barclays has accepted that there 
were technical problems and I believe that this is fair compensation for the trouble caused 
by this service issue
my final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H and Mr Y to 
accept or reject my decision before 24 September 2020.
