The complaint
Mr B complains that Acasta European Insurance Company Limited (Acasta) has declined 
his claim on his Complete Wheel Protection insurance policy. 
What happened
The background of this complaint is well known to both parties and has been detailed by 
our investigator previously. So, Ill summarise the key points Ive focused on within my 
decision.
Mr B took out a three-year wheel protection policy that started on 29 August 2018.
On 16 September 2021 Mr B made a claim for damage that occurred on 29 August 
2021. But Acasta declined it as it said the policy had expired. 
Mr B disagreed he sent evidence to Acasta that the policy expired on 29 August 
2021 and therefore feels the claim should be honoured. Acasta didnt agree or 
uphold Mr Bs complaint. 
Our investigator investigated the complaint but didnt uphold it. Mr B disagrees and 
has asked for an ombudsman to make a decision. 
The complaint has therefore been passed to me, an ombudsman, to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
On 16 September 2021, Mr B made a claim on his policy for damage that he said happened 
to two alloy wheels at 7pm on 29 August 2021. What I need to consider is whether Mr Bs 
Acasta policy was in place at the time he said the damage occurred. If it didnt, then I 
wouldnt expect Acasta to consider any claim as it would sit outside of the period of 
insurance.
Mr B says his policy states that it expires 29 August 2021 and his understanding of this is 
that he still had cover for 24 hours on that day. 
Ive therefore looked at the evidence Mr B has relied on to say he had cover on the 29 
August 2021. The screenshot he provided is an online copy of his policy details, it shows the 
following relevant information;
Term: 3 years
Policy start date: 29/08/2018
Expires: 29/08/2021 (Expired)
I understand that Mr B thinks he still had 24 hours cover on the 29 August. But I disagree. 
The policy document clearly shows that the end date is the 29 August and it has expired, so 
cover only exists up to the expiration date (28 August 2021).
I am therefore persuaded that the incident Mr B has claimed for, took place after the policy 
has ended. And Acasta has fairly and reasonably declined the claim on this basis. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 November 2021.
