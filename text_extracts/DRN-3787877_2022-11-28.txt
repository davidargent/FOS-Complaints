The complaint
Mrs M complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has breached the terms of a fixed sum loan agreement that she used to pay for a 
bathroom to be supplied and installed. Her husband is also involved in her complaint.
What happened
Mrs M entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in June 2021 
for a loan to pay for a bathroom to be supplied and installed. The cash price was shown on 
the loan agreement as £9,246.51 and she made an advance payment of £925 so the 
amount of the loan was £8,321.51. The first repayment was due twelve months after 
Barclays Partner Finance paid the retailer and there were then to be 48 monthly repayments 
of £210.57.
Barclays Partner Finance paid the supplier in November 2021 but Mrs M complained to it. 
She said that it had breached the loan agreement because it shouldnt have paid the 
supplier until after she received the goods and services and that hadnt happened as there 
were still issues with the bathroom. 
Barclays Partner Finance said that it can pay the amount of the loan to the supplier once it 
has supplied the goods or services and that Mrs Ms account was activated in accordance 
with her loan agreement. It said that it had raised a separate claim under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 about the issues with the bathroom. Mrs M wasnt satisfied with 
its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She said that 
confirmation had been provided by the supplier that the installation had been completed and 
she thought that Barclays Partner Finance acted reasonably in make a payment to it. 
Mrs Ms husband, on her behalf has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. He has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, 
that 
the installation hasnt been completed and if the supplier were to go out of business it 
will never finish the bathroom and Mrs M will never get her money back  and that 
wouldnt be the case if Barclays Partner Finance had waited for the installation to be 
completed before making payment;
he confirmed to the supplier in September 2021 that the installation wasnt complete 
and the finance was activated two months after that;
the supplier said that they would be able to raise any problems with the bathroom 
before the finance was activated and it was their intention to repay the loan in full as 
soon as the installation was complete;
Barclays Partner Finance never gave them a chance to explain their complaint and 
didnt reply to any of the emails that it was sent about the complaint; and
the section 75 claim is separate to this and Barclays Partner Finance wrongly 
activated the finance.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mrs M entered into the loan agreement which said: We will pay this amount directly 
to the retailer once we have approved the loan or on a later date requested by the 
retailer; and the pre-contract credit information that Barclays Partner Finance 
provided to Mrs M said: We will pay the amount of the loan to the retailer once we 
approve the loan and receive the signed agreement or when the retailer has supplied 
the goods or services to you, if this is later;
the bathroom was installed in September 2021 and an installation declaration of 
completion was signed by the installer  it was also signed by Mrs Ms husband and 
immediately below his signature it said: Please sign once your installation is fully 
completed; and there was a box for customers comments but he hadnt added any 
comments;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mrs Ms husband to not have signed 
the declaration of completion and to have provided some comments about any 
issues that he had with the bathroom;
the supplier sent an e-mail later in September 2021 in which it said: Please can you 
confirm if your installation is now fully completed or do you have anything that is 
outstanding yet to be installed? - to which Mrs Ms husband replied with information 
about three issues;
Mrs M and her husband clearly feel very strongly that the issues that were raised in 
September 2021 show that the bathroom installation hadnt been completed and that 
Barclays Partner Finance shouldnt have activated the loan agreement;
I consider that it was fair and reasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to rely on the 
declaration of completion that had been signed by the installer and Mrs Ms husband 
as evidence that the supplier had supplied the bathroom to Mrs M and for it to 
release the payment to the supplier  although it didnt make the payment to the 
supplier until November 2021;
Im not persuaded that the issues that were raised with the supplier after the 
declaration of completion had been signed are enough to show that Barclays Partner 
Finance shouldnt have activated the loan;
Mrs Ms husband has described further issues that there have been with the 
bathroom and Barclays Partner Finance may be liable for a breach of contract by the 
supplier under section 75 but that is being dealt with separately and doesnt form part 
of this complaint;
if the supplier stops trading before any issues with the bathroom for which it would be 
liable are completed, that is likely be a breach of contract by the supplier for which 
Barclays Partner Finance may also be liable under section 75  but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that the supplier has stopped trading so Im unable to make any 
finding on that issue;
Mrs M complained to Barclays Partner Finance in May 2022 and discussed her 
complaint with it - it didnt uphold her complaint and issued its final response letter to 
her in June 2022;Im not persuaded that Barclays Partner Finance has acted incorrectly in these 
circumstances; and 
I sympathise with Mrs M for the issues that shes had with the bathroom but I find that 
it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to cancel 
the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 December 2022.
