K821x#15complaint
Miss B complains  that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie,SCA has refunded a payment to a credit 
card that is no longer  active.
background
Miss B says she bought an item for £52 and later asked PayPal for a refund. She says 
PayPal refunded her money but not to her PayPal account as she was expecting. Miss B 
says that refund was applied to a credit card account that is no longer open. She says shes  
been told by the credit card company that PayPal  needs  to request a refund of the money.
PayPal doesnt  accept making a mistake and says it refunded  the money to the credit card 
that was used for the original purchase.  It says Miss B didnt  use her PayPal account to 
make the purchase  and its provided  her with a reference so that she can trace  the money. It 
also says it had no evidence that the credit card was closed until after the refund.
Miss B brought her complaint to us and our investigator upheld it. She thought PayPal hadnt 
provided any evidence  that it had tried to trace the money and so recommended it pay Miss 
B the £52.
Miss B accepts that view but PayPal doesnt  and has asked for an ombudsmans review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so I think the fairest  
approach here would be for PayPal to pay Miss B the £52 and request that the £52 it 
refunded to Miss Bs former credit card provider  be returned to it.
I make  it clear  to the parties that I dont think PayPal made a mistake by refunding the 
money to the credit  card Miss B used for the original purchase.  I also dont think, unless Miss 
B told it, that PayPal  could know the account  had been closed. So I think Miss B should take 
some responsibility for what  took place as Im satisfied that she didnt use her PayPal 
account for this transaction.
Im satisfied that Miss B has tried to find out where  the money went. And I accept that the 
provider of her credit  card has told her that PayPal  should request  that the money be 
refunded. I dont think PayPal has tried to trace the money and has told Miss B its up to her 
to find out where  it is. So I agree with the investigator that PayPal could have done more to 
assist Miss B when  it became aware of the problem. And I would have expected  PayPal to 
have contacted the credit card provider to find out what if anything could be done and which  
party had the authority  to request the money. As PayPal hasnt done so, Ive come to the 
same overall view as the investigator about what would be the fairest approach here.
