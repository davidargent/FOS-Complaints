The complaint
Mr D says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him. He says no account was taken of whether he could afford the lending and he had a 
bad credit rating. The lending had a detrimental impact on his life.            
What happened
This complaint is about one running credit facility followed by 17 short-term loans (Ill refer to 
them all as loans in my decision and have numbered them for reference) Sunny provided to 
Mr D between September 2014 and January 2017. Mr Ds borrowing history is as follows:

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ds complaint and thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been given as Mr Ds borrowing behaviour would suggest he was 
persistently reliant on the lending. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan ten onwards. We put the 
offer to Mr D, but he wasnt willing to accept it.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me to decide in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr D could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);                        
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);                                          
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr D didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr D had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
Mr Ds complaint in part. Ill explain why.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr D, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
After doing so, and given the particular circumstances of Mr Ds case, like the adjudicator I 
think that this point was reached by loan six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr D was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr D had been indebted to Sunny for 12 months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr D was having to borrow further to cover 
the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ds 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mr Ds first loan, excluding the running credit facility (loan one), was for £150 and 
loan loan six was for the same amount.  At this point Sunny ought to have known that 
Mr D was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet 
an ongoing need. 
 
Mr D was repaying his loans well before the agreed term of the loan and while I 
accept this would have save him interest charges, he was then returning for further 
borrowing within days or weeks of settling a previous one. As examples, loan nine 
was taken the day after loan eight was repaid and loan ten was taken the same day 
that loan nine was repaid. Given the nature of short-term lending, I would question 
why someone would repay a loan early only to come back shortly afterwards for 
further borrowing. And in the case of Mr D, for the same amount as the previous loan 
(with the exception of loan 18).
 Mr D wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 18 was 
taken out over two years after Mr Ds first. Mr D had paid large amounts of interest to, 
in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period. Sunny has said there 
were gaps in the lending between loans one and two and then loans 12 and 13. But 
these gaps were only for two months and I dont agree this was a sufficient amount of 
time for Sunny to have assumed that Mr D had overcome the circumstances that led 
him into taking high cost credit in the first instance.
 
I think that Mr D lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr D borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ds ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, like the adjudicator Im also upholding the complaint about loans six to 18 and Sunny 
should put things right.
 Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr D paid on six to 18;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 
the number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans six to 18 should be removed from 
Mr Ds credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ds complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 May 2020.
