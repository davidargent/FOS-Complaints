The complaint
Mrs B complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, trading as Barclaycard, wont refund to her the 
money that she paid to a holiday company. Shes being represented in her complaint by a 
claims management company.
What happened
Mrs B entered into a purchase and sale agreement with a resort company in December 2014 
to buy a 128,000 out of a total of 420,960,000 interest in a vacation resort. The final 
purchase price was US$20,149, she entered into a mortgage deed and a promissory note 
with the resort company in which she promised to pay it US$14,104.40 by monthly payments 
of US$242.18, and she paid a deposit of US$6,044.70. Mrs B also entered into a vacation 
ownership assignment agreement and use restriction in which she assigned the use, 
occupancy and possessory rights in the property to a trust, to be administered in accordance 
with a trust agreement and a vacation plan and 128,000 vacation club membership points 
were assigned to her to reserve use of property in accordance with the Trust Agreement.
Mrs B says that shes only been able to book one holiday due to there being no availability 
when shes tried to book and, if shed been told that she needed to book more than a year in 
advance, she wouldnt have gone through with the purchase. She also says that shes been 
told that the timeshare that shes purchased wouldn't get her anywhere to which she actually 
wants to go. A claim was then made to Barclaycard about those issues under section 75 of 
the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Barclaycard responded to that claim in May 2020 and said that no breach of contract or 
misrepresentation had been established from the evidence provided. Mrs B wasnt satisfied 
with its response so a complaint was made to this service. Her complaint form says that the 
resort company is in breach of the contract by misrepresenting the contract to Mrs B and 
breaching the EU Timeshare Directive. 
Barclaycard then issued a final response letter to Mrs B in January 2021. It said that the 
terms and conditions of the contract stipulate that the plan manager reserves the right to limit 
availability of accommodation and that Mrs B is entitled to a thirteen month advance 
reservation priority and an eleven month reciprocal reservation priority. It said that it was 
unable to prove a breach of contract or validate Mrs Bs claim under section 75.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Bs complaint should be upheld. He didnt think 
that Barclaycards decision to turn down her claim was unfair or unreasonable as he wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale.
Mrs Bs representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says that the contract and addendum document support the claim that Mrs B 
has made that she was purchasing bricks and mortar. It also says that she was misled into 
the belief they she was purchasing property, not a timeshare which merely gives her rights of 
occupancy, and she didnt wish to buy a timeshare but was interested in ownership of bricks 
and mortar. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Bs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mrs Bs claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right to 
claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclaycards response to 
Mrs Bs claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mrs B entered into the purchase and sale agreement to buy a 128,000 out of a total 
of 420,960,000 interest in a vacation resort and she also entered into a vacation 
ownership assignment agreement and use restriction in which she assigned the use, 
occupancy and possessory rights in the property to a trust, to be administered in 
accordance with a trust agreement and a vacation plan, and 128,000 vacation club 
membership points were assigned to her to reserve use of property in accordance 
with the Trust Agreement;
I consider it to be clear that the effect of the documents that Mrs B entered into in 
December 2014 was that she obtained 128,000 vacation club membership points 
that she could use to reserve property in the resort companys vacation resorts;
the final purchase price payable by Mrs B was US$20,149 and she entered into a 
mortgage deed and a promissory note with the resort company in which she 
promised to pay it US$14,104.40 by monthly payments of US$242.18 and she also 
paid a deposit of US$6,044.70; 
Barclaycard says that Mrs B has been paying the monthly instalments on her 
Barclaycard and it has provided statements for her credit card account which show 
some of the monthly payments to the resort company;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs B paid the deposit using her Barclaycard so 
the only payments that its evident that shes made using her Barclaycard are the 
payments under the mortgage deed and promissory note so the only claim that shed 
be able to make to Barclaycard under section 75 would be that theres been a breach 
of contract or misrepresentation by the resort company about the mortgage deed and 
promissory note;
Mrs Bs claim relates to the purchase and sale agreement and the vacation 
ownership assignment agreement and use restriction and Ive seen no evidence to 
show that theres been a breach of the mortgage deed and promissory note or that 
those agreements were misrepresented to her;
I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for Barclaycard to have 
rejected Mrs Bs section 75 claim for that reason;
even if Mrs B did pay the deposit using her Barclaycard, I dont consider that shes 
provided enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the resort company;
Mrs B said in a statement that she:  purchased the timeshare whilst on holiday at 
the resort; but that shes only been able to book one holiday due to there being no 
availability when shes tried to book and, if shed been told that she needed to book more than a year in advance, she wouldnt have gone through with the purchase  
and that shes been told that the timeshare that shes purchased wouldn't get her 
anywhere to which she actually wants to go;
she completed a form from the resort company which asked for her top three reasons 
for choosing its vacation club membership points by writing: Because we travel [a] 
lot; and: We loved the idea;
neither Mrs B nor her representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to her before she 
entered into the agreements in December 2014;
theres no reference in Mrs Bs statement or the form that she completed to her 
believing that she was buying property and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that Mrs B was led to believe that she was purchasing property 
rather than vacation club membership points and that she didnt wish to buy vacation 
club membership points;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the resort company 
misrepresented these arrangements to Mrs B or that she was induced into entering 
into the agreements by any such misrepresentations;
Mrs B signed a reciprocal advance reservation priority certificate in December 2014 
which set out the usage rules and advance reservation priority to which Mrs B was 
entitled and Im not persuaded that the issues with availability and choice of resorts 
that Mrs B has described would amount to a breach of contract for which Barclaycard 
would be liable under section 75;
Mrs Bs complaint form says that the holiday company is in breach of the contract by 
misrepresenting the contract to Mrs B and breaching the EU Timeshare Directive but 
the property and the resort company are both in the US and Ive seen no evidence to 
show that the EU Timeshare Directive would apply in these circumstances;
Mrs Bs complaint form provides no further information about the alleged breaches of 
contract by the resort company and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that theres been a breach of contract by the resort company for which 
Barclaycard would be liable under section 75;
I sympathise with Mrs B for the issues that shes had with her use of the vacation 
club membership points but I consider that Barclaycards response to the section 75 
claim that had been made to it was fair and reasonable in the circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclaycard to refund to 
Mrs B any of the money that shes paid to the resort company, to pay her any 
compensation or to take any action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 January 2024.
