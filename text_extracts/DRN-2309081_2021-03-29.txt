The complaint
Mr and Mrs A say they were put under pressure to reduce the debt on their The One 
Account mortgage with The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc in 2013. They say this caused them 
financial difficulties until they were able to remortgage elsewhere in 2018.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
Although Ive read and considered the whole file, Ill keep my comments to what I think is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point, its not because Ive not considered it but 
because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach the right outcome.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons.
Mr and Mrs A took out this mortgage in 2001. They opted to take it on a repayment basis, 
which means Mr and Mrs A should have been leaving enough in the account each month so 
that the balance would reduce. As you have decided to repay your One account borrowing 
each month over the next 20 years your planned balance should reduce every month.
Instead, throughout the life of the account Mr and Mrs A were frequently up to the facility 
limit. The review in December 2012 showed the outstanding balance was £118,494 against 
the £89,829 it should have been at that point if the mortgage was on track to be repaid in 
2026 (which was the contractual end date). That means Mr and Mrs A were around £28,600 
behind plan.
In June 2013 Mr and Mrs A were around £30,600 behind plan; they had an oustanding 
balance of £117,946 against a planned balance of £87,282.
As the situation was worsening RBS contacted Mr and Mrs A to discuss matters, and the 
account was set so each year the available facility would be reduced so Mr and Mrs A didnt 
find themselves at the end of the term with an oustanding debt of over £100,000 and no way 
to repay it.
Mr and Mrs A have said their difficulties came about due to redundancy in late 2008 / early 
2009 but that isnt supported by the evidence. From the time the One account had been 
taken out Mr and Mrs A had requested and received an increased borrowing facility on more 
than one occasion, and the statements we have on file dont show any notable decrease in 
the amount owed, other than in the six months after Mrs As redundancy; that is, in 
December 2008 Mr and Mrs A owed £117,987 but by June 2009 that had decreased to 
£112,334. Unfortunately their debt then increased again over the years until RBS put the 
reducing limit annual reviews in place in 2013.
In 2008 Mrs As net income that was paid into the account was around £17,340, whereas in 
2009 Mrs A had around £21,640 paid in; an increase of £4,300. So whilst Mrs A was made 
redundant in December 2008 / January 2009 she had a higher net income in the year after 
redundancy than she did in the year before. 
Mrs A has said she took a £10,000 paycut but having reviewed the transactions that doesnt 
seem right. In October and November 2008 her net monthly income credited to the account 
was £1,340 (albeit she was paid four-weekly, so there would be 13 payments in a year 
rather than 12). She started her new job in April 2009 and her monthly income for that was 
£1,240; so about £2,500 less net a year. But by December 2009 shed received a payrise 
that took her net income to around £1,420 a month; so an almost idential net annual salary 
to the job shed been made redunandant from. Once the lump sums Mrs A received were 
added on, as I said she received over £4,000 more in the year after redunancy. In that time 
Mr As income remained fairly static.
Having considered everything I cant see how Mrs As redundancy caused any financial 
difficulties in itself as the figures just dont support that, instead it seems more a case that for 
the seven years the account had been running up to that point the debt had been increasing, 
rather than decreasing. In that context I can see why RBS felt Mr and Mrs A may have 
needed a more rigid plan to repay their debt by the end of the term.
Whilst I can understand how unwelcome Mr and Mrs A may have found it having RBS 
reduce their facility limit I think it was well-intentioned. There was a very real risk that 
Mr and Mrs A would still owe a substantial sum at the end of the term based on how the 
account had been running until that point. Whilst Mr and Mrs A have referred to this being 
two facility decreases, in reality it was only one. Thats because the 2013 decrease was only 
£1; taking the facility limit from £120,000 to £119,999. The 2014 decrease took the facility 
limit down to £112,546, so in a full two-year period that was only a £7,454 decrease needed 
in the amount owed.
In 2015 RBS asked Mr and Mrs A if they wanted to continue with the facility decreases, and 
when they said they didnt want to they were cancelled and the account facility was left at the 
limit it was at.
Mr and Mrs A have said they built up £20,000 in credit card debts due to the facility 
decreases which they were only able to pay off when they remortgaged in 2018. 
Unfortunately they were unable to provide credit card statements to show that debt had built 
up due to putting their day-to-day living expenses on the cards between 2013 and 2015. 
After the facility decreases were cancelled in 2015 the account balance continued to fall 
significantly, which indicates those reductions were affordable and a choice. In December 
2015 Mr and Mrs A had a facility limit of £112,546 and an outstanding balance of £100,414. 
That means they had £12,132 to draw down if they wanted to.
By December 2016 theyd paid a large amount off their mortgage, with the debt being down 
to £86,989. Mr and Mrs A have said £5,000 of that was a loan from their parents to help 
reduce the balance so they could apply for a remortgage and that loan had to be paid back, 
but even if that was the case that still left over £8,000 Mr and Mrs D had paid off the debt in 
a year which could have gone towards paying what I would assume were higher 
interest-bearing credit cards.
Were not the regulator so it isnt our place to fine or punish a business. We investigate if something has gone wrong and, if something has gone wrong, what needs to be done to put 
right any financial loss arising from that. Mr and Mrs A havent been able to prove any 
financial loss from the facility reductions, so theres nothing for me to order RBS to do to put 
things right even if I did think it had done something wrong. 
I understand from some recent communications that RBS has offered £200 compensation to 
Mr and Mrs A in recognition of any distress and inconvenience caused. All things considered 
Im satisifed thats a fair offer and I wouldnt have ordered any more.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint in the sense I consider the £200 offer already made to be fair 
and reasonable.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs A to 
accept or reject my decision before 27 April 2021.
