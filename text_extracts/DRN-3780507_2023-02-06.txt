The complaint
Mr E complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he paid for a holiday club membership. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a legal adviser. 
What happened
Mr E and his wife entered into a holiday ownership agreement in September 2008. The 
purchase price, including fees, for the membership was £4,895 and Mr E entered into a 
credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance that he signed in September 2008 for 
credit that he used to pay for the it. The credit agreement said that the purchase wouldnt be 
charged to his account for six months. Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit was 
repaid in March 2009.
Mr E wrote to Barclays Partner Finance in February 2021 and said that it appeared that the 
credit intermediary recorded on the loan agreement wasnt permitted or authorised to 
arrange loans  and he asked it to explain its position. Barclays Partner Finance replied to 
Mr Es letter in March 2021 and said that the purchase was made in October 2008 so was 
time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980. Mr E then complained to this service and his 
representative wrote a detailed complaint letter to this service in July 2021.
That letter said, in summary and amongst other things, that the credit intermediary wasnt 
authorised to arrange the loan which makes it unlawful, Mr E purchased the loan following a 
lengthy and pressurised sales presentation, the membership points were misrepresented to 
Mr E, there was an unfair relationship between Mr E and Barclays Partner Finance pursuant 
to section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act, there was no evidence that a credit check was 
conducted before the loan was granted and the high interest rate was also an indication of 
an unfair relationship.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Es complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of the misrepresentation claim 
that was made under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act and of the section 140A claim to 
turn them down. He said that it was likely that the retailer identified on the loan agreement 
acted as a credit broker and it held a consumer credit licence. He also said that he hadnt 
seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr E.
Mr Es representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded to our investigators recommendations in detail and says, in 
summary and amongst other things, that:
 the ombudsman service isnt required to follow the relevant law, guidance and 
practice but to reach an evaluative assessment of the merits of Barclays Partner 
Finances decision;
 facts relevant to Mr Es cause of action under both sections 75 and 140A werent 
known to him when he entered into the loan in 2008, were concealed from him at the 
point of sale and were only revealed when he sought advice having seen material 
online about the mis-selling of timeshares;
 the misrepresentations were fraudulently made and Mr Es claims arent statue 
barred as the limitation periods have been extended under section 32 of the 
Limitation Act; and
 Barclays Partner Finance hasnt satisfied its regulatory obligation to assess Mr Es 
creditworthiness before arranging the loan. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Es complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
 we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
 Mr Es complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that he 
would have been able to make under sections 75 and 140A - but I need to consider 
whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to his claims;
 Im not determining the outcome of Mr Es claims under sections 75 and 140A in this 
decision as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
 section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
 Mr Es claim under section 75 is that the membership was misrepresented to him and 
that he wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to him - if the criteria 
for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would be expected 
to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time limits set out 
in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act 
and to not consider the claim;
 the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
 I consider that Mr E could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into buying the membership in September 2008 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been incurred 
as that was when he also entered into the credit agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance;
 I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made 
until July 2021, more than twelve years later which was outside of the time limits set 
out in the Limitation Act so I consider that Mr Es misrepresentation claim is now 
time-barred; Mr Es representative says that facts relevant to Mr Es cause of action werent 
known to him when he entered into the credit agreement in 2008  but when he had 
the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist him for the purposes of the Limitation 
Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are extended where 
a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but 
I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr Es claim;
 Mr Es representative says that facts relevant to Mr Es cause of action were 
deliberately concealed from him and that misrepresentations were fraudulently made 
to him so the time limits are postponed under section 32;
 section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been 
deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the 
debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have 
been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a 
breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate 
concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
 I dont consider that Mr Es representative has set out what the false statements of 
fact were that it says could amount to fraudulent misrepresentations and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a deliberate 
concealment of any relevant information in these circumstances - so I dont consider 
that section 32 is applicable to Mr Es claim; 
 Mr Es representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr E and 
Barclays Partner Finance and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
 the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
 Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that the credit of £4,895 
was repaid in March 2009 - so Mr E would have had six years from then to bring a 
claim against either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance;
 Mr E didnt raise his concerns about the authorisation of the credit intermediary with 
Barclays Partner Finance until February 2021, and there was no reference to a claim 
under section 140A until Mr Es representatives letter to this service in July 2021 
which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that his 
claim under section 140A is now also time-barred;
 the retailer is named on the credit agreement and Barclays Partner Finance says that 
the retailer was on-boarded in January 2008 and, as part of the on-boarding 
process, it would have had a consumer credit licence from the Office of Fair Trading;
 Im not persuaded that Mr E and his representative have provided enough evidence 
to show that the retailer wasnt licenced to arrange the credit for Mr E in September 
2008 or that the credit was provided to him unlawfully;
 Mr Es representative says that Barclays Partner Finance hasnt satisfied its 
regulatory obligation to assess Mr Es creditworthiness before arranging the credit  
but the credit was repaid in March 2009 and Ive seen no evidence to show that the 
credit wasnt affordable for Mr E when it was made available to him or that hes 
experienced any financial difficulties as a result of the credit being provided to him;
 Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr E or his representative asked Barclays Partner Finance for any information about its credit checks before July 2021  as the credit 
was made available to him in September 2008 I consider that it would be reasonable 
to expect him to have raised any concerns about the credit checks before then;
 as Barclays Partner Finance wasnt asked for information about the credit checks 
until more than eleven years after the credit agreement ended, I dont consider that it 
was required to have retained information about any affordability assessment that 
was conducted in September 2008;
 Mr Es representative says that the high interest rate that Mr E was expected to pay 
is also an indication of an unfair relationship  but Mr E signed the credit agreement 
which clearly set out the annual rate of interest (and the APR) and the amount of 
credit and immediately above his signature it says This is a Credit Agreement 
regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be legally 
bound by its terms;
 if the terms of the credit agreement werent acceptable to Mr E I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect him not to have signed the credit agreement;
 the loan agreement also set out Mr Es right to cancel the loan agreement within 
fourteen days but Ive seen no evidence to show that he tried to cancel the loan 
agreement within that period;
 Mr E used £4,895 of credit to pay for the membership in September 2008 and the 
credit agreement said that the purchase wouldnt be charged to his account for six 
months  he paid £4,895 to Barclays Partner Finance in March 2009 to repay that 
credit so I dont consider that he paid any interest to Barclays Partner Finance for the 
credit;
 Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr E was unduly 
pressured into buying the membership or entering into the credit agreement or that 
the holiday company used unacceptable commercial practices against him  he 
didnt contact Barclays Partner Finance about any issues relating to the credit until 
February 2021 (more than twelve years after he entered into the credit agreement) 
and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained to 
Barclays Partner Finance about any such issues before then;
 I consider that Barclays Partner Finances response to Mr E was fair and reasonable 
and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it has acted 
incorrectly in these circumstances; and
 I sympathise with Mr E for the issues that hes described but I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to him any of 
the money that he paid for the membership, to pay him any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Es complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 March 2023.
