The complaint
Ms R complains that NewDay Ltd havent properly dealt with her s75 complaint and she 
hasnt had her money back.
What happened
Ms R initially contacted this service in around July 2019 as she was having problems with 
transactions on her credit card account supplied by NewDay. Ms R said that she had been 
supplied a faulty item of jewellery and wanted a refund of Â£306.32. Ms R was advised to 
raise her complaint with NewDay first.
Ms R referred her complaint back to this service in October 2019 as she said NewDay hadnt 
responded to her complaint.
Our investigator looked into things and didnt recommend that the complaint was upheld. 
NewDay explained that it had opened a complaint for Ms R and asked for further information 
to support the S75 claim but Ms R hadnt sent the information. In these circumstances our 
investigator didnt think NewDay had done anything wrong.
Ms R didnt agree and said she had sent the information, but she didnt have it anymore 
because of problems with her laptop. She said that NewDay should have got in touch with 
the jeweller to find out any further information. 
So as the complaint hasnt been resolved it has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms R has said that NewDay havent properly dealt with her s75 complaint for a refund for 
faulty jewellery.
Ms R relies on the rights she has under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. I think 
its important to set out my role here. In considering a complaint about a financial services 
provider, Im not determining the outcome of a claim that a party might have under Section
75. 
Because NewDay has financed the purchase under a credit agreement, its equally 
responsible with the supplier if theres been a breach of contract or a misrepresentation. The 
relevant law says that goods need to be of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose at the point 
of supply.
Ms R has said the jewellery is faulty, but she hasnt provided NewDay with the evidence it 
needs to assess the claim she is making. I can appreciate the problems Ms R has had with 
her laptop, but I dont think it is unreasonable for NewDay to request supporting information 
from Ms R before dealing with her claim.
As it is Ms R who is saying the jewellery is faulty, I think it would be reasonable for her to 
provide the information requested by NewDay. I dont agree that it is up to NewDay to get 
the information from the seller. 
NewDay has said it will deal with the claim made by Ms R if she provides the information 
requested.
I havent seen anything to persuade me that NewDay has already had the information or that 
it has delayed in responding to Ms R.
I cant say that NewDay should refund Ms R the cost of the jewellery without further 
evidence and information from Ms R or that it is up to NewDay to ask the seller about the 
claim. I think that Ms R is responsible for providing the information that NewDay has asked 
for in order for it to consider her claim.
In these circumstances I cant see that NewDay has done anything wrong and I cant ask it 
to do anything further.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms R to accept or reject my decision before 
12 November 2020.
