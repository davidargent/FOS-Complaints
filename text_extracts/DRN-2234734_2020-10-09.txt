Our adjudicator upheld Mr As complaint from loan 4 onwards and thought these loans 
shouldnt have been given. But Mr A disagreed, and so the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr A 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MYJAR should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr A could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr As complaint.
Ive considered the affordability assessment MYJAR carried out for Mr A before agreeing to 
lend him loans 1  3. MYJAR asked Mr A about his income and expenditure and based its 
decision to lend on the information he provided. And I think, for these first few loans, this 
level of checks was proportionate. I say this because it was early on in the lending 
relationship and Mr A hadnt had a previous history of lending with MYJAR. During the 
lending of the first 3 loans there was nothing in the way Mr A was borrowing and repaying 
these loans that ought to have prompted MYJAR to do any further checks. Based on the 
income and expenditure information Mr A provided at that time, I think it was reasonable for 
MYJAR to conclude these loans were affordable for him. So Im not upholding Mr As 
complaint about loans 1  3.   
However, as our adjudicator explained, a proportionate check for loan 4 onwards would most 
likely have led a responsible lender to decide not to lend any further to Mr A. I say this 
because by loan 4 Mr A had taken out a new loan on the same day as repaying the 
previous, and the loan amounts continued to increase significantly each borrowing. Since 
this lending relationship commenced Mr A had been indebted to MYJAR for the entire time. 
So, I think this suggests it was unlikely Mr A wouldve been able to repay any further loans 
without borrowing further. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of MYJARs lending history with Mr A, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. Given the particular circumstances of Mr As case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point MYJAR ought to have realised Mr A was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. MRJAR had taken out six loans within six months and Mr A had 
been indebted the entire time. So MYJAR ought to have realised it was more likely 
than not Mr A was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous 
loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr As indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
Mr As first loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £1,200.  At this point MYJAR ought 
to have known that Mr A was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR. Loan 10 was 
taken out nine months after Mr As first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr A had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to MYJAR over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr A lost out because MYJAR continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr A borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 4 onwards and MYJAR should put things 
right.
Putting things right
If MYJAR has sold the outstanding debts, it should buy these back if its able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If MYJAR is not able to buy the debts back, then it should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A. MYJAR should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr A towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything MYJAR has already refunded.
B. MYJAR should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr A 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr A originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. MYJAR should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on loan 10, and 
treat any repayments made by Mr A as though they had been repayments of the 
principal on loan 10. If this results in Mr A having made overpayments then MYJAR 
should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the 
complaint is settled. MYJAR should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B 
and move to step E.D. If there is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus, 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr A. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then MYJAR should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr A. MYJAR 
shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal it has already written-off. 
E. MYJAR should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr As credit file in relation 
to loans 4 and 5.
F. All entries about loans 6  10 should be removed from Mr As credit file. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr A a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr As complaint. MYJAR Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 November 2020.
