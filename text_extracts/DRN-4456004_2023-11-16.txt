The complaint
Mr B complains that NewDay Ltd has refused his account application and hasnt provided 
him with the reasons for doing so. He also complains that NewDay has ignored his letters to 
it about the application.
What happened
Mr B says he held a credit card account which NewDay took over. He says he spent about 
£4,000- £5,000 a month which he paid off in full each month. Mr B says NewDay declined 
his application for a new account without explanation and says he provided it with required 
bank statements in November 2022.
NewDay says it wasnt able to verify Mr Bs financial position and hasnt made a mistake. It 
says it would look at Mr Bs bank account statements but didnt receive them.
Mr B brought his complaint to us, and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator didnt think NewDay could be held responsible for not receiving Mr Bs account 
statements.
Mr B doesnt accept that view and says he wrote to NewDay in January 2023 which it 
ignored and re-sent his documents by recorded delivery in February 2023. He says NewDay 
has simply ignored him.
I asked NewDay for further information about this complaint and asked it to confirm what 
was the up-to-date position with the application and to provide the original refusal letter.
NewDay has not replied.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision and came to the provisional view that NewDay had not dealt 
appropriately with Mr Bs account application. I made clear to NewDay that as it hadnt 
responded to any of my requests for further information or for its views on including all 
matters within this complaint. Then I said I cant fairly include Mr Bs potential complaint 
about the failure to respond to his application from February 2023 within this decision, when 
he sent NewDay the required documents by recorded delivery. I said I hoped Mr B 
appreciates why I couldnt deal with those matters and that he would have to make a new 
complaint if he wished, about the failure to respond to him sending the documents which 
NewDay accepts it received.
I made clear to the parties that I had considered NewDays failure to respond to the 
documents sent to it in February 2023 as part of my decision to provisionally uphold this 
complaint as it provided evidence of a failure to respond to Mr B. But I explained that I had 
not considered the impact of that on Mr B and had not considered that part of the complaint 
when assessing compensation. I appreciated it would have been easier to include all 
complaint points together within one decision but as NewDay hadnt responded to my 
request to do so, I said I cannot do so.
I accepted that NewDay must assess any new application for credit, as a responsible lender, 
and that its up to it to decide with whom it enters into a business relationship. But I said 
NewDay should provide reasons for the refusal which I could see that it did provide in 
general terms.
I was satisfied having looked at Mr Bs records that he provided information to NewDay in 
November 2022 as required by it. I appreciated NewDay says it didnt receive it, but I 
thought it clear Mr B wanted the credit card account and provided all of the required 
information.
I was also satisfied that Mr B wrote to NewDay in January 2023 about his application but 
didnt receive a reply and resent his documents by recorded delivery in February 2023 which 
NewDay did receive. So, I thought on balance considering the amount of letters Mr B sent 
without response that it was unlikely on balance that NewDay failed to receive all of them. It 
follows that I didnt think NewDay had dealt appropriately with Mr Bs application and 
accepted Mr B had been caused distress and inconvenience. I said even if NewDay didnt 
receive Mr Bs documents in November 2022 then I would have expected it to have told Mr B 
that when he followed up his application in early 2023. I had not seen any evidence of 
NewDay checking its records for evidence of the documents or that Mr B had the evidence 
returned to him.
I said I had to consider what on balance I thought is more likely to have happened and I was 
persuaded that Mr B sent the required documents and letters as he kept records of them. 
And that he followed up his letters with further letters asking for an update. I couldnt see any 
evidence of a response by NewDay.
I was satisfied that Mr B sent and completed a number of documents as well as letters. I also 
accepted he would have been caused distress in not receiving a response or a decision 
about his application. I thought on balance NewDay should pay Mr B £150 compensation 
which I thought fair and reasonable and fairly reflected the amount of time from November 
2022 to February 2023 Mr B had spent trying to resolve matters.
I said I hoped NewDay could answer the questions I asked of it and confirm what the up-to-
date position is with the application. I hoped it could also confirm if it required Mr B to make a 
new complaint in respect of its apparent failure to respond to the documents sent by 
recorded delivery in February 2023.
NewDay has not replied to my provisional decision.
Mr B has replied and says £150 compensation is a paltry sum. He questions why he should 
make a new complaint about the failure to respond to his documents being sent in February 
2023. Mr B says there should be an appropriate financial penalty for NewDays actions.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the same overall decision that I reached in my provisional 
decision and for the same reasons.
We are not NewDays regulator and so Its not our role to punish it as Mr B suggests. 
I appreciate Mr Bs frustration with NewDays failure to respond to his February 2023 letter 
and its failure to confirm if that part of his complaint could be included in this complaint. But a business must have an opportunity to respond to a complaint and for that reason Mr B will 
need to make a complaint to NewDay if he wishes about that part of his complaint.
Overall Im satisfied that the compensation award is fair and reasonable and in line with the 
type of awards we make for this type of issue. NewDay has not responded to my provisional 
decision and has not suggested my approach in dealing with this complaint up to February 
2023 is unfair or incorrect.
Putting things right
NewDay should pay Mr B £150 compensation.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and order NewDay Ltd to pay Mr B £150 
compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 December 2023.
