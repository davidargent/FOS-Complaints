K820x#14complaint
Miss G says Barclays  Bank UK PLC mis-sold her a payment protection  insurance  (PPI)  
policy. 
background
Miss G bought the policy in 2002  sometime after she took out a credit card. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Miss G disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Miss Gs case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Miss Gs complaint because:
 Miss G took out PPI over the internet  sometime after taking out the credit  card.  So I 
think Barclays made Miss G aware  that she had a choice about buying the PPI, and 
that she chose  to take it. 
 Barclays didnt recommend the PPI to Miss G so it didnt have to check if it was right 
for her. 
 Its possible the information Barclays gave Miss G about  the PPI wasnt  as clear  as it 
shouldve been. But Miss G doesnt  appear  to have been affected by any of the main  
things the policy  didnt cover  and based on what I know about  her circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been  useful to her. While she had some sick and 
redundancy pay through her work, the PPI wouldve paid out on top of this for up to 12 
months. This wouldve left any pay from her work for other things. So I dont think 
better information wouldve stopped her buying  it. 
Ive taken into account Miss Gs comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Miss Gs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 September 2019.
