K821x#15complaint
Miss S complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Miss S was given ten loans by QuickQuid  between May 2015 and July 2017.  Some of the 
loans were topped  up by taking additional  borrowing shortly  after the initial loan. And most of 
the loans were repayable over two or three months. Although  Miss S appears  to have faced 
some problems repaying some of the loans - she incurred late payment fees,  and needed to 
defer some of her repayments by paying  some additional interest   all of her borrowing has 
been fully repaid. A summary of Miss Ss borrowing from QuickQuid is as follows;

Miss Ss complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think QuickQuid 
had been wrong  to give the first loan to Miss S. But he didnt  think  the remaining loans had 
been lent responsibly. So he asked QuickQuid to pay Miss S some compensation.
QuickQuid didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Miss S accepts my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN21749932QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Miss S could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner. These  checks  could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Miss S could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ss complaint.
Before lending to Miss S, QuickQuid asked her for details of her income,  and her normal 
monthly expenditure. The income that Miss S initially declared to QuickQuid was very low. 
And taken  alongside the expenditure she declared left her with little each month that she 
could use to repay her borrowing. So I think QuickQuid should have taken great care when 
making its lending  decisions to ensure that Miss S could afford the repayments in a safe and 
sustainable manner.
Ref: DRN21749933I think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid to give the first loan to Miss S. The amount she 
needed to repay was well within the disposable  income shed declared. This was the first 
loan shed taken  from the lender. So given what was apparent  about  her circumstances at 
the time I dont think it wouldve been  proportionate for QuickQuid to ask Miss S for the 
amount of information  that would be needed  to show repaying this loan would be 
unsustainable.  
Miss S was due to make  three repayments on her first loan.  But she failed to make the first 
small repayment on time and so was charged a late payment fee. Then, a few days  later, 
Miss S repaid the entire loan. Around  two months  later Miss S asked to borrow again. The 
amount she asked to borrow  was double the size of her previous loan. And the largest 
repayment she needed to make, just over a month later, was significant in comparison to her 
income and the amount she said she had left over each month.
Given what had gone before I dont think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to conclude  that 
Miss S would be able to make that repayment in a sustainable  manner.  So based on the 
information it had gathered I dont think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid to give this loan to 
Miss S.
As it turns out Miss S wasnt able to repay  that loan as planned. She again  incurred a late 
payment fee. And then she needed  to defer her repayment for two months by paying some  
additional interest. I think that should have been a clear indicator to QuickQuid that Miss Ss 
finances were under  pressure and she wasnt able to meet  her commitments in a 
sustainable way. So when she asked to borrow again, just four days after repaying her 
second loan, I think QuickQuid should have  declined that request. QuickQuid should have 
considered it most likely that Miss S was borrowing again to fill the hole that repaying her 
earlier borrowing had left in her finances.
By the time she asked for loan 4 I think QuickQuid should have  realised that any further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  provide  any further  loans. 
I say this because:
By the time Miss S asked for loan 4 shed been  borrowing from QuickQuid for a 
lengthy period  and she wasnt making any inroads  to the amount she owed the 
lender. By then Miss S had paid a considerable amount  of interest  to QuickQuid to 
effectively service  a debt over an extended period.
Although there were  some gaps between Miss S repaying her loans and asking  to 
borrow again, I dont  think it would have been reasonable for QuickQuid to conclude 
these were any indication that Miss Ss finances had moved on from whatever 
situation had required her previous loans. 
The amounts  that Miss S was asking to borrow rarely decreased.  So QuickQuid 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Miss S was having  to borrow  
further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Miss Ss indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Ref: DRN21749934I think that Miss S lost out because  QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ss indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans and top ups was likely to have had negative  implications 
on Miss Ss ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in the market  for 
these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 2 to 10 and QuickQuid should  put things right.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Miss S after, and including, the loan 
that she took on 23 August 2015  (loan 2). So for each of those loans QuickQuid should;
Refund any interest and charges (including  late fees) applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Ss credit  file in relation  to loans 2 
and 3.
The number of loans  taken from loan 4 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  4 to 10 should be removed from Miss Ss 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss S a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold most of Miss Ss complaint and CashEuroNet  UK LLC to 
put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 July 2019.
