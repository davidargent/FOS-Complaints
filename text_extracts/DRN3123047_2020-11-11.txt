K821x#15complaint
Mr C has complained that AvantCredit of UK LLC lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr C was given a loan by AvantCredit in January  2014  for £1,700.  The loan was due to be 
repaid in 18 monthly instalments of around  £181.  I understand  the loan has been repaid. 
One of our adjudicators has looked into the complaint. She didnt think AvantCredit  should 
have provided  Mr C with the loan and she asked the lender to put things right.  AvantCredit  
didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment,  and so the complaint has been  passed to me 
to make a final decision  about the matter.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to unaffordable  and irresponsible  lending  on our website and 
Ive considered this approach when deciding Mr Cs complaint.
AvantCredit needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend to Mr C 
irresponsibly. I think there are key questions I need  to consider in order to decide  whats  fair
and reasonable in the circumstances of this particular  complaint:
Did AvantCredit carry out reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself that 
Mr C was in a position to sustainably repay the loan?  If not, what would reasonable 
and proportionate checks have shown at the time? 
Did AvantCredit ultimately make a fair lending decision? 
Did AvantCredit act unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr C in some other way?
AvantCredit was required to carry out a borrower focussed assessment, sometimes  knows 
as an affordability check.  The lender  had to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks  
to satisfy itself that Mr C would be able repay the loan sustainably.  There was no set list of 
checks that AvantCredit had to do, but it could take into account  a number of different things 
such as the loan amount, the length  of the loan term,  the repayment  amounts, and the 
borrowers overall financial circumstances.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have  
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the longer  the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit  is 
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make  payments for an extended  
period).
Ref: DRN31230472There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed  a proportionate check 
shouldve been  for any particular application  including (but not limited  to) any indications  of 
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in future circumstances. Ive kept all of 
this in mind when thinking about  whether AvantCredit did what it needed to before agreeing 
to give the loan to Mr C.
AvantCredit says it asked Mr C for information  about his income and expenditure and it 
carried out some credit  checks.  AvantCredit thinks its checks  were reasonable and 
proportionate.
I can see from Mr Cs application form that his total monthly expenses were  stated as £800 
and his income was declared as £1,800. AvantCredit said it verified this information.  On the 
face of it, it would seem that Mr C had sufficient disposable income to afford the loan.
AvantCredit says that Mr Cs credit report showed he had no monthly payment to credit 
commitments on a regular basis. Yet its Affordability  Report did show  that Mr C had five 
loan accounts  and that hed opened  six accounts  in the last three months. AvantCredit has 
also told us that Mr C did state the purpose  of the loan was to consolidate existing credit 
commitments  all of which I think ought  reasonably to have suggested to AvantCredit  that 
Mr C did have some existing,  fairly  recent, credit commitments which  potentially  might 
impact on his ability to repay  his loan sustainably. I accept that AvantCredits report shows  
little adverse credit information for Mr C, and a low total credit balance.  But Mr C was 
applying to AvantCredit for a costly loan, repayable over an extended period. I think  in the 
circumstances, AvantCredit ought  reasonably to have realised that for its checks  to be 
reasonable and proportionate, it needed a better  understanding  of Mr Cs true current 
financial position - to ensure that he could  sustainably repay his loan over the whole loan 
term.
So I think AvantCredit should have gone  further  on this occasion  and carried out more in 
depth checks to independently verify some of the information Mr C had given about his 
financial situation  for example by asking  to see bank statements.
The information that AvantCredit has provided  suggests that it did request a bank statement 
from Mr C at the time. But if it did, I havent seen a copy of this. Mr C has provided us with 
copies of his bank statements for the period leading up to his loan application so I can 
determine what better checks might have  shown AvantCredit at that time.  And I have 
considered this information  in light of what Ive set out above.  
Of course,  different checks  might show different things. But I think  if AvantCredit had carried 
out what I consider  to be proportionate checks, I think  its likely it would have discovered 
more about Mr Cs financial  position.  In particular I think  it more  likely than not AvantCredit  
would have realised  that Mr C was regularly gambling considerable amounts of money. And 
that he was also borrowing  from at least six other  short-term or payday  lenders in the month  
prior to his taking the loan from AvantCredit.
As Ive already  explained, AvantCredit  was required to establish  whether Mr C could 
sustainably make his loan repayments.  I think its likely that with better checks AvantCredit  
would reasonably have concluded that Mr C was having serious difficulties managing  his 
finances and that he was most likely borrowing as a result of his gambling  and would also 
most likely need to borrow elsewhere  to repay  his loan from AvantCredit. I would have 
expected AvantCredit to realise that it was unlikely that Mr C would be able to sustainably 
Ref: DRN31230473repay his loan over the full loan term. So it ought reasonably to have concluded that it was 
not appropriate to lend to him. 
Did AvantCredit treat Mr C unfairly  in any other  way?
Ive not seen anything which makes me think that AvantCredit treated Mr C unfairly  in some 
other way. But I dont think it should  have  agreed  to provide the loan to him. So AvantCredit 
needs to put things right.
Putting things  right 
I think its fair and reasonable for Mr C to have repaid the principal amount that he borrowed, 
because hes had the benefit of that lending. But he has paid interest  and charges on a loan 
that shouldnt  have been provided to him. So I think Mr C has lost out and AvantCredit  
should put things right for him. 
So AvantCredit should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges  on the loan and treat all the payments Mr 
C made as payments  towards the capital. 
If reworking Mr Cs loan account  results in him having effectively made  payments  
above the original capital  borrowed, then AvantCredit should refund  these  
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments,  from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen,  to the date of settlement*. 
If reworking the account still leaves an outstanding  amount  of capital to be paid, 
then AvantCredit  should agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr C, bearing 
in mind its obligation to treat him positively and sympathetically in these 
discussions.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Cs credit file in relation to the 
loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to deduct tax from this interest. AvantCredit 
should give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Cs complaint and direct AvantCredit  of UK LLC to put 
things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 December  2020.
