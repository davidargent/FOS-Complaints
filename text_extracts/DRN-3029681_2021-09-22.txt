The complaint
Mr J complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has unfairly applied limitations to his 
account.
 
What happened
Mr J held a PayPal account, which from July 2017 included a PayPal Credit account. In 
January 2020 he was declared bankrupt and the amount owed on this was included in the 
bankruptcy. Following the bankruptcy, Mr J expected to be able to resume using some 
features of his PayPal account. He didnt want to access credit, but wanted to be able to use 
PayPals e-money services to make payments from his own bank account.
In February 2021, Mr J let PayPal know hed been discharged from bankruptcy. It updated 
its records, but changed the limitation on Mr Js accounts from one which related to 
bankruptcy and the owed amount, to one relating to just the owed amount. Due to this, Mr J 
wasnt able to use the standard account in the way he wanted, as the limitation prevented 
both the standard and credit aspects of his account being used. It said these limitations 
would be removed if/when Mr J cleared the outstanding balance on the Credit account.
Mr J complained to PayPal about this. He said that the Credit account had been included in 
the bankruptcy, so he no longer owed this amount. He wanted PayPal to remove the 
limitations. He explained that a basic PayPal account was almost an essential service in 
current times, due to how often its used or required. PayPal didnt agree to do this, so Mr J 
brought his complaint to our service.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Js complaint. He said that PayPal was able to chose who it 
had as a customer, just as Mr J was able to chose who he wanted to use for financial 
services. And that while PayPal couldnt chase him for this amount of money  due to his 
bankruptcy  it could make a commercial decision not to offer him its services, due to this 
debt. Our investigator didnt feel this was unfair as PayPal was and is entitled to assess risk 
in its customers and make decisions based on this. He also said that as this wasnt a basic 
bank account PayPal wasnt required to provide this service to Mr J.
The case has been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
PayPal has the right to make legitimate commercial decisions on who it has as a 
customer. And part of that decision can be based around risk. Mr J borrowed nearly 
Â£3,500 from PayPal but wasnt able to pay it back. By not making payments to his 
account when they were due; and not paying this money back, he breached the 
terms of his User agreement with PayPal. So I can understand why its determined 
theres a greater risk in this case, and so it doesnt want to remove the limitations 
from Mr Js account now. I havent seen anything to suggest Mr J is being unfairly 
discriminated against and I consider this is a legitimate commercial decision.
Mr J has said he has settled his debt with PayPal, just in a different way. But while 
the bankruptcy means Mr J isnt now legally responsible for repaying PayPal, it didnt 
receive the money back it lent him  the amount of debt remained the same before 
and after the bankruptcy. I cant say its unfair a limitation was placed on Mr Js 
account due to the outstanding debt. And as Mr J wants to continue to use the 
services PayPal provides under the same account, he will therefore be impacted by 
the limitation.
Because this debt was included in Mr Js bankruptcy, PayPal isnt now chasing him 
for the debt or trying to enforce it in court. It is simply saying that in order to use its 
services again, the amount needs to be paid back. While it wont remove the 
limitations from his account until he does pay it back, that doesnt equate to it chasing 
him for this debt. So I cant say its doing something wrong here.
While I accept that PayPals e-money services are very commonly used, a PayPal 
account isnt currently considered an essential service, or treated in the same way as 
a basic bank account. So PayPal isnt required to provide Mr J with a standard 
account. 
Ultimately PayPal has set out what Mr J needs to do to have a fully operational 
account again  and I cant say that this is unreasonable. I understand Mr Js 
frustrations, especially after completing the bankruptcy process, but I cant say 
PayPal has acted unfairly in this case.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Js complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 October 2021.
