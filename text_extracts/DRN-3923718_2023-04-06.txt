The complaint
Mr O complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly closed his account without 
providing an explanation. He wants NatWest to reopen his account. 
What happened
Mr O had a NatWest personal account. Hes told us that he lives in Turkey and used his 
account when visiting the UK.
In February 2022, NatWest decided to review Mr Os account. Following its review, NatWest 
decided to close Mr Os account and wrote to him on 14 February 2022, giving him 60 days 
notice that it intended to close his account and hed need to make other banking 
arrangements. Mr O contacted NatWest to try and find out what was happening with his 
account but says the bank wouldnt tell him much other than to refer him to the terms and 
conditions of his account. 
Mr O complained to NatWest. He said he hadnt breached the terms of his account and 
couldnt understand why NatWest no longer wanted him as a customer. He pointed out that 
he had been a customer of the bank for many years and asked the bank to explain why it 
had decided to close his account. 
In response, NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong when it closed Mr Os account and 
had done so in line with the terms and conditions. And wasnt willing to reopen Mr Os 
account. Unhappy with this response Mr O brought his complaint to our service. 
One of our adjudicators looked into Mr Os complaint. She said NatWest hadnt done 
anything wrong when it had closed Mr Os account. Mr O disagreed. He wants NatWest to 
explain why it closed his account.
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill start by setting out some context for NatWests decision to close Mr Os account. Anti-
money laundering regulations and UK legislation place extensive obligations on regulated 
financial businesses. NatWest is expected to take measures to comply with current 
legislation, regulations, and Anti-money laundering guidance, which means it has extensive 
things it needs to be aware of and monitor to ensure its doing what it should. 
The regulations can be broad and relate to countries, individuals, trade, and transactions. 
They can broadly be summarised as a responsibility to protect persons from financial harm, 
and to prevent and detect financial crime. Those obligations are ongoing and dont only 
apply to when an account is opened. Our role is to check whether they have followed the 
correct procedures, and if where they havent, we ask the business to put things right for the 
consumer. 
Banks are entitled to end their business relationship with a customer, as long as its done 
fairly, doesnt breach regulations and is in line with the terms and conditions of the account. I 
understand it cant be pleasant being told youre no longer wanted as a customer. Especially 
so, given how long Mr O had been a customer of NatWest. However, unless theres a very 
good reason to do so, this service wont usually say that they must keep a customer or 
compensate a customer who has had their account closed. Having looked at all the 
evidence, Im satisfied that NatWest was within its rights to close Mr Os account and it did 
so line with the account terms and relevant regulations. So, I cant say NatWest have done 
anything wrong when it closed Mr Os account and it wouldnt be appropriate for me to ask 
NatWest to reopen Mr Os account.
I understand that Mr O wants NatWest to explain the reason it closed his account. But 
NatWest is under no obligation to tell Mr O the reasons behind its decision to close his 
account, as much as hed like to know. So, I cant say its done anything wrong by not giving 
Mr O this information. And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it to do so or for me to 
disclose the reasons.  However, I want to reassure Mr O that Ive looked at all the 
information provided by him and NatWest, and there is nothing that would lead me to 
conclude he has been treated unfairly. 
In summary, its clearly caused Mr O trouble and upset when NatWest closed his account. 
So, I realise he will be disappointed by my decision. But having looked at all the evidence 
and circumstances of this complaint, for the reasons Ive set out, Im satisfied that NatWest  
didnt treat Mr O unfairly when it closed his account. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 May 2023.
