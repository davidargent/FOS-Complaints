The complaint
Mr E says Gain Credit LLC, trading as Lending Stream (Lending Stream), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr E says his credit report would have shown the other debts he had, payment 
defaults, later payments and a county court judgment. So, it shouldnt have lent to him

2013 and November 2019. Mr Es borrowing history is as follows:

*Loans sold to a third party on 23 August 2016. There were two chains of borrowing. 
When Lending Stream responded to Mr Es complaint it offered to uphold loans 10, 11, 22 
and 23 because of affordability issues. But our adjudicator thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been given as Mr E was becoming persistently reliant on this type of 
lending. 
Lending Stream didnt respond to the adjudicator.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure  Mr 
E could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether Mr E could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr E didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr E had with Lending Stream. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Es complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
There were two chains of borrowing, but like the adjudicator and in the particular 
circumstances of this complaint, because of the overall length of time of the borrowing I am 
treating it as one chain.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Lending Streams lending history with Mr E, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream should reasonably have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Lending Stream should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Es case, like the adjudicator, I think that this point 
was reached by loan six. I say this because:
At this point Lending Stream ought to have realised Mr E was not managing to repay 
his loans sustainably. Mr E had taken out six loans within 12 months. So Lending 
Stream ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr E was having to borrow 
further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Es indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 When Mr E returned for more borrowing at loan 12 it was 11 months since loans 7 to 
11 had been sold to a third party for non-repayment in August 2016. I think Lending 
Stream should have been aware of this and that he clearly wasnt able to make the 
repayments, and not lent to him any further. 
 
Lending Stream has pointed out that Mr E repaid some of his borrowing much earlier 
than the loan term agreed at the outset. While I appreciate this may have saved Mr E 
interest costs, it can equally be the behaviour of someone struggling to manage their 
finances and juggling their money. And it wasnt uncommon for Mr E to come back 
for further borrowing shortly after he repaid an earlier loan. Given the nature of high-
cost short-term credit I would question why a borrower would do this. 
 
Mr E wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Lending Stream. Loan 
23 was taken out over six years after Mr Es first. And it was for a similar amount. 
  Mr E had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Lending 
Stream over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr E lost out because Lending Stream continued to provide borrowing from loan 
six onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Es indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr E borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Es ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him/her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans six to 23 and Lending Stream should put things 
right.
Putting things right  what Lending Stream needs to do
If the outstanding balance due on Mr Es loans has been transferred to a third-party Lending 
Stream should buy the loans back if it can. If Lending Stream cant buy the loans back, then 
it needs to work with the third party to make sure the following is achieved: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr E towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr E which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr E originally made the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding loans, 
and treat any repayments made by Mr E as though they had been repayments of the 
principal on all outstanding loans. 
If this results in Mr E having made overpayments then Lending Stream should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the 
overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Lending Stream should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step 
E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus, 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr E. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then Lending Stream should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr E. 
The number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So, all entries about loans six to 23 should be removed from Mr Es credit 
file. Lending Stream does not have to remove loans seven to 11 and loans 22 and 23 from 
Mr Es credit file until these have been repaid, but any adverse information recorded about 
these loans should still be removed.                                                                                           
                 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Mr E a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
If after doing the above Mr E still has an outstanding balance due, then Lending Stream 
should try and work together to come to a mutually agreeable repayment plan with Mr E in 
order to repay what is owed. But Id remind Lending Stream of its obligation to treat Mr E 
fairly. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Es complaint. Gain Credit LLC 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 July 2020.
