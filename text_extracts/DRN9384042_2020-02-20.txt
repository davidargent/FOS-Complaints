K820x#14Complaint
Mr A complains that TransferWise  Ltd blocked  and closed  his account. He wants 
TransferWise to provide  an explanation for its actions.  And reopen his account.
Background
On 14 October 2018 Mr A opened  an account with TransferWise. Soon after opening his 
account, Mr A decided to take advantage of a promotional offer which said if he 
recommended TransferWise to three other people, hed receive £50 once  theyd made 
transfers of £200  using  the services offered by TransferWise.
Mr A successfully managed to get others to open  accounts and make transfers. 
On 15 October 2018, TransferWise conducted a review of Mr As account. Following the 
review, it decided to close  Mr As account.  And it wrote to him to let him know.
Mr A complained about the closure of his account to TransferWise. And asked them  for an 
explanation why it no longer wanted  him as a customer. TransferWise told Mr A its terms 
and conditions allow them  to close his account. Unhappy with this response,  Mr A brought 
his complaint to our service. 
One of our investigators  looked at Mr As complaint. She said TransferWise  hadnt done 
anything wrong  when it closed Mr As account and didnt have to provide him with a reason 
for its decision. Mr A disagreed. He said he hasnt done anything  wrong and TransferWise  
only closed his account to avoid paying  him the £50 promotional offer.   
As no agreement could be reached  the matter has come to me to decide.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 
I appreciate that Mr A has been inconvenienced  by TransferWise closing his account. And 
hed like his account  reopened.  But TransferWise  has acted within  the terms and conditions 
of the account.  So, it was entitled to close the account as its already done. And it wasnt 
required to give him a reason, as much as hed like to know. So, I cant  say TransferWise 
has done anything  wrong by not providing this information to Mr A.  
Whilst I accept  that the closure of the account  has caused Mr A inconvenience and 
annoyance, TransferWise can make commercial  decisions about who it offers banking 
services to. They cannot unfairly discriminate against a customer.  But they can say they no 
longer wish to do business  with individuals.  Thats  because theyve got the commercial 
freedom to decide who they want to contract  with. And having  looked at all the information 
and circumstances  of this case,  Im satisfied that TransferWise has exercised its commercial 
decision legitimately when  it decided  to close Mr As account. So, I cannot fairly and 
reasonably say its done anything wrong.  
I know Mr A feels that TransferWise closed his account to avoid paying him £50 as part of its 
promotional offer. But I havent seen  any evidence to support Mr As suspicions. 
Ref: DRN93840422In summary,  I recognise how strongly Mr A feels about whats happened.  But overall, based 
on the information I have, I cant say TransferWise  have acted unreasonably and treated 
Mr A unfairly when it closed his account. So, I wont be asking TransferWise  to do anything.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 March  2020.
