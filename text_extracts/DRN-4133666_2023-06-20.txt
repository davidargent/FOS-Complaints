The complaint
Mr P has complained - on behalf of his business, A - that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
(PayPal) rejected As claim on their buyer protection policy after A bought counterfeit 
goods.
What happened
A is a company which builds arcade consoles to order.  To do this, they have to source 
various parts.  
In mid-2022, Mr P discovered that a number of the parts A had bought using PayPal were 
counterfeit and had stopped working.  So he made a claim on PayPals buyer protection 
policy for refunds totalling just over $29,000, on the basis the items supplied were 
significantly not as described.
PayPal declined As claim.  They said that it had bought the parts over an extended period of 
time.  And theyd been fitted to As own products.  PayPal said this meant the parts fell into 
the category of being used/altered/repaired in As/Mr Ps possession  which meant they 
were excluded from the buyer protection policy.  PayPal added that, because theyd been 
bought as parts for items A sold on, they fell under the category of items intended for resale 
 which were also not eligible for buyer protection.
Mr P complained to PayPal, but PayPal didnt change their position.  So Mr P brought As 
complaint to our service.
Our investigator considered the complaint and concluded PayPal didnt need to do any more 
to resolve it.  They accepted the buyer protection policy covered counterfeit items.  But they 
were satisfied theyd been purchased for resale within the machines A sold to its customers, 
so fell within the resale exclusion.
Mr P indicated A didnt agree with the investigators view.  So Ive been asked to make a 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Im not upholding the complaint Mr Ps made on As behalf.  Ill explain 
why.
I understand why this complaints been made.  A are clearly out of pocket as a result of 
receiving parts that didnt do what they were supposed to.  But I can only say PayPal should 
refund A if Im satisfied that they havent applied the buyer protection policy in line with its 
terms.
Ive looked at the policy.  Its introductory paragraph includes the following:
PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim is eligible for the Buyer 
Protection program based on the eligibility requirements, any information or documentation 
provided during the resolution process, or any other information PayPal deems relevant and 
appropriate under the circumstances.
Im satisfied this makes it clear PayPal will decide if the particular transaction is eligible for 
buyer protection.
Transactions can be eligible either because a buyer doesnt receive their items or because 
they are what the policy calls Significantly not as described.  Counterfeit items are included 
within this second category.
But the buyer protection also sets out a number of reasons a transaction may be ineligible.  
PayPal say As items were ineligible because they were intended for resale  which is one of 
the categories of ineligible items.  Mr P says the items werent intended for resale and hadnt 
been modified.
Ive thought carefully about this.  I think, from the evidence Ive seen, PayPals interpretation 
of the situation is reasonable.  I appreciate A didnt buy the parts to sell them on in that form.  
But it did buy them to add to machines which they sold.  A didnt keep them for its own use.  
A is a commercial entity.  So I think PayPals decision that it bought the parts to resell was 
reasonable.  And that means I dont think they need to do any more to resolve the complaint 
Mr P made on As behalf.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding the complaint Mr P made on behalf of A 
about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask A to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 July 2023.
