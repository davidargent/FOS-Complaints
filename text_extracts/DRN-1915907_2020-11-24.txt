The complaint
Miss W complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement was 
mis-sold to her by Motor Outlet Limited, trading as Motor Range.
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Miss W under a hire purchase agreement with a credit 
provider that she electronically signed in May 2019  the credit broker was Motor 
Range;
she complained to Motor Range about the payments under the agreement, the cost 
to insure the car and about the cars tyres  and shes since complained about other 
issues with the car;
the credit provider was the supplier of the car and its responsible for the quality of 
the car so any complaint that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was 
supplied to Miss W would need to be made to the credit provider - and not to Motor 
Range  so Im unable to consider Miss Ws complaint about the tyres and the other 
issues with the car as part of her complaint about Motor Range;
Miss W has described the difficulties that she was experiencing when she 
approached Motor Range and I sympathise with her those difficulties and the issues 
that theyve caused  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that the car, or the hire purchase agreement, were mis-sold to her by Motor Range;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the car was misrepresented to Miss W and, 
although she says that she described her financial needs to Motor Range, it was her 
decision to enter into the hire purchase agreement for the car to be supplied to her 
and I consider that the financial arrangements were clearly set out in the agreement;
Miss W electronically signed the hire purchase agreement which said: This is a Hire 
Purchase Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you 
want to be legally bound by its terms. If you are entering into this agreement 
electronically, please sign the agreement by typing your name below. This will have 
the same effect as if you had signed the agreement by hand, and an agreement 
signing code was provided;
Motor Range has also provided the pre-contract credit information and adequate 
explanation document that were prepared by the credit provider for Miss W;
those documents clearly show that Miss W was required to make two payments of 
£369.75 and 58 monthly payments of £319.75 for the car to be supplied to her, so 
she would have been aware of the cost of the car when she signed the agreement  
and if the terms of the agreement werent acceptable to her I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect her not to have signed the agreement;
the cost of the insurance that was available for Miss W to drive the car would be 
affected by many factors and the insurance wasnt provided by Motor Range so I 
dont consider that it was responsible for any issues that Miss W had with insuring 
the car;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Motor Range acted 
incorrectly in its dealings with Miss W or that it mis-sold the car, or the hire purchase 
agreement, to her; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Motor Range to arrange for the hire purchase agreement to be ended or for the car to 
be returned by Miss W, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 December 2020.
