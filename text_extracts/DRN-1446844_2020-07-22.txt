The complaint
Mr L complains that a van that was supplied to him under a hire agreement with LeasePlan 
UK Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality and that LeasePlan hasnt properly compensated 
him for his losses. Hes being helped with his complaint by his representative.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
LeasePlan has accepted that the van that was supplied to Mr L for his business 
wasnt of satisfactory quality so it has agreed to his rejection of the van, refunded his 
payments  including his advance rental of £2,400  and reimbursed him for the cost 
of hiring other vans;
Mr L says he hasnt been properly compensated for the time that LeasePlan took to 
deal with this, the distress and inconvenience that he was caused and his loss of 
earnings;
the investigator recommended that LeasePlan should also pay him £150 to 
compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that he was caused  and it has 
agreed to do so  but he felt that the refund of his rental payments and the 
reimbursement of his hire costs adequately compensated him for any time that he 
wasn't able to work;
I consider that LeasePlans response to Mr Ls complaint was fair and reasonable as 
it refunded his rental payments and reimbursed him for the cost of hiring other vans  
Im not persuaded that hes provided enough evidence to show that the issues with 
the van have caused him to suffer a loss of earnings that justifies further 
compensation or that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require LeasePlan to 
pay him any further compensation for his loss of earnings;
these events have clearly caused some distress and inconvenience to Mr L but what 
is appropriate compensation for distress and inconvenience can be very subjective  
the investigator has recommended that LeasePlan should pay £150 compensation to 
Mr L for his distress and inconvenience - and it has agreed to do so  but Mr L 
believes that the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused justifies a higher 
amount of compensation; and
I consider that £150 is fair and reasonable compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience that Mr L has been caused as a result of the issues that hes had with 
the van.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for LeasePlan (if it hasnt already done so) to pay 
£150 to Mr L to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused. 
But I dont consider that a higher award of compensation is justified in these circumstances 
for that distress and inconvenience. Nor am I persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable 
for me to require LeasePlan to pay any further compensation to Mr L for his loss of earnings.
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Ls complaint in part and I order 
LeasePlan UK Limited (if it hasnt already done so) to pay him the £150 compensation that 
its agreed to pay him for his distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 August 2020.
