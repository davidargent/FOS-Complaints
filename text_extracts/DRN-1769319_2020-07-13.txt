The complaint
Mr N is unhappy that Step One Finance Limited gave an incorrect redemption figure in 
September 2019 when he was redeeming his second charge loan account.
What happened
Mr N took out this loan in December 2018. He borrowed £135,595 over a seven-year term 
which, in the fixed interest rate period, gave monthly payments due of £2,386.38. There was 
an early repayment charge (ERC) due which in the first year was 4% of the amount repaid.
In September 2019 Mr Ns solicitor requested a redemption statement from Step One. There 
was a mistake when it was generated which led to it saying £54,813.80 was needed to repay 
the loan. 
On 8 October Mr Ns solicitor sent that amount across and asked the discharge of the loan 
be completed. Step One noticed the error, apologised, and said a further £77,437.72 was 
needed to repay the loan. That solicitor said there was enough surplus money to pay that 
and the loan was completely repaid on 11 October.
Step One admitted it had made a mistake and offered £295 compensation. Our investigator 
said that was fair. Mr N didnt agree, calling the offer derisory and citing his resultant 
professional, emotional, psychological distress, and its impact on my work and life as a 
doctor, as well as my Finances. He said it put him in debt by about £100,000.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Whilst I acknowledge how frustrating it is when a business makes a mistake, mistakes do 
happen. In this case it was a simple human error that meant a redemption statement was 
issued to Mr Ns solicitor for less than half of what he owed.
Mr N borrowed £135,595 and made nine payments totalling £21,477.42. The loan was 
charged at an interest rate of 11.9% so more than half of that went to just paying the interest 
due each month. Even if no interest was charged the balance could only have reduced to 
£114,117.58 over the nine-month period, so there could be no reasonable expectation that 
the figure of £54,813.80 was correct. 
Mr N has said he wouldnt have remortgaged if hed known the true redemption figure, but 
Im not persuaded by that. The incorrect figure was given on 26 September which was less 
than two weeks before the remortgage completed. The remortgage application would have 
been started quite some time before the incorrect figure was given. So, Mr N must have 
decided to remortgage (and started the process) based on the true debt as when he applied 
for the remortgage Mr N couldnt have known that Step One would later make this mistake. 
We dont know when the remortgage application was made but Mr Ns credit file shows he 
was credit searched for a £375,000 mortgage application on 5 July 2019. When the 
remortgage went through it seems from Mr Ns credit file that the two secured debts 
combined (that is Mr Ns main mortgage and this second charge) came to around £370,000.
Theres no doubt that Step One made a mistake, and for that its apologised and offered 
£295 compensation. Having considered everything Im satisfied thats fair compensation and 
I make no further order or award.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im 
required to ask Mr N to accept or reject my decision before 11 August 2020.
