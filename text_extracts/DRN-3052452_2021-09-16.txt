The complaint
Mr B complained that NewDay Ltd had opened credit card accounts for him without making
proper checks. Mr B said this lending was never affordable for him.
  
What happened
Mr B said that NewDay had lent him money he couldnt afford to pay back. Mr B has now
entered into an IVA. He wanted us to look at what NewDay had done, and get it to pay him
back all the interest and fees hed paid for lending, with interest.
NewDay said it first lent to Mr B on 18 September 2014. Mr B said then he was employed 
with an annual income of £65,000, with £10,000 in additional household income. His 
unsecured debt was £4,800, and whilst he had one default with an outstanding balance of 
£8,800, that default happened 26 months prior to his application. He had no county court
judgments (CCJs) and no payday loans, and no accounts in arrears. NewDay opened a 
credit card account for him with a credit limit of £600. But Mr B closed the account almost 
straight away, on 22 September 2014.
NewDay didnt think this first card that it opened for Mr B was a mistake.
NewDay said Mr B later applied again, and it opened a new credit card account for him on
10 November 2015. Mr B said then that he was employed with an annual income of £60,000.
His unsecured debt was £10,700, and whilst he still had one default with an outstanding
balance of £8,800, that happened 40 months prior to his application. He had no CCJs and 
no payday loans, and no accounts in arrears. He had seven other active accounts. NewDay 
opened a credit card account for him with a credit limit of £300.
NewDay didnt think this second card that it opened for Mr B was a mistake.
NewDay said it made one credit limit increase on this account. In May 2016 it made an
increase from £300 to £1,200.
NewDay didnt think that this increase was a mistake.
NewDay said that the last payment it received on this account was in October 2017. Mr B set
up a payment arrangement on 19 February 2018, but in late June 2018 his account was sold
to a third-party debt collection service.
NewDay said it had also opened a third card account for Mr B, on 10 December 2016. Mr B
said then that he was employed with an annual income of £53,000. His unsecured debt was
£17,400, and whilst he still had one default with an outstanding balance of £8,800, that
default happened 53 months prior to his application. He had no CCJs and no payday loans, 
and no accounts in arrears. He had six other active accounts. NewDay opened a credit card 
account for him with a credit limit of £300.
NewDay said it did think this lending was a mistake, the account was not suitable for Mr B.
NewDay said it had made one credit limit increase on this account. In June 2017 it made an
increase from £300 to £1,200.
NewDay said that this debt had been sold to a third party in late May 2018, but it would ask
that third party to remove £96 in late payment fees, £96 in overlimit fees, and £305.77 in
interest. And it would ask the third party to remove the default from Mr Bs credit file.
Our investigator reached the same conclusion on this lending as NewDay. I wont set out her
reasoning here, as I havent adopted it.
Mr Bs representatives didnt agree. They wanted Mr Bs complaint to be considered by an
ombudsman, so it was passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Mr B first applied for a NewDay credit card in 2014. When he did that, Mr B reported 
a high personal and overall household income. But his credit file also showed a 
relatively recent default, just over two years ago, which still seemed to have a high 
outstanding balance. 
I dont think, from the information I have seen, that it was clearly inappropriate for 
NewDay to make this lending at this time. And I also dont think Mr B has been 
disadvantaged by this. Mr B doesnt appear to have used this card, as he closed the 
account within only a few days. So I dont think NewDay has to do anything about 
this card now.
Mr B then opened a second card in November 2015. At that time, he again reported 
a relatively high personal income, although slightly lower than the year before, at 
£60,000, and with no additional household income. Mr Bs indebtedness had risen to 
£10,700, and he hadnt paid anything to reduce his previous default. But I dont think 
his credit report and the information he passed to NewDay at this stage were such 
that NewDay shouldve realised that it would be irresponsible to lend to Mr B, on the 
basis of what it knew at the time.
I do though have concerns about the increased lending that NewDay subsequently 
made on this card. Mr Bs overall total indebtedness had increased by £2,000 since 
NewDay opened this card for Mr B, and NewDays own lending accounted for only 
£300 of that. And the card that Mr B opened in November 2015 was over its credit 
limit by January 2016.
Mr B was making around the minimum payment. Although hed only held the card for 
a few months, NewDay increased his limit to £1,200 in May 2016.
Its clear from how Mr B used the card after this, that he wasnt managing his 
finances at this time. But what I need to consider is the decision NewDay made, at 
the time it made it.
I know that Mr B had declared a relatively high personal income when he applied for 
this card, but I think there were already questions about why he hadnt, with quite a 
high income, managed to reduce the debt owed for an outstanding default against 
him. I also think that the conduct of Mr Bs card, and the sharp increase in his other 
unsecured debt, meant that by May 2016 NewDay ought not to have lent to Mr B 
without carrying out additional checks, to ensure this lending was affordable.As NewDay didnt do that at this time, it cant show that this lending was affordable 
when it was made. Because of that, I think that NewDay should refund onto Mr Bs 
card any interest or fees he was charged from May 2016 onwards, for a balance over 
his previous limit of £300, while this card was open. If that amount exceeds Mr Bs 
current debt on this card account, then NewDay must pay the remainder back to Mr 
B, with 8% simple interest.
After the credit limit increase was made on this card, Mr B used all of this new 
available credit immediately. His May 2016 statement shows he was just below his 
new, significantly higher, credit limit. And his June 2016 statement shows he was 
over the limit. In July 2016 he was back only just below his limit. He was then just 
below his limit until the November 2016 statement, which shows he was back over 
his limit. Not long after this, NewDay opened Mr Bs third account with it, in 
December 2016.
I think that at the time this third card account was opened, Mr B was very clearly 
having difficulties with managing his finances, and this was visible to NewDay 
because it could see how he was using his second card.
I dont think this lending shouldve been made to Mr B. Because of that, I think that 
NewDay should pay back all the fees and interest Mr B was charged on this third 
card. If that amount exceeds Mr Bs current debt on this card account, then NewDay 
must pay the remainder back to Mr B, with 8% simple interest.
I understand that NewDay has already made a sizeable refund onto the debt for Mr 
Bs third card, but if this provisional decision is confirmed, it will need to satisfy itself 
that this decision has been complied with in full. And, because I think this initial 
lending should never have been made on this third card, NewDay should remove all 
record of this card from Mr Bs credit file.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Mr B didnt reply. NewDay sent a substantive reply. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay said that the default Id commented on was recorded 40 months before Mr B 
applied for the second account with it. And NewDay said it is a second chance lender, so its 
not unusual to see consumers with late payments and defaults using its products. NewDay 
said this default was considered when it assessed the application.
NewDay said it couldnt comment on why Mr B didnt make much of a reduction on the 
default amount despite him having a relatively high income, but NewDay said this didnt 
prevent him from being eligible for the credit limit increase in May 2016.
I understand that NewDays internal policies mean it doesnt reject applications from people 
with previous defaults. My comment here was that this was a point of concern about Mr Bs 
financial position, which NewDay was aware of. And, as I set out in my provisional decision, I 
think that this, taken with the other points of concern which had developed by then (in 
particular the sharp increase in Mr Bs overall lending) added up to enough that Mr B 
shouldnt have been given a credit limit increase in May 2016 without NewDay carrying out 
further checks.NewDay also wanted to set out why it understood that Mr Bs second card had missed 
payments and had gone over its limit. It said that when the card account was opened, Mr Bs 
account was set to receive postal statements. But he didnt get his first postal statement 
dated 20 December 2015, which told him to pay £5.00 by 6 January 2016. NewDay said that 
was why he missed a payment and went over his credit limit in January 2016. It said this was 
confirmed by the collections department notes dated 7 January 2016.
NewDay said when it offered to increase Mr B's credit limit from £900 to £1,200 on 22 April 
2016, his account had been 'on book' for four and a half months. When it went ahead on 3 
May 2016, it had been 'on book' for five months. Apart from not receiving his first statement, 
Mr B had made all the payments required in line with the terms and conditions of his credit 
agreement.
NewDay said Mr B's account then entered arrears on several occasions, and he gave the 
following reasons:
June 2016 - forgot to pay.
August 2016 - forgot to pay.
September 2016 - on holiday.
January 2017 - unexpected bill/expense.
February 2018 - temporary reduction in income.
So NewDay said that Mr B made late payments, exceeded his credit limit, and incurred fees, 
not because of its lending decisions, but due to a combination of other factors such as not 
receiving a statement, forgetting and being on holiday.
I understand that Mr B did give an explanation for the first missed payment on this card 
account, but NewDay will be aware that people who are in financial difficulties may not 
always be happy to tell a lender about why they have missed payments. I think that the 
same applies to the further missed payments for which NewDay told us Mr B had provided 
explanations. So I dont think that NewDay can simply disregard Mr Bs missed or late 
payments, just because he had offered explanations. And equally, I dont agree with 
NewDays conclusion that Mr B wasnt experiencing financial difficulties at times when 
payments were missed, just because an alternative explanation was offered. 
 
Ive reconsidered, but my views on the lending decisions NewDay made on this card remain 
unchanged. I still think that, given there were some issues which I consider to be likely signs 
of financial difficulties, that Mr B ought not to have been given such a substantial credit limit 
increase in May 2016 without further investigation. 
NewDay also wanted to challenge my decision on the lending it made on Mr Bs third card. It 
said when the application was accepted, Mr B had three over-limit fees on his second card 
account within the preceding 12 months. NewDay repeated its argument that these werent a 
result of its lending decisions but rather due to a combination of other factors.
NewDay repeated that when he applied for this third card Mr B had no accounts in arrears 
with other lenders and no CCJs. The last default was recorded 53 months prior; he had no 
payment arrangements or debt management programmes in place. NewDay said that 
reasonable and proportionate checks were completed before Mr B's application was 
accepted, and it was also in line with NewDay's lending policy. So NewDay said it didnt 
agree that Mr B should not have been accepted for a third account.
What NewDay has said now, in response to my provisional decision, contrasts with what 
NewDay told us when it sent us full details of Mr Bs accounts. It said then that NewDay identified that it may not have been appropriate to accept the [third] application. This is 
because he had high indebtedness and his [second] account entered arrears in January and 
February 2016. As I noted in my provisional decision, NewDay had already made refunds 
onto this card.
When I considered the lending NewDay made on this third card, I took into account Mr Bs 
debts elsewhere, but also the history of his second card. I thought that there were a number 
of signs in how that card was managed that indicated Mr B was very likely to be having 
financial difficulties. I still think this third card account should not have been opened for Mr B.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the award I originally proposed.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd must 
refund onto Mr Bs second card any interest or fees he was charged from May 2016
onwards, for a balance over his previous limit of £300, while this card was open. If
that amount exceeds Mr Bs current debt on this card account, then NewDay must
pay the remainder back to Mr B, with 8% simple interest.
refund onto Mr Bs third card all the fees and interest he was charged. If that amount
exceeds Mr Bs current debt on this card account, then NewDay must pay the
remainder back to Mr B, with 8% simple interest. And NewDay Ltd should remove all
record of this card from Mr Bs credit file.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2021.
