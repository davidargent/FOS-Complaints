The complaint
Mr G complains that Tesco Personal Finance plc, trading as Tesco Bank, wont refund to 
him the money that he paid for an online advertising account.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr G used his Tesco Bank credit card in August 2019 to pay £120.68 for an online 
advertising account  he was expecting to receive a 50% discount but was charged 
the full amount and he says that the supplier hasnt set up the account because he 
used an incorrect web address;
he complained to the supplier and then made a claim to Tesco Bank under section 
75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and the chargeback rules  it didnt refund the 
payment but credited £50 to his account because of errors it had made in dealing 
with his dispute and for the poor customer service that hed experienced;
Mr G then complained to this service but our investigator couldnt say that Tesco 
Bank had done anything wrong in not making a chargeback and declining his section 
75 claim  but he thought that £50 was fair compensation for the errors that it had 
made;
to be able to uphold Mr Gs complaint about Tesco Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that Tesco 
Banks response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not 
determining the outcome of his claim under section 75 as only a court would be able 
to do that;
Mr G clearly feels strongly that the supplier had offered him a 50% discount  but 
hes not provided any documentary evidence to show that such an offer was made to 
him and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the supplier 
has charged him more than it shouldve done;
the account was set up using the details that Mr G had provided but hed given an 
incorrect web address  I can understand Mr Gs disappointment that hes paid for an 
account that he cant use but I dont consider that the supplier has charged Mr G 
incorrectly as it provided a service to him using the information that hed provided 
and it wasnt at fault for the incorrect information;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier so I consider that it was fair and 
reasonable for Tesco Bank to decline Mr Gs claim for a refund under section 75;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made - but if 
the right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules  and 
if theres a reasonable prospect of success  I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
but Im not persuaded that the supplier has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr G 
so I dont consider that there was any reasonable prospect of a chargeback claim 
being successful  and for that reason I dont consider that Tesco Bank acted 
improperly in not making a chargeback claim;
Tesco Bank has accepted that it made errors in dealing with Mr Gs claim and that he 
experienced poor customer service so it credited £50 to his account  I consider that 
to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Tesco Bank to refund to 
Mr G the amount that he paid to the supplier, to pay him any more compensation or 
to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2021.
