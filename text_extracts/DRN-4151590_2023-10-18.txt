The complaint
Mr and Ms P complain that National Westminster Bank Plc closed their joint bank account 
without notification and wouldnt agree a practical method to resolve matters. Ms P has dealt 
with the complaint at all stages and so I have just referred to her.
What happened
Ms P lives abroad and has a joint bank account with NatWest. She said she no longer has 
need of the account but cannot log in and transfer the balance and close the account 
properly as NatWest has blocked her online access. 
Ms P said she didnt receive any notification from NatWest regarding the pre-dormancy and 
possible closure of her joint account. She was put in touch with NatWests Personal 
Dormant Team and told that the account was made dormant as she hadnt contacted the 
bank for over nine months as set out in its letter. Ms P said she didnt receive the letter.
Ms P asked NatWest to make the account available online again for a short period to enable 
the remaining balance to be transferred out and the account to be closed permanently. She 
said this was the safest and most secure method to settle matters, but NatWest declined and 
asked her to telephone. Ms P said time differences made calling difficult and asked to use 
email. NatWest said it could send her information via encrypted email, but she would need a 
password only available via a telephone call. 
Ms P complained to NatWest, and it responded to say her account was closed on 28 
February 2023 as a dormant account. It said the proper process of communication was 
followed and explained what Ms P had to do to obtain the balance of the account, involving 
sending identity documents, but it wouldnt re-open the account at Ms Ps request.  
NatWest said confidential information such as an account closure has to be sent by post. But 
Ms P said NatWests email of 30 September 2017 confirmed all correspondence would be 
sent to the online mailbox on the account and said post was disrupted during the pandemic. 
Ms P said as theres no proof notification was sent NatWest hasnt met its regulations and 
processes. And shes been denied the opportunity to close the account in a safe and secure 
manner. Ms P said it isnt secure to send her documents by post as NatWest suggested and 
is contrary to government advice. She requested a copy of NatWests policy about this.
Ms P was dissatisfied with NatWests response and referred her complaint to our service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint be upheld. She said its more likely 
than not that NatWest sent Ms P information about the account becoming dormant and as 
the account hadnt been used for more than five years this wasnt unreasonable. 
Ms P disagreed with the investigator. She said that with the extraordinary circumstances at 
the time involving the closure of international borders, and lack of evidence that NatWest 
sent its letter, she requested an ombudsman review the complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms P complains about the lack of notice of the closure of her account. Essentially Ms P 
wants NatWest to temporarily re-open her account so she can reclaim the account funds, 
rather than follow its procedure for reclaiming the funds. She believes NatWests approach 
to requiring her to email or fax their identity documents could compromise their security. 
Ms Ps account had last been used in 2016 and so it was reasonable and in line with 
NatWests process for it to treat this as dormant. The terms and conditions of the account 
allow NatWest to close an account with 60 days notice. NatWest said it wrote to Ms P nine 
months before closure to alert her. 
I can understand Ms Ps point that her communication preferences were set not to include 
post and should be sent to her online mailbox. NatWest didnt tell her it would write to her, 
but its terms and conditions of the account allow it to do so concerning the closure of an 
account. NatWests process for dealing with dormant accounts states that no email 
correspondence will be sent to a customer regarding the closure of the account, rather only 
an automatically generated letter will be sent stating the pre-dormancy. 
Ms P doubts that a letter was sent as she didnt receive it and a copy doesnt exist. I can 
understand her scepticism about this and why she wonders that NatWest would consider 
writing to her given the distance and background events. 
NatWest has a record of the dispatch of the letter to Ms P, but copies of automatically 
generated letters rarely exist in bank records. However, if they werent sent there would be a 
widespread break down in account management that would become very apparent. Our 
understanding is that international post wasnt suspended during covid, but may have been 
delayed, but that doesnt mean Ms P received NatWests letter. However, Ive not seen 
anything to indicate there were issues with NatWests automated process and NatWest 
hasnt reported any issues, so on the balance of probability I think NatWest sent the letter in 
accordance with its automated dormancy policy.
Dormant bank accounts have proved to be extremely vulnerable to fraud and so it is 
understandable that banks will adopt different means of communication about their closure 
and the funds therein. NatWest (and other banks) have determined that the risks posed to 
dormant accounts are best addressed by means of letters as a new and separate means to 
communicate from the mailbox associated with the account. However, I think Ms P makes a 
reasonable point that an alert could be sent to the mailbox that a letter had been dispatched, 
and NatWest should think about this going forward.  
Ms P disagrees with this as she has no confidence in sending her documents to NatWest by 
post as she doesnt consider this to be secure. But this is a process regularly followed by 
overseas customers of banks and has increased greatly over recent years as bank security 
measures have been tightened. I dont find that the process has brought about an unfair or 
unreasonable situation for Ms P though I sympathise with her for the difficulties she has 
faced. 
I realise Mr and Ms P will be disappointed with this outcome but as Ms P would consider 
consenting to the NatWest paying the money directly into her relatives UK bank account and 
closing the joint account by means of their letter of authority, then the same outcome should 
be achieved without the risk of sending identity documents by post.
My final decision
For the reasons I have given it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld.  Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P and Ms P to 
accept or reject my decision before 15 November 2023.
