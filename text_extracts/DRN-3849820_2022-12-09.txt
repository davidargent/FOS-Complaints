The complaint
Mr H complains PrePay Technologies Limited trading as Prepay Solutions unfairly blocked 
his account. He says this caused him financial hardship and worry and he wants 
compensation.
What happened
I provided a summary of the facts which surround Mr Hs complaint in my provisional 
decision. I repeat them now for the purposes of this final decision.
Mr H held an account with a firm for which PrePay are responsible as principal. For 
this reason, I will refer to that firm and PrePay as PrePay.
PrePay blocked Mr Hs account in November 2021 to carry out a review. It asked him 
various questions, which Mr H answered, but they continued to hold the funds that 
were in the account until February 2022 when they were released. His account was 
closed during this time.
PrePay offered £50 to Mr H for not providing him with updates during a period he 
was contacting them regularly. Mr H didnt accept their offer and brought his 
complaint to our service.
In November 2022 I issued a provisional decision, in which I didnt uphold Mr Hs complaint. I 
said:
PrePay have important legal and regulatory obligations they must meet when providing 
accounts to customers. Those obligations are ongoing and dont only apply when an account 
is opened. They can broadly be summarized as a responsibility to monitor accounts, know 
their customer, and verify the origin and sources of their income.
PrePay will review accounts to comply with their responsibilities. And, its common industry 
practice for firms to restrict access to accounts to conduct a review - doing so helps prevent 
potential harm that could otherwise result.
I have received further information from PrePay since our investigator issued their view. In 
summary, that information provides further detail on the basis for PrePay blocking Mr Hs 
account and what their review involved. I understand Mr H wants to know PrePays reasons 
for blocking his account, but I am treating the information I have received in confidence, a 
power I am afforded under the dispute resolution rules (DISP 3.5.9R (2)). After considering 
the further information PrePay provided, Im satisfied it demonstrates they were acting in line 
with their legal and regulatory responsibilities by blocking his account. 
PrePay offered Mr H £50 for the lack of communication they provided to him. I see they 
failed to respond to him as quickly as they could have. And its possible they might have 
completed their review sooner. But even if they communicated more regularly with Mr H, Im 
satisfied they would not have been able to provide him with the reasons behind their review 
or what the result of their review would be at that time. So, I doubt Mr H would have received 
the assurance he wanted even if PrePay were in touch with him more.
I have also carefully considered the context and content of PrePays review. Having done so, 
I dont find awarding Mr H compensation would be appropriate in the individual 
circumstances of his complaint. If PrePay still wants to offer Mr H £50 for not responding to 
his communication and Mr H wants to accept this, this is a matter for them to decide outside 
of my and our services involvement.
I afforded both Mr H and PrePay time to provide further comments or information, which has 
now passed. Neither party has provided anything further, so I have proceeded to make a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have decided not to uphold Mr Hs account for the same reasons I gave in my provisional 
decision. Those reasons are copied above and now form my findings for this final decision.
I am not directing PrePay to pay Mr H compensation.
My final decision
I have decided not to uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 January 2023.
