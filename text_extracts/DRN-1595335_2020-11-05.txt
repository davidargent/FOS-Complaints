The complaint
Mrs H complains that Nationwide Building Society increased the monthly payments on her 
mortgage after she used her overpayment balance to allow her to not make the payment due 
in July 2019.
What happened
On 19 July 2019 Mrs H phoned Nationwide to say she was struggling to make her £179.05 
mortgage payment due that month.
The call handler told her she had until the end of the month to pay, and also said as there 
was a £195.98 overpayment on the account Mrs H could simply miss her July payment as 
the overpayment balance could be used instead. Unfortunately, the call handler didnt 
explain that this would mean Mrs Hs mortgage payment would then increase going forward, 
as the balance of the mortgage would increase if the overpayment was used.
Nationwide sent Mrs H a letter in August 2019 which explained her monthly payment would 
increase from September 2019 from £179.05 to £184.66, following which Mrs H complained.
Nationwide accepted it made a mistake in not telling Mrs H that her monthly payments would 
increase, and for that omission it paid her £50 compensation. It explained in its response to 
the complaint that the payments needed to increase to ensure the mortgage was fully repaid 
by the end of the term (which is February 2022).
Our investigator said that offer was fair, and that Nationwide didnt need to do anything 
further. Mrs H didnt agree and so its been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Nationwide has admitted to its mistake, all thats left for me to decide is the right level of 
compensation. Mrs H has said that shell be paying extra for the remaining term of the 
mortgage, and she wants her monthly payments to go back to the amount they previously 
were. She says she wouldnt have followed Nationwides advice if she had known her 
payments would go up.
The only other option Mrs H had if she didnt want her payments to go up was to make her 
full payment of £179.05 in July 2019, and the reason she phoned Nationwide was because 
she was struggling to make that payment. Had Mrs H managed to make that payment then 
she would have paid out £179.05 in July 2019, rather than the nil payment she made. 
Before she missed that payment Mrs Hs monthly payments were calculated based on the 
outstanding balance of her mortgage (which took into account the overpayment of £195.98). 
By using most of that overpayment balance to cover the payment due in July 2019 Mrs H, in 
effect, increased the balance of her mortgage. The only way the increased balance could be 
repaid by the agreed end date of the mortgage was for Mrs Hs monthly payments to 
increase.
There was never an option for Mrs H to pay nothing (or a reduced payment) in July 2019 
without her subsequent monthly payments increasing.
The payment increase was from £179.05 to £184.66, so £5.61 a month. If nothing else 
changed (from when the calculations were undertaken) then that would equate to a total of 
£168.30 over the remaining term of the mortgage; that is, 30 payments that are £5.61 higher. 
But from that you need to deduct the £179.05 Mrs H saved by not making the payment due 
in July 2019. So, all thats happened is that the payment Mrs H didnt make in July 2019 has 
been spread over the remaining term, its not a case of Mrs H paying extra as she believes.
That £179.05 always had to be paid, either in July 2019 or by an increase in the monthly 
payments over the remaining term. Mrs H has said shes struggling to pay the extra £5 a 
month, but the other option was for her to pay the entire £179.05 in July 2019. If Mrs H has 
concerns about meeting her monthly payments, then I would recommend that she contact 
Nationwide to discuss that.
If Mrs H didnt want her monthly payments to increase by £5.61 then she would have needed 
to make the £179.05 payment once she became aware of the issue, which was in 
August 2019. But, as I said, there was never an option for Mrs H to not make the July 2019 
payment, and to also not have her subsequent monthly payments increase.
When were looking at complaints like this we consider the appropriate remedy is to place 
the consumer in the position they would be in if the correct information had been given. We 
dont put them in a position where theyve gained from any misinformation. If Mrs H had 
been given the correct information in the call she would have been told she either needed to 
pay the £179.05 due in July 2019, or her monthly payments would go up for the rest of the 
mortgage term.
Having considered everything, Im satisfied the £50 already paid by Nationwide is fair and 
reasonable and so I wont be ordering Nationwide to do anything else.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint in the sense I consider the payment of £50 already made by 
Nationwide Building Society is fair in all the circumstances. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or reject my decision before 
3 December 2020.
