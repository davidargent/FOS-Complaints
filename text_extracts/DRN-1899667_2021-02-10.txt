The complaint
Mr H complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire agreement with Lex 
Autolease Limited, trading as Land Rover Contract Hire, wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mr H under a hire agreement with Land Rover Contract 
Hire that he signed in May 2019  he agreed to pay an initial rental of £1,414.30 and 
then 35 monthly rentals of £471.43;
Land Rover Contract Hire, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring 
that it was of satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory 
quality will depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the car 
and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr H was a new car and I consider that it was 
reasonable for him to expect that it would be free from even minor defects;
Mr H complained to Land Rover Contract Hire in August 2019 about issues with 
Bluetooth connectivity in the car and it said that the manufacturer was aware of the 
issue but no fix was available so it offered to cover the cost of the purchase of a 
Bluetooth device to be used in the car and to pay compensation totalling £209.58;
Mr H wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service  but Land 
Rover Contract Hire then said that a fix had been available for the issues since 
November 2019;
our investigator said that Mr Hs complaint should be upheld but that it wouldnt be 
proportionate for him to reject the car and he recommended that Land Rover 
Contract Hire should apply the fix at no cost to Mr H, refund 10% of all monthly 
payments until November 2019 and pay Mr H £250 for the distress and 
inconvenience that hes been caused;
Mr H says that he wasnt contacted about the fix in November 2019, that Land Rover 
Contract Hire has had opportunities to fix the car, the partial refund of his monthly 
payments shouldnt be limited to the period until November 2019 and that hes not 
been treated fairly;
he also says that his wife has been using the car because she doesnt need 
Bluetooth connectivity, the cars mileage is 16,182 miles and he should be able to 
reject the car;
I sympathise with Mr H for the issues that hes had with the car and understand the 
frustration and disappointment that he feels about those issues  but Land Rover 
Contract Hire says that a fix for the Bluetooth connectivity issues is available - Mr H 
hasnt taken his car for that to happen so I find that it would be fair and reasonable 
for the fix to be applied to Mr Hs car;
the fix has been available since November 2019 and I agree with the investigator that 
it would be fair and reasonable for Land Rover Contract Hire to refund to Mr H 10% 
of the monthly payments that he made between May 2019 (when the car was 
supplied to him) and November 2019 (when the fix became available) to compensate 
him for the loss of enjoyment of the car that those issues have caused him  but the 
fix has been available since November 2019, Mr H has been aware at least since our 
investigator made his recommendations that the fix is available but he still hasnt 
taken the car to have the fix applied - and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Land Rover Contract Hire to refund all or any part of 
Mr Hs monthly payments for the period after November 2019;
the car has been driven for 16,182 miles since it was supplied to Mr R, a fix for the 
Bluetooth connectivity issues is available and Im not persuaded that it would be fair 
or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Land Rover Contract Hire to 
allow him to reject the car; and
these events have clearly caused Mr H some distress and inconvenience  I find that 
it would be fair and reasonable for Land Rover Contract Hire to also pay him £250 to 
compensate him for that distress and inconvenience.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Land Rover Contract 
Hire to apply the fix to Mr Hs car at no cost to him. I also find that it would be fair and 
reasonable for it to refund to Mr H 10% of the monthly payments that he made under the 
agreement for the period between May and November 2019 as compensation for his loss of 
enjoyment of the car. And I find that it should pay Mr H £250 to compensate him for the 
distress and inconvenience that hes been caused. 
But Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Land Rover 
Contract Hire to allow him to reject the car or to take any other action in response to Mr Hs 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Hs complaint in part and I order Lex Autolease Limited, 
trading as Land Rover Contract Hire, to:
1. Apply the fix to Mr Hs car at no cost to him.
2. Refund to Mr H 10% of the monthly payments that he made under the agreement for 
the period between May and November 2019 as compensation for his loss of 
enjoyment of the car.
3. Pay £250 to Mr H to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes 
been caused.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 March 2021.
