The complaint
 Mr C believes AvantCredit of UK, LLC acted irresponsibly by agreeing loans hed applied 
for.
What happened
 On 28 June 2015, Mr C took out a loan with AvantCredit (Loan 1). The loan was for £1,500 
over 12 months, with monthly repayments of £161.30.
On 5 August 2016, Mr C took out another loan with AvantCredit (Loan 2). This loan was for 
£2,500 over 24 months, with monthly repayments of £139.13.
Mr C has complained AvantCredit didnt act responsibly when approving the loans. He said 
he was in a cycle of debt, borrowing money from a number of different lenders (including 
Payday lenders), and that the loans from AvantCredit increased his financial hardship. 
AvantCredit agreed they shouldnt have approved Loan 1. But they thought theyd acted 
reasonably when approving Loan 2. Mr C wasnt happy with this, and he brought his 
complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service for investigation.
Our investigator said that AvantCredit had carried out a credit check, and asked Mr C for 
details of his income and expenditure. So she thought theyd carried out reasonable and 
proportionate checks for Loan 2. But she thought that the information contained within these 
checks shouldve prompted AvantCredit to carry out more checks before deciding to lend. 
The investigator considered what AvantCredit would most likely have seen if theyd carried 
out additional checks. And she said these wouldve shown that Mr C was in a cycle of debt, 
and that payments to Loan 2 werent sustainable. So she said that AvantCredit shouldnt 
have approved Loan 2.
The investigator said AvantCredit should refund all of the payments Mr C made (less the 
amount he originally borrowed) and refund all of the interest and charges. And, if that meant 
that Mr C has paid back more than he borrowed, then AvantCredit should also pay statutory 
interest.
AvantCredit didnt agree with the investigator. They said that Mr Cs financial position had 
improved when he applied for Loan 2, and he was borrowing money for consolidation. So his 
overall repayments were less, and he wouldve been in a better financial position. Because 
of this, they asked for an Ombudsman to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 When someone complains about irresponsible and/or unaffordable lending, there are two 
overarching questions I need to consider in order to decide whats fair and reasonable in all 
of the circumstances of the complaint. These are:
1. Did AvantCredit complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr C would be able to repay the credit in a sustainable way?
a. if so, did AvantCredit make a fair lending decision?
b. if not, would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown that Mr C 
could sustainably repay the borrowing?
2. Did AvantCredit act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
And, if I determine that AvantCredit didnt act fairly and reasonably when considering Mr Cs 
application, Ill also consider what I think is a fair way to put things right.
Did AvantCredit complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr C 
would be able to repay the credit in a sustainable way?
Theres no set list for what reasonable and proportionate checks are, but Id expect lenders 
to consider things such as the amount, duration and payments of the finance being applied 
for; as well as the borrowers personal circumstances at the time of each application. 
AvantCredit agreed they shouldnt have agreed Loan 1. And theyve said that Mr C was in a 
better position when they approved Loan 2. But each loan should be treated on its individual 
merits. And saying Mr C was in a better financial position than when they approved a loan 
they agreed they shouldnt have, is not by itself a valid reason for approving Loan 2. 
Because of the above, my decision will focus on whether AvantCredit made a fair decision 
when approving Loan 2.
Ive seen the affordability calculation AvantCredit did at the time they approved Loan 2. This 
shows Mr C had a monthly income of £1,679 and that he had monthly expenditure of £700, 
which included rent (£125), utilities (£60), car expenses (£80) and other expenses (£100). 
So, on the basis of this calculation, Loan 2 looked to be affordable.
AvantCredit have also provided a copy of the summary credit report they used as part of the 
application for Loan 2. This showed that Mr C had opened four new credit accounts in the 
last 3-months; and had increased the outstanding balance on five new credit accounts in the 
last 3-months. It also showed that Mr Cs credit card balance to limit ratio was currently 0.92 
(albeit down from 0.99 3-monrths earlier). AvantCredit classed all of these as red flags.
The summary report also showed that Mr C had three credit cards and eight loans with a 
total outstanding balance of £4,965; that hed missed payments in each of the last three 
months; that he had an active default; that there was an overindebtedness indicator 
present; and that hed had 50 Payday loans in the last 6-months.
Mr C was at, or near, the limits of his credit cards; he had recent missed payments; hed 
taken on new borrowing, and increased existing borrowing, in recent months; and there had 
been recent and substantial reliance upon short-term Payday lending. All of these are 
indicators that Mr C may have been struggling financially, and that any additional lending 
may not be suitable or sustainable. 
Given this, I dont think that AvantCredit acted reasonably or proportionately by approving 
this finance agreement without carrying out any additional checks.Would any additional checks AvantCredit couldve done have shown that Mr C could 
sustainably repay the borrowing?
Mr C has provided us with his bank statements for the period 24 December 2012 to 2 April 
2019. And these show his income and expenditure over a longer, more sustained, period. If 
AvantCredit had asked for more information about Mr Cs income and expenditure, then the 
bank statements for the period just before Mr C applied for Loan 2 give a good indication of 
what AvantCredit would likely have discovered.
The bank statements for May to July 2016 show Mr Cs average income was £1,706.77 a 
month  slightly higher than AvantCredit had used in their affordability calculation. They also 
show that Mr C was paying an average of £67.68 a month for his mobile phone, £150 a 
month to his credit cards, and £117.04 a month to catalogue shopping accounts.
The bank statements show that, in this 3-month period, Mr C took out 14 separate loan with 
Payday lenders, totalling £2,620. The vast majority of these were for £100 or less. In the 
same period, Mr C paid a total of £1,871.11 back to Payday lenders  an average of £623.70 
a month.
Looking at this on a straightforward affordability basis, Mr C received £1,706.77 a month, 
and paid out £1,323.42 a month  including the rent, utilities and other spending AvantCredit 
had used in their affordability calculation. Also deducting AvantCredits loan payment of 
£139.13, this would leave Mr C with £244.22 a month (about 14% of his net income) to cover 
any additional spending such as food, clothing etc.
Taking this into consideration with the fact that Mr C was clearly reliant upon regular Payday 
loans to cover his expenditure; and that he was regularly overdrawn and paying fees for both 
the overdraft and for items such as failed direct debits (due to insufficient funds in his 
account); shows me that Loan 2 wasnt affordable for Mr C. And making payments over the 
full term of the loan wasnt likely to be sustainable without reliance on additional borrowing.
So, Im satisfied that AvantCredit shouldnt have approved Loan 2.
Did AvantCredit act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
I havent seen anything to make me think AvantCredit acted unfairly or unreasonably in
some other way.
Putting things right
 As I dont think the finance shouldve been approved, Ive thought about how to put Mr C 
back in the position he wouldve been in if this hadnt happened. But Ive also taken into 
consideration that Mr C had the benefit of the money he borrowed and should pay this back.
So, AvantCredit should add up the total amount of money Mr C has paid them for both Loan 
1 and Loan 2 and deduct the amount of money Mr C received from both Loan 1 and Loan 2.
a) if this results in Mr C having paid more than he received, AvantCredit should refund 
any overpayments, along with 8% simple interest a year calculated from the date of 
the overpayments to the date of the refund ; or
b) if this results in an outstanding capital balance, AvantCredit should attempt to 
arrange an affordable and sustainable repayment plan with Mr C.HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to take off tax from this interest. AvantCredit 
must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax theyve taken off if he asks for one.
AvantCredit should also remove any negative information, relating to both Loan 1 and Loan 
2, from Mr Cs credit file.
My final decision
 For the reasons explained above I uphold Mr Cs complaint. AvantCredit of UK, LLC must 
follow my directions above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 November 2021.
