K820x#14complaint
Mr W1 complains as administrator of the estate of Mr W2. He says fees and charges were  
unfairly applied  by Bank of Scotland plc (trading as Halifax) to a mortgage account in the 
name of Mr W2. He asks for compensation.
background
Mr W2 had a mortgage  with Halifax. Mr W1 says Halifax unfairly  applied  fees and charges to 
the mortgage and the worry this caused  contributed to Mr W2s health issues.  Mr W2 died in 
mid 2012. The mortgage was repaid in October 2013. While Halifax  offered compensation of 
£250, Mr W1 says this isnt enough for the distress caused. 
An ombudsman issued  a decision  saying  we can only look into fees and charges applied  
from 24 October 2012. Our rules dont allow us to look into events before this.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that the complaint  should  be upheld.  He said between  
October 2012 and October 2013 Halifax applied arrears fees totalling £175 and a £100 fee 
related to a visit by a field agent.  He said the fees didnt  appear unfair. The adjudicator said 
Halifaxs offer of £250 compensation  for any upset caused  was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances.  
Mr W1 didnt agree and so the complaint has been  passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im very sorry for the circumstances that have led to this complaint. Mr W1 says Mr W2 had 
money worries  and the fees applied to his mortgage  account contributed to his health  
problems. I understand  how upsetting this must be for him.
Halifax wrote  to Mr W1 in early 2018, saying  it was refunding some arrears management 
fees following  a review of Mr W2s closed mortgage  account. Halifaxs  letter alerted Mr W1 
to the effect these fees might have  had on Mr W2s health and he made a complaint. Halifax  
paid compensation of £250 as an apology for any distress and upset caused to Mr W2.
I cant look into Mr W1s concerns  about  fees and charges applied  before 24 October 2012. 
As the mortgage  was repaid in October  2013, Ill consider the fees and charges  applied  
between October 2012 and October 2013.
I should first say that Halifax  is entitled to apply  arrears  fees,  which are to cover  the 
additional costs  involved when it administers a mortgage in arrears. While Mr W1 disputes 
that the account was in arrears, I think it was. Account statements suggest that contractual  
monthly payments  werent made in late 2012  through early 2013. 
Halifax says it doesnt apply arrears fees if theres regular contact from the person 
administering an estate.  It seems  that wasnt the case here.  I think Halifax was entitled to 
apply arrears fees and I dont think it was unfair  for it to do so. 
Ref: DRN46651062Halifax says it sent a field agent to the property in spring 2013 as it hadnt  had a response to 
its calls and letters. Its entitled to apply a fee to the mortgage account for this, and I dont 
think it was unfair to do so. Halifax incurred the cost of the field agents visit.
Mr W1 says the £250 offered by Halifax isnt enough for the distress caused  to Mr W2. I 
understand how strongly he feels about  this. But Im looking here at the fees applied after 
October 2012  which was after Mr W2 had died.  As I dont think the fees applied  between 
October 2012 and October 2013 were  applied wrongly or unfairly, I wont  be requiring Halifax  
to refund the fees or pay further  compensation. 
Mr W1 is also upset about the time taken by Halifax to respond  to his complaint. He says he 
had to chase for a response. Im sorry that this caused Mr W1 further upset. But complaint 
handling isnt a regulated  activity and it isnt within my jurisdiction to look into this. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W1, as 
administrator of Mr W2s estate, to accept  or reject  my decision  before 21 March  2020.
