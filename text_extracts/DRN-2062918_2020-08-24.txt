The complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) prevented him from 
transferring money from his account.
 
What happened
Mr B tried to transfer £9,000 from his current account with NatWest to an account he held 
with another bank, using his mobile banking application. He was concerned that the money 
hadnt reached his account after several hours had passed, so he phoned NatWest. 
NatWest told Mr B the payment had been raised as a fraudulent transaction and had been 
stopped.
 
Mr B didnt pass NatWests security checks over the phone, so it told him to go into a 
branch. He went into a branch the next day but wasnt able to stay long enough for the 
matter to be resolved because he had to get to work. He returned to the branch the following 
day and the money was transferred.
Mr B complained to NatWest. The money was for a deposit on a house and needed to be 
paid on the day hed attempted the transaction. He was concerned about incurring 
unnecessary costs and charges. It was difficult for him to come into a branch to get the 
transaction authorised because of branch closures.
NatWest said a restriction was placed on Mr Bs payment as a fraud prevention measure. He 
contacted the fraud team before it was able to make contact with him. As Mr B was unable to 
verify himself over the telephone, he was referred to a branch. It acknowledged that the 
advisor used incorrect terminology when asking who the other person on the joint account 
was. But this wasnt the reason Mr B failed security and was referred to the branch.
NatWest apologised that Mr B was given some incorrect information over the phone. It paid 
£60.80 into Mr Bs account to compensate him for inconvenience and phone calls. 
Mr B remained unhappy, so he brought his complaint to our service. 
Our investigator looked into Mr Bs concerns but didnt think his complaint should be upheld. 
She didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly by placing a block on the payment. It had acted 
in line with its procedures and in Mr Bs best interests. She said she was unable to say what 
would have happened if the NatWest advisor had worded the security question better. Mr B 
may still have needed to go into the branch. It might have been helpful if NatWest had 
contacted Mr B about the block. But he was still able to contact it to discuss the account and 
NatWest had covered Mr Bs call costs.
Mr B disagreed with our investigators view. He didnt accept that our investigator couldnt 
make a finding as to what would have happened if the NatWest advisor had worded the 
security question better. Mr B felt he should have passed security because it wasnt a joint 
account and hed given the right information.
As Mr B has disagreed with our investigators opinion, his complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The relevant regulations require NatWest to pay due regard to the interests of its customers 
and treat them fairly. It also has a duty to protect the money in Mr Bs account from potential 
fraud.
NatWests timescales for making payments are set out in the terms of the account. These 
say that most payments in the UK will be made using the Faster Payments Service and the 
money will be added to the payees account immediately. But in limited circumstances (for 
example, if we suspect fraud), the payment may take longer to reach the payees account.
NatWest says the transaction was blocked because a fraud alert was triggered. It isnt able 
to say what triggered the alert because of security reasons and because fraud parameters 
change daily.
While NatWest isnt able to give a specific reason for it, I dont find it particularly surprising 
that a fraud alert was triggered. It was quite a large sum of money and had only gone into Mr 
Bs account earlier that day, having been paid in by Mr Bs mother. 
Mr B has pointed out that the account it was being transferred to, was his own and one hed 
often moved money to before. But I dont think this means NatWest shouldnt have taken the 
precautions it did. Fraud and scams are becoming increasingly common and more 
sophisticated. NatWest has an obligation to protect Mr Bs money and try to prevent fraud. 
So, I think it was reasonable for NatWest to block the transaction while it took steps to 
ensure it had been made by Mr B.
NatWest says the fraud team would usually aim to contact a customer within 72 hours of a 
restriction being applied. Mr B contacted NatWest well within this timeframe. So, I cant say 
NatWest delayed letting Mr B know about the block.  
Mr B believes he didnt get through NatWests security check when he called because the 
advisor asked him an incorrect question. The advisor asked who the joint account holder 
was, when the account is in Mr Bs sole name. 
 
NatWest says it cant say why Mr B didnt pass its security check. Its acknowledged that the 
advisor used incorrect terminology when asking who the other person on the joint account 
was. But this didnt lead Mr B to misinterpret the question as he gave the right answer. This 
wasnt the reason Mr B failed security and was referred to the branch.
Ive listened to a recording of the phone call. The advisor asks Mr B for the full name of the 
joint account holder. Mr B says there isnt a joint account holder. His mother can see the 
bank account, but she isnt on there.
 
I can understand why Mr B feels he didnt get through the security check because of this. But 
the advisor went on to ask other questions. So, I dont think this was likely to be the reason 
Mr B was asked to go into the branch.
NatWest says its unable to share its caller verification procedure with us because its 
confidential. This means I cant tell why the advisor wasnt satisfied with Mr Bs answers to 
his questions. But NatWest says an advisor is required to take precautions if there is a risk of 
compromise to a customers account. And the most secure way of verifying them is referring them to a branch with photographic identification. So again, I think it was reasonable for 
NatWest to send Mr B to the branch. 
I appreciate the situation was frustrating for Mr B who was concerned about losing the 
property he wanted to buy because he wasnt able to pay the deposit on time. Going into the 
branch was an inconvenience for Mr B who works long shifts in a demanding role. But if     
Mr B had been a victim of fraud and NatWest hadnt taken steps to prevent money being 
removed from his account, the consequences could have been far worse for Mr B.
 
Overall, I think NatWest has acted fairly and in the best interests of Mr B.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 September 2020.
