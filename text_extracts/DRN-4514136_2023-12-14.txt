The complaint
Miss P complains that PayrNet Limited wont refund the money she was tricked into sending
to a PayrNet account.
What happened
The detailed background to this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide
a brief overview of some of the key events here. In October 2021 Miss P made several
payments from her own bank H to an account held with PayrNet. The payments totalled
£11,600. At the time, Miss P believed she was paying for roofing work, but she later
discovered shed been the victim of a rogue trader scam.
Miss P complained to her own bank H and as a result of this was reimbursed with all except
the final payment shed made (which was for £2,500). Miss P is seeking her outstanding loss
from PayrNet.
One of our Investigators recommended that the complaint should be upheld. In summary
she said PayrNet hadnt provided sufficient evidence to support their position. So on that
basis, she recommended that PayrNet pay Miss P £2,500 plus 8% interest. Miss P accepted
this outcome, but PayrNet didnt; they didnt agree our service could consider this complaint
or that they should have to pay redress. The complaint was then passed to me to decide.
In September 2023 I issued a jurisdiction decision which concluded our service can consider
Miss Ps complaint. I later issued a provisional decision in which I explained that I intended
to uphold the complaint, based on PayrNet not providing sufficient evidence to support their
position. But I also set out that I intended to make a reduction of 50% in my intended award
due to Miss Ps contributory negligence.
Miss P responded to say she thought she should get a full refund, not just half. PayrNet
responded with further information and evidence which prompted me to issue a further 
provisional decision in which I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss P has recovered a large portion of her loss from H. So this complaint only concerns the
outstanding loss of £2,500 which Miss P is seeking from PayrNet. Im intending to come to a
different outcome compared to what Ive previously set out. So, Im issuing this provisional
decision to give everyone a further opportunity to comment before finalising my decision.
PayrNet have now provided the information required to enable the investigation of this
complaint. They have evidenced that they took appropriate proof of identity and other
documentation when opening the account. Ive seen a valid passport and utility bill in this
regard. So based on this, I dont think PayrNet failed when opening the account or that they
reasonably could have known, at that time, that the account might later go on to be used in
connection with a fraud or scam.
The recipient account had been opened relatively recently. There was nothing in the prior
account activity so suspicious or indicative of potential fraud such that I think PayrNet should
have done more. I dont think they had any reason to do more before accepting Miss Ps
payment onto the account or following their customers instructions to pay the money away.
In reaching this conclusion Ive considered the type of account with its expected use, as well
as the sum involved. PayrNet have also confirmed that there were no prior notifications of
fraud in relation to this account and Ive seen evidence to show that the £2,500 Miss P sent
was spent from the account prior to PayrNet being informed that there was a potential
problem. So, I cant say they failed to act on any prior notifications. And as the money was
no longer in the account when Miss P raised this with PayrNet (through her own bank), I
cant say that they failed in their recovery efforts as the money was already gone.
Based on the new evidence PayrNet have provided, I dont think they reasonably caused the
outstanding loss of £2,500 to Miss P and so Im not intending to direct that they need to do
more to resolve this complaint.
PayrNet responded and said they had nothing further to add. Miss P made some further 
comments which Ill address below. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss P says that shes been told by Trading Standards that PayrNets accountholder wasnt 
who they said they were and that it was a homeless person who was wanted by the police. 
She also says she was told that the address used to register the business was not a proper 
address and that shes been unable to trace the roofer to raise a claim in the small claims 
court. She still doesnt think the checks done at account opening were sufficient. 
Ive considered what Miss P has said, but I remain satisfied that PayrNet made sufficient 
checks before opening the account. PayrNet obtained documentation to verify the identity of 
the person they were opening an account for, and a selfie. Theyve shared copies of this and 
nothing looks out of the ordinary. The selfie resembles the passport, and there is nothing 
about either which appears to be fake/fraudulent. So I cant say theyve acted unreasonably 
when opening the account. 
Miss P has also highlighted that the Bank of Lithuania removed PayrNet UABs Electronic 
Money Institute (EMI) licence earlier this year. She thinks this is indicative of PayrNets 
failures. Ive considered this but PayrNet Limited is the respondent to this complaint. There 
may be a link between PayrNet Limited and PayrNet UAB and I understand why Miss P has 
flagged this. But Im not persuaded that a decision taken by a bank in Lithuania impacts the 
outcome of this complaint. I maintain that I dont think the activity on the PayrNet account 
that Miss P paid was so suspicious or indicative of potential fraud such that PayrNet ought to 
have done more. 
Im sorry Miss P has an outstanding loss in relation to this matter. But as nothing Miss P has 
said has persuaded me to deviate from the outcome explained in my provisional decision, 
Im not upholding this complaint. My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 January 2024.
