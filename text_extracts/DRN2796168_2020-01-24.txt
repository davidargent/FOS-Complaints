K820x#14Complaint
Mr R complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc made sent £8,700 to the wrong  account.  
Background
On 9 November  2018 Mr R visited a branch of NatWest as he wanted to send £8,700  to an 
account he holds  with another bank abroad. During  the visit Mr R says there were a number 
of problems and the branch staff werent sure how to process his request. Mr R says he 
gave details of the destination  account, including the IBAN number, to the branch  staff and a 
payment was sent by CHAPS with a £23 fee. 
But the funds  didnt reach Mr Rs other account  and he contacted  NatWest  again on 
20 November 2018. NatWest looked  at the transfer and found the funds had been sent to 
another bank  account within the UK. The payment was cancelled on 23 November 2018  
NatWest contacted the receiving bank to try and get Mr Rs funds back. 
It took around three weeks for the funds to be returned to Mr Rs account. NatWest  says it 
regularly chased  updates  from the receiving bank about missing funds and returned them  to 
Mr Rs account as quickly as possible.  The funds credited Mr Rs account on 
14 December 2019. 
Mr R complained and NatWest issued its final response on 14 December 2018. NatWest  
agreed the service  provided could have been  better  and that it had taken a long time to get 
the money back. NatWest apologised and paid Mr R £150 compensation and refunded the 
£23 CHAPS fee. Mr R referred  his complaint to our service and it was passed to an 
investigator. The investigator thought  the settlement NatWest paid was fair so didnt ask it to 
do anything else. Mr R didnt accept so his complaint has been passed  to me to make a 
decision. 
 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that the transfer wasnt  correctly arranged in branch. Mr R has provided a clear 
recollection of the events  that occurred when  he asked NatWest  to make the payment. He 
says the branch staff seemed confused about  what to do and how to send his money. He 
also says that the branch staff gave  him misleading and incorrect information. 
As part of the investigation, the staff involved also gave their recollection  of events.
NatWests staff members say they followed Mr Rs instructions and that the UK account  
number was provided by him. They say the account details were specifically checked with 
Mr R and that he was told the account  being credited was based  in the UK. NatWests staff 
also say that Mr R authorised the payment after checking the details used were correct.
Both parties  have provided clear recollections of what they say happened during Mr Rs 
branch visit. The versions differ considerably. Where theres no direct record  of what  was 
said or discussed Ill make my decision on the balance of probability. That is, what I consider  
most likely to have happened based on the information available. Having looked at both 
versions of events, I think there was a genuine  misunderstanding between the parties 
Ref: DRN27961682involved which led to incorrect account details being  inputted for the transfer. I havent seen 
anything to show either side made an obvious mistake.  NatWest has accepted that it could 
have handled  things better  and compensated Mr R for the service he received.  I think thats 
a reasonable approach in this case.
After Mr R found the funds hadnt reached  the intended account he contacted  NatWest  and it 
began to investigate  what had happened. I appreciate it took around  three  weeks  from the 
date NatWest contacted  the receiving bank to retrieve Mr Rs money. But NatWest regularly 
contacted the other bank and chased the progress  of its investigation. The receiving bank in 
turn would have  most likely had to contact the other account holder  to check  the funds had 
been mistakenly paid into their account before sending them back. That takes time. Whilst I 
understand there was a reasonably long delay, I havent seen anything to show  NatWest  
could have sped  up the process  of retrieving Mr Rs funds. 
NatWest accepts the service provided  should have  been better and its paid Mr R £150 and 
refunded the £23 CHAPS fee to apologise.  Mr R hasnt sent us any evidence to show  the 
delayed transfer  caused a financial loss. Taking everything Ive seen into account, I think the 
£150 plus the £23 CHAPS  fee refund NatWest has paid fairly  reflects the impact of the 
situation on Mr R. I know hes upset and feels NatWest is entirely to blame. But, as Ive said 
above, I think there was a genuine misunderstanding between  Mr R and NatWest  which  led 
to the incorrect payment  details being used.  As Im satisfied  NatWest dealt with 
Mr Rs complaint fairly Im not telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2020.
