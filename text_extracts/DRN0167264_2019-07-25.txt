Miss S complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, was irresponsible  to 
lend to her.

2012 and January 2014 as follows:

QuickQuid didnt agree that it lent irresponsibly to Miss S. It said that the checks it carried 
out, amongst  other things, included asking  her about  her income  and carrying out identity 
and credit checks. Its review of the information  it gathered didnt show there  was any reason 
that Miss S couldnt afford the repayments.
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Ss complaint  in part and thought the loans from seven onwards 
shouldnt have been given. QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my provisional findings
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Miss S 
and to QuickQuid  on 29 May 2019.  I summarise my findings:
QuickQuid was required  to lend responsibly. It needed to make checks  to see whether 
Miss S could afford  to pay back each loan without it adversely  impacting on her financial 
situation. It had to gather enough  information  so that it could make an informed decision 
on the lending.  
QuickQuid was required  to establish whether Miss S could sustainably repay her loans  
not just whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence 
calculation. 
Ref: DRN01672642Being  sustainable means without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should 
be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting  other  reasonable commitments; as 
well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. It follows  that a lender should 
realise, or it ought fairly  and reasonably  to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make 
their repayments sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able to make their repayments  
without borrowing further.
Based  on the information Miss S had provided  for loans one to five, her disposable 
income seemed  sufficient  for her to be able to comfortably meet the loan repayments.  So 
given Miss Ss repayment amounts, what was apparent about her circumstances at the 
time, and her history  with the lender, I think the QuickQuids checks  were proportionate 
and its decision to lend was reasonable.
Miss S was provided loan six within eight days of settling the previous  loan. She had 
been borrowing  regularly for the previous eight months and she wasnt making  any real 
inroads to the amount  she owed  QuickQuid. I thought that at this point onward  
QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss S was having to 
borrow further to fill the hole that repaying previous loans  was leaving in her finances  
and that Miss Ss indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Subject to any further representations from Miss S or QuickQuid, my provisional decision 
was that I thought QuickQuid was wrong  to lend to Miss S for loan six onwards.
Miss S responded to say that she didnt think QuickQuid followed proper checks. She was 
desperate for the money and whilst  she tried to keep up with the repayments she got caught  
in a vicious cycle.
QuickQuid didnt agree with my provisional  decision.  In summary, it said that Miss Ss 
borrowed fluctuating  amounts, she repaid the loans on time and there  was nothing to 
indicate she couldnt sustain the repayments. It says her income  and expenditure hasnt 
demonstrated unsustainability.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
QuickQuid seems to place considerable reliance on the fact that Miss S repaid her loans on 
time. QuickQuid seems to believe that a repeat borrower is more likely to find a later loan 
affordable simply because they have paid off previous ones. Even though  the borrower 
mightve paid off previous loans, QuickQuid wont necessarily know  how they managed to do 
this.
I agree  that a consumer repaying  a loan on time could sometimes  indicate that the short-
term emergency (the consumer borrowed  for) had been resolved and that the consumer was 
in a reasonable financial position. Without making  further enquiries about  this, I cant see 
how QuickQuid can regard simply paying off previous loans, or loan chains, as a reliable 
indicator that a borrower will be able to sustainably repay a future loan  especially bearing 
in mind the effect of paying high levels of interest  over a more sustained  period. 
Miss S often approached QuickQuid for another loan within days  after shed repaid the 
previous one so I consider that QuickQuid ought  fairly  and reasonably to have been alert to 
Ref: DRN01672643the possibility  she mightve been seeking  further funds to cover  the hole left in her finances  
by the repayment of a previous loan. 
As well as assessing the affordability of each  individual loan provided to Miss S, I also 
thought that it was fair and reasonable for QuickQuid to look at the overall pattern of lending. 
It seemed to me that there may come a point at which a responsible lender would 
reasonably question whether continuing to offer further short-term loans to a customer  who 
appeared to be persistently reliant  upon them was unsustainable or otherwise harmful. I 
consider that this point was reached  at loan 6.
So I think QuickQuid unfairly  and unreasonably  provided Miss S with loans 6 to 11 (as set 
out in the table above).  I also think that she lost out  through  having had to pay interest and 
charges  as a result of being given these advances when she shouldnt have been.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Miss S for the loans she took from 6 
July 2013 (loan  six) onwards, so it should:
refund  all interest and charges applied to loans six to eleven 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*
the number  of loans taken from six onwards means any information recorded  about them  
is adverse. So all entries about  loans six to eleven should be removed from Miss Ss 
credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss S a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Ss complaint in part. I require CashEuroNet UK LLC 
to put things right as detailed above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 August 2019.
