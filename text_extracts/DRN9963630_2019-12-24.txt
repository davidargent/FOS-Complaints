K820x#14complaint
Mr C brings this complaint  on behalf  of his business,  which  Ill refer to as Company P. 
Company P complains  about WorldPay Limiteds  handling of a chargeback claim. 
background
Company P had a WorldPay account  which it used  to receive payments from its customers. 
In September  2018 one of its customers asked  their bank to raise  a chargeback against 
Company P for £6,037 following a dispute over work  it carried out. WorldPay  attempted  to 
defend the chargeback using information provided  by Company P.
In November 2018 Company P asked  WorldPay for an update. In the emails that followed, 
WorldPay said the chargeback had been  defended, hadnt been disputed  further  and 
couldnt be disputed  again because the deadline  for doing so had passed. Company P says 
it therefore cancelled  the legal action  it had planned, as it thought the chargeback  couldnt 
go any further.
In January 2019 WorldPay told Company  P the chargeback defence had been unsuccessful  
and its account  would  be charged £6,037. This letter used a new reference number. 
Company P thought it was unfair that a second  chargeback had been raised which  it hadnt  
had the opportunity to defend. So Company P complained to WorldPay.  
In its final response,  WorldPay said it had defended  the chargeback but was unsuccessful.  It 
said the account terms and conditions meant Company P needed to pay WorldPay the 
£6,037 it had been obliged to refund on Company Ps behalf.  However,  WorldPay  said the 
assurances it emailed to Company P in November 2018 werent correct. It apologised for 
this but said the incorrect  assurances didnt change the outcome of the chargeback. 
Company P still thought this was unfair,  so it complained to our service. It said it wanted 
WorldPay to reverse the chargeback  and prevent further chargebacks regarding this dispute. 
Our investigator thought WorldPay hadnt made any errors in defending the chargeback and 
was right to ask Company P to repay  £6,037. However, he said WorldPay  should pay 
Company P £250 compensation for distress and inconvenience, as the incorrect emails 
meant it stopped  its planned legal action and was upset to later discover  the true situation. 
Company P didnt  agree. It maintained  the chargeback outcome was unfair  and said 
WorldPay should investigate further. Because Company  P disagreed,  this complaint was 
passed to me to make a decision. 
I asked WorldPay further questions about its handling of the chargeback.  It said it had 
defended the chargeback but the evidence from Company  P didnt resolve  the dispute, so 
the chargeback  was passed to the card scheme - Mastercard  for a decision. WorldPay  
said its system  automatically generated a different reference number  for this, even though it 
was about the same  chargeback. 
I shared my thoughts informally with Company P and WorldPay. I said the outcome of the 
chargeback was a matter  for Mastercard  to decide - WorldPay had no say in that decision,  
and I wouldnt be looking at it. But WorldPay needed  to have acted fairly and reasonably  
when handling  the chargeback, and overall  I thought it had except for the incorrect  
assurances it gave in November 2018.  I didnt think that warranted compensation as 
Ref: DRN99636302Company P is a business and not a physical being, and so cant suffer  distress. And I didnt 
think WorldPay had caused Company  P any financial loss or inconvenience over and above 
what it, as a business, might reasonably be expected to deal with. 
Company P asked  how it could discuss the chargeback  decision with Mastercard, but 
provided no further comments. And WorldPay had nothing further  to add. So Ive gone on to 
make my decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Im not upholding this 
complaint. I realise  this isnt the answer Company P wanted  , so Ill explain why. 
But before I do, I want to be clear that it wasnt WorldPay that decided whether the 
chargeback was successful or not. That decision was made  by Mastercard in line with its 
rules, and its not something I can consider.  Instead, I can only look at whether WorldPay 
acted fairly  and reasonably to defend the chargeback. Ill return to this.
I also want to be clear  that there was only one chargeback here, though  it was looked at 
twice. It was looked at firstly by WorldPay and the bank  of the customer Company P was in 
dispute with. It was then looked at a second time by Mastercard  under the chargeback  
process, Mastercard can be asked to look again  at the evidence from both sides  and make  a 
decision. And that's what happened  here.  WorldPay has explained that its system 
automatically used  a new reference  when  the chargeback was looked at again by 
Mastercard.
Ive looked at what WorldPay did to defend the chargeback on behalf  of Company P. Ive 
seen that it used the information Company P provided to try to defend  the chargeback  the 
first time. Unfortunately, Ive seen that evidence wasnt  enough to resolve  the dispute. So the 
chargeback was passed to Mastercard  to decide. As Ive said,  this is a possible next step in 
the chargeback  process, and not something WorldPay  has any control over. So Im satisfied 
WorldPay did what it reasonably could to defend the chargeback,  though ultimately its 
defence wasnt  successful. 
Ive seen that the terms and conditions Company P agreed to when it opened its WorldPay  
account entitle  WorldPay to settle the chargeback and seek repayment  from Company P. So 
Im satisfied WorldPay hasnt acted unfairly  by doing  that.
But I do think WorldPay gave Company P incorrect  information in some  of the emails it sent 
in November 2018. It seems at that time the chargeback  was ongoing and being defended. 
And the emails do say the chargeback had been defended on Company Ps behalf and 
hadnt so far been disputed further. But when  Company P asked for further reassurance, 
WorldPay said it was highly unlikely  the chargeback would be disputed further and WorldPay 
could file it away, and that it couldnt  be disputed again in the future as the deadline for doing 
so had passed. These assurances were incorrect, as the chargeback was still ongoing and 
could be disputed further by being passed  to Mastercard for a decision. Which  is what  later 
happened.
When a business  like WorldPay makes  a mistake, our service  considers whether that loss 
caused any distress, inconvenience or financial loss. Company P is a business and not a 
physical being,  so it cant suffer distress. And dealing with problems like incorrect  
Ref: DRN99636303assurances is part and parcel of doing business,  so I dont think Company P was caused 
significant inconvenience by WorldPays incorrect assurances. While  Company P has said 
the chargeback  decision  - which Ive said WorldPay had no say in - caused it a financial loss, 
Ive not seen enough evidence to suggest that WorldPays incorrect  assurances caused 
Company P a financial loss over and above  its usual costs  of doing business.  
For these reasons I dont  think  an award  of compensation is warranted in this case. 
WorldPay has apologised for the incorrect assurances, and Im not asking it to do anything 
further.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Company P to 
accept or reject my decision  before  24 January 2020.
