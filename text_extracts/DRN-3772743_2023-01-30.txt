The complaint
Mr R complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr R entered into a credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in July 2008 for 
credit to pay for a purchase of a timeshare interest. He wrote to Barclays Partner Finance in 
July 2020 and said that it appeared that the credit intermediary wasnt permitted or 
authorised to arrange loans and he asked it to explain its position. Barclays Partner Finance 
said that he was out of time to bring any claim in respect of the issues that he claimed to 
have happened at the point of sale.
Mr R wasnt satisfied with its response so he complained to this service. His representative 
wrote to this service in April 2021 and said, in summary and amongst other things, that the 
credit intermediary wasnt authorised to arrange the loan, the timeshare was misrepresented 
to Mr R, there was an unfair relationship between Mr R and Barclays Partner Finance 
pursuant to section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act, there was no evidence that a credit 
check was conducted before the credit was granted and the high interest rate was also an 
indication of an unfair relationship. Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit was fully 
settled in December 2008.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Rs complaint should be upheld. He said that the 
credit broker identified in Mr Rs representatives letter to this service was an authorised 
broker at the time that the credit was sold to Mr R so he didnt agree that the sale was 
unlawful or prohibited. He thought that Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the 
timing of the misrepresentation claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act and of the 
section 140A claim to turn them down. He also said that he hadnt seen anything persuasive 
to suggest that the lending was irresponsible.
Mr Rs representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, 
that:
the loan documentation doesnt refer to that credit broker being involved in the 
provision of the loan;
extracts of Barclays Partner Finances communications to Mr R refer to another entity 
and it was likely to have been the credit broker but wasnt authorised when the credit 
was sold to Mr R;
Mr R wouldnt have known that the timeshare had been misrepresented to him at the 
time of sale;
any loss would have been suffered at the time of the final payment; and
Mr R has been pursued by the timeshare company each year for annual 
maintenance fees and a new limitation period is created each time.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Rs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr R first raised his concerns about the authorisation of the credit intermediary with 
Barclays Partner Finance in July 2020 and I dont consider that his letter would 
properly be considered to be a complaint but Barclays Partner Finance said that he 
was out of time under the Limitation Act 1980 to bring any claim in respect of the 
issues that he claimed to have happened at the point of sale - Mr Rs representatives 
letter to this service then made claims under sections 75 and 140A so I need to 
consider whether the Limitation Act applies to those claims;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Rs section 75 and 140A claims in this 
decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im considering whether or not 
Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Rs claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented to him by the 
timeshare company and that he wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to him - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays 
Partner Finance would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was 
brought outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would 
be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr R could have made a claim to the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him into buying 
the timeshare in July 2008 as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations 
would have been made and any loss would have been incurred as that was when he 
also entered into the credit agreement with Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that Mr Rs cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the timeshare 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but he didnt write to Barclays Partner 
Finance until July 2020 and a misrepresentation claim wasnt made under section 75 
until April 2021, more than twelve years after the credit had been provided to him, 
which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that his 
misrepresentation claim is now time-barred;
Mr Rs representative says that Mr R only became aware that he could make a misrepresentation claim to Barclays Partner Finance much later  but when he had 
the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist him for the purposes of the Limitation 
Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are extended where 
a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but 
I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr Rs claims;
Mr Rs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr R and 
Barclays Partner Finance and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit was fully settled in December 2008  
and Ive seen no evidence to show that the credit agreement continued after 
December 2008 so Mr R would have had six years from then to bring a claim against 
either the timeshare company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim under 
section 140A wasnt made until April 2021, more than twelve years later which was 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that his claim 
under section 140A is now also time-barred;
Im not persuaded that the timeshare company pursuing Mr R each year for annual 
maintenance fees creates a new limitation period for his section 140A claim - the 
maintenance fees are payable to the timeshare company under the timeshare 
agreement and arent payable under the credit agreement or to Barclays Partner 
Finance; 
Mr Rs representatives April 2021 letter to this service referred to the credit 
intermediary by name and this services records show that that company was 
covered under our consumer credit jurisdiction in July 2008  which it wouldnt have 
been had it not been granted a consumer credit licence by the Office of Fair Trading - 
so I dont think that its unreasonable for me to conclude that that company was likely 
to have held the requisite licence in July 2008 when the credit was provided to Mr R 
and that the credit agreement was enforceable;
in response to our investigators recommendations, Mr Rs representative has 
provided extracts from other documents that were sent by Barclays Partner Finance 
to Mr R and which refer to an account with another entity and to the retailer as that 
entity  and it says that that entity was the credit intermediary but wasnt authorised 
to arrange the credit;
Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit intermediary was the company referred 
to in Mr Rs representatives letter and that it is its understanding that it was operating 
under a specified consumer credit license number at the time that the credit was 
provided to Mr R;
Im not persuaded that Mr R and his representative have provided enough evidence 
to show that the credit intermediary wasnt authorised in July 2008 to arrange the 
credit for Mr R;
Mr Rs representative says that theres no evidence that a credit check was 
conducted before the credit was provided to Mr R but the credit was provided to him 
in July 2008 and was fully settled in December 2008, less than six months later, and 
Ive seen no evidence to show that he asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its credit checks before April 2021 and there was no reference to the credit checks in Mr Rs letter to Barclays Partner Finance in July 2020;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the credit wasnt affordable for Mr R when it was 
provided to him or that hes experienced any financial difficulties since then  I 
consider it to be more likely than not that any complaint about the credit checks or 
the affordability of the credit would now be time-barred;
Mr Rs representative says that the high interest rate that Mr R was expected to pay 
is also an indication of an unfair relationship (Ive not been provided with a copy of 
the timeshare agreement or the credit card agreement, but Mr Rs representative has 
provided a copy of a letter that Barclays Partner Finance sent to Mr R in July 2008 
and the monthly rate of interest and the APR were confirmed in that letter) and Ive 
seen no evidence to show that Mr R complained to Barclays Partner Finance about 
the interest rate at any time between the credit being provided to him and the credit 
being settled in December 2008;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr R was unduly 
pressured into buying the timeshare or entering into the credit agreement or that the 
timeshare company used unacceptable commercial practices against him  he didnt 
complain to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues until April 2021 (more than 
twelve years after he entered into the credit agreement) and I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect him to have complained to Barclays Partner Finance about 
any such issues before then;
Barclays Partner Finance said in response to Mr Rs letter about the credit 
intermediarys authorisation that he was out of time to bring any claim in respect of 
the issues that he claimed to have happened at the point of sale  I dont consider 
that hed made a claim to it at that time under sections 75 or 140A but I consider that 
it was fair and reasonable for it to have said that any claim that he made under 
sections 75 or 140A would be time-barred; and
I sympathise with Mr R for the issues that hes had with his timeshare but I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays 
Partner Finance to refund to him any of the money that he paid for it, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 February 2023.
