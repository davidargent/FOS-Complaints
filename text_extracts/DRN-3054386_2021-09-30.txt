The complaint
On Mr Gs behalf, his father (Mr G1) complains about delays by National Savings & 
Investments when setting up a Junior ISA (JISA). 
What happened
On his sons behalf, Mr G1 started a JISA transfer from another business (A) on 20 April 
2020. Mr G1 verified his sons identification and a transfer authority form was sent to him by 
NS&I. The transfer authority form was signed by Mr G1 on 11 May 2020 and returned to 
NS&I. 
NS&I wrote to Mr G1 to confirm the JISA funds had been requested on 25 May 2020. 
Mr G1 says there were delays in the process with NS&I and A blaming each other. A told Mr 
G1 the funds were transferred on 8 June 2020. But NS&I says it received a cheque from A 
on 16 June 2020. 
NS&I processed the application on 26 June 2020 and backdated interest to 16 June 2020, 
the date it says the cheque was received from A. 
On Mr Gs behalf, Mr G1 complained that NS&I had unnecessarily delayed the JISA transfer 
process. NS&I didnt agree and Mr G1 referred Mr Gs complaint to this service. An 
investigator looked at Mr Gs complaint and initially upheld it. But the investigator later 
changed their view after NS&I provided more information. 
Mr G1 asked to appeal, so Mr Gs complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In order to decide whether NS&I acted unfairly, Ive tried to get an understanding of the 
timeline in this case. I understand Mr G1 feels NS&I unreasonably delayed Mr Gs JISA 
transfer.
Looking at the overall timeline, I havent found evidence of an avoidable delay by NS&I. 
NS&I says that it couldnt begin the JISA transfer process until it received Mr Gs transfer 
request form. Mr G1 signed that on Mr Gs behalf on 11 May 2020 and sent it back. NS&I 
says it received the form in the days that followed and forwarded it to A to request the 
transfer. NS&I confirmed the JISA transfer was requested from A on 25 May 2020. 
A told Mr G1 it transferred the JISA funds on 8 June 2020, but NS&I says it received a 
cheque on 16 June 2020. I asked our investigator to double check this point with A. And A 
has confirmed the JISA funds were not transferred, they were posted by cheque. Im 
satisfied NS&I received the cheque on 16 June 2020 as it claims.
NS&I opened Mr Gs JISA on 26 June 2020 and backdated interest to the date it received 
the cheque from A. I think thats fair, I wouldnt expect NS&I to pay interest on funds before 
they were received. 
I dont doubt Mr G1s frustrations as both parties appear to have blamed the other. But, in 
this case, I can only look at NS&Is actions. And I havent found anything that shows NS&I 
unreasonably delayed the JISA transfer process or treated Mr G unfairly. 
As Im satisfied NS&I has dealt with Mr Gs complaint fairly, Im not telling it to take any 
further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 October 2021.
