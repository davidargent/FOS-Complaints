The complaint
Mrs B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc recorded an entry about her on a fraud 
prevention database following her failed mortgage application to it.
What happened
Mrs B applied for a mortgage with NatWest, via a broker, in 2019 but the application was 
declined. Mrs B says she discovered in October 2022 that NatWest had recorded a marker 
against her name with CIFAS, a fraud prevention database. Mrs B says that has caused her 
financial hardship as she is a landlord with a property portfolio. 
Mrs B complained to NatWest. NatWest responded in a letter dated 20 November 2022. It 
said her mortgage was declined because of the results of its standard checks and those 
checks also led to NatWest recording the CIFAS marker. NatWest said it had followed the 
correct procedures so would not be removing the marker.
Dissatisfied with NatWests response to her complaint, Mrs B referred the matter to us. She 
said she feels that its unfair that NatWest hadnt provided her with any information about the 
marker and hadnt removed it. But she assumes NatWests concern was with her second 
income from her husbands company, as her broker told her that is often looked upon by 
lenders as a likely source of fraud. Mrs B explained that the work she was paid for by her 
husband started six months before the application and lasted for over a year after the 
application.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mrs Bs complaint. She thought, in adding the CIFAS marker, 
NatWest had acted fairly and reasonably because shes seen sufficient evidence to meet the 
standard of proof to do so. And she explained that NatWest was not obliged to inform Mrs B 
that it had added the CIFAS marker or why it had done so.
Mrs B didnt accept our investigators opinion. She said she actually worked for her husband 
for a further three years, on a part time basis doing administration work. And she has 
provided us with an accountants letter showing that.
As Mrs B didnt accept our investigators opinion, her complaint has been passed to me for a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same conclusion as our investigator. Ill explain why.
When Mrs B applied for the mortgage in 2019, NatWest considered the information and 
evidence it received in connection with mortgage application and carried out underwriting 
checks to try to confirm the accuracy of what it was told and to decide whether it wanted to 
lend. I think its worth saying here that there was no obligation on NatWest to lend money to 
Mrs B. It wasnt obliged to give reasons for refusing to do so either. 
The standard of proof for putting a marker on the CIFAS database is that there must be 
clear, relevant and rigorous evidence of fraud, such that NatWest could confidently report 
the matter to the police or other authorities (whether or not it has actually done so). 
The standard required is therefore one of reasonable suspicion, not proof. But there must be 
evidence of fraud. There are various fraud offences, but a common feature is acting 
dishonestly for financial gain.
Having carefully considered all the evidence available and arguments made, I can 
understand why NatWest had concerns about the information it had been given in 
connection with Mrs Bs mortgage application. 
As Ive said above, Mrs B believes NatWest may have been concerned about her secondary 
earnings which she says are from work she carried out for her husbands business. Mrs B 
provided payslips and bank statements to NatWest to show that income as part of her 
mortgage application. However, the bank statements provided show that the income she 
claimed was paid to her husbands bank account. While I make no judgement here about the 
legitimacy of Mrs Bs secondary income, I do understand that to be an unusual arrangement 
 ordinarily a lender would expect to see earned income paid to the employees bank 
account.
NatWest tried to verify the legitimacy of Mrs Bs payslips for her secondary income with the 
relevant tax authorities. However, those payslips could not be verified. So, again, I 
understand why that would cause suspicion.
Mrs B has provided us with a copy of an accountants letter. In that letter the accountant 
says Mrs B started employment with her husbands company on 1 December 2018 and 
worked their until 31 May 2022. I think that does add weight to Mrs Bs argument. However, I 
dont think that means it was unreasonable for NatWest to be concerned about Mrs B not 
directly receiving pay for the employment she claimed. NatWest appears not to have moved 
to report its suspicion to CIFAS on that information alone. Instead, it sought to verify the 
validity of the payslips Mrs B had submitted as evidence of her income with the relevant tax 
authority. NatWest acted to report its suspicion to CIFAS  and decline Mrs Bs mortgage 
application  only when the relevant tax authority could not verify the validity of Mrs Bs 
payslips.
Mrs B says her broker told her that employment with family is often looked upon as 
suspicious by lenders. Had NatWest reported its suspicions to CIFAS merely because Mrs B 
claimed she was employed by her husband, I wouldnt consider that reasonable. But, in this 
case, its suspicions were based on Mr B making Mrs Bs salary payments to his own bank 
account. And then the relevant tax office could not verify her payslips  adding another layer 
of suspicion. So, I dont think NatWest acted unreasonably here. And I dont think the letter 
from Mr Bs accountant is sufficient for me to ask NatWest to arrange for the marker to be 
removed, as that letter doesnt address NatWests specific concerns  albeit that I 
understand Mr Bs accountant wouldnt have known what NatWests specific concerns were 
at the time of writing his letter. That means I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint about National Westminster Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 August 2023.
