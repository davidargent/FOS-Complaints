The complaint
Mrs L complains about the way that Hyundai Capital UK Limited, trading as Kia Finance, 
responded to her second request to repay the final payment due under her hire purchase 
agreement by instalments. Her husband is also involved with her complaint.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the investigator that this complaint should be upheld for these 
reasons:
Mrs L entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Kia Finance in August 2015 to 
pay for a new car  she agreed to make 36 monthly payments of £192.15 and a final 
payment of £4,802.50;
she asked to pay the final payment by instalments and entered into a modifying 
agreement with Kia Finance in September 2018 under which she agreed to make 
eleven monthly payments of £192.15 and a final payment of £2,910.49;
Kia Finance says it sent a letter about the end of the agreement to Mrs L in June 
2019 and her husband phoned it in July 2019 about paying for the final payment due 
under the modifying agreement by instalments;
its clear from the recording of the call that there was a misunderstanding about what 
was agreed  Mrs Ls husband understood that Kia Finance had agreed that the final 
payment could be paid by instalments but Kia Finance had said that the modification 
had already been actioned when Mrs L had phoned to set it up;
Kia Finance says that it sent another letter about the end of the agreement to Mrs L 
in August 2019 and left a message for her in September 2019 about the final 
payment  but she says that she didnt receive that letter and she phoned Kia 
Finance in September 2019 because it hadnt collected the payment that she was 
expecting of £192.12;
Kia Finance says that it would only agree for the final payment to be made by 
instalments once and that the final payment of £2,910.49 was due from Mrs L but, as 
it wasnt made on time, a late payment marker was recorded on her credit file;
the final payment was made in October 2019 and Mrs L complained to Kia Finance 
and then to this service;
our investigator recommended that Mrs Ls complaint should be upheld  she thought 
that the information that Kia Finance had provided in July 2019 was misleading and 
unclear and that, if the correct information had been given, Mrs L would've had an 
extra month to find an alternate way to pay the balloon figure  but she was satisfied 
that a letter confirming the payment that was due in September 2019 was sent to 
Mrs L in August 2019 and that it was reasonable to expect that she should've queried 
it at the time;
she recommended that Kia Finance should pay Mrs L £150 to recognise the distress 
and inconvenience caused by the misleading information that was given to her in July 
2019 and Kia Finance has agreed to pay that amount to Mrs L  but she says that 
she should receive more compensation; 
I sympathise with Mrs L for the distress and inconvenience that shes been caused in 
these circumstances and I consider that the information that Kia Finance gave in July 
2019 was misleading and unclear  but if shed been correctly advised at that time it 
would have told her that the final payment due in September 2019 couldnt be paid 
by instalments;
she relied on the information that she was given and expected to continue with 
payments of £192.15  and, when the payment wasnt collected in September 2019, 
she phoned Kia Finance;
I consider it to be more likely than not that if shed been given the correct information, 
she would have made the final payment when it was due and that no adverse 
information wouldve been recorded on her credit file;
I consider that the late payment marker that Kia Finance has recorded on her credit 
file results from the misleading and unclear information that it gave to her in July 
2019  I dont consider that the letter that it sent to her in August 2019 (which she 
says she didnt receive) and the text that it sent to her are enough to make it fair and 
reasonable for adverse information to have been recorded on her credit file;
I consider that it would be fair and reasonable for Kia Finance to remove the adverse 
information about the late payment that its recorded on Mrs Ls credit file  and it has 
agreed to do so; and
I agree with the investigator that £150 is fair and reasonable compensation for the 
distress and inconvenience that Mrs L has been caused and Im not persuaded that a 
higher award of compensation is justified in these circumstances  and Kia Finance 
has agreed to pay £150 to Mrs L.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Kia Finance to remove 
the adverse information about the late payment that its recorded on Mrs Ls credit file. I also 
find that it would be fair and reasonable for it to pay £150 to Mrs L to compensate her for the 
distress and inconvenience that shes been caused  but Im not persuaded that it would be 
fair or reasonable for me to require it to pay a higher amount of compensation to Mrs L or to 
take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Ls complaint and I order Hyundai Capital UK Limited, 
trading as Kia Finance, to:
1. Remove the adverse information about the late payment that its recorded on Mrs Ls 
credit file.2. Pay £150 to Mrs L to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that shes 
been caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 February 2020.
