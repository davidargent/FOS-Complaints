The complaint
The estate of the late Mr L complains that Tesco Personal Finance plc, trading as Tesco 
Bank, has rejected the claim that its made under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. The estate is being represented in this complaint by its personal representative, 
Mrs H.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in June 2020 in which I described what had 
happened as follows:
Mrs Hs late mother made a membership application for a timeshare in December 
2002. The total cost of the timeshare was £5,355 and she paid a deposit of £595 
using her Tesco Bank credit card. Mrs Hs mother passed away in 2011 and her 
estate passed to Mr L. He made a redemption claim to the timeshare company in 
May 2013 but he then passed away in July 2016 and Mrs H was appointed as the 
personal representative of his estate in July 2018. She made a claim to Tesco Bank 
on behalf of the estate in August 2018 under section 75 that the timeshare had been 
mis-sold and misrepresented to her mother and that there had been a breach of 
contract.
Tesco Bank said that under the Limitation Act 1980 a claim must be raised within six 
years of when the cardholder first became aware that they may have a claim. It said 
that it wasnt contacted about the claim until August 2018 so was unable to progress 
with it. Mrs H wasnt satisfied with that response so a complaint was made to this 
service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld. He said that 
the misrepresentation claim was now more than likely time-barred under the 
Limitation Act 1980 so he thought that Tesco Banks decision not to look into the 
claim was fair. He also considered the claim under section 140A of the Consumer 
Credit Act but thought that any such claim was also more than likely time-barred.
Mrs H has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has 
explained the reasons that the claim couldnt be made earlier than it was and she 
says that the timeshare company went into receivership in 2015 so can no longer 
provide the timeshare which is a breach of contract.
I set out in my provisional decision the reasons that I agreed with our investigator that this 
complaint shouldnt be upheld which were as follows:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and 
our rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  
that we cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six 
years after the event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the 
date on which the complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have 
become aware) that they had cause for complaint;
Mrs H referred this complaint to this service within six years of the event 
complained of  which is Tesco Bank turning down the section 75 claim - but I 
need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to the claim;
in this decision Im not determining the outcome of the estate of the late Mr Ls 
claim as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Tesco Banks response to that claim was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods 
or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that 
section are met);
the estates claim to Tesco Bank under section 75 is that the timeshare was 
misrepresented to Mrs Hs late mother and that she wouldnt have bought it if it 
hadnt been misrepresented to her and that theres been a breach of contract by 
the timeshare company;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Tesco Bank would be 
expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 
of the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action 
accrued (which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mrs Hs mother could have made a claim to the timeshare 
company or Tesco Bank about any misrepresentations that may have induced 
her into buying the timeshare soon after she made the membership application 
as that was when she entered into an agreement based on the alleged 
misrepresentations of the timeshare company and that she would have suffered a 
loss as she paid the deposit using her Tesco Bank credit card and made other 
payments to pay for the timeshare;
I consider that the cause of action accrued at that time, so Mrs Hs mother would 
have had six years from about then to bring a claim against either the timeshare 
company or Tesco Bank  but she hadnt made a claim against Tesco Bank 
before she passed away and Mrs H didnt make the claim on behalf of the estate 
until August 2018, more than fifteen years later;
Mrs H has explained the reasons that the claim couldnt be made earlier than it 
was  but Mr L passed away in July 2016 and, even if the claim had been made 
immediately after he passed away, it would have been more than thirteen years 
after I consider that the cause of action accrued;
I consider that any claim that the estate of the late Mr L may have against Tesco 
Bank under section 75 for any misrepresentation by the timeshare company 
would be time-barred under the Limitation Act;
Mrs H also says that theres been a breach of contract because the timeshare 
company went into receivership in 2015  but one of the criteria for a section 75 
claim is that there must be a relevant relationship between the debtor, the 
creditor and the supplier;
in this case Mrs Hs mother was the debtor because she used credit provided by 
Tesco Bank to pay the deposit for the timeshare, Tesco Bank was the creditor 
and the timeshare company was the supplier  Mrs Hs mothers credit card 
account with Tesco Bank was closed when she passed away and, although her interest in the timeshare may have passed to Mr L, there was no relevant 
relationship between Tesco Bank and Mr L relating to the timeshare because it 
had provided the credit to Mrs Hs mother and not to Mr L  so I dont consider 
that theres a relevant debtor-creditor-supplier relationship in relation to the 
estates claim against Tesco Bank;
Tesco Bank didnt properly consider the breach of contract claim under section 
75 but, if it had done so, I consider it to be likely that it would have said that the 
debtor-creditor-supplier relationship required for such a claim wasnt present in 
these circumstances so it wouldnt have upheld the claim;
Tesco Bank said that it was unable to progress with the misrepresentation claim 
because, under the Limitation Act, a claim must be raised within six years of 
when the cardholder first became aware that they may have a claim but it wasnt 
contacted about this claim until August 2018 - I consider that to have been a fair 
and reasonable response to that claim;
our investigator also considered whether there was an unfair relationship 
between Mrs Hs mother and Tesco Bank under section 140A - but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that the estate has made a claim to Tesco Bank under section 
140A;
the courts have said when considering section 140A that the time limit for such a 
claim for limitation purposes, runs from the date that the credit agreement ended 
(if it wasnt still running at the time that the claim was made) and the limitation 
period for a claim under section 140A is six years;
section 140A wasnt introduced until 2007 and Mrs Hs mothers credit card 
account with Tesco Bank was closed when she passed away in 2011 so any 
claim made by the estate of the late Mr L would have needed to have been made 
by 2017 at the latest  but Tesco Bank wasnt contacted by Mrs H until August 
2018 so any claim under section 140A would also be time-barred under the 
Limitation Act; and
I sympathise with Mrs H for the loss of her mother and Mr L, and the issues that 
shes had with the timeshare, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require Tesco Bank to refund to the estate of the 
late Mr L any of the money that was paid for the timeshare, to pay any 
compensation to it or to take any other action in response to this complaint.
Subject to any further representations by the estate of the late Mr L, Mrs H or Tesco Bank, 
my provisional decision was that I didnt intend to uphold this complaint. Both Tesco Bank 
and Mrs H have said that they have nothing to add to my provisional findings.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Tesco Bank nor Mrs H has anything to add to my provisional findings, I see no 
reason to change the findings that I set out in my provisional decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of the 
late Mr L to accept or reject my decision before 5 September 2022.
