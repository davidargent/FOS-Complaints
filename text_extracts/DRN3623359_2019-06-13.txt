K821x#15complaint
Mr J says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr J had 23 loans with QuickQuid between September 2011 and April 2015.  This included 
22 payday loans   plus 21 top-ups on those loans  and one FlexCredit agreement. 
The FlexCredit account was an open-ended facility which allowed Mr J to make drawdowns 
up to a fixed credit limit. Mr J made 34 drawdowns from his account,  totalling about £4,800.
Mr J withdrew  his complaint about loans 1-3. And QuickQuid has accepted  it couldve done  
more to check whether  loans 5-21 were affordable and made  an offer in respect of those 
loans. 
Mr J didnt accept that offer. And our adjudicator  looked at his complaint and recommended 
QuickQuid also put things right in respect  of loans  4, 22 and 23 (the FlexCredit facility). 
QuickQuid didnt agree to the adjudicators recommendation,  so the complaint was passed 
to me to decide.  Ill only be looking  at loans 4, 22 and 23 as theyre the only loans still in 
dispute.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending  including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly  speaking,  
this all means that QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice,  this means it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make 
sure Mr J could  repay his loans in a sustainable  manner. Additionally, there may come a 
point where the lending  history and pattern of lending itself clearly  demonstrates  that the 
lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances  of this particular  complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same  reasons.
At the time he applied for loan 4, Mr J declared  a net monthly income of £648. Loan  4 was 
approved on 8 March  2012 and was for £100. It was due to be repaid on 29 March 2012  with 
a repayment of £125.
Ref: DRN36233592I dont think QuickQuids checks before approving this loan were proportionate. Even though 
the loan wasnt  particularly large,  Mr J had declared  a low income and had paid late fees on 
his previous two loans.  Loan 4 was approved  just six days  after loan 3 was repaid and Mr J 
borrowed more. With this in mind, I think QuickQuid ought to have asked Mr J some 
questions about  his regular expenditure and credit  commitments (including  regular and 
short-term) to establish whether loan 4 was affordable.
Our adjudicator thought the above  expenditure for March 2012 wouldve come  to about £471 
 of which the bulk was £400 due to another short-term lender. So Mr J wouldve  had £52 
left over after repaying QuickQuid. Our adjudicator didnt think  that was sustainable.
QuickQuid says its checks didnt  pick up the other £400 loan and that £52 wasnt  too little for 
Mr J to be left with, given his low monthly  expenditure. But these points dont persuade  me 
that the loan was affordable. QuickQuid  hasnt provided any evidence about  the credit  check 
or the results of it, so I dont know what this did or didnt show. Even if the other  short term 
lending didnt show on the credit check, I think QuickQuid  shouldve asked Mr J about  his 
other credit commitments  and it couldve found out about it that way.
I understand that, even when taking the £400  loan into account, Mr J mightve  had some  
income left over after repaying QuickQuid. But he was already  committed to spending 60% 
of his income on repaying creditors. Together with QuickQuids loan, that increased to a little 
over 80%. I dont think thats a sustainable  amount of income  to be spending repaying 
creditors in one month  so I dont think the leftover over amount of £52 suggests Mr J 
wouldnt likely have to borrow again   as he did.
Our adjudicator thought that by the time of loans  22 and 23 (and in fact long before this 
point) QuickQuid shouldve realised, from the pattern of lending  alone, that Mr J was 
dependent on high-cost  credit and that the lending  wasnt  sustainable. 
QuickQuid had acknowledged this in relation to loans 5-21. It said:  When  Mr [J] submitted 
his requests for loans 5-21 we can see that a pattern of dependency begins  to become 
evident. We say this because there are minimal breaking periods between the successful 
repayment of the prior loan and the request for the new loan.
It has argued this doesnt apply to loans 22 and 23 because there was a significant  breaking 
period between loans 21 and 22. I dont agree with this. Mr J repaid loan 21 on 
28 June 2013  and borrowed loan 22 on 24 August 2013. Mr J appears to have  been  paid on 
the 26th day of each month, so there was only one pay period  (in July 2013) in which  Mr J 
didnt borrow  after more  nearly  two years  of consecutive borrowing. I dont think  that 
constitutes a significant  break.
As there was no significant break from loan 5 onwards, I see no reason why QuickQuid  
shouldnt also put things right in relation to loans 22 and 23 too.
For the reasons  Ive given above,  Im upholding Mr Js complaint about loans 4, 22 and 23  
in addition to QuickQuids offer.
Ref: DRN36233593putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 5-21, as it has offered
refund  the interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 22 and 23
add to the refund interest at 8% simple per year, from when Mr J paid the interest 
and charges (if he did) until the date of settlement
remove all remaining  loan entries  from Mr Js credit history  
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr J a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Js complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 July 2019.
