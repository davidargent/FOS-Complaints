The complaint
Miss B complains Amtrust Europe Limited have unfairly declined her Sofa Warranty claim.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Miss B said she was redecorating her home, when a ladder fell and caused paint to 
spill onto her sofas. Miss B said she had the sofas covered with a bed sheet, but the 
paint had soaked through
Amtrust have raised concerns the damage wasnt consistent with the incident Miss B 
described as the damage would have extended to the arms of the sofas, rather than 
just the seat covers
Amtrust have said its unlikely the damage reported wouldve happened had due care 
been taken
The policy says it doesnt cover any damage caused by neglect, abuse or misuse, 
and Amtrust have relied on this exclusion to decline Miss Bs complaint
My role isnt to decide how I believe the sofas were damaged, but to rely on the 
information available to decide whether I think Amtrust fairly applied the exclusion
Considering the photos of the damage, the amount of paint on the sofas and its 
location, Im more persuaded by what Amtrust has said
There are no signs of splashing around the cushions and arm, but the main parts of 
the sofas are both covered in a lot of paint  which wouldnt appear to be consistent 
with the sofas being covered
So considering what Ive set out above, I dont think Amtrust have applied the 
exclusion unfairly. So I dont intend to interfere in their decision to decline Miss Bs 
claim
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Miss Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 August 2021.
