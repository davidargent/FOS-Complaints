complaint
This complaint is about a store card payment protection insurance (PPI) policy taken out in 
2002. Mr B says AXA France IARD (AXA) mis-sold him PPI.
background
The background and circumstances leading up to this complaint, which includes Mr Bs 
circumstances at the time of the sale as well as the PPI policy benefits, limitations and 
exclusions of cover, arent disputed. So I havent repeated all of this information here.
According to AXAs records Mr B paid a total of Â£1.53 for PPI during the policys lifetime.
Our adjudicator did not uphold the complaint.
Mr Bs representative disagreed with the adjudicators opinion  they didnt raise any new or 
additional points but repeated the same complaint points and arguments theyd previously 
made. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered all 
the evidence and arguments available to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
When considering what is fair and reasonable, I am required to take into account relevant: 
law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, 
where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the time. 
Weve set out our general approach to PPI mis-sale complaints on our website and 
published some example final decisions that set out in detail how these relevant 
considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mr Bs. I havent set out that detailed information 
here but Ive taken into account all relevant considerations in deciding Mr Bs complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint and Ive summarised my reasons 
for this conclusion below:
I think AXA made it clear that Mr B didnt have to take out the PPI and he chose to take it 
out. I say this because AXA has provided a copy of Mr Bs store card application 
completed in 2002. Looking at this I can see Mr B signed a separate section of the 
application to take out PPI  a section which said: Only sign here if you want cover 
So if Mr B didnt want PPI he couldve left this section blank and only signed the credit 
agreement itself.
Taking everything into account I think Mr B chose to take out PPI and likely did so 
without undue pressure.
Its not in dispute that AXA didnt recommend the PPI to Mr B - so it didnt have to check 
that the PPI was right or suitable for him. But it did have to give Mr B enough clear and 
timely information so he could decide for himself if it was right for him.
Its possible the information AXA gave Mr B about the PPI wasnt as clear as it shouldve 
been. But Ive found that he chose to take it out - so it looks like he wanted this type of 
cover. The cover wasnt fundamentally wrong for Mr B  for example he was eligible for 
the cover and there was nothing about his employment or occupation which would have 
made it difficult for him to claim. Although Mr B says he had a common cold in the past, 
this isnt a pre-existing medical condition - so Mr B wouldnt have been caught by the 
policy limitation around existing medical conditions. Because of this the policy wasnt too 
dissimilar to what he reasonably thought he was buying from the information he was 
given. 
While Mr B says he was financially stretched the at the time, Ive not seen anything else 
to suggest that the policy wasnt affordable  so it seems like it would have been useful 
for him if something went wrong. Because of this I dont think Mr B would have declined 
the cover had AXA done anything more.
While the policy contained limitations on claims relating to back and mental health 
conditions, in light of Mr Bs circumstances at the time of sale and despite its limitations 
and exclusions, the policy wasnt fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for him. So I think 
he would have still thought he had some good reasons to take the policy out.
Overall, I consider that Mr B would have still taken out PPI. The policy was sufficiently close 
to what its likely he thought he was getting and I think the policy could provide a useful 
benefit in a difficult time, given his circumstances at the time. And in those circumstances, I 
think that he would have taken out the policy in any event.
Mr Bs representative has raised a number of what I consider to be general complaint points, 
which it says apply to all PPI complaints. These general points include: a claim that the 
Financial Ombudsman Service is not correctly applying the regulators rules and guidance 
for handling PPI complaints; these policies represented poor value because of the number of 
significant exclusions and limitations of cover coupled with the low claims ratio; and the duty 
of utmost good faith meant AXA should have disclosed the poor value and explained the 
significance of the limitations and exclusions and the impact it had on the chances of making 
a claim.
But Mr Bs representative has not said how these points apply to the specific facts and 
circumstances of Mr Bs individual complaint  just that they apply to all PPI complaints.
I have thought about these things and how they might apply in Mr Bs particular case. But 
these points dont persuade me to alter my conclusions about what is fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances of the complaint  for the reasons Ive set out above I dont uphold this 
complaint. 
This means AXA doesnt have to do anything to put things right.my decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint  so I make no award.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2021.
