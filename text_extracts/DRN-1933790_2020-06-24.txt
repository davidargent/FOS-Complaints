The complaint
Mr F complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in May 2020 that I summarise below.
Mr F was given five loans by Sunny between July and December 2018. Each of the loans 
was due to be repaid in six monthly instalments. Due to his pattern of borrowing Mr F's first 
four loans were outstanding at the same time. Mr F successfully repaid his first four loans 
but was unable to repay loan 5. Sunny registered a default against that loan in May 2019 
and the loan remained outstanding when Mr F made his complaint. A summary of Mr F's 
borrowing from Sunny is as follows;
Loan 
NumberBorrowing 
DateRepayment 
DateLoan 
Amount 
1 14/07/2018 21/12/2018 £  100
2 16/07/2018 21/12/2018 £  150
3 17/07/2018 21/12/2018 £  100
4 18/07/2018 21/12/2018 £  100
5 21/12/2018 - £  450
 
In my provisional decision I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, and 
in particular I said that the checks Sunny needed to do should take into account things such 
as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I thought less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
I thought that the checks Sunny did before agreeing the first four loans were proportionate. 
So I didn't think it had been wrong for Sunny to agree to give these loans to Mr F. I noted our 
adjudicators concerns about how quickly each of these loans had been borrowed. But on 
balance I thought that it was most likely Mr F was taking advantage of Sunny's policy to 
allow up to four concurrent loans. I didn't think the borrowing pattern, in the specific 
circumstances of Mr F's relationship with Sunny, should have indicated to the lender that 
Mr F was most likely facing problems managing his money.
I thought that Sunny should have done more checks before agreeing loan 5. But Mr F hadn't 
given us enough information for me to determine what better checks would have shown to 
the lender. So I wasn't able to say that Sunny had been wrong to agree that final loans 
either.Mr F has said that he is happy with my provisional decision. We haven't heard anything back 
from Sunny.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Given that neither party has provided 
me with any new evidence or further comments I see no reason to alter the conclusions 
I reached in my provisional decision.
It follows that I don't think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, and in my provisional decision, I dont uphold the complaint or 
make any award against Elevate Credit International Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2020.
