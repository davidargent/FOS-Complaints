K821x#15Complaint
Mr M has complained about NewDay Ltd and their decision  to register a default against his 
credit file.
Background
Mr M contacted NewDay in March 2018  and entered into a fair treatment arrangement  
(FTA). NewDay  accepted  a re-payment  plan,  agreeing to halt any further interest and 
charges.
As this re-payment  amount didnt cover the minimum  payment, the account  continued  to 
build arrears. Because of this, NewDay issued a default notice. Mr M and NewDay  
discussed this default on 25 May and he continued  with the plan.
NewDay then wrote to Mr M to explain that they were closing his account. Mr M contacted  
NewDay on a number  of occasions to discuss making a payment that would prevent the 
default. 
A payment of the full balance wasnt made  so NewDay sold the debt to a third party 
company on 31 October, registering a default  on the same day. 
Mr M felt NewDay didnt  provide him the opportunity  to make  a full payment. He felt NewDay  
didnt make him aware his account could  be defaulted when he was in an FTA. So, the 
default was registered unfairly  and he wanted  it removed.
NewDay responded saying they made  a business  decision  to sell the debt as the arrears 
had continued  to build. They felt they followed the correct process  when registering the 
default and transferring the debt so didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr M wasnt happy with NewDays response  so he referred his complaint to us.
An investigator looked in Mr Ms complaint and didnt uphold it. They thought  NewDay acted 
reasonably when registering the default.  They agreed with NewDays offer of £30 
compensation, made after their final response, to recognise NewDays  failure  to provide a 
call back.
Mr M disagreed with this view but accepted  the £30 offer in the interim. Mr M argued  had 
NewDay responded to his communication in October, he wouldve  been able to pay the 
account in full. He said although  his situation  hadnt  changed, he had people willing to pay 
the amount to prevent  a default. So, he maintained the default  was registered unfairly and 
now impacted his ability to secure  future  credit.
As Mr M disagreed with our investigators view, the complaint  has been passed to be for a 
decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I wont be upholding the 
complaint for broadly  the same reasons as the investigator.
Default
Ref: DRN16396662Ive looked into whether  NewDay acted  reasonably  when registering the default and also 
whether they made Mr M reasonably aware  about  the actions they took and why.
Ive seen system notes  that document the FTA between NewDay and Mr M as well as the 
monthly statements  sent to Mr M. They show that interest and charges were suspended and 
that a £5 payment was made  as agreed. However,  they also show  the account was building 
arrears as the minimum payment calculated from the outstanding balance wasnt being paid. 
I think these statements explain clearly that any arrears are payable immediately, in line with 
the credit  agreement Mr M entered into. As Mr Ms payments werent  covering  the arrears,  I 
think NewDay have acted  reasonably when issuing  a default notice on 19 May.
Ive listened to the call Mr M made to NewDay after receiving the notice. I think NewDay 
made Mr M aware  of how the arrears were  being  built and that the account  would  likely  be 
closed and defaulted. Mr M was aware at this point  that, unless he was able to pay the 
outstanding arrears, a default would be registered.
During the call, Mr M decided to wait and see if his financial situation  improved. 
Unfortunately, this wasnt the case. Id expect  NewDay  to continue  to manage the account 
and its default  as per the usual process during  this time.
NewDay closed the account and informed  Mr M of their intention  to register  a default in 
letters dated  7 July and 6 September.  This followed the advice Mr M was provided in the 
phone call. So, I think NewDay  have acted reasonably in the actions theyve taken up to this 
point.
Mr M states  he then wrote  to NewDay  on two occasions after receiving the default notices 
and didnt receive a response.  He states  he intended to pay the full balance so if hed have 
spoken to NewDay,  they couldve taken payment before the default was registered.
Ive seen Mr M wrote to NewDay 13 September. NewDay  responded on 21 September but 
didnt respond  to Mr Ms request for them not to register  a default. They only mentioned 
Mr Ms request to change  the payment date. I would expect NewDay to respond to every  
point Mr M raised and I think theyve failed  to do so here.
But, Ive seen Mr M called NewDay on 3 October to discuss this further, before the default 
was registered.  So Mr M did have the chance speak to NewDay after receiving the default 
notices. I think this call gave Mr M a reasonable opportunity to discuss and pay the default 
before it was registered. Because of this, I dont think NewDays failure to mention the 
default in their letter has impacted Mr M.
System notes show on this call Mr M agreed  to make a payment on 15 October. The notes 
dont reflect him making  an offer to pay the entire balance. Mr M continued  to call NewDay  
and made  a payment of £5 on 16 November, after the default had been  registered.
I wouldnt expect Mr M to continue to make smaller payments if his intention  was to pay the 
full amount as he was aware at this time that a default was pending. Because  of this, I dont 
think its likely that Mr M would have made  the full payment even  if NewDay had responded 
to all of his communication.
Ref: DRN16396663Mr M had 5 months from being  made  aware a default could be registered to make the full 
payment and this wasnt received. He didnt  make this payment so I cant agree NewDay  
have prevented him from doing so. NewDay have  an obligation to record an accurate  
reflection of how Mr M manages  his account  and so Id expect them  to place the default.  
For these reasons, I think the process NewDay has followed when registering the default 
have been reasonable  and they dont  need to take any further  action to resolve  the 
complaint.
Callback
NewDay have offered Mr M £30 to recognise  their failure to call him back after receiving his 
request for a breakdown  of his charges and interest.  This offer was made  after we accepted 
Mr Ms complaint. Id expect NewDay to respond to this e-mail so I agree their failure  
warrants recognition.  However, I dont  think their error impacted Mr Ms ability to pay the 
arrears before the default was registered for the reasons already listed  above. 
So, when considering the remedy  Ive taken into account the frustration the lack of response  
this e-mail would have  created. Ive also considered that Mr M received monthly statements 
which included the charge  and interest  information  he wanted. Hed also spoken  to NewDay  
on a number of occasions where this information could have been asked for. 
I can understand how the lack of response  would make Mr M feel ignored and this would 
have caused some frustration. For these  reasons,  I think NewDays  offer of £30 is a 
reasonable amount to recognise  the upset this caused.
My final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above, I uphold Mr Ms complaint  about  NewDay Ltd. They  must  
pay Mr M £30 to recognise the frustration created by their failure to call Mr M back.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 November 2019.
