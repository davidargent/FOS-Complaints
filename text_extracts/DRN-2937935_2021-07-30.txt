The complaint
X, a limited company, has complained about MacDonald Group. X argues that it mis-sold 
cover as it didnt complete appropriate searches and that it failed to notify two claims to the 
insurer which then impacted the insurers response to those claims. 
What happened
X lets properties. MacDonald used to arrange the block insurance which covered Xs 
properties against damage to the buildings and landlords contents.
 
In August 2018 damage was caused to one of Xs properties which Ill refer to as Property R. 
X was only made aware of issues at the property in October 2018 when it was contacted by 
the Police. Also on 9 October 2018 damage was found at another of Xs properties which Ill 
refer to as Property C. X notified MacDonald of both issues on 10 October 2018. However 
MacDonald didnt notify the insurer straight-away. The claim for Property C was made to the 
insurer on 25 October 2018, and that for Property R in March 2019. Whilst the insurer then 
considered both claims, the outcome of those claims was affected to one extent or another 
by MacDonalds late notification. MacDonald says it notified the claims when it had the 
relevant detail it felt was needed to make those claims, and the insurers decision was not 
negatively affected on account of when those claims were notified to it. 
X said it was also concerned about how MacDonald had handled arranging its policy. It felt 
MacDonald hadnt searched the market well enough, and if MacDonald had it would have 
been with a different insurer at the point the losses occurred. MacDonald set out details of 
some of the work it had done, it concluded it had handled the arrangements appropriately.
X complained to us.
Our investigator felt the insurers letter on each claim, setting out its reasons for decline, 
evidenced that the date of notification hadnt influenced its findings. She felt it had handled 
arranging the policy appropriately. X objected. It said that, in respect of both claims, the late 
notification had been material to the insurers findings. Regarding how the policy had been 
arranged, X said it was a fact it now had a better policy directly with the insurer which had 
underwritten the branded policy MacDonald had arranged for it and, contrary to what 
MacDonald had said, thered been no issue getting a quote. It felt this was something 
MacDonald shouldve obtained a quote for. The complaint was passed to me for a decision 
to be made.
I felt that some loss had occurred to X, in respect of its claim for Property R, on account of 
failures of Macdonald. I wasnt otherwise persuaded Macdonald had failed X, or that if it may 
have done, it reasonably needed to do anything about that. My full findings were:
Mis-sale
I understand that MacDonald didnt approach Xs current insurer for a quote because it 
believed it wouldnt offered one because it was the insurer behind the branded policy 
X already had. Im not persuaded that just because another broker was then able to obtain a 
quote directly from that insurer that means MacDonald was wrong or that it should have 
done something differently. And even if I were persuaded in that respect, it isnt clear to me 
that X suffered a loss as a result of this. It would also be difficult for me to say the policy 
MacDonald arranged shouldnt have been in place when its clear that X has benefitted from 
that policy as claims have been made against it, which have been considered and in some 
cases, settled or partially settled. I dont intend to make any award against MacDonald in 
respect of how it arranged Xs policy.
Claim for Property C
In terms of Property C, part of the insurers reason for declining the claim was a breach of 
the policys late notification condition. However, X made a complaint to this service about the 
insurers decision to decline its claim for Property C and Ive now issued some provisional 
findings on that complaint. As a result, assuming my final decision on the insurers reliance 
on the late notification condition to decline the claim for Property C stays the same, this 
issue against MacDonald falls away. 
Claim for Property R
Turning to Property R; MacDonald was made aware by X on 10 October that a loss, which 
it believed to be covered by its policy, had occurred. Under the agreement MacDonald had 
with X, MacDonald was obliged to handle the claim. To handle a claim a wealth of detail is 
required. I see that whilst MacDonald asked X for information, this wasnt presented to 
MacDonald immediately. However, in more general terms, it is the duty of a broker to act 
appropriately to protect the position of its client. And that would include notifying claims to 
the insurer in a timely manner. What a timely manner might be could be a matter for 
consideration in some circumstances. But here the policy MacDonald had arranged for 
X included a very important term (a condition precedent) about when claims must be notified 
to the insurer. The condition says:
In the event of any occurrence likely to give rise to a claim under this policy you will report it 
to us as soon as practicable or in any event within 5 days.
The condition continues to say that full details of the claim must be given within 30 days. 
Whilst notification was given by X to MacDonald as soon as was practicable  that being at 
the point it was made aware by the Police of an issue  X did not provide full details to 
MacDonald within 30 days. But when X made MacDonald aware of the loss, MacDonald 
didnt notify the claim to the insurer as soon as was practicable, or within 5 days. And 
MacDonald didnt emphasise to X that it was imperative for these two things (notification and 
provision of full details, to the insurer) to take place within very strict timescales. I think if 
MacDonald had done so X would have acted to comply with the condition.
The insurer did ultimately cover most of Xs claim for Property R. But it capped its lability for 
lost rent. The insurer said it would only cover Rs claim for lost rent from March 2019, the 
date it was notified of the claim. It appears that if it had been notified earlier, the loss, from 
that earlier notification date, would have been covered. I think MacDonald, therefore, needs 
to compensate X for its loss caused by the insurers limited claim settlement.
From what Ive seen I think its clear that X didnt act with all haste to provide MacDonald 
with information. But I think if it had been aware of the 30 days time period for provision of 
information to the insurer, it would have complied with that. That would have meant the 
insurer would have had no cause to limit settlement of the claim. And the March 2020 email 
from the insurers loss adjuster shows that the limited settlement, of 13 months of rent from a 
total loss claimed for of 20 months (£11,000, giving monthly rent of £550), was due to the 
claim not being notified by MacDonald until March 2019. I think MacDonald then reasonably 
needs to compensate X for the seven months of lost rent the insurer refused to pay on 
account of the late notification of the claim. That totals £3,850. I think MacDonald will have to add interest* to the above sum. But for the late notification 
issue the insurer would arguably have settled the claim fully and earlier than it did because 
the delay from October 2018 until March 2019 would have been avoided. However, I note 
that shortly after it was first notified of the claim in March 2019, the insurer declined it 
outright, for reasons totally unrelated to the late notification. It was then March 2020 before 
the restricted settlement was made. Whether or not the insurer should have handled the 
claim quicker, I cant fairly blame that on MacDonald. So I think its fair to say that if 
MacDonald had notified the insurer in October 2018, its likely it would still have taken the 
insurer about a year to progress the claim to settlement. That means that it would have been 
about October/November 2019 when X should, but for MacDonalds failures, have had the 
benefit of both the 13 months rent the insurer settled for and the £3,850 the insurer refused 
to pay on account of the claim being notified late. The fact that X did not get either of those 
payments until substantially later, was MacDonalds fault. 
As X was out of pocket due to MacDonalds error, Im going to say MacDonald should pay 
an amount to X equivalent to interest* on the whole claim amount for lost rent of £11,000. 
There are two figures which make up that sum  £7,150 which the insurer offered to X on 
26 March 2020, and £3,850 which Im saying MacDonald must now pay. So I intend to make 
MacDonald pay interest to X on these two sums from 1 November 2019 and until, for the 
sum of £7,150  26 March 2020, and for the sum of £3,850 until settlement is made.
Solicitors acting for X confirmed X had no further comment to make. Macdonald said it 
disagreed with my provisional decision. In summary Macdonald said:
X is a sophisticated commercial consumer.
It acknowledges that it did not highlight the relevant policy time periods to X, but 
emphasized that it did ask it several times to provide all the requested claim information 
to it. 
It understands that X was notified of the incident at Property R sometime before [Xs] 
eventual notification to it in October 2018.
It thinks X may not have returned Property R to a habitable state as soon as it could 
have done, thereby not mitigating its loss. This, MacDonald said, may have impacted on 
the insurers decision to limit the loss of rent claim settlement. Further there was no 
tenant in place at the time of the loss, the rental payments were in arrears and it isnt 
clear when a new agreement, but for the loss, might have begun.
Its delay in notification of the claim was 5 months, so its unclear why its being asked to 
pay for 7 months lost rent.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
X opted to use Macdonald as a broker. I remain of the view that MacDonald, acting in that 
role, should have done more to look after Xs interests and make sure X was aware of key 
policy terms. As I explained provisionally, MacDonalds repeated requests for claim detail, 
set in light of the fact the time-periods were not highlighted, wasnt enough. I see that MacDonald understands what X knew and when. Also that it clearly has concerns 
about the reasoning for the insurers limited settlement and seems to feel that X may not 
have been entitled to the full 20 months of lost rent claimed for. But I havent seen any 
evidence presented to support these concerns. If I had, then maybe my view would have 
been different. But as it stands, Im satisfied that the claim settlement X received from its 
insurer, for Property R, was reduced due to the delayed notification. And Im satisfied that 
MacDonald is responsible for that delay.
The delay was October 2018 to March 2019  but the exact period of delay doesnt mean 
I can only award compensation for those months. Rather I have to think about what loss was 
caused as a result of that delay. I did that when I made my provisional decision and 
explained in my findings, copied above, why I think MacDonald is responsible for paying X a 
sum equivalent to seven months lost rent. My view on that hasnt changed.   
I remain of the view, as explained provisionally, that MacDonald is liable for lost rent Xs 
insurer didnt pay, as well as for paying interest on the whole amount X claimed for (some of 
which the insurer paid, and some of which Im saying MacDonald must pay). My provisional 
findings havent changed and they now form part of the findings of this, my final decision.
Putting things right
I require MacDonald pay X:
£3,850, for lost rent the insurer refused to pay.
An amount equivalent to interest* on the sum of £3,850 applied from 1 November 2019 
until settlement is made.
An amount equivalent to interest* on the sum of £7,150 applied from 1 November 2019 
until 26 March 2020.
*Interest is at a rate of 8% simple per year and paid on the amounts specified and from/to 
the dates stated. If MacDonald considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to 
take off tax from any interest due to X, it should tell it how much its taken off. It should also 
give X a certificate showing this if it asks for one, so it can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue 
& Customs if appropriate.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. I require MacDonald Group to provide the redress set out above at 
Putting things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask X to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 August 2021.
