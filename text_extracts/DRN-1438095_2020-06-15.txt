What happened
This complaint is about 36 instalment loans Sunny provided to Miss S between       February 
2015 and June 2019. All the loans were repayable by six monthly instalments and have all 
been repaid except Loan 35. Miss Ss lending history is as follows:

In its final response letter, Sunny didnt uphold any of the loans. It noted that Miss S had paid 
all her repayments on time or within seven days of them falling due. 
Our adjudicator recommended that Miss Ss complaint should be upheld in part. He said that 
by Loan 4 proportionate checks would have shown that Miss S had a significant amount of 
short term loans with other lenders as well as one outstanding loan with Sunny. This ought 
to have alerted Sunny to the possibility that Miss S might have been having problems managing her money. And he said that by Loan 6, Miss Ss overall pattern of borrowing 
suggested that she had become persistently reliant on short term loans. So he 
recommended that Loans 4 to 36 be upheld.
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicators recommendations. It said that the adjudicator hadnt 
provided specific information as to what amounted to proportionate checks. It also said that it 
allowed its borrowers to take out up to four loans with it at any one time. Sunny said that 
Miss S was required to use on average 5.21% of her monthly income to make a contractual 
repayment on any Sunny loan. It noted that there was a seven month gap between      Loans 
14 and 15 and said that the gap didnt support the adjudicators conclusion that   Miss S had 
become persistently reliant on short term loans. It was treating Loan 15 onwards as a 
separate chain of lending. But it considered it prudent to have done things differently for 
Loans 12 to 14 and Loans 26 onwards and it offered to settle these loans and pay 8% 
interest on the refunds of interest on these loans and remove them from Miss Ss credit file.
Miss S rejected Sunnys offer. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
To start with, it seems that Miss S has accepted our adjudicators findings. So I think this 
means I no longer need to make a decision about Loans 1 to 3. But I have kept these loans 
in mind when thinking about Miss Ss lending relationship with Sunny.
As Sunny has offered to settle Loans 12 to 14 and 26 onwards, I havent investigated these 
loans below. But I have included the redress for them in my proposed compensation award.
When Sunny lent to Miss S the regulator was the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and 
relevant regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC). The 
CONC contained guidance for lenders about responsible lending. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss S could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss S could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the CONC defines sustainable as being without undue difficulties 
and in particular the consumer should be able to make repayments, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ss complaint.
Sunny did a number of checks before it lent to Miss S. It appears that for Loans 1 and 2 it 
asked her for details of her monthly income and credit expenditure as these are shown on its 
Loan Datasheet. From Loan 3 it asked her for details of her monthly income and total 
expenditure. Miss Ss declared income for all the loans ranged from £1,230 to £2,900.
Miss Ss total expenditure for Loans 3 to 36 ranged from £479 to £2,379. It appears that 
most of her expenditure was spent on credit commitments.
Sunny also checked Miss Ss credit file before agreeing to the loans. It has provided us with 
a brief summary of the results of its credit checks. It appears from the summaries Ive seen 
that there wasnt any adverse information such as bankruptcy, IVAs or debt management 
plans that I think should have caused additional concerns to Sunny. 
Weve received a credit report from Miss S which shows a number of other short term loans 
which I shall refer to below.
Loan 3 was still outstanding when Miss S firstly took out Loan 4 for £100 and then Loan 5 for 
£200 shortly after Loan 4 was repaid. Although the amounts that Miss S borrowed on Loans 
4 and 5 were significantly less than Loan 3, the highest total monthly repayment amounts on 
the loans increased to around £329 and £361 respectively. I also note from Sunnys Loan 
Datasheet that it was aware that Miss Ss credit expenditure had increased substantially to 
£850 before Loan 4 and £905 before Loan 5. So I think that Sunnys checks needed to go 
further and that it would have been proportionate for Sunny to have asked Miss S more 
about her other short term borrowing. 
I note from Miss Ss credit report and bank statements that she appeared to have two other 
short term loans with other lenders which would have been repayable around the same time 
as Loans 3, 4 and 5. But I cant safely say that if Sunny had carried out proportionate checks 
before Loans 4 and 5, it wouldve seen that Miss S couldnt sustainably make the 
repayments to Loans 4 and 5. So Im not upholding her complaints about these loans. I 
asked the adjudicator to ask Miss S if she had any comments to make about Loans 4 and 5 
not being upheld. Miss S said that she would be happy to accept a decision that didnt 
uphold Loans 4 and 5.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ss case, I think that this point was reached by 
Loan 6. I say this because:
By Loan 6, Miss S had been borrowing from Sunny for nearly eight months with no 
gaps between her previous three loans. Loan 6 was her third loan in eight weeks.
There was an emerging pattern from Loan 4 of Miss S taking a new loan in addition 
to her existing loan, repaying it and then taking out a higher amount shortly after 
repaying the previous one. I think this indicated that Miss S was becoming dependent 
on this type of borrowing.
Miss S wasnt making any real inroads to the amounts she owed Sunny. With Loan 6, 
her total outstanding loans were £1,250. This was £150 higher than her previous 
highest total loan balance. And Miss S had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
Miss S had repaid all of her loans early. I think that the continuous repayment of 
loans early should have raised concerns with Sunny that Miss S might not be 
managing repayments sustainably and that she may be dependent on short term 
lending to meet an ongoing need.
 
I can see that as Sunny didnt stop lending at this point, Miss S went on to take out a further 
30 high cost loans for almost another 45 months. 
I note that there was a gap of around seven months between the repayment of Loan 14 and 
Loan 15 being taken out. But I dont think it would have been reasonable for Sunny to have 
seen this gap as an indication that Miss Ss finances had moved on from whatever situation 
had required her previous loans. I note that Miss S returned to Sunny to borrow £600 on 
Loan 15 which wasnt a small amount. There had also been an established period of 
borrowing before Loan 15 which I think Sunny ought to have been concerned about 
irrespective of the length of pause between Loans 14 and 15. So Im treating Loans 15 
onwards as part of the same chain of lending as Loans 1 to 14.
I think that Miss S lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from Loan 6 
onwards because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ss indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Miss Ss 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
The fact that nearly all the loans were repaid does not mean that they were repaid 
sustainably, or without causing Miss S undue difficulty. 
 
I note that Sunny said that Miss S had paid all her repayments on time or within seven days 
of them falling due. This wasnt the case with Loan 35. But with regard to Miss Ss other 
loans, I think Sunny will (or ought to) know from previous decisions that this service 
considers there will be times when the pattern of lending alone is enough to indicate that a 
consumer is likely to be in financial difficulty  or would otherwise be harmed should relending continue. So it follows that successful repayment of a loan doesnt automatically 
mean it was repaid sustainably.
I note that Sunny said that Miss S used an average of 5.21% of her income to make her 
contractual repayments on any Sunny loan. But I can see that Miss S used a significant 
 proportion of her income to repay her first two loans. And I think the percentage of Miss Ss 
monthly income used to repay other loans was far higher than 5.21% as Miss S often had at 
least two and sometimes three or four loan repayments to make to Sunny.
I note that Sunny referred to the gap in lending between Loans 14 and 15. I have referred to 
this above.
I also think that when a consumer borrows numerous loans over a long period of time, its 
most likely that the loans arent being used for their intended purpose of temporary cash flow 
problems. As Sunny will know, the FCA made it clear in a recent letter to CEOs of high cost 
lending firms that a high volume of relending..may be symptomatic of unsustainable 
lending patterns. And I think that is the case here.
So Im upholding this complaint in part with regard to Loans 6 to 36 and Sunny should put 
things right as shown below.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this 
complaint, I order Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, to take the following 
steps:
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debt on Loan 35 Sunny should buy this back if it is able to 
do so and then take the following steps. If it isnt able to buy the debt back then it 
should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) Sunny should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss S towards interest, 
fees and charges on Loans 6 to 34 and Loan 36, not including anything Sunny has already 
refunded.
B) Sunny should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss S 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss S originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on Loan 35, and 
treat any repayments made by Miss S as though they had been repayments of the principal 
on Loan 35. If this results in Miss S having made overpayments then Sunny should refund 
these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then 
refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on Loan 35 (and any principal written-
off under a redress scheme). If this results in a surplus then the surplus should be paid to 
Miss S. However if there is still an outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree 
an affordable repayment plan with Miss S.
E) The overall pattern of Miss Ss borrowing for Loans 6 to 36 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans entirely from       Miss 
Ss credit file. If Sunny has sold Loan 35, it should ask the debt purchaser to do the same. Sunny doesnt have to remove Loan 35 from Miss Ss credit file until this has been repaid, 
but it should still remove any adverse information recorded about this loan.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct tax from this interest. Sunny should 
give Miss S a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one. If 
Sunny intends to use the refund to reduce an amount Miss S owes, Sunny must do this after 
tax.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 July 2020.
