K821x#15complaint
Mr and Mrs L have complained about  the administration of their mortgage account  by 
Yorkshire Building Society (YBS).
background
In September  2000 Mr and Mrs R took out a mortgage with YBS.  They borrowed £60,000, 
initially on an interest-only basis. In January  2006 almost £29,000 was transferred onto a 
capital repayment  basis. In July 2006  a further advance of £10,000  was taken out on a 
capital repayment  basis. As a result,  the mortgage was split into various sub-accounts, with 
one part  about £31,000  being  interest-only and the remaining sub-accounts being capital 
repayment.
In August  2009  Mr and Mrs R asked  YBS to transfer  £10,000 of their mortgage from an 
interest-only basis onto a capital and interest  repayment basis. This would create a new sub-
account, on a capital repayment  basis. Unfortunately YBS made a mistake and transferred 
£10,000 from one of the existing capital repayment sub-accounts  to the new sub-account.
In October  2011 Mr and Mrs R transferred a further  £9,500 from the interest-only sub-
account into a new capital repayment sub-account. In June 2015 and November 2018 there 
were two further capital  repayment sub-accounts created for further advances  of £29,000 
and £15,000 respectively.
In total there were  seven sub-accounts.
Mr and Mrs R say that they only became aware  in 2019 that the £10,000 which should have 
been transferred  from interest-only to capital repayment in 2009  was still on interest-only, at 
which point they complained to YBS. After investigating the matter, YBS accepted it had 
made a mistake.  YBS offered  compensation of £1,307.69. This was made up of £1,057.69 
for additional interest charged on the £10,000 over the period, and £250 for trouble and 
upset.
Mr and Mrs R were unhappy  with this and complained to us. They believe that the interest-
only portion of their mortgage has been  £10,000 higher than it needed to have been 
throughout the ten-year period. They believe  they should be compensated for this.
An investigator looked at the complaint. Because YBS had acknowledged its mistake  the 
only issue was what redress was fair and reasonable.
The investigator found that, if Mr and Mrs Rs instructions had been followed correctly  in 
2009, the mortgage balance would have reduced  more than it has. But on the other hand, 
Mr and Mrs R would  have had to make higher monthly repayments,  to cover the capital 
repayment element  of that £10,000. This meant that the account had been under-funded.
The investigator also noted that Mr and Mrs R had been told in January  2013 that they owed 
£19,974 on the interest-only  part of the mortgage, and were also given a balance  update  in 
December 2013.  In the circumstances, she didnt think it was fair that YBS should be held 
wholly responsible.
The investigator said that YBS should re-work the account as if the £10,000 had been put on 
capital and interest repayment in August 2009,  and compensate Mr and Mrs R for 50% of 
Ref: DRN91801092the underfunded amount,  less the £1,057.69 already paid to Mr and Mrs R for additional 
interest charged.
YBS agreed to do this, but Mr and Mrs R didnt agree. They  say that the settlement is only 
10% of what they believe is the actual final impact on them.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as the investigator, for largely the same reasons.
Its not disputed  that YBS made a mistake in 2009.  What Im required to do is put Mr and 
Mrs R back in the position theyd have been  in if the mistake hadnt been  made.  This means 
YBS has to rework the account as if the right payments had been made from 2009. 
YBS will have to write off some of the capital shortfall that had built up to the date the 
mistake was sorted out. Im satisfied that if no mistake had been  made,  Mr and Mrs R would 
have been able to afford  the higher repayment theyd have needed to make from 2009  
onwards.
But Im also satisfied that Mr and Mrs R were given sufficient information at various times 
since 2009  in 2011, 2013 and 2017  to have been aware that the interest-only  part of 
their mortgage was £10,000 more than it should  have been. 
In the circumstances, I agree with the investigator  that, although the account needs to be re-
worked as if the £10,000 had been  put on capital repayment in August 2009, ordering YBS 
to make a full refund of the underfunded amount would not be fair or reasonable.
I appreciate Mr and Mrs R believe  they are out of pocket by £10,000, but they are not. They 
are out of pocket by the amount of capital  which  the account would have reduced by if theyd 
been making the full capital and interest  repayments since  2009,  as well as extra  interest 
charged on the full £10,000 over the period.  
I note that YBS has paid Mr and Mrs R £250 for trouble and upset. Im satisfied this is fair 
and reasonable,  and so Im not ordering YBS to pay anything  further  for this.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. 
In full and final settlement,  within 28 days  of receiving Mr and Mrs Rs acceptance of this 
final decision, Yorkshire Building Society  must rework Mr and Mrs Rs mortgage account as 
if £10,000 had been put onto capital repayment  basis in August 2009 assuming all payments 
had been made in full and on time. 
Yorkshire Building Society must  then refund  50% of the difference in the account balance  to 
Mr and Mrs R, after deducting the interest refund of £1,057.69  already  paid.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs R to 
accept or reject my decision  before  5 June 2020.
