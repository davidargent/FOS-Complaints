Ms P looks like she may have had some problems repaying her final two loans because STF 
has told this Service that outstanding balances remain.
For loans 1  5 the only information that STF has been able to provide this Service about 
them is as follows;
loan amount; 
interest due to be charged;
term the loan was due to run for and 
how long the loan was active for. 
What STF hasnt been able to provide this Service is the start and end date of each of the 
first five loans. 
The adjudicator, reviewed Ms Ps complaint and she thought STF had acted reasonably 
when it approved loans 1  5. But, from loan 6, the adjudicator was of the opinion STF 
needed to do further, more in-depth checks. But she didnt have enough information from 
Ms P to be able to conclude STF did something wrong when loans 6  9 were lent. 
However, the adjudicator did uphold Ms Ps complaint about loans 10  21 because in her 
view the overall pattern of lending was now harmful for Ms P and so these loans ought to not 
have been provided. 
Ms Ps representative received and appear to have agreed with the adjudicators findings. It 
did say that it may provide further information to this Service, but to date this hasnt been 
received, and no further extensions requests to allow more time to provide any information 
have been made. I therefore see no reason to delay the issuing of this final decision. 
STF didnt respond to the adjudicators assessment. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
There doesnt appear to be any ongoing disagreement about the outcome the adjudicator 
reached for loans 1  9. So, I no longer think they are in dispute and so I wont be making a 
finding on them. But what I would add, is that I dont disagree with what the adjudicator said, 
and I agree that STF checks needed to go further from loan 6. 
Instead, this decision will focus on what happened when loans 10  21 were lent. But Ive 
kept in mind loan 1- 9 as they do form part of Ms Ps lending history with STF. 
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms P could
repay her loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might suggest STF should have done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Ms P. These factors include: 
Ms P having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income); The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ms P having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms P coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms P. The loan payments being 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case.
At the time loans 10  21 were given, STF was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, 
which has set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) that payments are 
sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and in particular, made on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to make them. If a 
lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make 
their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those 
repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Ms Ps complaint.
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 10 - 21 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. STF has been able to provide this Service with a copy of Ms Ps 
application forms from loan 10. These application forms include details about the income 
and expenditure details that Ms P declared and what STF gathered from credit checks (for 
some of the later loans).  
I would say, that based on the details in the application form and the later income and 
expenditure assessments, that STF couldve have reasonably concluded that Ms P would be 
in a position to afford the repayments she was committed to making. 
But Id be inclined to think that from loan 10, STFs checks really needed to go further. At this 
point in the lending relationship, I think STF ought to have been verifying Ms Ps income and 
overall expenditure in order to have an accurate understanding of her actual financial 
position. I dont think it did this level of checks for all of Ms Ps loans. 
But in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Ms P, STF also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Ms P. Having looked at the overall pattern of STFs 
lending history with Ms P, I agree with our adjudicator that STF should reasonably have 
seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided 
loan 10. I say this because;
At this point STF ought to have realised Ms P was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Ms P had taken out a total of 10 loans, and this was now the fifth loan in 
at least 18 months (based on the known start dates of the loan). But its likely, Ms P 
had been indebted to STF for some time before that. 
So STF ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms P was having to borrow 
further to cover an ongoing need and that Ms Ps indebtedness was increasingly 
unsustainably.Ms Ps capital borrowing hadnt shown any signs that she was significantly 
decreasing what she was borrowing. In fact, the borrowing was either increasing or 
showing slight decreases. This suggests to me that Ms Ps indebtedness was overall 
increasing unsustainably, and she was likely needing further borrowing to cover 
ongoing living costs, rather than as a means to cover one-off purchases, for example. 
Ms P had developed a pattern of taking new loans around the same time previous 
ones were repaid, for example, loans 7 and 8 and loans 14 and 15 to name two. And 
at times Ms P had more than one loan running at the same time. This pattern 
continued throughout the lending relationship. So, STF ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Ms P, on these occasions, was having to borrow further to 
effectively cover a longer-term financial need. To me, this is also indicative of her 
indebtedness not being sustainable.
Ms P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed STF. Loans 20 and 21 
which were taken on the same day and were taken out at least four and half years 
after loan 6 (the first loan we have information for). And it was for a larger sum.  Ms P 
had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to STF over an 
extended period.
I think that Ms P lost out when STF provided loans 10 - 21 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ps indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans and the time in debt was likely to have had negative 
implications on Ms Ps ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 10 - 21 and Ill go on to set out
what STF should do to put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms P from loan 10 as I think it ought to.
 
Clearly there are several possibilities, and all hypothetical answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms P may have simply left matters there and 
not tried to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed between 
her and STF which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, she may 
have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct.
 
From what Ive seen in this case, I dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and 
substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Ms P in a compliant 
way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Ms P would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Imsatisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
STF shouldnt have given Ms P loans 10  21.
If STF has sold the outstanding debts it should buy these back if it is able to do so and then 
take the following steps. If STF isnt able to buy the debts back then it should liaise with the 
new debt owner to achieve the results Ive outlined below.
 
A. STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms P towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance. 
B. STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms P 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms P originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled. 
C. STF should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Ms P as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on these outstanding loans. If this results in Ms P having 
made overpayments then STF should refund these overpayments with 8% simple 
interest* calculated, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date 
the complaint is settled. STF should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E. 
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Ms P. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then STF should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with 
Ms P and Id remind STF of its obligation to treat Ms P fairly and with forbearance. 
E. The overall pattern of Ms Ps borrowing for loans 10 - 21 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so STF should remove these loans entirely from Ms 
Ps credit file. STF do not have to remove loans 20 and 21 from Ms Ps credit file until 
these have been repaid, but it should still remove any adverse information recorded 
about these loans.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. It should give Ms P a 
certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Ms Ps complaint in part.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 December 2021.
