K821x#15Complaint
Mr Y has complained about short-term loans granted to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid. Mr Y says he couldnt afford these  loans and that QuickQuid didnt 
take appropriate steps to check whether he could afford them when he took them out. 
Background
QuickQuid agreed 18 short-term loans for Mr Y between August 2011  and August  2013.  
Loans 1  17 were  payday loans, and were  repayable over between  one and three months. 
Loan 18 was a flexible credit agreement  (flex-credit). This was a credit  facility that allowed 
Mr Y to draw down money  up to a pre-agreed credit limit, with a view to repaying  it  
potentially over a period  of up to 10 months.
Ive set out a summary of the lending below.

QuickQuid objected to us looking at loans 1  5. It said that because of how long ago they 
were taken out, they fell outside  the rules that cover what complaints our service  can and 
cant consider. Mr Y subsequently  dropped his complaint about loans 1 - 5, and asked that 
we instead consider loans  6  17.
One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Ys complaint already and recommended  the 
complaint be upheld. He felt the checks QuickQuid carried out on loans 6 - 17 werent 
proportionate. And he thought that had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks on the 
above loans, it wouldve  concluded that all of the loans considered  wouldve  been 
unaffordable for Mr Y, and would not have  agreed to them.
Ref: DRN46141242QuickQuid disagreed with the adjudicators findings,  and Mr Y raised no new arguments in 
response to the adjudicators assessment. So as no agreements been reached at this stage, 
the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision.
As Mr Y has dropped his complaint about loans  1  5, my decision will focus on QuickQuids 
decision to approve  the remaining loans, loans  6  17. However,  I may make reference to 
some of the earlier loans,  as they do form part of the overall pattern of lending.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
QuickQuid initially said it carried out appropriate and proportionate checks when  Mr Y 
applied for his loans.  It said it analysed Mr Y's current financial commitments, insolvency 
records, delinquency records, County Court  judgments,  credit enquiries and other credit 
accounts he had active. It said it also verified information obtained from Mr Y directly as well 
as taking into account his credit-scoring  information  from credit reference agencies.  And 
based on these  checks it felt that it was appropriate  to lend him. 
But having  looked at the specifics  of Mr Ys case,  I dont think QuickQuid was right to provide 
him with some of his loans. Ill explain why.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr Y 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ys income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Ys complaint. These  questions  are:
1. Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks to satisfy  
itself that Mr Y would  be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr Y would  have been  able to do so?
Ref: DRN46141243When Mr Y applied  for the first loan Im considering,  hed been borrowing from QuickQuid for 
around four months, and this was the sixth loan hed taken out in that time, and hed 
declared a monthly  income of around  £1,274. But before I look further into his monthly 
outgoings, the highest monthly repayment on loan 6 alone was £1,000, which  represented 
more than 75% of Mr Ys monthly income.  And he was also taking out other loans from other 
short-term lenders around this time. 
So I think QuickQuid had enough information at this stage to determine that Mr Y was not in 
a position to meet the repayments on this loan in a sustainable manner, and as a 
responsible lender, should not have agreed to loan 6.  
2. Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ys indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending.  Ive  looked to see if there  was a point at which 
QuickQuid should  reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ys case, I think  this point was 
reached when  he applied for loan 7. I say this because:
Mr Y wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid  at this point. 
And was in effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an 
extended period
the amounts  Mr Y was borrowing had steadily been increasing, and QuickQuid ought 
to have realised it was likely his indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably 
I think that Mr Y lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ys indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was  likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ys ability 
to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost loans
So Im upholding  Mr Ys complaint about  loans 7 onwards because the overall pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything that 
leads me to conclude  QuickQuid  acted unfairly  or unreasonably towards  Mr Y in some other 
way.  
What QuickQuid needs to do to put things right
Ref: DRN46141244For the reasons  outlined  above, I dont think QuickQuid shouldve agreed to loans 6  17 for 
Mr Y. So it needs to refund all of the interest and charges Mr Y paid towards  these loans. 
Specifically, it should:
refund  the interest and charges Mr Y paid on loans  6  17;
 
pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple  a year from the date they were paid to the 
date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan 6  from Mr Ys credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 18 should be removed from 
Mr Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr Y a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Mr Ys complaint.
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 August 2019.
