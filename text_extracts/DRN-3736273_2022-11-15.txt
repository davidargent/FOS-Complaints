The complaint
Mr A complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, trading as Barclaycard, wont pay him the 
compensation that hes claimed for some garden furniture.
 
What happened
Mr A used his Barclaycard credit card in May 2021 to pay £1,019.94 for some garden 
furniture. The furniture was flat-packed and Mr A says that he put it together in March 2022 
when he noticed that the table wasnt the one that hed ordered. He says that he contacted 
the supplier which offered him £20 compensation, which it increased to £50 (or a £100 gift 
card), and then said that it would collect and replace the table as long as it was sufficiently 
packaged. Mr A then claimed £999.99 from Barclaycard in March 2022. He said that the 
table was meant to have a section in the middle for an ice bucket and contain a lid to cover 
the hole when not in use but the table sent was for a fire pit, no lid was provided and the 
wrong sized piece of glass was provided. 
Barclaycard says that it was contacted by Mr A after the time in which it could have made a 
chargeback claim had expired so it considered his claim under section 75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974. It didnt agree that the supplier had breached its terms and conditions and 
said that it believed that the suppliers offer to replace the table outside of the 30 day return 
period was more than fair. It accepted that the letter that it had sent to Mr A contained errors 
and apologised for that. Mr A wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that the 
supplier had offered to remedy the breach of contract and she didnt think that Barclaycards 
assessment of his section 75 claim was incorrect or that it needed to take any further action. 
Mr A has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that the 
supplier doesnt require returned products to be dismantled if it would be dangerous to do 
so, the supplier is in breach of its terms and conditions and it must give six months from the 
receipt of a product to raise an issue or fault, which he did. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Barclaycard says that it was contacted by Mr A after the time in which it could have 
made a chargeback claim for the payment that hed made to the supplier had expired 
 and I consider that it correctly concluded that a chargeback claim couldnt be made 
in these circumstances  so it considered his claim under section 75;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr As complaint about Barclaycard, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that 
Barclaycards response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but 
Im not determining the outcome of Mr As claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
the supplier said that Mr A had provided sufficient proof regarding the damage or 
fault with his order for which it apologised  so I consider that there has clearly been 
a breach of contract by the supplier;
the supplier offered Mr A a number of options to remedy the breach of contract, 
including to collect and replace the table  but it said that Mr A would need to make 
sure that the damaged table was sufficiently packaged;
Mr A said that he wasnt able to deconstruct the table or package it and that that 
would need to be done by the persons picking up the table  he says that theres a 
10kg piece of glass on the top of the table which is not safe to lift or package which 
has extremely sharp corners and that, due to the tension in the screws, items could 
very easily ping off and hit him when dismantling the table;
the supplier said that the courier wouldnt collect the table unless it was sufficiently 
packaged so Mr A made a claim to Barclaycard but it said that it believed that the 
supplier had been more that fair when offering to replace the table and that its terms 
state that goods should be returned in the condition in which they were delivered;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mr A to have noticed that the wrong 
table had been delivered when it was being unpacked and that it would be fair and 
reasonable to expect him to have contacted the supplier before he put it together if 
he wanted to return it and to have kept the packaging in which the table was 
delivered;
Im not persuaded that it was unfair or unreasonable for the supplier to require the 
damaged table to be sufficiently packaged for collection or that it was dangerous for 
Mr A to dismantle the table  so I consider that the terms on which the supplier had 
offered to replace the table were fair and reasonable and Im not persuaded that it 
was fair or reasonable for Mr A to require the supplier to collect the table without it 
being dismantled;
Mr A says that he had six months to raise an issue or fault  but the supplier has 
accepted that there was an issue with the table and the suppliers term that Mr A has 
referred to says that the supplier may reduce the refund to reflect any use of the 
goods if theyre rejected after more than six months and I dont consider that to be 
applicable in these circumstances;
Barclaycard accepted that the letter that it had sent to Mr A contained errors and 
apologised for that  and I consider its apology to be a fair and reasonable response 
to the issues with its letter; 
I sympathise with Mr A that he hasnt received the table that he ordered but I 
consider that the suppliers offer was fair and reasonable and that Barclaycards 
response to his section 75 claim was also fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in the circumstances for me to require 
Barclaycard to refund to Mr A any of the the money that he paid to the supplier, to 
pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 December 2022.
