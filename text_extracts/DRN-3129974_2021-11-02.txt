The complaint
Mrs G complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA have failed to provide a refund for an
item she ordered but didnt receive, and about the level of customer service they provided.  
What happened
On 27 December 2020 Mrs G ordered three windchimes costing £54.36 and paid for these
using her PayPal account.
She hadnt received the windchimes by 11 January 2021 so she contacted the seller who
provided her with a tracking number. Mrs G checked this number with the postal services
who confirmed that the parcel hadnt been delivered to her address.
Mrs G contacted the seller again by email on 24 and 25 February 2021 but still didnt receive
the goods shed ordered.
On 26 February 2021 she contacted PayPal to open a claim. On 4 March 2021 the seller
gave PayPal a different tracking number for Mrs Gs parcel. Once again, she checked this
with the postal services who confirmed the parcel the tracking number related to hadnt been
delivered to her address. She sent proof of this to PayPal.
On 11 March 2021 PayPal denied Mrs Gs claim. They said the seller had provided two
tracking numbers and the postal service had marked the parcel as delivered. So PayPal said
they couldnt uphold her claim.
Mrs G was unhappy with their response and complained to our service. Our investigator
considered the case and said Mrs G had put a lot of effort into finding out what had
happened to her parcel, and she didnt think shed have done this if shed received it.
Our investigator said she was surprised that PayPal hadnt questioned why the seller had
provided two tracking numbers for the same parcel. And that they hadnt considered the
evidence, from the postal services, which showed the items related to these tracking
numbers hadnt been delivered to Mrs G.
Mrs G also raised the level of customer service shed received from PayPal. This related to
having to speak to a different person each time she contacted them. Our investigator
considered this, but although she appreciated that this was frustrating for Mrs G, she said
how PayPal operated their phonelines was a commercial decision, and not something we
could ask them to change.
Our investigator also said that in their final response letter dated 10 April 2021 PayPal
referred to a different transaction, not the one Mrs G had asked them to investigate. She
asked them if they wished to consider the case again, but they told her they stood by their
response.
Based on the evidence provided our investigator didnt think that PayPal had carried out a
proper investigation of Mrs Gs complaint. So she recommended that they pay Mrs G £54.36
for the windchimes shed not received, with simple interest at 8% from 26 February 2021,
and £50 for the distress and inconvenience shed experienced.
As PayPal didnt accept our investigators opinion the case came to me for a decision.
I issued my provisional decision on 19 October 2021. In it I said: - 
In not upholding Mrs Gs claim PayPal relied on their terms and conditions which say: -
Your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not
Received claim, if:
 The seller has provided proof of delivery.  
If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in
favour of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the
goods.
While I agree that this is clear, the evidence from the seller isnt the only evidence PayPal
received. Having been told by PayPal that the seller had provided a tracking number which
showed her parcel had been delivered, Mrs G contacted the postal services and was told the
parcel hadnt been delivered to her address. She raised this with PayPal and when they
contacted the seller, they provided a different tracking number.
I think this should have raised some concerns with PayPal. If an item ordered had been sent
to the customer, I wouldnt expect the seller to provide a different tracking number, when the
one theyd previously provided was queried. But PayPal have simply said that the seller may
have made a mistake with the tracking number.
And they stood by their decision to close Mrs Gs claim, even after she provided further
evidence that the parcel the second tracking number related to, also hadnt been delivered to
her address.
PayPal accept the Mrs G has had a less than desirable experience but maintain that the
followed the correct procedures and acted in accordance with their User Agreement and the
policies it contains.
The guidance PayPal say theyve followed refers only to evidence from the seller. But it must
be the case that if theyre going to rely on evidence provided by the seller, that evidence
must be valid. In this case Mrs G has provided evidence that the parcels, related to both the
tracking numbers the seller provided, werent delivered to her address. So the evidence of
delivery PayPal relied on isnt valid and they should have accepted Mrs Gs claim under their
Buyer Protection and have provided her with a refund.
I appreciate Mrs Gs frustration at having to explain her concerns to someone else each time
she had to contact PayPal. While its not our role to tell businesses how they should operate,
I do think that she has received very poor customer service from PayPal. Shes been put to a
lot of trouble to obtain evidence that the goods she ordered werent delivered to her, and this
has simply been ignored by PayPal, when they were prepared to accept questionable
evidence from the seller.
So I require PayPal to refund Mrs G the money she paid for the items she didnt receive,
together with interest. And to pay her £150 for the distress and inconvenience she
experienced as a result of the poor customer service she received.
So my provisional decision was that I upheld Mrs Gs complaint.Mrs G has told us that shes happy to accept my provisional decision. But PayPal have 
indicated that they dont accept it.
Theyve said that during the claim Mrs G opened with them they received one tracking 
number which in accordance with their user agreement was valid information and proof 
delivery provided by the seller.
They say that Mrs G didnt provide them with any information from the postal services 
disputing the delivery. When Mrs G opened her claim under PayPal Buyer Protection for an 
item not received, they say they asked the seller to provide proof of delivery. Which they did 
by providing a shipping label and tracking information showing delivery to her address.  
So they say they correctly closed Mrs Gs claim in accordance with their user agreement, 
and that they did nothing wrong.
We asked Mrs G for her comments on what PayPal have said about her not providing any 
evidence that the items she ordered werent delivered to her.
Shes told us that she took photos of the documentation the postal service sent her and sent 
this to PayPal within a message in their resolution centre between 19 March and 12 April 
2021.
Shes told us that the resolution centre works a bit like a chat facility. You send a message 
and are notified by email when one of PayPals agents has responded. You can then go 
back in and respond again but the agent who responds each time is likely to be different.
Mrs G has shown us she received a number of messages from PayPal between 20 March 
and 12 April 2021. She says that during the chat she was talking to the agents about the 
photos shed submitted and what these showed. And she explained that although the 
tracking numbers provided by the seller had been scanned, the items hadnt been delivered 
to her address, and the postal service was able to establish this by where the postman was 
when the item was scanned as delivered.
Mrs G hasnt been able to show us the content of the chat conversations she had with 
PayPal, as she says after a time they disappear from the resolution centre. Shes also 
provided evidence of what the resolution centre looks like if she accesses it now. This shows 
that she cant see historical chats or their content.
Mrs G has also said that she went to a lot of time and effort to obtain evidence from the 
postal services and having done this, it simply wouldnt have made sense for her not to send 
this to PayPal.
We put this to PayPal and asked them to provide us with details of the chat conversations 
Mrs G had with their agents in the resolution centre. They replied saying that they dont have 
any record of evidence received from Mrs G and asked that she send this to them again, so 
they can consider it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I accept that its unlikely that Mrs G would have gone to the effort of obtaining evidence that 
the items werent delivered to her, if she then wasnt going to send this to PayPal. It follows 
that I accept what Mrs G has told us about providing evidence to PayPal that the goods she ordered werent delivered to her address.
Weve asked PayPal to provide details of the chat Mrs G had with their agents within the 
resolution centre. They havent provided this, theyve simply repeated that theyve received 
no evidence from Mrs G, and said if she sends it now, theyll consider it.
Im satisfied that Mrs G has provided the evidence she obtained from the postal services to 
PayPal. But having seen this they chose to rely on evidence from the seller, when they 
should have accepted this evidence and upheld her claim.
Im persuaded that it wouldnt be fair to ask Mrs G to now provide further copies of her 
evidence to PayPal, and further delay the resolution of her complaint. 
So I require PayPal to refund Mrs G the money she paid for the items she didnt receive,
together with interest. And to pay her £150 for the distress and inconvenience she
experienced as a result of the poor customer service she received.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, and in my provisional decision, my final decision is that I 
uphold Mrs Gs complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and to put things right I 
require them to do the following: -
 Pay Mrs G £54.36 for the items she didnt receive.
 Pay interest on this sum at 8% simple from 21 February 2021 until payment.
 Pay £150 compensation for the distress and inconvenience Mrs G has experienced.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2021.
