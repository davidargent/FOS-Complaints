The complaint
Mr M complains about the interest rate that hes being charged under a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Secure Trust Bank Plc, trading as V12 Retail Finance, that it didnt send him 
the loan agreement and that he didnt receive other documents that it sent to him.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that Mr M applied for a loan to pay for two 
sofas and he says that he made the application in-store using the suppliers screen; 
the sofas were supplied to him and, when V12 Retail Finance started collecting loan 
payments from him, he contacted it and asked for a copy of the agreement - he says 
that he then became aware of the interest rate that he was being charged;
Mr Ms loan application was successful and the sofas would only have been supplied 
to him if the supplier had received payment for them  which in this case was the 
loan from V12 Retail Finance;
I consider it to be more likely than not that Mr M had electronically signed the fixed 
sum loan agreement and had agreed to the terms that it contained  including the 
interest rate  and I dont consider that the supplier would have supplied the sofas to 
Mr M unless hed agreed to the loan;
I also consider it to be more likely than not that the loan application was made using 
information that Mr M had provided and that he would have confirmed those details 
to the supplier when he signed its screen;
V12 Retail Finance says that it sent a link to Mr M by e-mail for him to download the 
loan agreement in September 2017 to the e-mail address that was used on the 
application form and that it sent him a letter in August 2018 to remind him that the 
buy now  pay later period was ending to the address that it held for Mr M;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that had Mr M properly 
notified V12 Retail Finance of any changes to his e-mail or postal addresses;
Mr M says that he didnt receive the e-mail or letter but I consider it to be more likely 
than not that they were sent to him by V12 Retail Finance  even if they werent 
received by him;
Mr M had received the sofas but hadnt paid for them and Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that V12 Retail Finance has acted incorrectly in its 
dealings with him;
Mr M says that V12 Retail Finance should accept his original settlement offer of 
Â£4,957.65 minus any monthly payments already received  but I consider that Mr M 
knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that hed entered into a loan agreement 
with V12 Retail Finance to pay for the sofas, he didnt pay the amount of the loan 
during the buy now pay later period and hes now bound by the terms of the loan 
agreement (including the provisions relating to early repayment); and
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require V12 Retail Finance to accept a reduced settlement from Mr M, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2020.
