The complaint
Mr B has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-sold him a
packaged bank account, called an Advantage Gold account.
NatWest charged Mr B a monthly fee for the Advantage Gold account and provided 
several potential benefits in return. He thinks it should refund him all the fees he paid, 
plus interest. 
What happened 
Mr B has banked with NatWest for quite a long time. NatWest has looked at its records 
for him and has told us that:
in February 2003, he opened a fee-free account,
in April 2004, NatWest sold him the Advantage Gold account which replaced his fee-
free account and for which it charged the monthly fee,
in October 2005, Mr B closed the Advantage Gold account. 
I think NatWests records about this are probably reliable and I have taken this account 
history to be accurate. 
I understand that after Mr B closed the Advantage Gold account he opened a separate fee-
free account. 
One of our adjudicators has already looked into Mr Bs complaint. The adjudicator didnt 
think that NatWest had mis-sold the Advantage Gold account to him and didnt 
recommend that it should give him any money back.
Mr B didnt agree with the adjudicators findings and asked for an ombudsman to review 
his case. So, it has come to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about packaged bank accounts on our 
website, and Ive used this approach to help me to decide what to do about this case. Ive 
looked into everything that Mr B and NatWest have told us or sent us about the complaint, 
and Ive decided not to uphold it. Ill explain why.
In 2004, NatWest, along with other banks, was allowed to sell packaged bank accounts, 
like the Advantage Gold account, in two ways. It could do so without giving personal advice 
on an information-only (or non-advised) basis. Or, it could sell the account in an advised (or 
recommended) sale. In both situations, I would have expected NatWest to give Mr B a 
choice and tell him about the Advantage Gold accounts costs and benefits clearly and 
fairly. In an advised sale, I would also have expected it to check Mr Bs circumstances to 
see if he needed the benefits which the Advantage Gold account could provide. 
Mr B has said that NatWest recommended he should buy the Advantage Gold account 
during a meeting in one of its branches. NatWest has agreed it sold him the account 
through a branch but has said it did so on an information-only basis, which was its usual 
practice at the time. 
Obviously, as I wasnt present at the meeting, I cant tell for sure what happened. But, I 
havent seen sufficiently compelling evidence for me to think that NatWest changed its 
usual selling practice for Mr B. I certainly accept that it may well have talked positively to 
him about the Advantage Gold account, but Im not convinced it gave him personal advice. 
I have therefore considered this complaint to be about an information-only sale. 
By the time NatWest sold the Advantage Gold account to Mr B, he had held a fee-free 
account for over twelve months. Hes told us that at the time he wanted an overdraft and 
NatWest said that in order to obtain (one)....(he) would need to pay for the privilege by 
buying the Advantage Gold account . Hes said that the only reason he bought the 
Advantage Gold account was to get the overdraft. But, he now believes that what he recalls 
NatWest saying was wrong and he could have had an overdraft with his fee-free account.
Firstly, I would like to confirm that Mr Bs current belief is correct. It is very rare for Natwest 
and other banks to decide whether a customer can have an overdraft based on the type of 
account he or she holds. If NatWest was willing to grant Mr B an overdraft with the 
Advantage Gold account, then its highly likely that it would also have allowed him an 
overdraft with a fee-free account. But Mr Bs point is that he thinks NatWest misled him 
about this.
Again, I cant tell for sure what NatWest said, or didnt say, to Mr B. But, in 2004, one of the 
benefits available to customers with Advantage Gold accounts was that NatWest would 
usually charge them lower interest rates on overdrafts than it applied to customers with fee-
free accounts. Similarly, it also offered discounts on some types of personal loan, and I 
understand that shortly after buying the Advantage Gold account, Mr B took a loan from 
NatWest.
I fully accept that Mr B is doing his best to recall what NatWest said during the discussion, 
but it took place more than fifteen years ago and I think its more likely that NatWest told 
him about the possible benefits of the Advantage Gold account than misled him in the way 
he has described. It may well  have told Mr B that he could only have the overdraft and 
loan-related benefits if he bought the Advantage Gold account. But as this would have been 
true, it would have been a reasonable thing for it to say. 
I havent seen anything to make me think that NatWest told Mr B he couldnt keep his fee-
free account. So, Im satisfied it allowed him a choice, and there isnt any dispute that 
NatWest told Mr B about the monthly fees for the account. I also think its highly likely 
NatWest told him about the other benefits. After all, it was trying to sell the Advantage Gold 
account to him and it was in its own interest to tell him what he could gain by buying it. 
At the time, the other benefits of the Advantage Gold account included insurance for travel, 
discounts on some electrical goods and hotels and extended warranties on some products 
bought through the account. Mr B has told us that he didnt need  or use these benefits. 
However, in an information-only sale, this was not something NatWest had to check.Mr B has also told us that he was subject to a serious fraud which led to him closing the 
account. Hes pointed out that he didnt take another Advantage Gold account but went 
back to one without a monthly fee. I accept this, and Im very sorry indeed to hear that Mr B 
was a victim of fraud, but it doesnt follow that NatWest had mis-sold him the Advantage 
Gold account over a year earlier. 
So, in summary, Im satisfied that NatWest gave Mr B a choice and told him about the 
Advantage Gold accounts costs and benefits. And I doubt it misled him about overdrafts. I 
dont think that NatWest mis-sold the Advantage Gold account to Mr B. 
My final decision 
For the reasons I have set out above, I am not upholding Mr Bs complaint that National 
Westminster Bank Plc mis-sold him a packaged bank account. I am not going to tell it to give 
him any money back. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 July 2022.
