The complaint
Mr T complains that Oodle Financial Services Limited (Oodle) retained payments he  made 
towards his Hire Purchase Agreement when it agreed to rejection of his car. He would like all 
payments refunded, and compensation for the distress and inconvenience.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known so I wont repeat them again here instead I will 
focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
I appreciate it must have been frustrating for Mr T to have had problems with his car. 
Oodle agreed to rejection but retained payments made towards the agreement. I 
dont think this was unreasonable. Rejection was agreed around seven months into 
the agreement . During this time Mr T drove 10,000 miles. The usage was greater 
than the payments made but Oodle has written this excess amount off.
Mr T has told us the car was sold for more than he bought it for so Oodle hasnt 
suffered any loss. That may be the case that doesnt mean that Mr T shouldnt pay 
for the use he has had of the car. 
Oodle has also paid Mr T £120 for vehicle recovery costs and £100 compensation for 
distress and inconvenience. I think these payments are appropriate.in the 
circumstances
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 September 2022.
