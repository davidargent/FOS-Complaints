The complaint
Mr N says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr N says he couldnt afford the repayments, had to borrow from other short-term 
loan providers and was struggling to pay for his essential outgoings. 
What happened
This complaint is about 18 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mr N between April 2018 and 
January 2019. Mr Ns borrowing history is as follows:

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ns complaint and thought the loans from loan six 
onwards should be upheld because Mr Ns borrowing behaviour suggested he was 
persistently reliant on short-term lending.
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan 16 onwards. We put the 
offer to Mr N who didnt want to accept it and asked for his complaint to be passed to an 
ombudsman for decision. 
While the case was waiting to be allocated to an ombudsman another of our adjudicators 
reviewed the complaint. They agreed the complaint should be upheld from loan six onwards 
but didnt think all information about the loans six to nine was adverse and didnt need to be 
removed from Mr Ns credit file. They thought that point was reached by loan ten. 
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr N could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr N could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr N didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr N had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ns complaint.
From the beginning of Mr Ns borrowing relationship with Sunny, theres an indication that he 
may have potentially been struggling to manage his finances and I think that Sunny should 
have looked into this further. I say this because loan one was repaid only nine days after it 
was taken out rather than the agreed six-month term. And loan two was taken the same day 
that loan one was repaid. Loan two was for more than double the amount of loan one which 
could be a suggestion that Mr N had re-borrowed to pay off loan one and top up with an 
additional funds. 
Loan three was taken when loan two was still outstanding and there was further borrowing in 
May 2018 with loan four while loans two and three were yet to be repaid. Sunny has told us 
that it allows its customers the flexibility to manage their finances by being able to take more 
than one loan at a time. But I think that equally it could be the behaviour of someone who is 
having difficulty managing their finances. And at loan four, Mr N now owed Sunny £600 
compared to the initial borrowing a month earlier of £150. 
Mr N continued to repay loans early only to come back for further borrowing. Loan five was 
taken out only six days after loan four was repaid and loan six was taken out the same day 
that loan five was repaid. Bearing in mind the nature of short-term lending, I would question 
why someone would repay one loan early, only to quickly replace that borrowing with further 
lending. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr N, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ns case, and like the second adjudicator, I think 
that this point was reached by loan ten. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr N was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr N had taken out ten loans within five months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr N was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ns 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ns first loan was for £150 and loan ten was for £200.  At this point Sunny ought 
to have known that Mr N was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Like the earlier borrowing, Mr N was provided with a new loan within days of settling 
previous loans. Loans 12 to 15 were repaid on 28 November 2018, the day loan 16 
was taken out (followed by loan 17 the following day). And Loans 16 and 17 were 
repaid on 29 January 2019, the same day loan 18 was taken. And for the same 
amount as the total of loans 16 and 17  £600.
Mr N wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 18 was 
taken out nine months after Mr Ns first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr N had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Mr N lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan ten 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ns indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans Mr N borrowed was likely to have had negative implications on 
Mr Ns ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
 
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans six to 18 and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr N paid on loans six to 18;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans six to nine from Mr Ns credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan ten onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans ten to 18 should be removed from 
Mr Ns credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr N a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
 My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ns complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May202.
