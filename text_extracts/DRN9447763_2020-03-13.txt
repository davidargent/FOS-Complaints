K821x#15Complaint
Mr K says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny)  irresponsibly lent to him 
and provided him loans  without sufficient affordability checks  to assess  that he could 
reasonably afford the loan. 
Background
Mr K took one running credit account followed  by 24 instalment loans between  February  
2014 and May 2015. A summary of Mr Ks borrowing up to loan 12, based on the information 
provided to us by Sunny, is summarised below.

Our adjudicator thought Sunny had treated Mr K fairly when it provided  him with the running 
credit facility. The adjudicator also reviewed  how the facility  was used, and she felt that by 
the time Mr K request  his 14th drawdown  in December  2014, Sunny shouldnt have provided 
this or any further  credit  after this point. And she felt by the 6th instalment loan, the overall 
pattern of borrowing suggested  he had become reliant on short-term loans.
Sunny agreed  to uphold Mr Ks complaint from loan 13 onwards. Mr K did not accept  this 
offer.
As the case could not be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to reasonably 
conclude Mr J could repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
Ref: DRN94477632These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Mr K hasnt said he disagrees with our adjudicators  opinion about the initial  decision to lend 
loan 1 (the running credit  facility)  and Sunny accepts that it should have done  more before 
lending loans 13 - 24. So as there is no ongoing  disagreement about these loans, my 
decision will focus on the 14th drawdown on loan 1 to loan 12; the lending in dispute  by 
Sunny.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr K could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. The 
loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication Mr K could sustainably 
make his repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
The first lending decision that Sunny made  was to provide Mr K with a running credit facility  
with a credit  limit of £500. I can see from Mr Ks credit agreement that it explained that this 
type of credit  was unsuitable for borrowing over long periods, and the credit agreement 
indicated that the repayments needed to be repaid within  five months.  I can also see Sunny 
allowed Mr K to make multiple  drawdowns  on the running account facility  and the credit  limit 
was increased to £750. 
On 30 June 2014 Mr K drew down £750.  By 31 October 2014, Mr K had been using the 
facility for eight months and had taken his 10th drawdown. 
By December 2014, Mr K had been  using  the running credit facility  for ten months.  He had 
been drawing  on it regularly and the facility had been at, or near, the maximum limit for 
almost six months. So, Mr K was not making any in roads into what he owed Sunny. Mr K 
cleared the balance in mid-December   only to drawdown on it again  six days  later. So, 
when he made his 14th drawdown  on 21 December (just a day after he had repaid the 13th 
drawdown) I think Sunny  ought to been  concerned that Mr K was struggling to manage his 
money and was experiencing wider financial difficulties.
Ref: DRN94477633So, in these circumstances,  I think Sunny  ought  to have realised that Mr K wouldnt have 
been able to repay from this point or any further loans without undue difficulty or without the 
need to borrow  again.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr K, to see if there 
was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And I agree with our adjudicator  that Sunny shouldve 
realised this by the time it provided loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr K was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr K had taken out 6 loans within 14 months. So Sunny ought  to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mr K was having to borrow further  to cover the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and Mr Ks indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ks first loan was for £500  and by loan 6, along with loan 4 (which was also 
outstanding) Mr K total borrowing of £700. At this point Mr K ought  to have known 
that Mr K was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in his income but to 
meet an ongoing  need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr K was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one. 
Mr K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 25 was 
taken out almost two years after Mr Ks first. And (combined  with outstanding loan 
24) was for a larger amount. Mr K had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, 
service a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
I think that Mr K lost out when Sunny provided  loan 6 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ks indebtedness by allowing him
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time and;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ks
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost
loans
So, Im upholding  Mr Ks complaint about  loans 2 - 24 and from 12 December 2014  onwards 
on the running credit facility. Sunny  should  put things right as detailed below.
Putting things  right
A) add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr K towards interest,  fees and 
charges on these loans,  
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr K which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr K originally  made the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled.
C) pay Mr K the total of A plus B.
Ref: DRN94477634D) remove  any adverse information you have recorded on Mr Ks credit  file in relation to 
loans 2-5 and from 21 December 2014 on the running credit. The overall pattern of Mr Ks 
borrowing for loans  6 onwards means  any information recorded about  them  is adverse, so 
Sunny should  remove these  loans entirely  from Mr Ks credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mr K a certificate  showing  how much tax its deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold  Mr Ks complaint as Ive explained above. I require 
Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) to put things right for Mr K as set out 
above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 April 2020.
