K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains about a number of loans CashEuroNet UK LLC (CEN)  trading as 
QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket. Mr H says the loans were lent irresponsibly.
background
Mr H took 13 payday  loans and one instalment loan from CEN between September  2013 
and October 2017.  The loan amounts varied from £50 to £500  and from what Ive seen, Mr H 
has repaid all his loans.
Ive set out some information about  the loans as an appendix at the end of this decision.
Mr H complained to CEN about all the loans through a third party representative.  CEN  didnt 
uphold any part of his complaint and said it didnt lend irresponsibly.  Mr H then referred his 
complaint to this service  where it was looked  at by one of our adjudicators.
Our adjudicator thought that QuickQuid had lent loans 4 to 14 irresponsibly as the overall  
pattern of the borrowing  was unsustainable for Mr H. Our adjudicator  recommended that the 
complaint about  those  loans should  be upheld. However, our adjudicator didnt think  Mr Hs 
complaint about  loans  1 to 3a should be upheld.
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment of loans 4 to 14. And as the 
complaint hasnt been resolved, it has come  to me  an ombudsman for a decision.
Since the adjudication, there  have  been  no further  disputes about loans 1 to 3a and so my 
decision focusses on the loans that remain in dispute (loans 4 to 14).
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Hs case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Hs complaint  in part and have explained why below. Although I 
havent gone into details about loans 1 to 3a here, Ive looked  at the circumstances of those 
loans and I agree with our adjudicators assessment of them.
At the time of the loans in question  loans 4 to 14 - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
was the regulator of lenders such as CEN.  Under  the rules  of the FCA, CEN needed to take 
reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice this means that it 
should have carried  out proportionate  checks to make sure Mr H could repay  his loans in a 
sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Hs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN21294112But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
1.did CEN,  each  time it lent, complete  reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr H would be able to repay in a sustainable way?  If not, would those 
checks have shown that Mr H would have been  able to do so?
2.taking  into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  
pattern of lending increase Mr Hs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.did CEN  act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Hs complaint.
did CEN, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate  checks  to satisfy  itself 
that Mr H would be able to repay in a sustainable  way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr H would have been  able to do so?
CEN has told us what checks it carried out. It has said before agreeing to lend, it searched 
Mr Hs credit file, asked  him about  his income before each loan. And from loan 4 onwards, it 
asked for Mr Hs monthly expenses.
From what  I can see, Mr H is recorded  as being employed and in rental  accommodation. 
Mr Hs recorded income  varied  from £1,180 to £1,406 and his recorded expenses  varied 
from £450 to £750.  Mr Hs expenses included, housing, utilities,  transport, food, regular 
credit commitments  and other expenses.  CEN in its response to our adjudication has said 
Mr H told it that he was sharing the household bills and so he didnt carry the burden  on his 
own. I havent recreated individual, proportionate  affordability checks  for loans  4 to 14 
because I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next 
section.
CEN hasnt  provided  the results of its credit search but Mr H has provided a copy  of his 
credit report  and from what I can see, he had a default entered  on his file in July 2013  
before any of the loans were granted. This wasnt historic and is something  CEN shouldve 
taken into account  when it was making  its lending decisions. This entry was less than three  
months before loan 1.
Ref: DRN21294113taking into account  the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Hs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending to see if there was a point at which  CEN  should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
CEN should have  realised  that it shouldnt have  provided any further lending. Given  the 
particular circumstances  of Mr Hs case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 4. I say 
this because by the time Mr H was borrowing loan 4, he had been borrowing for five months  
without any breaks and the amounts  he was borrowing were generally increasing.  Mr H 
appeared to have formed a pattern of taking out small amounts to start with but very quickly 
topping-up the loans to increase the overall  borrowing. CEN ought to have realised it was 
likely his indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably. 
Mr H wasnt making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed lender. And was in effect 
paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended period, from loans 4 
to 13, Mr H borrowed an average of £135 and to access this money, he paid around  £710 in 
interest. CEN has said Mr H repaid some of the loans early and while I acknowledge that, 
the early repayment  of loans doesnt demonstrate that Mr H was repaying them sustainably. 
I can see that loan 14 was due to be repaid over 12 monthly instalments but Mr H repaid it 
within 3 days of taking  it. I think it suggests  that he was using this as a payday loan and 
made a large  repayment of around  £505 in one month. Bearing in mind  that his declared 
income was £1,406, this repayment  represented a substantial portion of his income.  This 
was likely to be unsustainable.
Also, Mr H was demonstrating  repayment  difficulties from loan 3. Mr H topped-up loan 3 and 
rolled it over twice before repaying  it. This was quite  early in the borrowing relationship  and I 
think this along  with the default recorded on Mr Hs file shouldve  concerned  CEN.
CEN argues that Mr H had a number of breaks in his borrowing and those  breaks suggest 
that he wasnt dependent on the loans. Ive carefully  considered  those gaps and Im not 
persuaded that any of the breaks were enough to say that Mr H wasnt dependent on those 
loans. I can see that the longest break  was around four months between  when  Mr H repaid 
loan 8 (including its top-ups) and when  he took out loan 9. But looking at his overall  lending,  
I think Mr H was dependent on these loans from loans 4 to 14.
I say this because  apart  from loans  1 and 2, Mr H topped-up all the other payday loans he 
took. In total CEN granted additional  borrowing to Mr H 16 times which meant  that the total 
number of advances  including the instalment loan was 30. I think  thats a large  number of 
advances over a three and half year period.
Also as stated above, Mr H rolled over loan 3 twice  after topping-up the loan, he incurred a 
late fee charge  on loan 5 and he went into a pre-default payment plan for loan 6 after rolling 
it over. I think it shouldve been  clear to CEN that Mr H was dependent on these loans and 
likely struggling to repay them.
As QuickQuid continued to lend to Mr H from loans 4 onwards, he lost out because:
these  loans had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive  credit over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN21294114the sheer  number of loans was likely  to have had negative  implications on Mr Hs 
ability to access  mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
Ive considered the points CEN  raised  in response to the adjudicator. Essentially, it has said 
it doesnt think that a pattern of lending  alone is enough to establish that the loans were 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful for Mr H. In making its points, it referred to the current  
regulators sourcebook  for consumer  credit,  known  as CONC.
CEN will know from previous decisions and our published approach  that this service  
considers that there are circumstances  where  the lending  pattern is sufficient to conclude 
that the loans  were  unsustainable. There are also provisions within CONC and other  
relevant guidance that detail the possibility of repeat lending being unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful. 
I think this is one of those circumstances and so Im upholding Mr Hs complaint about loans 
4 to 14 because  the overall pattern of lending increased his indebtedness in a way that was 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful and he lost out as a result.
did CEN act unfairly  or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude CEN  acted  unfairly  or unreasonably towards  Mr H in some  other  
way.  
putting things right  what CEN needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 4 to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were  paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number of loans taken from loan 4 onwards  means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 4 to 14 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit  file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires CEN  to take off tax from this interest. CEN must give 
Mr H a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Hs 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right as Ive set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 May 2019
