The complaint
Miss C complains NewDay Ltd sent her emails that incorrectly said she was over her credit 
limit. Shes also unhappy with the interest charged on her account, and the level of customer 
service theyve provided.
What happened
Miss C has a credit card account with NewDay. She became unhappy when she started 
receiving emails from NewDay saying her account had gone over her credit limit. Miss C 
said these emails shouldnt have been sent as she was within her credit limit at the time.
Miss C was also unhappy with delays to her payments being added to her credit card 
account, and the interest and fees that were being applied. Miss C raised these concerns 
with NewDay on several occasions and asked for a manager to call her back to discuss her 
concerns.
Unfortunately, NewDay didnt always call Miss C back as she expected, and their first final 
response failed to address all her concerns. But after Miss C complained again, NewDay 
issued another final response. 
NewDays final response explained that interest would have taken Miss Cs account balance 
over her credit limit, but no fees had been applied when that happened. They also explained 
it can take a full day for their app to update itself after a payment has been made and 
apologised for any confusion Miss C may have experienced when waiting to see her 
updated balance. NewDay also offered Miss C £25 in recognition of their failure to fully 
address her concerns in their first final response.
Miss C remained unhappy, so she asked us to investigate her complaint. Our Investigator 
considered what had happened and said this complaint should be partially upheld. Our 
Investigator was satisfied NewDay had provided Miss C with the correct information about 
the way her credit card account worked. She also said interest had been applied fairly to 
Miss Cs account. However, our investigator said NewDay didnt treat Miss C fairly when 
they failed to call her back on multiple occasions. Given the period of time Miss C was trying 
to resolve things with NewDay, our Investigator felt an award of £100 was more appropriate 
in the circumstances.
NewDay accepted our Investigators findings, but Miss C did not. Because of this, her 
complaint was passed to me to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed all the information sent to us, Im upholding Miss Cs complaint. I will be 
explaining the reasons for my decision below.
Miss C has raised several complaint points with us. Because of this Ill comment on these 
points separately.
The emails Miss C received about her credit limit
Miss C says NewDay sent her emails saying she was over her credit limit. Shes unhappy 
because she wasnt over her credit limit when she received the emails.
Having read the emails Miss C has complained about, I can understand why they caused 
her to be concerned. Thats because, at the time she received those emails, the balance of 
her credit card was within the agreed credit limit. However, the emails Miss C received 
werent saying she was over her credit limit at the time they were sent. The emails were 
letting Miss C know that her statements were due to be produced shortly; and it was likely 
the interest due to be applied to her account would increase her balance to an amount that 
was higher than her credit limit.
The purpose of these emails was to help Miss C decide if she wanted to make an extra 
payment before the interest is applied and prevent her being charged over credit limit fees 
and the options to do this.
The emails NewDay send would state the balance of Miss Cs credit card account at the time 
of the email, and the amount she had left to spend. And her statements detailed the 
estimated interest that would be added to the following months statement. When the current 
balance and estimated interest are added together, the total would exceed Miss Cs credit 
limit. Because of this, NewDay were correct when they said Miss C would most likely go over 
her credit limit if she didnt make a payment before receiving her statement.
I do agree with Miss C that she wasnt over her credit limit when she received the emails 
complained about. But NewDay wasnt telling her that was the status of her account. 
I appreciate Miss C feels strongly about this, but I dont agree NewDay was sending her 
misleading information about her account.
Im aware Miss C is still receiving these emails and would like them to stop. Ultimately, its 
for NewDay to decide what information they want to share with their customers. Our Service 
doesnt have the power to change NewDays commercial decision. Because of this, I cant 
ask NewDay to stop sending Miss C these emails if the status of her account causes their 
system to automatically send them. 
Given what Ive said above, Im not upholding this part of Miss Cs complaint.
Did NewDay apply interest to Miss Cs account correctly?
Miss C has said NewDay has charged her too much interest.
Its not unusual for interest to be added to an outstanding balance on a credit card account. 
Ive reviewed several of Miss Cs NewDay credit card statements, and I havent seen that 
she ever paid off her entire balance during the period of time shes complained about. And 
having reviewed the terms and conditions of Miss Cs credit card account, Ive seen that 
NewDay would add interest to any outstanding balance. 
Ive also listened to calls between Miss C and NewDay. It seems confusion may have arisen 
when Miss C made payments on the same day her statements were produced. However, Im 
satisfied NewDays advisers correctly explained that making payments on the day a 
statement was due to be produced wouldnt change the monthly payment she was expected 
to pay after the statement had been generated. It's clear Miss C is very unhappy with the way NewDay applied interest and charges to her 
credit card account. But the information Ive seen persuades me that NewDay handled her 
account in line with the relevant terms and conditions. 
Given the above, Im satisfied NewDay correctly calculated the interest applied to Miss Cs 
account. Thats why I wont be asking them to do anything further to resolve this complaint 
point.
The level of customer service provided by NewDay
The information Ive been provided persuades me Miss C first complained in February 2021. 
This was after she experienced a delay in the mobile app updating her balance to reflect a 
payment shed made. Im aware Miss C believe she raised complaints before this date, but 
Ive not seen evidence to persuade me that happened. So, I cant fairly say NewDay should 
have started investigating her concerns before February 2021.
Ive listened to a recording of the February 2021 phone call between Miss C and NewDay. In 
this call NewDay told Miss C it can take a full day for the mobile app to update. Im satisfied 
they explained this point clearly to help Miss C understand why her recent payment hadnt 
shown up immediately. It was clear Miss C disagreed with this point, but I have no reason to 
disbelieve NewDay when they say thats how their mobile app works. Its not uncommon for 
online or mobile banking to take a few hours  or a day to update. But I also dont consider 
that delay to be unreasonable. Ive not seen anything to show Miss C experienced serious 
problems because of this delay, so I dont agree NewDay treated her unfairly.
Having listened to recordings of several calls Miss C made to NewDay, Im satisfied she was 
given the correct information about how her credit card account works. However, I think 
NewDays customer service was poor when they didnt call Miss C back on three occasions.
NewDay has said they cant always guarantee a call from a manager, and I dont consider 
thats unreasonable. But they should have explained this to Miss C when she asked for call 
backs. I dont think NewDay made it clear to Miss C that call backs couldnt be promised. 
That meant she was left more frustrated and confused. It wasnt fair for NewDay to make 
Miss C feel like that. Thats why I consider NewDay needs to do something to resolve 
Miss Cs complaint.
Putting things right
NewDay didnt provide Miss C with the level of customer service I would expect. This means 
they need to do something to put things right for her.
Miss C made it clear she was unhappy and confused with the information NewDay were 
sending her. She also made it clear when she wanted to speak to a manager. I dont think 
its unreasonable that NewDay couldnt guarantee a call back each time Miss C asked for 
that to happen. But I do think NewDay should have done more to explain this to Miss C. 
NewDays failure to explain things left Miss C more frustrated. It also meant she needed to 
make more calls to NewDay to try and resolve things.
Raising a complaint comes with some inconvenience that cant be avoided. But NewDay 
made mistakes that made the situation more difficult and time consuming for Miss C. I think 
an award of £100 fairly recognises the additional time Miss C spent trying to speak with 
managers at NewDay. So, Im asking NewDay to pay this amount to resolve this complaint.My final decision
My final decision is that Im upholding Miss Cs complaint about NewDay Ltd.
To put things right NewDay Ltd should pay Miss C £100. This award is to recognise the poor 
customer service she has received from NewDay Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 December 2022.
