K820x#14complaint
Miss P complains  that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) incorrectly  set up an 
account for her when  she worked for them. She says this led to wrongly applied fees and 
charges on her account, which  affected her credit  rating. Miss P also complains NatWest 
then unfairly applied a default  to an overdraft on her bank account. 
background
Miss P says that when she worked for NatWest she was made  to open a number of 
accounts to help meet branch targets. She says they werent set up as staff accounts, so 
she accrued interest  and charges on them. Miss P says NatWest havent done  anything to 
rectify the matter.
Miss P complained to NatWest in August  2017 about the charges and interest accrued on 
her overdraft for her current account.  Around  this time, NatWest  say they notified Miss P of 
their intention to default the account.  Miss P says NatWest told her the action on her account  
would be paused while she complained. NatWest then defaulted the account in           
October 2017. Miss P says if shed  known they were  planning to do this she wouldve acted 
sooner to avoid  her credit file being  affected. 
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. She said NatWest applied  the default  fairly, as 
they had tried a number  of times  to recover the money owed on the overdraft. She said that 
as the last payment to the account was in March 2017, it was reasonable for them  to sell the 
debt on and apply  a default.
Miss P disagreed. She felt NatWest hadnt  taken  her wider  situation into account when they 
decided to default the account. So she asked for an ombudsman to review  the complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so I wont  be upholding this 
complaint. Ill explain  why.
NatWest have shown  Miss P opened the account as a student account in June  2006  with a 
Â£1,250 overdraft. Theyve provided statements to show Miss P made two large withdrawals 
a few days after the account opened,  which took it near the overdraft limit. 
Miss P says the account shouldve  been opened as a student account with staff markers so 
she didnt have to pay any interest  or charges. NatWest have provided statements to show  
that interest  and charges were  applied to the account  from the time it opened. 
The contact  notes provided go back to April 2009,  so I cant  see what was discussed at the 
time the account  was opened.  But I can see that NatWest applied a refund to the account in 
August 2007 for the charges and fees accrued to date. So in my opinion its likely  that 
something did go wrong when the account was opened and NatWest refunded Miss P for its 
error.
Miss P says NatWest didnt correct her credit  file at the time, and as a result this left a 
marker on her credit file. Whilst  I appreciate  what Miss Ps said here, if the impact had been 
significant, I mightve expected her to have  raised this with NatWest at the time. Any adverse 
information that was recorded  on her credit file ten or more years  ago will no longer be there,  
Ref: DRN96076252so I cant tell NatWest to put it right now. And I dont consider I can fairly require NatWest to 
remove the default now because of what they may have recorded on Miss Ps credit file so 
long ago.
Ive considered the later charges that were  added to the account, which  increased  the debt. 
The bank statements show the account started  to accrue interest  and charges again  from 
August 2010.  I can see from the contact notes that Miss P queried this with NatWest at the 
time. The notes show  NatWest discussed options to get the account back on track, and 
made Miss P aware of how she should be managing the account. So I think  at this point 
Miss P was aware the account would continue to accrue interest, and what  would  happen if 
she didnt maintain the repayments.
Ive then considered  if it was fair for NatWest to default the account  when  it did. Ive 
reviewed the contact notes to see what steps  were taken by Miss P to pay off the debt. Ive 
also looked to see if NatWest have treated her positively and sympathetically. From looking 
at both the bank  statements and contact  notes together, it appears that NatWest agreed  a 
repayment plan in 2011 and 2012, but overall  the payments were  sporadic with the last one 
made in March 2017.
In July 2017, the account entered collections as the overdraft limit had been exceeded. 
NatWest wrote to Miss P to let her know and gave a deadline to take remedial action,  but 
didnt get a response. NatWest then wrote to Miss P on 2 August 2017  to serve notice of 
their intention to terminate the overdraft arrangement and default the account. Ive seen 
copies of these  letters, which  match  Miss Ps current address, so Im satisfied  NatWest  gave 
Miss P sufficient notice  of their intentions.
Miss P says that when she contacted NatWest to discuss the letter and complain  she was 
told the default action would be placed on hold. NatWest have confirmed that this is their 
usual practice, but this didnt happen  and the account was passed to their recoveries  
department and a default applied. NatWest have confirmed they havent  asked for the 
default to be removed, as they believe its unlikely the debt would be repaid and this would 
prolong the default being applied.
Ive thought carefully about this point.  I do appreciate Miss P was told by NatWest that the 
default action  would  be placed on hold.  But on balance, I think  it was fair for NatWest to 
apply the default. I say this because the overdraft has been outstanding  for a number of 
years and the last payment to the account was in March 2017. I havent seen any evidence 
of further repayments  since Miss P complained to NatWest  so she hasnt shown that she 
was prepared to reduce  the debt. So on balance I think their decision to default the account 
when they did was fair.
So I wont  be requiring  NatWest to remove the default from Miss Ps account.
Ref: DRN96076253my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules  of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept  or reject my decision before 
12 March 2019.
