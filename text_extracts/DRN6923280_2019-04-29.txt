K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains about the service he received in relation to a van supplied  with finance from 
Toyota Financial Services (UK) Plc. Hes also unhappy  about charges following termination 
of the agreement.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint a copy of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I proposed to uphold Mr Bs complaint in part and 
to require TFS to reduce the storage  charges to £1600 plus VAT. I invited Mr B and TFS to 
let me have  any further evidence or arguments  they wanted to make before I finally 
determined the matter.
TFS said it accepted my provisional decision.  Despite reminders, Mr B didnt reply to my 
provisional decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr B hasnt replied to my provisional decision. TFS has indicated that it accepts it. I see no 
reason to reach any different  conclusions from the ones I set out in my provisional decision.
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is to uphold  the complaint in part. To resolve matters, Toyota Financial 
Services (UK) Plc should reduce the storage charges to £1600  plus VAT.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 May 2019.
