background
Miss H is complaining about  eight instalment loans Oakam lent to her between  March 2012 
and December 2014. Some information about Miss Hs borrowing history is as follows:

The loans were  due to be repaid in twelve monthly instalments and loans 4, 5, 7 and 8 were  
refinanced from previous  loans.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Hs complaint  and thought  the loans from 
September 2012 onwards  shouldnt  have been  given. Oakam  disagreed  and the complaint 
was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Oakam needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Miss H could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Oakam should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN54653772the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
In some cases, the lending history and pattern of lending  itself clearly demonstrates that the 
lending was unsustainable.
Oakam was required to establish whether Miss H could sustainably  repay her loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Hs complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think that Oakam was wrong  to lend Miss H loans 1 to 3 and so didnt 
recommend that those  loans should be upheld. I havent seen that Miss H disagrees  with the 
adjudicators findings  and having considered the circumstances  of those loans,  I agree with 
the adjudicator.  So Ive focused my decision on loans 4 to 8 as theres an ongoing dispute  
about those loans.
Loan 4 was a refinanced loan from loan 3, Miss H had borrowed loan 3 but hadnt fully 
repaid it before requested  more funds. So for loan 4 Miss H needed to repay around £510 
with a maximum repayment of around  £78 per month.  This loan was Miss Hs fourth  loan in 
six months.
Oakam has said before  it lent Miss H this loan,  it checked her income and monthly 
expenses. It also said it searched her credit file. Miss Hs monthly  income throughout the 
lending was declared as £969  and her monthly  expenses at the time of loan 4 were around 
£742.
Oakam asked Miss H if she had any County Court Judgements (CCJs) and I can see that 
she said yes for CCJs  when  she applied  for loan 4 and she also declared that she was in 
arrears. Oakams credit search  revealed Miss H was in arrears  for a significant  amount of 
more than £13,000 and that she had a CCJ. So Given  that Miss H had a CCJ recently 
recorded on her file which she declared and the level of arrears  Oakams credit search 
revealed, I think it ought to have  been  aware that Miss H would struggle to repay loan 4 and 
any subsequent  loans in a sustainable manner.
This is borne out by Miss H again  needing  to refinance loan 4 and taking out further  
borrowing for loan 5. So I uphold Miss Hs complaint for loans  4 and 5. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Oakams  lending history with Miss H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Oakam should  reasonably have seen that further lending  
Ref: DRN54653773was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Oakam should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Hs case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
at this point Oakam  ought to have  realised Miss H wasnt  managing  to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss H had been  indebted to Oakam for more  than 15 months. So 
Oakam ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Miss H was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
at this point Oakam  ought to have  known that Miss H was unlikely borrowing to meet  
a temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. Miss H indicated  
that she was borrowing  loan 6 for her rent, bills and food and I think Oakam ought to 
have realised that she had become reliant  on the loans.
from loan 6 onwards  Miss H was provided with a new loan on the same  day as 
settling a previous  one. And there were no gaps in the lending  from loan 6 onwards.
so Miss H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Oakam. Loan  8 
was taken out 21 months after Miss Hs first. And it was for a larger amount.  Miss H 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Oakam over an 
extended period.
Oakam continued to provide credit  to Miss H from loan 6 onwards and she lost out because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Hs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the length of time over which Miss H borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6to 8 and Oakam  should put things right.
Ref: DRN54653774putting things right  what Oakam needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss H paid on loans 4 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative payment information about loans 4 and 5 from Miss Hs credit  
file;
the information recorded  about  the loans  from loan 6 onwards  is adverse. So all 
entries about loans  6 to 8 should be removed from Miss Hs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Oakam to take off tax from this interest.  Oakam  must 
give Miss H a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Hs complaint. Oakam  Ltd should 
pay Miss H compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 November 2019.
