The complaint
Mr B complains that Pay Pal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) didnt help him when he 
accidentally sent money to the wrong person.
What happened
In September 2020 Mr B went to use his PayPal account to make a payment of $450 to a 
third party. Unfortunately, he entered the details incorrectly and accidentally sent the 
payment to someone he didnt know. 
Mr B realised what had happened the same day and contacted PayPal to try to resolve 
things. He tried to call but due to the Covid-19 pandemic he was unable to speak to anyone. 
So, he filed a claim and selected the category unauthorised payment as this was the best 
he could find. In the submission he explained that he had sent the payment to the wrong 
person. 
PayPal declined his claim as it was clear Mr B had authorised the payment. PayPal also told 
him the payment was ineligible for its PayPal Buyer Protection because it was processed as 
a personal payment and not intended for the purchase of goods or services.
PayPal suggested Mr B contact his card issuer and ask them to do a charge back. 
However, Mr B said his card issuer told him only PayPal had the authority to refund the 
payment.
So, Mr B complained to PayPal. But it didnt uphold this complaint. Mr B remained unhappy 
and brought his complaint to our Service.
Our Investigator looked into things and upheld the complaint. They said PayPal was bound 
by the Payment Service Regulations (2017) and was required to make reasonable efforts to 
recover funds where the incorrect account details had been used. And they didnt think this 
had been done. They asked PayPal to refund Mr B the $450.
PayPal disagreed. It said it had made reasonable efforts to recover the funds and provided 
further evidence in support of this. This showed it had temporarily held the funds in the 
recipients PayPal account and sent a notification informing the recipient about the issue. 
But it said it was prevented from taking further action due to the type of payment made.  
Our Investigator looked at this further evidence but didnt change their overall opinion. 
They said the notification PayPal had sent referred to the dispatch of merchandise and 
would have caused confusion, not action, on the part of the recipient. They also said PayPal 
hadnt engaged with the recipient to see if theyd return the money. They noted that when 
PayPal couldnt recover the funds it ought to have provided Mr B with the recipients details 
so that he could enter into negotiations or go through the courts. They also decided to award 
8% simple interest on the $450 for the time he didnt have access to the funds. 
PayPal still disagreed. It said the recipient was given Mr Bs details but due to data 
protection issues it cannot contact the recipient and provide other information or contact 
details from the sender. 
So, the complaint has been passed to me to consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr B clearly made an error when putting the payment through. And this wasnt PayPals 
fault. But what Mr B is unhappy about is the lack of assistance he got from PayPal when he 
contacted it to try to fix things.
So, Ive thought about what PayPal could have done and what it had a responsibility to do.
I agree with PayPal that this transaction wasnt covered by PayPals Buyer Protection 
scheme.
But the Payment Services Regulations (PSR) 2017 apply and the relevant section here is 
section 90. These regulations refer to customers as payment service users and businesses 
as payment service providers. The section relevant in this case says:
(2) Where the unique identifier provided by the payment service user is incorrect, the 
payment service provider is not liable under regulation 91 or 92 for non-execution or 
defective execution of the payment transaction, but the payment service provider 
(a)must make reasonable efforts to recover the funds involved in the payment transaction;
What this means is that PayPal isnt liable for the loss Mr B incurred due to his mistake, but it 
did have a responsibility to make reasonable efforts to recover the funds. 
PayPal has said it did make reasonable efforts. And when it was notified of the error, I can 
see it temporarily held the money whilst it looked into things. This is the sort of action Id 
expect it to take. But Im not persuaded that it then took any action to actually recover the 
funds. 
PayPal notified the recipient of a possible problem and told them not to dispatch goods 
(which of course didnt apply here). But it didnt ask the recipient if theyd be willing to return 
the money. When it realised Mr B had authorised the payment, it simply removed the block. 
And whilst I appreciate Mr B chose the incorrect category for the claim he raised with 
PayPal, he explained the problem in his submission. So, I dont think the mis-categorisation 
should have had any bearing on how PayPal handled his request for help. 
PayPal has said it wasnt able to contact the recipient, but it has provided no evidence that it 
tried to or further explanation to support this. It was clearly able to temporarily hold the 
transaction and contact the recipient about this. So, Im not persuaded it was unable to ask if 
the recipient would be willing to return the money. It might not have been able to take any 
further action had the recipient refused, but the question was never asked. 
For all of these reasons, I dont think PayPal acted fairly here. 
Where a mistake has been made, my role is to try put Mr B back into the position he would 
have been had errors not occurred. This issue came about because of Mr Bs error  
something PayPal isnt responsible for. But I think PayPal could have taken further steps to help Mr B and had it done so the money might have been recovered  so it too has 
responsibility for the loss Mr B incurred. We will never know for definite what would have 
happened had PayPal contacted the recipient of the money. So, I need to decide what I think 
is most likely to have happened, on the balance of probabilities. Having thought carefully 
about this, I think more people than not, if contacted shortly after receiving money that 
wasnt theirs and that they werent expecting, and being advised it was an incorrect payment 
from another customer, would return the money if asked to do so by PayPal. So, I think its 
more likely than not Mr B would have got his money back. Which means I think PayPal 
should refund this amount in full. Mr B has also lost the use of these fund so I think PayPal 
should pay 8% simple interest from the day after the transaction was made (to allow time for 
this to have been resent) until the date it makes this payment. 
I do appreciate Mr B would have also been upset and inconvenienced by all of this but given 
this was partially due to his initial error, I dont intend to make any further award for this.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I direct Pay Pal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to 
pay Mr B $450 and 8% simple interest on this amount from the date after Mr B made the 
transaction until the date it makes this payment. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2022.
