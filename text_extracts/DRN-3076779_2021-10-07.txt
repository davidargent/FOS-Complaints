The complaint
Miss P complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA will not refund a disputed transaction.
What happened
Miss P complained to PayPal about a transaction which debited her account on 5th April 
2020 for just under £260.  She said she hadnt authorised this payment to company D for an 
item of furniture and wanted PayPal to reimburse this money to her.
Prior to complaining to PayPal, Miss P had made a claim by way of the chargeback 
procedure with her own bank as money from her account had been debited to pay her 
PayPal account.  The chargeback was defended which meant Miss P had not been 
successful in securing a refund.  Miss P said her bank had relied on incorrect information 
provided by PayPal in coming to a decision not to pursue the chargeback any further.
When PayPal did not uphold her complaint, Miss P came to this service.
In its initial submissions to this service, PayPal relied on the unsuccessful chargeback with 
Miss Ps bank as evidence it relied upon in rejecting this complaint.  No mention was made 
as to whether it had conducted its own investigation into the transaction and whether or not it 
had been authorised by Miss P.
In subsequent submissions, it said it was rejecting Miss Ps complaint for the following 
reasons:
- the payment was made following a successful login to Miss Ps account which was 
password protected;
- the registered address and the billing address were a match;
- there was a match on the genuine phone number used by Miss P and the number 
used to activate the payment;
- it reiterated the failed chargeback from Miss Ps bank.
So, our investigator looked into Miss Ps complaint for her and decided PayPal ought to 
refund the transaction as the evidence suggested she had not authorised it.  Miss P agreed 
but PayPal did not.  It asked that an ombudsman make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant
law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and,
where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time. 
In short, PayPal is required to refund the amount of an unauthorised transaction. The 
relevant regulations, to this effect, are the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (the PSRs 
2017).  Authorisation in this context consists of two elements  authentication and consent -
and I remind myself that it is for PayPal to show Miss P authorised this payment and not for 
Miss P to show that she didnt.  
Dealing with authentication first. In this case, its the use of Miss Ps PayPal account and 
linked debit card.  Im satisfied from the evidence Ive seen that the payment was 
authenticated.  
However, I dont think PayPal has been able to show, on balance, that Miss P consented to 
the payment.
Ive considered how much weight to place on the failed chargeback request and I have 
concluded that it would be very little.  That matter is not with this service and without a full 
investigation, I dont think it would be fair to conclude that that decision was either right or 
wrong.
So, Ill turn to PayPals further submissions.
The payment was allowed after Miss Ps account was accessed using her password.  I think 
its possible for a third party to obtain these details and access Miss Ps account.  On 
balance, I dont think this shows she consented to the payment  and as PayPal have not 
suggested this is a case of gross negligence, Ill make no further comment. 
The argument regarding the registered address and billing address being a match carries 
little weight as neither show the item was delivered to Miss Ps address.  In fact, PayPal 
have not been able to provide this service with any confirmation of a delivery address.
Im unsure as to what PayPal means when it submits that there was a match on the phone 
numbers so its difficult for me to say what weight I place on this.
On the other hand, Miss P says she did not make nor authorise this payment  so my 
starting point is that I have no reason to doubt what she says and find her to be a credible 
witness.
And then I remind myself that there is no delivery address, no confirmation that the IP 
address matched Miss Ps previous transaction history and no confirmation that the same 
device had been used as previous undisputed transactions.
In fact, there had only ever been one previous transaction made on Miss Ps PayPal account 
and that was some months earlier.
When I consider these aspects, I think the only fair and reasonable conclusion here is that 
PayPal has failed to show Miss P authorised this payment and so it follows that they must 
refund it to her.
Ive also considered whether I think there should be some payment for the distress and 
inconvenience caused to Miss P in having this unauthorised payment leave her account and 
pursuing PayPal.  I think PayPal ought to make a payment of £100.
  
Putting things right
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must refund the amount of the disputed transaction, to the 
sum of £258.95, to Miss P.It must also pay statutory interest at the rate of 8% from the date of the transaction to the 
date of settlement.
Finally, it should pay £100 for the distress and inconvenience caused to Miss P in having to 
pursue this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 November 2021.
