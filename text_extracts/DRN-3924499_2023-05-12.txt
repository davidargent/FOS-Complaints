The complaint
Mr G as a director of C, a limited company, complains that ClearBank Limited (ClearBank) 
wont refund money C lost after falling victim to a scam.
What happened
Mr G says Cs account was set up with the purpose of purchasing buy-to-let properties. In 
October 2021, C was purchasing a new property. They had instructed a firm of solicitors and 
had been dealing with a staff member from that firm, who Ill refer to as S, via email. 
In October 2021, Mr G received an email from S asking them to make a payment of £39,500 
towards the property purchase. The email had been intercepted and came from a fraudster, 
not the genuine firm. The email continued on in an email chain from previous genuine emails 
however the email address was slightly different, and the fraudster changed the contact 
phone number in the footer. Mr G was given the bank details for accounts controlled by the 
fraudster rather than the genuine solicitors bank details.
Mr G attempted to make the payment on 20 October 2021, but the payment bounced and 
was immediately credited back to Cs account. Mr G attempted to make the payment four 
times on the 20 October 2021 and once on 21 October 2021  with all of the payments 
bouncing back into Cs account. He then attempted to make a smaller payment of £10,000 
(on 21 October), which also bounced, before using new account details provided by the 
fraudster and successfully making the full payment of £39,500.
During the failed payment attempts Mr G got in touch with ClearBank through their in-app 
chat to find out why the payment wasnt going through. ClearBank told Mr G that the first 
payment attempt hadnt gone through as hed recently received funds into Cs account and 
there had been a communication error between their systems. They suggested Mr G wait for 
20 minutes then attempt the payment again. When the payment failed a second time, 
ClearBank suggested Mr G check the recipient account details were correct and also clear 
the apps cache.
  
ClearBank escalated Mr Gs payment issue to an internal team when it continued to bounce 
back to Cs account. Following that review, ClearBank told Mr G that the issue might be 
caused due to the recipient having a limit on their bank account. They suggested Mr G 
contact the recipient and get them to check on their end. Mr G responded to ClearBank that 
he had contacted the recipient and the problem didnt lie with them. The chat ended after   
Mr G was able to make the payment successfully, by making the payment to different bank 
account details provided by the fraudster. 
In January 2022, the genuine solicitors firm got in touch with Mr G and asked him to make 
the payment. At this point Mr G became aware hed been the victim of a scam and reported 
it to ClearBank.
ClearBank investigated Cs fraud claim and issued a final response letter saying they upheld 
Cs complaint. As a result of the letter, Mr G expected a full refund which he chased with 
ClearBank. In response, ClearBank clarified that as no funds could be recovered from the 
beneficiary account, C wasnt entitled to a refund. They told Mr G that C would only have 
been entitled to a refund of any recovered funds.
Mr G wasnt happy with ClearBanks response, so he brought a complaint to this service on 
Cs behalf.
An investigator looked into Cs complaint and didnt recommend ClearBank refund Cs loss 
saying:
The payment didnt trigger because of potential fraud concerns, it was due to issues 
with the recipients bank account.
While Mr G attempted to make the payment multiple times, they wouldnt have 
expected ClearBank to identify a fraud risk based on the previous account usage.
There wasnt anything said during the in-app chat with Mr G that shouldve 
concerned ClearBank that he mightve been the victim of a scam.
We cant make an award for any distress Mr G suffered as the complaint is being 
brought on behalf of C, and a business cant experience distress.
The investigator felt ClearBank had caused confusion in the way they worded their final 
response letter by telling C they were upholding the complaint, which resulted in Mr G 
chasing ClearBank for a refund. Because of that, the investigator recommended that 
ClearBank pay C £150 for the inconvenience caused.
Mr G disagreed with the investigators opinion, highlighting wording in the final response 
letter where ClearBank said they shouldve asked additional questions about the nature of 
the payment and that they hadnt done their due diligence. Mr G feels that as ClearBank 
have admitted fault, they should be held accountable. He also felt the number of times the 
payment bounced shouldve looked suspicious to ClearBank and triggered their fraud 
system.
As the case couldnt be resolved it was passed to me to review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The starting position is that ClearBank are expected to process payments and withdrawals 
that its customers authorise, in accordance with the Payment Service Regulations and the 
terms and conditions of the customers account. So, when ClearBank made the payment, it 
was complying with Mr Gs instructions made on behalf of C.
ClearBank arent a signatory to the Contingent Reimbursement Model Code, so I cant apply 
it to the payment C made. However, ClearBank have a duty of care to their customers to be 
on the lookout for, and to protect its customers from, potentially falling victim to fraud or 
scams. 
Having carefully considered all the evidence, Im not satisfied that I can fairly hold ClearBank 
liable for Cs loss and Ill explain why.
While Cs payment to the fraudster was attempted several times, the reason the payment 
didnt go through was due to issues with the recipient bank  rather than due to ClearBanks 
system identifying it as potential fraud. Having reviewed Cs previous account use, I can see 
they regularly made large one-off payments in the months prior to the payment to the fraudster, which is in line with what Mr G has told us about the account being used to 
purchase buy-to-let properties. Also, while the payment was initially made to a new payee, 
the subsequent attempted payments went to the same payee. As opposed to payments 
made to multiple different payees, which mayve been more suspicious. I realise that Mr G 
ended up setting up two new payees on two consecutive days, but Im not satisfied that by 
itself shouldve been concerning for Clearbank. Having considered all the features of the 
payment that C was attempting to make against the previous use of the account and the 
reason that the payment was unsuccessful, Im not satisfied that I can fairly say ClearBank 
shouldve identified a potential indicator of fraud and intervened on that basis.
Ive also read the in-app chat that Mr G had with ClearBank and Im not satisfied that there is 
anything in that chat that shouldve concerned ClearBank or prompted them to ask more 
questions before processing the payment. Mr G didnt voice any concerns that mayve 
indicated he was at risk of financial harm, and from what Ive seen the information ClearBank 
had suggested that the issue lay with the recipients account. There wasnt anything that 
suggested that the recipients account was fraudulent, rather it appeared that ClearBank 
thought the account mayve been limited. They suggested that Mr G check the account 
details he was using were correct, and also asked him to check with the recipient to see if 
their account mayve been limited. I think the guidance ClearBank provided to Mr G was 
appropriate based on the information they had at the time.
Also, Im conscious that ClearBank is considered a payment institute so the obligations on 
them are slightly different than those on a traditional bank  which Ive taken into 
consideration along with industry standards at the time Mr G made the payment. And, having 
carefully considered all of the evidence, including the points raised by Mr G in response to 
the investigators opinion  Im not satisfied that I can fairly asked ClearBank to refund C.
An award for the poor service C received
I agree that ClearBank caused confusion by telling C it was upholding their complaint, when 
in fact they only intended to refund C any money that could be recovered from the 
beneficiary bank. On that basis, I think the £150 recommended by the investigator is fair for 
the poor service C received. As the investigator explained, I cant make an award against 
ClearBank for distress experienced by Mr G, as he is only bringing the complaint on behalf 
of C and a business cant experience distress. 
I realise that Mr G is going to be very disappointed and that this represents a lot of money to 
C, but I cant fairly ask ClearBank to fund C for their loss and will only be asking ClearBank 
to pay £150 for the poor customer service C experienced.
Putting things right
To put things right ClearBank Limited should pay C £150 for the poor service they provided.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold this complaint against ClearBank Limited and 
require them to compensate C as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask C to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 June 2023.
