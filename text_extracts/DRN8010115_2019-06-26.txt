K822xcomplaint
Miss M complains that NewDay Ltd hasnt sent her a replacement card since she reported 
her card missing. Shes also unhappy about  the interest rate on her account.
background 
Miss M holds a credit card account with NewDay. In March 2017  the interest rate on Miss 
Ms account  increased.  Miss M was given  the choice to close the account  or keep the card 
and pay the higher interest rate. She decided to keep the card.
In November 2017 the card was reported lost. NewDay issued a replacement  card in 
November 2017  but it wasnt received. Further replacement cards  were issued in December 
2017, April 2018,  May 2018, February 2019 and April 2019 but none have been  received. 
In April 2018 Miss M complained about  the delay in receiving her card. NewDay said there 
was a card production issue between March and November 2018 and awarded Miss M 
compensation of £150.
Miss M isnt happy shes been charged  a higher interest rate when she hasnt had access to 
the card. She wants NewDay to revert the interest rate to the lower rate and refund any 
additional interest shes paid.
Miss M is also unhappy that she was offered a balance transfer which she couldnt take 
advantage of.
Our investigator said the delay in providing Miss M with a replacement card was excessive 
and recommended that NewDay pay further compensation. The investigator didnt think  it 
was fair to ask NewDay to revert the interest rate because Miss M had already  accepted  
these changes.
Miss M didnt agree. She felt the compensation wasnt sufficient because she still hadnt 
received her card. She also felt she should  be refunded  interest for the time shed been 
without the use of the card.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay has acknowledged  that there  were  some card production  issues  which  meant that 
none of the cards issued to Miss M between March and November 2018 reached  her. I think  
the delay in providing Miss M with a card during this time was of such a degree that further 
compensation is warranted. In this respect  I agree with the investigator that further 
compensation of £200 should be paid to Miss M.
I appreciate that Miss M was without  a card beyond November 2018. NewDay  has said it 
issued a card to Miss M in February  2019 but Miss M says she didnt receive this. A further 
card was issued in April 2019 but this was returned to NewDay  because the courier was 
unable to deliver it and Miss M didnt collect it from the courier.
Ref: DRN80101152On balance, Im satisfied that NewDay has made  reasonable efforts  to provide Miss M with a 
card since  February 2019.
Miss M has said she was previously offered a balance transfer and that she wanted to take 
this up but was declined. NewDay has said that Miss M isnt eligible for a balance  transfer.  I 
havent been provided with any evidence to show that miss M was offered a balance  transfer  
but even if she was, its up to NewDay to decide  whether or not to accept the application.  Im 
unable to require  NewDay to accept Miss Ms application for a balance  transfer.
I appreciate that Miss M wants the interest rate on her account  reduced. She also wants a 
refund of extra interest shes paid since February  2017. Although  I understand that its been 
frustrating for Miss M to be without a card, I dont  think  its fair to ask NewDay to reduce the 
interest rate or refund interest. This is because Miss M agreed  to the higher interest rate in 
February 2017 and interest has been  charged  in accordance with the terms and conditions 
of her account. Miss M says she agreed  to the higher interest rate so she could continue 
using the card. I appreciate that Miss M hasnt had the ability  to use the card but the interest  
rate applied to the outstanding balance on the card as well, which  existed as at February 
2017. Miss M was obliged  to repay  that balance in any event. In the circumstances I wont  
be asking NewDay to refund any interest.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold  the complaint. NewDay Ltd should  pay further 
compensation of £200 to Miss M.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 July 2019.
