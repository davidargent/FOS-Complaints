K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains Barclays Bank UK PLC overcharged him interest on a loan but it hasnt paid 
him back all his losses.
background
Mr H says he had a loan with Barclays from 16 June 2010 to 12 May 2017.  It refunded him 
£2,039.32 for interest itd charged  him. But he says it should refund  him another £2,260.17 in 
fees and charges because the incorrect interest made his account overdrawn.
Barclays says the loan account ran from 21 January 2013 and it was originally for 60 
months. It was paid off on 17 April 2017.  But it realised it hadnt sent the right information to 
him as was required by the Consumer Credit Act. So it said it had to refund him the interest  
from the time of the initial issue until the date the loan was fully repaid.
The adjudicator didnt think Barclay had to refund Mr H his fees and charges for a number of 
reasons which  he has set out in his very detailed opinion.  
Mr H wasnt happy with the adjudicators opinion. He said that not having the £2,000 in his 
account led to him paying £3 a day in overdraft charges.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see from Mr Hs loan agreement that it began on 21 January 2013 and it was for 60 
months. 
Barclays (and all other  financial organisations) is obliged to give a borrower  such  as Mr H, 
certain, specified information about  their loan.  If it doesnt do that Barclays cant enforce the 
agreement and the borrower is not liable to pay any interest.  
Barclays has told us the breach occurred on 22 February 2015 and the loan was repaid on 
17 April 2017. As a result of that breach Barclays wasnt entitled to charge interest.  So it 
refunded Mr H all the interest hed paid between those dates.
It said the breach  happened in this way: an arrears sum notice (ASN1) was issued on 22 
August 2014.  The account was then brought up to date on 9 January  2015 by re-aging the 
loan by three months. In other words, Mr H had missed 3 monthly payments but these were 
added to the end of the loan so the term was extended by 3 months.
It said it didnt issue a notice of variation to formalise the arrangement to extend the loan and 
so it shouldve issued  another arrears notice six months after the first on 22 February 2015. 
It didnt do that so from that date on it wasnt entitled  to charge interest.
Barclays mistake  was not that it charged Mr H the wrong interest during the course  of his 
loan. The mistake  Barclays  made was a technical one involving the information it shouldve 
sent him about  changes to his loan agreement.  It had extended Mr Hs loan by three months. 
But it didnt send him the relevant documentation.  So it had to refund  him the interest it 
charged during  the period  the breach continued.  It did that in December 2018. 
Ref: DRN47667072I know Mr H will not agree with me but Im satisfied  the overdraft fees he paid on his current  
account during  that time werent as a result of Barclays failure to send him the correct 
information about his loan. So I cant fairly ask it to refund those fees.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 July 2019.
