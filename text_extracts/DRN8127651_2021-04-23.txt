Mrs T complains that HSBC UK Bank  Plc wont refund money she lost when she fell victim to 
an investment scam.
background
In December 2016, Mrs T had an existing  portfolio  of shares,  which shed held for a 
considerable time. She also held accounts  with HSBC, both current and savings  accounts.  
She was cold called by someone purporting to be a financial adviser who explained they 
could get her better financial  returns.  As she provided care to her husband, funds were going  
to be needed.  There doesnt appear  to be any dispute that Mrs T has been the victim of a 
scam and so I proceed accordingly. 
Below is a table containing details  of the payments.

Additional information about events during the course of the scam are as follows:
Mrs T sold £50,000 of shares she had in an existing portfolio in order to make  the 
first transaction. 
This first payment was made in branch and the reason given by Mrs T for the 
payment was currency-travelling-grandchildren-travelling money.  Mrs T doesnt 
recall giving this reason  and says her grandchildren havent  travelled.  Mrs T says this 
Ref: DRN81276512payment was made online and so she didnt speak with anyone. However,  HSBC  has 
provided evidence  to show this was, in fact, a branch  transaction.
The second transaction  was also carried out in branch  the reason for this 
transaction was investing. 
The transaction made on 20 November 2017, highlighted above, was returned  by the 
scammer when Mrs T raised questions with them.  
HSBC spoke with Mrs T on 15 December 2017  about the transactions  taking place  
and warned her they thought she was being scammed.  They also arranged  a visit 
from the police,  which  I understand took place  on the same day. Although Mrs T 
remembers this differently (that she visited them and they were of no help), I 
understand she remained happy to continue investing. 
Mrs T spoke with HSBC on 28 February 2018 to request  details of one of the 
payments she had made. This prompted  a number of questions  from the call handler; 
Mrs T acknowledged she had been  contacted by HSBC  and the police, and although 
she recognised  they were only trying to help, she was quite happy. 
The transaction on 4 July 2018  was money  borrowed  from one of Mrs Ts daughters 
in order to release  the funds invested. I understand this money  was recovered. It was 
at this juncture,  when  the scammer  didnt return the investment, and the phone  line 
went dead, that Mrs T realised she had been  the victim of a scam.
I issued my provisional decision on 11 March 2021  explaining why I was minded to uphold 
this complaint but only award some of Mrs Ts losses. Both parties  have now replied to my 
provisional findings. 
Although Mrs T initially restated some previous submissions about the police indicating 
everything was alright  as the scammer had returned £10,000  and there are some  points  
she disagrees with, she has now let us know she accepts my provisional findings.  HSBC has 
also ultimately accepted  my provisional findings. 
As both parties accept  my provisional  findings, I see no reason to alter them   I therefore 
make my provisional findings  final, as set out below. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As the scammer returned  £10,000 to Mrs T in November 2017, and the final payment made  
was recovered,  my consideration is in relation to the remaining transactions, totalling  
£502,600. 
There isnt any dispute that Mrs T authorised the payments out of her account to the 
scammer. The scammer deceived her into believing she was making  legitimate investments 
into various different  companies. She received  share certificates  and items of 
correspondence from the companies  she invested into and the financial adviser likely led 
to an air of authenticity about  what was taking place. 
The payments from Mrs T were authorised even though she was the victim of a scam. She 
either used  her security  credentials to request payments online, or she went  to branch. So, 
although she didnt  intend to get scammed, under the Payment Services Regulations 2009 
and 2017 (2009 for transactions before 13 January 2018 and 2017 for those that took place 
Ref: DRN81276513after) and the general terms and conditions of bank accounts, Mrs T is presumed  liable in 
the first instance.
Taking into account the law, regulators rules and guidance, any relevant codes of practice 
and what I consider to have been good  industry practice at the time, I consider HSBC should  
fairly and reasonably:
Have been monitoring accounts and any payments made  or received  to counter 
various risks, including anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, 
and preventing fraud and scams.  
Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other  signs that 
might indicate that its customers were  at risk of fraud (amongst other things). This is 
particularly so given  the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years, 
which banks are generally more familiar with than the average customer.  
In some circumstances,  irrespective of the payment channel used, have taken 
additional steps, or made additional checks, before processing a payment, or in 
some cases  declined  to make a payment altogether, to help protect customers  from 
the possibility  of financial harm from fraud. 
I am aware  that HSBC considers too high a standard  has been applied  to what is expected  
of it in terms of identifying payments that might  indicate a consumer is at risk of financial 
harm; and it has referred to the Quincecare  duty in support of its argument (after  the legal 
case of that name). I am mindful that the courts have interpreted Quincecare  narrowly  and 
the circumstances of this complaint are different to that case. Our fair and reasonable remit 
also enables  us to take account  of regulatory  and industry standards beyond  the narrow  
legal duties considered in that and other court cases. 
In any event, I am not suggesting Quincecare  applies to this case. However, the broad legal 
position  i.e. that a bank is expected to process  authorised payments without undue  delay  
is not absolute; and Quincecare (along with regulators rules and guidance, relevant codes of 
practice and good  industry practice  at the time) is just an example of where  a court  felt a 
bankers intervention might be appropriate.
Mrs Ts first payment  to the scammer  on 22 December  2016 followed her selling some 
shares. The cheque  from that sale was deposited into her account just days  before. Mrs T 
has confirmed she held her investment portfolio  for some time, so it would appear she does 
at least have some experience of investing.  I think it fair to say the sum Mrs T was paying  
out was substantial at £50,000.  The only transfers  from the account that were  anywhere 
near that sum were some payments of £10,000  each to family members much  earlier  in the 
year. So Im satisfied this transfer was uncharacteristic and unusual for the account such  
that the bank ought to have been put on notice to make further enquiries. 
Ref: DRN81276514But it doesnt appear the branch staff asked Mrs T any probing questions  about the payment 
being made. It seems  they merely completed  some  know your customer identification 
checks for anti-money-laundering purposes, alongside filling  out a form, which Mrs T signed,  
about the payment and what is was for. I think the reason given for the payment, combined 
with it being uncharacteristic, was enough to put the bank on notice that it should have 
asked questions. I say this because whilst  many  grandparents are generous  to their 
grandchildren, I think any reasonable person would think  £50,000 was rather  a large sum to 
fund travel money requirements, such that they would consider it odd. In my judgment, 
HSBC could and should have done  more. Whilst the Banking Protocol  a police  and 
industry joint initiative   wasnt in place at the time, those provisions were  based on what 
had already been considered good industry practice  for some time. It was also well known 
even in 2016 that victims of scams like this are often given cover  stories by the scammer. 
I acknowledge Mrs T doesnt recall giving the reason for the payment. But the documentary 
evidence from the time seems clear enough  and has greater  weight than mere  
recollections years later.  It would seem that this was indeed a cover story suggested by the 
scammers, as I accept her story  now that she thought she was actually investing. Mrs T was 
vulnerable at the time due to her age and her personal circumstances; she was providing 
care to her husband who was suffering  ill health and she knew  she would need  funds to 
support that. Investment  scams were well known even back  then, particularly to banks, and if 
the staff had probed  e.g. asked  appropriate questions about  the amount, where the 
grandchildren were  travelling to, etc  it seems likely Mrs Ts story would have unravelled 
and she and/or the staff would have realised  something was wrong before it was too late. In 
other words, but for HSBCs failure to probe, the scam probably wouldnt have succeeded. 
I say this because  it was the very first transaction the scammer  had asked Mrs T to make. 
Although later intervention didnt succeed  (which Ill come to below)  at this point Mrs Ts 
relationship with the adviser was very new and she likely hadnt yet fallen under their spell; 
whereas further  own the line, Mrs T was in regular  contact  with the adviser  such  that they 
were on informal terms (speaking about family etc), she had been sent correspondence and 
share certificates and was being told how her investments  were  doing  in other  words,  
later she was far more  invested in this professional relationship than at the outset. Had 
HSBC warned her that financial advisers  dont  conduct business  by cold calling potential  
clients (or give implausible  cover  stories to relay  to banks for legitimate transactions), I think 
its likely  she would  have had second  thoughts about  what she was doing such  that she 
wouldnt have made the payment. And this in turn means its highly unlikely Mrs T would 
have made  further  payments to the scammer,  so further losses  would have been prevented. 
But that isnt the end of the matter.  I have also considered whether Mrs T should  bear some  
responsibility for the situation in which she finds herself. 
HSBC became concerned enough about the string  of significant payments being made that it 
spoke with Mrs T around 15 December 2017  (nearly a year too late in my view). Although a 
recording of the call is no longer available, I understand  HSBC  warned her that she was 
making transactions she probably shouldnt. But as she didnt take heed  of that warning, and 
because it still had concerns, HSBC got in touch  with the vulnerable  unit of local police to 
arrange a visit to Mrs T. (Interestingly,  this is comparable to the sort of action suggested in 
the Banking Protocol,  thereby reinforcing my findings above about  good industry practice  at 
the material time.) Despite that police visit, Mrs T remained happy  with what  she was doing  
and continued  investing. 
Ref: DRN81276515Mrs T recalls this differently,  variously saying that she visited the police station herself and/or 
that whoever she spoke  with didnt know about  fraud. I find it hard to accept  a police officer  
wouldnt know about fraud and I approach Mrs Ts testimony with caution,  as she doesnt 
recall how or what reason  she gave for the first payment. This is quite understandable given 
her age, vulnerability, the length of time and the circumstances.  But it does mean I dont find 
what she has said about this particular point persuasive. 
And I have  listened  to a follow-up call Mrs T had with HSBC  at the end of February 2018. In 
this call, Mrs T was asking for details of a payment  she had already made to her financial 
adviser. The call handler clearly found  it odd that this information  was being asked for and it 
put them on notice  to ask more questions. I set out an extract below:
HSBC: And have you known the financial adviser for a while?
Mrs T: Yes I have.  I have.  I mean,  yourererwhat do you call it, the people who 
look after the money in the bankhave  been  on to me and saying youve  done  this 
and done that, but you shouldnt be doing  this and shouldnt be doing that and even 
had the police on. Quite honestly   no you know  I know theyre trying to help but 
you know Im quite  happy. 
 
So Mrs T acknowledges in the call of February  2018  that both the police and HSBC had tried 
to warn her about the payments she was making,  and that she was likely being  scammed.  
Yet following  HSBC and the polices attempted intervention, Mrs T went on to send the 
scammer over £330,000  more. I dont think there is anything  more HSBC could have done at 
this point; if Mrs T wasnt willing  to listen to the police  then Im unsure what more HSBC  
could have said or done to have warned her such that she would have taken notice. And 
because she wasnt willing to listen the warnings HSBC or, more importantly, the police 
gave, I dont think the bank is to blame for Mrs T continuing to send money  to the scammer  
after 15 December 2017. From that point  onwards, the causal chain flowing from HSBCs 
wrongdoing was broken, so full liability for these authorised  payments may fairly and 
reasonably be assigned to Mrs T in line with the statutory regulations and/or account terms 
and conditions. I think she was fully to blame for those subsequent losses. 
In reaching this conclusion, I have thought  very carefully about whether HSBC would have 
been justified  in refusing to follow Mrs Ts instructions to send the money following its 
attempted intervention. This would be a significant  step for any bank given  its regulatory  
obligations as a payment services provider. And Ive borne in mind  that even if HSBC  ought 
to have done more at this stage, a bank could be held legally liable for refusing to allow a 
customer access to their money indefinitely. I think if HSBC  had refused to allow the 
transaction of 19 December 2017,  or those following it, that likely would have prompted  a 
complaint or some other contact from Mrs T insisting the payment be made. So even if 
HSBC had taken  such drastic action, I think Mrs T would probably have taken steps  to make 
sure payments were  executed in accordance  with her legal mandate. 
For the avoidance of doubt, I dont think it would be fair and reasonable to apportion any 
blame to Mrs T for the scammed payments before 15 December  2017   because, at that 
time, I am satisfied she was wholly duped by the scammer and, in the absence  of 
intervention from the bank  or others, simply unable to foresee this sort of financial harm as a 
result of her actions. 
Ref: DRN81276516Summary
I find that HSBC should  have  done more when Mrs T made  the first payment request. And 
as such I require it to reimburse some  of Mrs Ts losses. But I find Mrs T should also bear 
some responsibility for her losses given she didnt heed HSBCs or the polices warnings.  
Mrs T is aware  that I can only make  an award  up to specified amounts. She referred her 
complaint to our office in December 2018, which means I can award  fair compensation to be 
paid by a financial  business of up to £150,000,  plus any interest and/or costs/interest on 
costs that I consider appropriate. If I think fair compensation is more than £150,000, I may 
make a non-binding  recommendation that the business pay the balance. 
In making my award,  I have noted  that many of the payments were ultimately derived from a 
savings account  and so Mrs T will have lost out on interest earned in that account by making  
the payments  she did. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I uphold this complaint. I think fair compensation is £189,600  the 
amount paid to the scammer  between  December 2016 and 15 December 2017. My decision 
is that HBSC UK Bank Plc should  pay Mrs T £150,000 plus interest on that sum at the rate 
applicable to her savings account  from the respective  dates of loss to the date of refund 
(less any tax properly deductible). 
I think fair compensation  is more than £150,000, so I recommend  that HSBC  also pays  
Mrs T the difference, i.e. £39,600  plus interest (at the same rate and for the same period).  
This recommendation is not part of my final determination or award. HSBC doesnt have to 
do what I recommend. Its unlikely that Mrs T can accept  my final decision and go to court  for 
the balance. Mrs T may want  to get independent legal advice before deciding whether to 
accept this decision.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 May 2021.
