K820x#14complaint
A, a limited  company, complains about the chargeback  process operated by WorldPay (UK) 
Limited. As complaint has been brought  by its director, Mr B.
background
Mr B told us that his company, A, had an agreement with WorldPay  for it to process card 
payments to A. He told us that a number of cardholder not present payments had been 
reversed. He thought that this was WorldPays fault.  
Mr B said that hed sometimes split a payment  into two separate amounts, so that it would 
go through after a single payment for the full amount was refused. He didnt think  that 
WorldPay shouldve allowed those transactions to go through. And he said that on many or 
most of the cardholder not present  transactions, he'd carried  out all of the required security  
checks. Mr B didnt think that A should  have to pay money back for any transactions which had only 
gone through after theyd  been split, or any transactions where a full match on security  had 
been secured.
Mr B said that A had lost a lot of money  in chargebacks that had been processed by 
WorldPay, and there  was much more  pending. Mr B also said that he hadnt been  able to get 
any other credit card transaction  processing  company to accept As business after this. He 
said that all of this was having a significant  impact on A.
WorldPay said that it had contacted Mr B to tell him about problems with some transactions 
that he had processed  on behalf of A. The cardholders  had disputed those transactions, and 
WorldPay said that Mr B hadnt replied  to those letters.  Mr B said that A didnt receive  them.
WorldPay said that without that response, it wasnt able to defend  the chargeback requests 
that it had received. And that meant  that it had debited As account for these amounts. 
WorldPay didnt think that it had done anything  wrong. 
Our investigator didnt  uphold this complaint. He said that WorldPay  had followed its own 
terms and conditions. It had asked Mr B to tell it what had happened with the disputed  
payments, and Mr B hadnt replied to those requests. Our investigator  didnt  think that 
WorldPay had done anything wrong. 
Mr B replied  on behalf of A, to say that he didnt think that was fair. He said that A was a new 
company, so it couldnt get credit insurance to cover  it against the risk of failed payments. 
And he said that A had no choice but to sign up to an agreement like this one with WorldPay,  
if it wanted to take payment cards. He thought that it was WorldPays responsibility to take 
steps to safeguard against potentially fraudulent transactions,  and not just pass  that risk on 
to a smaller, less experienced and more vulnerable business like A.
Because Mr B, on behalf of A, didnt agree with our investigator, the case  was passed  to me 
for a final decision.  
Ref: DRN23329122my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive reached the same overall conclusion  
as our investigator, and for broadly  the same reasons.
Mr B didnt think that WorldPay should  be able to hide behind  terms and conditions, which 
he didnt think were  fair, to avoid  any liability  for failed transactions.  He said that our service  
should be doing something  about  that. Mr B has also told us that A took every reasonable 
step to ensure the transactions were  done properly.
I dont think that the point  that Mr B is making quite fits with what has happened  here.  Ill 
explain why not.
WorldPay doesnt just issue  terms and conditions. It also has a set of customer  operating  
instructions. Those include detailed  guidance on which transactions A should take particular 
care over. 
A processed  six transactions which were  later reversed. All of these were  cardholder not 
present transactions,  which WorldPay says are higher risk. All of these  were  for quite 
significantly higher  amounts  than the average payments that A was processing.  WorldPay  
told us that the average payment made  to A, disregarding these transactions,  was just over 
£100. All of these  transactions were for well over £1,000, and some of them quite 
considerably so. Four of the transactions appear to be what WorldPay  refers to as split 
transactions where the retailer has processed two payments  for one purchase. At least two 
of these were done after previously trying the full amount as one payment, apparently in 
order to avoid limits placed on the card. WorldPays customer  operating  instructions tell A, 
and other  merchants, never to do this, and warn  that theres a higher  risk of successful 
chargeback if it does do this. 
I dont think its reasonable for A to say that WorldPay  should be mainly  responsible  for 
making sure that these  transactions dont go through, or that its fair for A to say that it did 
everything it could to prevent the problems  which have  occurred.  I think  its primarily As 
responsibility to avoid transactions which are higher risk. I dont say that solely  because  
WorldPays terms and conditions work in that way. I think that A is generally in a better 
position to assess  and avoid risk that than WorldPay. And I note that WorldPays  guidance  
specifically warned A that these transactions  would be higher risk. 
So I dont  think that WorldPay did anything wrong by allowing these transactions  to go 
through. 
I also think its important, when Im assessing what has happened here, that WorldPay  didnt 
just allow  the card operator to reverse these transactions when it was notified of concerns 
over them. It notified A of the chargebacks on these transactions, and asked A for evidence 
that the goods had been  sent to the cardholder. So WorldPay was giving  A the chance  to 
show that these  transactions  were genuine.  
Unfortunately, Mr B says A didnt receive  any of those letters. Im satisfied that they were 
sent to the right address,  so its not WorldPays fault if they didnt arrive.  And without any 
response, WorldPay couldnt challenge the chargebacks  on these transactions.  So I dont 
think that WorldPay did anything wrong  when it then didnt challenge these chargebacks.
Ref: DRN23329123Ive considered everything that both sides have  said in this case, and I dont think that 
WorldPay has acted unfairly  or unreasonably. I know  that Mr B, on behalf  of A, will be 
disappointed, but I dont think that As complaint should be upheld.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 July 2019.
