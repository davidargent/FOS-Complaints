K820x#14complaint
Miss M and Mr B bring this complaint on behalf  of their business  M. They complain that 
WorldPay (UK) Limited has withdrawn its services from M which  means it can no longer 
trade. They also complain  that WorldPay has unfairly registered an alert under the Visa 
Mastercard Alert System (VMAS).
background
Miss M and Mr B run a business  and they signed up to an agreement with WorldPay that 
enabled them to take debit and credit card payments from their customers. 
In July 2018, following a review, WorldPay decided  to terminate Ms agreement without 
further notice. Mr B queried  this with WorldPay. He was told that due to the significant 
increase in declined transactions, by M, which WorldPay considered  excessive, it was 
entitled to take such  action.
WorldPay also said it was obliged to register an alert with the VMAS   although this was not 
to be seen as a blacklisting tool. It also withheld payments of Â£650 as it said it was entitled  
to do so under the terms and conditions of the account.
Miss M and Mr B disagreed. And they brought their complaint to us. Mr B explained that the 
declined transactions only related to two customers M had on the same day. He told us hed 
repeatedly tried to put payments through, with reducing amounts, but each time the 
payments were declined.  So he had ended  up offering the customers  payment plans. 
One of our investigators  looked into the complaint.  He said WorldPay  had acted  in 
accordance with the terms  and conditions of the agreement. And it hadnt  done anything 
wrong when it had notified VMAS  about  the closure of Ms account. Mr B disagreed. He said 
the declined authorisation  requests occurred during Ms first few uses of the payment 
terminal, so any declined  authorisation wouldve seemed excessive because the business 
hadnt yet made much  of an income.   
As no agreement could be reached  the complaint has been referred to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It seems  to me that it is not the legality of WorldPays decisions which  Mr M is challenging  
but more the reasonableness.  He says that WorldPay  hasnt taken into account the 
circumstances of the transactions. And that he hasnt done  anything to warrant  WorldPay 
notifying VMAS. 
So that all parties  are clear, I accept  that under the terms and conditions  of the contract  
between WorldPay and M, the former is entitled, in certain circumstances, to withdraw its 
services without notice, withhold funds and register a merchant with the VMAS.
Mr M submits that having looked at comments online from other companies, the consensus 
is that WorldPay need not or should  not have acted  in the way it has. He feels that the alert 
on VMAS has prevented him from obtaining card services elsewhere.
Ref: DRN27901492I appreciate Miss M and Mr B feel very strongly  about whats happened,  but Im afraid I have 
to tell them that I cannot tell WorldPay how it should enforce the terms of its contract. 
Commercial decisions such as these  are not something which this service  would normally  
interfere with. 
I know Mr B says that finding  an alternative  supplier has proved difficult but the alert with 
VMAS has to be registered. Miss M and Mr Bs agreement with WorldPay  says it will report 
account closure details  if WorldPay  has had to terminate an account. And WorldPay  says its 
obliged to record the fact it closed Ms account  on the VMAS system. So I dont feel I can 
fairly say it shouldnt have  done this in these particular  circumstances. Or that I can require  
WorldPay to remove the information its recorded  about Ms account.
In relation to the withheld funds, I know our investigator has advised Mr B to contact 
WorldPay about releasing these. I cannot add anything further to that advice.
I sympathise with the position which Miss M and Mr B now find themselves in. None of this is 
their fault  Mr B carried out what he thought was legitimate transactions.  But this is not 
WorldPays fault either  so I cannot ask that it does anymore.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M and Mr B, 
on behalf of M, to accept  or reject  my decision before 24 August 2019.
