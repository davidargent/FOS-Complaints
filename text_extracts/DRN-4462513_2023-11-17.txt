The complaint
L, a limited company complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly closed its 
accounts. L is also unhappy about the service NatWest provided regarding the repayment of 
loans. 
L is represented by its director, Mr B.
What happened
L had a current account with NatWest. It also had two loan accounts with NatWest  a small 
business loan and bounce back loan.
In November 2020, NatWest decided to review Ls current account. Following its review, in 
January 2021, NatWest decided to close Ls account and wrote to M B to let him know he 
needed to make alternative banking arrangements.
Mr B contacted NatWest to try and find out what was happening with Ls account but says 
the bank wouldnt tell him much about why it no longer wanted L as a customer. He also said 
that as a result of the account being closed, he wasnt able to make repayments towards Ls 
loans. No payments have been made towards Ls bounce back loan since January 2021 and 
no payments were made towards Ls small business loan since September 2021. So, both 
loans are in arrears.
NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong when it reviewed and closed Ls account. It also 
said that it had tried to contact Mr B throughout 2021 about repaying Ls loans, but no 
arrangements had been put in place. Arrears therefore continued to accrue, ultimately 
leading NatWest to default both loans and instruct a debt collection agency. 
Mr B brought Ls complaint to our service and one of our investigators looked into things. He 
said NatWest hadnt done anything wrong when it had reviewed and closed Ls account. 
Mr B disagreed. He says NatWest treated L unfairly when it closed its account which caused  
problems repaying Ls loans. He wants the bank to explain why it closed Ls account and pay 
compensation for the inconvenience the banks actions caused L. 
As no agreement could be reached the complaint came to me to decide. After reviewing all 
the evidence and arguments I issued a provisional decision in which I said the following:
I would add too that our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may treat 
evidence from banks as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if it contains 
security information, or commercially sensitive information. Some of the information NatWest 
has provided is information that we considered should be kept confidential. This means I 
havent been able to share a lot of detail with Mr B, but Id like to reassure him that I have 
considered everything.
Ive considered whether NatWest acted fairly in closing Ls account. In doing so, Ive looked 
at the terms and conditions of the account and relevant regulations. The terms and 
conditions outline that the bank can close a customers account with two months notice, and 
in certain circumstances they can close an account with less notice. In this case NatWest 
closed  Ls account without the full notice period. For NatWest to act fairly here they needed 
to meet the criteria to apply their terms for immediate closure  and having looked at these 
terms and all the evidence, Im satisfied that the bank did and that it was entitled to close the 
account as its already done. So, I cant say NatWest treated L unfairly. 
I understand that Mr B wants NatWest to explain the reason it closed Ls account and he is 
upset that when he spoke to the bank, he wasnt able to find out much at all about why the 
bank had decided to close Ls account.  But NatWest is under no obligation to tell 
Mr B the reasons behind the account closure, as much as hed like to know. So, I cant say 
its done anything wrong by not giving Mr B this information. And it wouldnt be appropriate 
for me to require it to do so.
Mr B has said that he couldnt make Ls loan repayments because the bank had closed Ls 
business account. I can appreciate that NatWest closing Ls bank account made things 
difficult for Mr B to run his business and make Ls loan repayments, but its reasonable for 
NatWest to expect repayment of the money L borrowed and owed. NatWest could also end 
their relationship with L even though L had two loans with the bank. 
From looking at the information, its evident that L didnt make sufficient payments towards 
what was owed on either loan. No payments had been received on the bounce back loan 
since January 2021 and no payments had been made towards Ls small business loan since 
September 2021. So, both loans are in arrears.
Ive looked at the contact notes and the letters which NatWest sent to Mr B in the run up to 
its decision to close the loans and default them. I can see that NatWest wrote to Mr B on 
several occasions between May 2021 and March 2023, which included final demand and 
pre-default letters. The bank also tried to call him and sent him text messages asking him to 
get in touch about repaying the loans. I can see that NatWest offered to help Mr B via its 
financial support team and said it would put any recovery action on hold until Ls complaint 
had been looked at by our service. So, Im satisfied that NatWest responded positively and 
sympathetically towards Mr B.
 
Having looked at the correspondence NatWest sent Mr B Im also satisfied that it set out 
clearly what steps NatWest would take if the arrears werent repaid, which included reporting 
information to credit reference agencies and passing the loans to debt recovery agents. 
Having looked at everything, Im satisfied that NatWest acted reasonably. I think its now 
down to Mr B to contact NatWest to arrange to repay what L owes.
 
In summary, its clearly caused L inconvenience when NatWest closed its account. But 
having looked at all the evidence and circumstances of this complaint, Im satisfied that 
NatWest has treated L fairly when it closed its account and asked L to repay its loans. So, I 
wont be telling NatWest to do anything else to resolve Ls complaint. 
NatWest accepted my provisional decision. Mr B responded on behalf of L. In summary he 
said:
He tried to make payments towards the loans but couldnt after Ls accounts were 
closed and his banking apps disappeared from his mobile phone
He doesnt understand why he should go to the trouble of making the payments 
when he hadnt done anything wrong 
NatWest has ruined his credit score 
NatWest have hurt him, and its actions amount to a great injustice against himNow both sides have had an opportunity to comment I can go ahead and issue my final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In response to the provisional decision, Mr B has raised a number of concerns, which Ill now 
address below.
Mr B has said that he couldnt make Ls loan repayments because the bank had closed Ls 
business account and removed access to his online banking. Hes said that he did try and 
make some payments by visiting a branch, but because Ls accounts had been closed, staff 
couldnt find its accounts on the banks computer systems. I can appreciate that NatWest 
closing Ls bank account made things difficult for Mr B to continue to make payments 
towards Ls loans, and I accept what he says about what happened when he went into a 
branch. I also accept that Mr B is very upset about what happened, but its reasonable for 
NatWest to expect repayment of the money L borrowed and owed, regardless of whether the 
bank closed Ls accounts and how upset Mr B is about everything.
 
As I set out in my provisional decision the letters which NatWest sent to Mr B in the run up to 
its decision to close the loans and default them set out clearly what Mr B needed to do about 
repaying Ls loans. And what would happen if he didnt repay what L owed, which included 
reporting information to credit reference agencies and passing the loans to debt recovery 
agents.
Im satisfied from looking at the contact notes NatWest has provided that the bank also tried 
to call Mr B and sent him text messages asking him to get in touch about repaying the loans. 
So, despite Mr B saying he had trouble repaying the loans at branch I think NatWest have let 
him know exactly how he could carry on making Ls loan repayments. But I havent seen any 
evidence that Mr B took any steps to repay Ls loans. 
I can also see that NatWest offered to help Mr B via its financial support team and said it 
would put any recovery action on hold until Ls complaint has been looked at by our service. 
So, Im satisfied that NatWest responded positively and sympathetically towards Mr B. 
Having looked at the correspondence NatWest sent Mr B Im also satisfied that it set out 
clearly what steps NatWest would take if the arrears werent repaid, Overall, Im satisfied 
that NatWest acted reasonably and fairly when it asked L to repay its loans. I think its now 
down to Mr B to contact NatWest to arrange to repay what L owes.
 
In summary, I appreciate that Mr B on behalf of L, will be disappointed by my decision, but I 
see no reason to depart from my provisional findings. I remain of the view that this complaint 
should not be upheld for the reasons set out in my provisional decision, which are repeated 
above and form part of this decision.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask L to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2023.
