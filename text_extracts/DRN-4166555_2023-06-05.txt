Complaint
Mr P has complained about personal loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) provided to him. He says the loans were unaffordable.
Background
118 118 Money provided Mr P with a loan for £1,500.00 in February 2016. This loan had an 
APR of 169.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total amount to be repaid of 
£3,460.32, including interest, fees and charges of £1,960.32, was due to be repaid in 24 
monthly instalments of just under £145. 
118 118 Money then provided Mr P with a second loan for £1,742.42 in December 2017. 
£242.42 of the funds advanced went towards settling the outstanding balance on loan 1. 
This loan also had an APR of 169.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total 
amount to be repaid of £4,094.40, including interest, fees and charges of £2,351.98, was 
due to be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of just over £170. 
In December 2018, 118 118 Money provided Mr P with a third loan for £2,301.69. £1,301.69 
of the funds advanced went towards settling the outstanding balance on loan 2. This loan 
had an APR of 169.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total amount to be 
repaid of £5,279.52, including interest, fees and charges of £2,977.83, was due to be repaid 
in 24 monthly instalments of just under £220. 
Mr P was provided with a fourth loan for £1,000.00 in June 2021. This loan had an APR of 
44.9% and a term of 12 months. This meant that the total amount to be repaid of £1,211.04, 
including interest, fees and charges of £211.04, was due to be repaid in 12 monthly 
instalments of just over £100. 
Finally, 118 118 Money provided Mr P with a fifth loan for £2,000.00 in May 2022. This loan 
had an APR of 49.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total amount to be 
repaid of £2,956.32, including interest, fees and charges of £956.32, was due to be repaid in 
24 monthly instalments of just under £125. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mr Ps complaint and he concluded that 118 118 Money 
didnt do anything wrong when providing loan 1 but that it ought to have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided Mr P with loans 2 to 5. Mr P accepted our adjudicators assessment 
but 118 118 Money didnt. So the case was passed to an ombudsman for a final decision.
As the parties are in agreement with the outcome reached on loan 1, this decision is only 
looking at whether 118 118 Money acted fairly and reasonably towards Mr P when providing 
loans 2 to 5. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr Ps complaint. 
Having carefully considered everything Ive decided to partially uphold Mr Ps complaint. Ill 
explain why in a little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
is 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Mr P could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
When Mr P approached 118 118 Money in December 2017 he was approaching for a 
second loan before hed even successfully repaid his first one. I think that this coupled with 
the fact that the payments to this loan would be taking up a reasonable proportion of his 
monthly income meant that 118 118 Money ought to have found out more about more about 
Mr P before determining that this loan was affordable for him. 
The position was even worse by the time of loan 3 as Mr P owed 118 118 Money (and his 
other creditors) even more than he did at the time he was provided with loan 2. As the 
position didnt really improve by the time of loans 4 and 5 either, Im satisfied that 118 118 
Money ought reasonably to have carried out further checks before providing loans 2 to 5 to 
Mr P.
I think further checks would have extended into finding out more about Mr Ps expenditure. 
And if 118 118 Money had done this here, Im persuaded that it would have seen that Mr P 
was already in a difficult financial position at the respective times and also found out why this 
was the case. Im also satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would more likely 
than not have shown 118 118 Money that Mr Ps existing precarious financial position was 
because he was struggling financially. 
So Im persuaded by what Mr P has said about already being in a difficult financial position 
at the time and the reasons for this. And as reasonable and proportionate checks should 
have extended into finding out more about Mr Ps income and expenditure, Im satisfied that 
they would more like than not have shown 118 118 Money that it shouldnt have provided 
loans 2 to 5 to Mr P. As 118 118 Money provided Mr P with loan 2 to 5, notwithstanding this, 
Im satisfied it failed to act fairly and reasonably towards him. 
Mr P ended up paying interest, fees and charges on a loan he shouldnt have been provided 
with in the first place. So Im satisfied that Mr P lost out because of what 118 118 Money did 
wrong and that it should put things right.
Fair compensation  what 118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Mr P
Having thought about everything, 118 118 Money should put things right for Mr P by:
refunding all interest fees, and charges Mr P paid as a result of loans 2 to 4:adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Mr P to the date of settlement
removing all interest, fees and charges applied to loan 5 from the outset. The 
payments Mr P made, whether to 118 118 Money or any third-party debt purchaser, 
should be deducted from the new starting balance  the £2,000.00 originally lent. Any 
compensation due for loans 2 to 4 should also be used to reduce the amount Mr P 
owes on loan 5. If, after all adjustments have been carried out, Mr P will have ended 
up paying more than £2,000.00, on loan 5, then 118 118 Money should treat any 
extra as overpayments. And any overpayments should be refunded to Mr P;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any overpayments, if any, from the date 
they were made by Mr P to the date of settlement
removing any adverse information it may have recorded about loans 2 to 4 from       
Mr Ps credit file; 
if no outstanding balance remains on loan 5 after all adjustments have been made, 
all adverse information 118 118 Money recorded about loan 5 should be removed 
from Mr Ps credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im partially upholding Mr Ps complaint. Madison CF UK 
Limited should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 July 2023.
