The complaint
 Mr L says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) gave him loans 
irresponsibly. 
What happened
 Mr L took 13 loans with Sunny between October 2016 and June 2019. Each of these loans 
was due to be repaid over a period of six months  but Mr L repaid some of the loans early. 
Some of Mr Ls loans overlapped with one another. A summary of Mr Ls borrowing is shown 
below.

* The maximum combined repayment figure is sometimes made up of multiple payments 
when the loans overlapped.
Our adjudicator considered the complaint and she recommended Sunny refund the interest 
and charges from loan 6 onwards (and make amendments to Mr Ls credit file) as it ought to 
have realised Mr L was having problems managing his money at this stage. She also felt 
that from loan 9 onwards it appeared that Mr L had become reliant on this form of lending. 
Sunny did not respond. Mr L accepted the adjudicators view.
As the case has not been resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account all the 
relevant rule, guidance and good industry practice.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when Sunny lent to Mr L. The 
FCAs Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC) is the specialist sourcebook for credit-related 
regulated activities. It sets out the rules and guidance specific to consumer credit providers, 
such as Sunny.
It is important to note that the FCA didnt, and doesnt, specify exactly how an assessment of 
affordability is to be carried out but the extent and scope and the types and sources of 
information to use needed to be enough to be able to reasonably assess the sustainability 
of the arrangement for the consumer.
In other words, the assessment needs to be consumer-focussed. It is not an assessment of 
the risk to the lender of not recovering the credit but of the risk to the consumer of incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant adverse consequence as a result of the 
decision to lend.
As set out in CONC, the risk to the consumer directly relates to the particulars of the lending 
and the circumstances of the consumer. Therefore, a lenders assessment of 
creditworthiness would likely need to be flexible. That is to say, what is sufficient for one 
consumer might not be for another, or indeed what might be sufficient for a consumer in one 
circumstance might not be so for the same consumer in other circumstances.
Bearing the above in mind, I would expect an assessment of creditworthiness to vary with 
circumstance. In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance, the greater the 
potential risk to the consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way
But certain factors might point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include, but are not limited to:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);  
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So Sunny was required to establish whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. And, 
although Mr L may have repaid some loans early, it doesnt automatically follow that he 
managed to repay them in a sustainable way. This is because the Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
It follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it undertakes eligibility, creditworthiness and affordability checks before 
deciding whether to provide a loan. I think that the checks Sunny did before agreeing the first 
five loans were proportionate and the information Mr L provided indicated that the loans 
were affordable. I appreciate this might not have been reflective of Mr Ls actual financial 
position at the time. But these were Mr Ls first few loans with Sunny and there was a seven-
month gap between loans 2 and 3. 
But by the time Mr L asked for loan 6, Sunny should have done more than rely on the 
information he was providing about his finances. I think it should have taken steps at that 
time to independently verify Mr Ls true financial position. We asked Mr L for copies of his 
bank statements and credit file so we could see what better checks would likely have shown 
Sunny. 
Looking at Mr Ls bank statements at the time he took out loan 6, I can see he was regularly 
over his overdraft limit and there are a large number of returned direct debits. He was 
making regular repayments to at least two short term instalment loans and had a number of 
other unsecured loans and credit cards. By loan 7, Mr Ls situation was no better, with at 
least 4 other short-term loans outstanding and by loan 8 it seems that Mr L was starting to 
borrow from family or friends with a number of credit deposits referenced as loan, Sunny 
ought reasonably to have discovered all of this through proportionate checks and as a 
responsible lender, I dont think it would have agreed to loans 6 to 8.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr L, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
In reaching this conclusion, Ive taken into account the substantial break in lending between 
loans 2 and 3; treating loan 3 as the first loan in the second chain of borrowing. Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 9. I say 
this because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 3 and 11 of Mr L taking new loans 
shortly after taking out or repaying the previous ones and often overlapping with one 
another. I think that by loan 9, Sunny ought fairly and reasonably to have regarded 
that pattern as established.
 
So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr L was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loans were leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ls indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mr L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny.
Loan 9 was taken out 14 months after loan 3. Loan 9, along with overlapping loan 8 
was much more than he borrowed for loan 3. The repayment (along with overlapping 
loan 8) was almost twice the amount Mr L was repaying for 3. 
 
I think that Mr L lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 9 
onwards. These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use. The sheer number of loans was 
more likely than not to have had negative implications on Mr Ls ability to access mainstream 
credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 9 to 13 as well as loans 6 to 8 and Sunny 
should put things right as set out below.
Putting things right
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr L loans 6 to 13 and should put things right as set out below.
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr L towards interest, fees and 
charges on these loans.
 
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr L which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr L originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
 
C. Pay Mr L the total of A plus B.
 
D. Remove any adverse information Sunny has recorded on Mr Ls credit file in relation 
to loans 6-8. The overall pattern of borrowing for loans 9-13 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans entirely from 
Mr Ls credit file. 
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
 My final decision For the reasons set out above, Ive decided to partially uphold Mr Ls complaint and direct 
Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) to put things right as set out above.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 May 2020.
