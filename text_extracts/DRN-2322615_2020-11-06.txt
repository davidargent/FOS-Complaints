The complaint
Miss S complains about 38 instalment loans that she took out with Gain Credit LLC, trading 
as Lending Stream, (GC), which she said were unaffordable. The complaint is brought to 
this 
service by a claims management company. But for ease I shall refer below to all actions 
being taken by Miss S. 
What happened
This complaint is about 38 instalment loans GC provided to Miss S between June 2015 and 
April 2019. All the loans were repayable by either 24 weekly repayments or six monthly 
repayments, but Miss S repaid many of the loans within a few weeks of taking them out. At 
times Miss S had up to five loans outstanding at the same time. All of Miss Ss loans have 
been fully repaid. Miss Ss borrowing history is as follows:

Miss S said that GC failed to carry out effective affordability assessments prior to the issuing 
of borrowing. If an effective assessment had been carried out, the borrowing would not have 
been provided.
GC said that it asked Miss S for her monthly income and expenditure. It also independently 
verified Miss Ss income with third party sources for some loans. It also in some cases used 
national averages for expense categories where data was available as a third party 
verification of Miss Ss declared expenses, and it revised upwards Miss Ss total stated 
expenses while computing the disposable income. GC also carried out a creditworthiness 
check and it said that the third party credit reference agency confirmed a rating which was 
satisfactory for the loans. GC also checked via a third party source Miss Ss other credit 
obligations at the time of her loan approvals and these met all reasonable affordability 
criteria. It concluded that proper and proportionate affordability checks were conducted, and 
it didnt uphold any of the loans. 
our adjudicators view
Our adjudicator recommended that Miss Ss complaint should be upheld in part. She 
recommended that Loans 5 to 23 and Loans 30 to 38 be upheld.
GC hadnt provided a response to the adjudicators recommendations. 
As this complaint hadnt been resolved informally, it was passed to me, an ombudsman, to 
investigate.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Miss S 
and to GC on 6 October 2020. I summarise my findings:
I noted that when GC lent to Miss S the regulator was the Financial Conduct Authority and 
relevant regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC). The 
CONC contained guidance for lenders about responsible lending and the relevant rules and 
guidance said that before lending GC needed to make a reasonable assessment of Miss Ss 
creditworthiness. This meant Miss S being able to meet her repayments out of her normal 
income without having to go without or borrow further and without the repayments having a 
significant adverse impact on her financial situation.The regulations werent prescriptive about what checks GC needed to carry out in order to 
reasonably assess whether or not Miss S would be able to meet her repayments 
sustainably. But the regulations said that such checks needed to be proportionate. This 
suggested that the same checks might not be the appropriate thing to do for all consumers, 
or for the same consumer in all circumstances.
I said that in general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the 
potential risk to the consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. 
So, for example, Id expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed 
checks
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer had been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing might signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There might even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
clearly demonstrated that the lending was unsustainable.
Id carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in 
this context and what this all meant for Miss Ss complaint.
GC had made a number of checks before it lent to Miss S. It asked her for details of her 
monthly income and expenditure. Miss Ss declared income for all the loans ranged 
from £1,100 to £1,700. Miss Ss adjusted total expenditure for all the loans ranged from 
£523 to £948.
GC also checked Miss Ss credit file before agreeing to the loans. It had provided us 
with a brief summary of the results of its credit checks. It appeared from the summaries 
Id seen that there wasnt any adverse information such as defaulted accounts that I 
thought should have caused additional concerns to GC.
Wed received a credit report from Miss S. I could see that showed a defaulted account in 
January 2016. But I was aware that when a lender carried out a credit check, the 
information it saw doesnt usually provide the same level of detail that a borrowers credit 
report would, and it wasnt necessarily up to date. A lender might only see a small portion 
of a borrowers credit file, or some data might be missing or anonymised. I was also 
aware that not all payday and short term lenders reported to the same credit reference 
agencies. So, not all of Miss Ss accounts might have been identified by GCs credit 
check. So, this might have explained any differences between the information provided by 
GCs credit check and Miss Ss actual situation.
As Id mentioned above each of Miss Ss loans was repayable by either 24 weekly or six 
monthly instalments. So, the amounts that Miss S needed to repay each time were 
smaller than if shed taken a normal payday loan. But she was also committing to 
making those repayments over a far longer period. In addition, Miss S sometimes had a 
number of loans
outstanding at the same time. So, Id needed to consider the total amount that Miss 
S needed to repay to GC each month.Id also thought that the fact that Miss S typically repaid many of her loans much earlier 
than planned should have caused some concerns to GC. That might be the sort of 
behaviour that would indicate that someone was facing problems managing their money 
and needing to refinance loans on a regular basis. So, Id also taken that into account 
when looking at whether GC should have given the loans to Miss S.
I thought that the checks GC did before agreeing Miss Ss first two loans were 
proportionate. The amounts that Miss S needed to repay were relatively small 
compared with the disposable income shed declared. Given these repayment amounts, 
what was apparent about Miss Ss circumstances at the time, and that these were her 
first two loans with the lender, I didnt think it wouldve been proportionate for GC to 
have asked her for the amount of information that would be needed to show the lending 
was unsustainable before agreeing the first two loans.
But by the time Miss S applied for Loan 3 around five months after applying for Loan 2, I 
thought that GC should have realised that it couldnt safely rely on the information shed 
provided about her financial situation. Shed been borrowing from GC for nearly ten 
months without a break and Loan 2 was still outstanding. So, I thought Sunny should have 
supplemented the information it held by gathering information about Miss Ss borrowing 
from other short term lenders.
Id reviewed Miss Ss credit report and bank statements to see what better checks 
would have shown. Id noted that Miss S had one outstanding short term loan with 
another lender which would have been repayable around the same time as Loan 3. But 
overall, I couldnt safely say that if GC had carried out proportionate checks before 
Loan 3, it wouldve seen that Miss S couldnt sustainably make the repayments to Loan 
3. So, I didnt intend to uphold her complaint about Loan 3.
Loan 4 was taken out less than a month after Loan 3. The loan amount was more than 
50% higher than Loan 3, and Loans 2 and 3 were still outstanding. Miss S had been 
borrowing from GC for almost a year without any break. So again, I didnt think it was 
reasonable for GC to rely on the information provided to it by Miss S. And I thought all 
this should again have prompted GC to do some additional checks such as asking Miss S 
for more information about her other short term borrowing commitments.
Id again looked at Miss Ss bank statements and credit report to see what better checks 
would have shown GC. I could see that Miss S had another short term loan at the time 
from another lender for £275. I thought this loan together with her two outstanding loans 
with GC might have suggested to GC that her finances were under pressure and that she 
was having difficulties managing her money. As such there was a real risk that Miss S 
wasnt going to be able to sustainably repay Loan 4. So as a responsible lender, I didnt 
think GC should have given Loan 4 to Miss S.
Loan 5 was taken out around a month after Loan 4. Loans 3 and 4 were still outstanding. 
Miss S had been borrowing from GC for more than a year without any break. The loan 
amounts had been increasing since Loan 3 and her outstanding loans with GC totalled 
£310. I thought the pattern and increasing amount of Miss Ss borrowing were such that 
again it wasnt reasonable for GC to have relied on the information provided by Miss S. 
But by the time of Loan 5, I thought it should have taken steps to independently verify Miss 
Ss true financial position.
Id carefully looked at Miss Ss bank statements for the month before Loan 5 to see what 
better checks would have shown GC. I could see that Miss S had another outstanding 
short term loan from another lender. I thought this loan together with her two outstanding loans with GC might again have suggested to GC that Miss S was facing problems 
managing her money and unlikely to be able to repay Loan 5 in a sustainable manner. 
So, I didnt think GC should have given Loan 5 to Miss S.
Id also looked at the overall pattern of GCs lending history with Miss S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which GC should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, GC should have realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ss case, I thought that this point had been 
reached by Loan 6. I said this because:
By Loan 6, Miss S had been borrowing from GC for over a year with no gaps in 
her borrowing. Loan 6 was her fourth loan in less than two months. I thought this 
indicated that Miss S was becoming dependent on this type of borrowing.
Miss S wasnt making any real inroads to the amounts she owed GC. The amount 
of Loan 6 was the highest since her second loan. And Miss S had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to GC over an extended period.
Miss S took out Loan 6 whilst she was still repaying Loans 3, 4 and 5 to GC. I 
thought the fact that Miss S still had three outstanding loans with it when she 
borrowed Loan 6 should have put GC on notice that Miss S might be 
experiencing significant financial pressures and that Miss S was likely having 
trouble managing her money.
I could see that as GC didnt stop lending at this point, Miss S went on to take out a 
further 17 high cost loans for almost another ten months.
I thought that Miss S had lost out because GC continued to provide borrowing from Loan 
6 onwards. These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ss indebtedness by 
allowing her to continue to have expensive credit intended for short term use over an 
extended period of time. The number of loans, and length of time she'd been borrowing, 
was likely to have had negative implications on Miss Ss ability to access mainstream 
credit and so kept her in the market for these high cost loans. And the fact that all the 
loans were repaid didnt mean that they were repaid sustainably, or without causing Miss 
S undue difficulty.
After Miss S repaid Loan 23, there was a gap of almost nine months before shed 
asked to borrow again. I thought that gap was, on balance, long enough to give GC 
some confidence that Miss S had overcome whatever problems had caused her to 
borrow in the past. So, I thought GC was entitled to treat Miss S as a new customer 
when she asked for Loan 24 and base its checks accordingly.
Miss S needed to make a highest total monthly loan repayment of around £157 to GC for 
Loans 24 to 28. I thought the repayments on these loans were relatively moderate 
compared to Miss Ss disposable income (as adjusted by GC). So, I thought that the 
checks GC did before agreeing Loans 24 to 28 were proportionate. Given Miss Ss 
repayment amounts, what was apparent about her circumstances at the time, and her 
borrowing history with the lender, I didnt think it wouldve been proportionate for GC to 
have asked her for the amount of information that would have been needed to show 
Loans 24 to 28 were unsustainable before agreeing these loans. So, I didnt think GC was 
wrong to give      Loans 24 to 28 to Miss S.Miss S took out Loan 29 three days after repaying Loan 28. The loan amount had 
increased to £450 and her highest monthly loan repayment was around £191. This was 
more than shed been repaying on Loans 24 and 25 together and more than the total 
monthly repayments for Loans 26 to 28. Loan 29 was Miss Ss sixth loan in less than four 
months, I thought that GC should have been concerned that Miss S might have been 
reliant on its lending and that she was taking six month instalment loans and effectively 
treating them as one month payday loans. She had repaid each of Loans 24 to 28 far 
earlier than planned and in the case of Loan 29 she was borrowing a far higher amount 
very shortly after repaying Loans 26 to 28. So, I didnt think it was reasonable for GC to 
base its assessment before Loan 29 on the information provided by Miss S without taking 
steps to independently check what shed declared. As far as I could see GC didnt do this.
Although I didnt think the checks GC did before agreeing Loan 29 were sufficient, that in 
itself didnt mean that Miss Ss complaint should succeed. I also needed to be 
persuaded that what I considered to be proportionate checks would have shown GC that 
Miss S couldnt sustainably afford the loan.
So, Id looked at Miss Ss bank statements and credit report, to see what better checks 
would have shown GC. And having done so, I didnt think better checks would have 
clearly shown GC that Miss S was facing significant problems managing her money. 
So, I didnt conclude that GC was wrong to give this loan to Miss S.
But looking at the overall pattern of GCs lending history with Miss S I thought by Loan 30 
the point had been reached where the lender should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, GC should have realised that it 
shouldnt provide further loans. This was now Miss Ss seventh loan request in around four 
months. I thought by this time that pattern of frequent borrowing and repaying early should 
have indicated to GC that Miss S was most likely having significant problems managing 
her money.
And Loan 30 was followed very shortly afterwards by two other concurrent loans. The 
amounts Miss S asked to borrow in this second chain were generally no lower than 
before, and she was still borrowing regularly. Id noted there were some short gaps, most 
notably one of around almost five months between Loan 32 being repaid and Miss S 
borrowing again and one of almost five months between Loan 34 being repaid and Loan 
35 having been taken out. But I didnt think those were anywhere near long enough to 
give GC any confidence that Miss Ss finances had returned once again to a more stable 
footing.
Over the following 12 months Miss S often had multiple loans active at the same time and 
continued her pattern of frequent early repayment. I thought that Miss S lost out because 
GC continued to provide borrowing from Loan 30 onwards because these loans had the 
effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ss indebtedness by allowing her to take expensive credit 
intended for short-term use over an extended period of time. The sheer number of loans 
was likely to have had negative implications on Miss Ss ability to access mainstream 
credit and so had kept her in the market for these high-cost loans. The fact that all the 
loans were repaid didnt mean that they were repaid sustainably, or without causing Miss 
S undue difficulty.
I also thought that when a consumer borrowed numerous loans over a long period of time, 
it was most likely that the loans werent being used for their intended purpose of temporary 
cash flow problems. As GC knew, the FCA had made it clear in a letter to CEOs of high 
cost lending firms that a high volume of relending..might be symptomatic of 
unsustainable lending patterns. And I thought that was the case here. Subject to any further representations by Miss S or GC my provisional decision was that 
 I intended to uphold this complaint in part. I intended to order GC to put things right as 
follows. 
 putting things right  what GC needed to do
refund all interest and charges Miss S paid on Loans 4 to 23 and 30 to 38;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse information recorded on Miss Ss credit file with regard 
to Loans 4 and 5;
remove any information about Loans 6 to 23 and 30 to 38 from Miss Ss credit file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires GC to take off tax from this interest. GC must give Miss 
S a certificate showing how much tax it had taken off if she asks for one.
Miss S responded to my provisional decision to say that she was happy with it.
GC hasnt provided a response to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Given that Miss S and GC have given me nothing further to consider, I see no reason to 
depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. It follows that I uphold part 
of the complaint and require GC to take the steps and pay Miss S some compensation as 
set out below.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this complaint 
I order Gain Credit, trading as Lending Stream, to pay Miss S compensation and take the 
steps set out below:-
1. Refund all interest and charges Miss S paid on Loans 4 to 23 and 30 to 38;
2. Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from 
the date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
3. Remove any adverse information recorded on Miss Ss credit file with 
regard to Loans 4 and 5; and
4. Remove any information about Loans 6 to 23 and 30 to 38 from Miss Ss credit 
file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires GC to take off tax from this interest. GC must give  
Miss S a certificate showing how much tax it had taken off if she asks for one.
.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 December 2020.
