The complaint
Mr A complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
FCE Bank plc, trading as Ford Credit, wasnt of satisfactory quality. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mr A under a hire purchase agreement with Ford Credit 
that he signed in December 2018;
Ford Credit, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory quality will 
depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the car and the 
price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr A was a new car and I consider that it was 
reasonable for him to expect that it would be free from even minor defects;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mr A says that the engine management warning light came on within a few months of 
the car being supplied to him and since then hes had problems with the cars diesel 
particulate filter and he says that the car has broken down many times;
Ford Credit has provided evidence from the dealer to show that the car was returned 
to it at least three times between April and June 2019 because Mr A says that the 
engine management warning light was on  and it says that each time the light 
wasnt displaying when investigated, no fault codes were stored and it was unable to 
find anything wrong with the car;
the dealer says that it changed the cars diesel particulate filter in August 2019 
because a manual regeneration wouldnt be able to clear it but Mr A has continued to 
complain about the engine management warning light coming on but no fault with the 
car has been found;
Mr A says that the car isnt safe to drive so hes parked it outside his house and has 
stopped making payments to Ford Credit  hes provided photos which show the 
engine management warning light on but hes not provided any other evidence, such 
as an engineers report, to show that theres a fault with the car;
I sympathise with Mr A for the difficulties that hes had with the car  and the other 
difficulties to which hes referred - but he was able to use the car to drive 9,620 miles 
in the twelve months after the car was supplied to him and Im not persuaded that 
hes provided enough evidence to show that theres a fault with the car or that it 
wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to him; 
its clear that Mr A has had issues with the cars diesel particulate filter but the dealer 
and Ford Credit have provided him with information about how those issues can be 
avoided and Im not persuaded that those issues are enough to cause the car not to 
have been of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr A;
Mr A has stopped making payments to Ford Credit so is in breach of the terms of the 
hire purchase agreement  I suggest that he contacts it to try to agree an affordable 
repayment plan for the arrears on his account  and if hes suffering financial 
difficulties its required to respond to those difficulties positively and sympathetically; 
and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Ford Credit to allow Mr A to reject the car, to pay him any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 December 2020.
