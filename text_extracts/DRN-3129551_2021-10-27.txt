The complaint
 Mr H complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) mismanaged his balance transfer.
What happened
 In December 2019, Mr H applied for a balance transfer of £7,000 on his HSBC credit card. 
This was agreed. In January 2020, HSBC sent two payments of £7,000 to his other bank 
credit card account (Bank A). One debit of £7,000 was made to his HSBC card account. A 
balance transfer fee of £203 was paid. In April 2020, HSBC wrote to Mr H and asked him for 
his costs. In July 2020, HSBC asked Bank A for two payments of £7,000 to be returned. 
Bank A returned two payments of £7,000. Bank As debt was then £14,001 against a limit of 
£11,550. In August 2021, HSBC returned one payment of £7,000 to Bank A.
Mr H complained. HSBCs error meant he was borrowing more than £14,000 at Bank A. He 
went over his limit. He incurred additional interest and fees with Bank A. Bank A also 
advised the wrong information to credit reference agencies, causing his credit rating to go 
down. He came under pressure because of the increased payments he had to make to Bank 
A. And he missed out on investment opportunities  because he didnt have the cash 
available. He wants compensation for the errors made by HSBC, a refund of all the 
additional interest and fees paid to Bank A, and his credit file amending. He also wants 
reimbursement for the missed investment opportunities.
HSBC admitted that they made an error in processing Mr Hs balance transfer request. This 
was due to a system error. They said theyd ensure he wouldnt suffer any financial loss and 
asked him to contact them with his claim.
Mr H brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said HSBC hadnt acted fairly. Theyd 
admitted their mistake and offered to pay Mr Hs costs. But he hadnt let them know what 
they were. At the time of the investigators view (November 2020), HSBC still needed to 
return one amount of £7,000 to Bank A.
Mr H asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
I reached a provisional decision where I said:
So I can be clear about what happened here  this is the sequence of events:
In December 2019, Mr H requested a balance transfer of £7,000 from his HSBC 
credit card, to go to Bank A. In January 2020, this was sent to Bank A and a balance 
transfer fee of £203 was paid. HSBC, due to a systems error, then sent another 
payment of £7,000 to Bank A on the following day. Only one debit of £7,000 was 
made to Mr Hs HSBC card account  so he wasnt disadvantaged by paying more 
interest to HSBC.
In April 2020, HSBC realised their error and wrote to Mr H, asking him for his costs. 
Mr H didnt reply  he told us he didnt get the letter.
In July 2020, HSBC asked Bank A for the return of two amounts of £7,000 (not one 
amount of £7,000 as was needed). Ive seen evidence of this in HSBCs records  
and in those of Bank A. So - Bank A returned two amounts of £7,000  so £14,000. 
This caused Mr H to go over his limit with Bank A and pay additional interest. Mr A 
spend a long time trying to resolve the problem with Bank A. Ive seen that in August 
2020, Mr Hs balance at Bank A was £14,001 debit against a limit of ££11,550.
Bank A reported the position on Mr As account to credit reference agencies.
In October 2020, Ive seen internal notes in HSBC which said that they should have 
processed the return of £7,000 at that time.
But  for reasons I havent seen, the £7,000 wasnt returned to Bank A until August 
2021. This meant that the problem of Mr Hs borrowing with Bank A was outstanding 
for 13 months.
Ive seen that HSBC  in their final response in October 2020 - asked Mr H for his costs of 
their error  by he didnt provide them. Instead, he brought his complaint to us to look at  
which he was entitled to do.
HSBC admitted their first error in sending two amounts of £7,000 to Bank A in January 2020. 
And they acknowledged this in their final response. But  HSBC made this worse by firstly  
requesting the return of two amounts of £7,000 in July 2020 (not one). Ive seen that in 
HSBCs notes dated 5 October 2020 say further email also to ensure the additional 
£7,000 claimed back is returned to (Bank A). Ive also seen evidence in Bank As records 
that HSBC asked for two payments of £7,000 to be returned. And  thats what Bank A did.
And then  in October 2020  even though HSBCs internal notes show that they were then 
to send back £7,000 to Bank A, only in August 2021 was it returned. Its not clear why there 
was such a long delay. But  it wasnt reasonable for Mr H to wait so long.
So  HSBC were at fault on three occasions in January 2020, July 2020 and October 2020. 
This impacted Mr H considerably. He has suffered a lot of stress and inconvenience in trying 
to sort things out with both HSBC and Bank A. Hes had to pay more interest and fees at 
Bank A as hes been borrowing £7,000 more than he needed to and gone over his limit. He 
also paid a balance transfer fee of £203 to HSBC  and the balance transfer went wrong.
Mr H also brought to us another complaint about HSBC  that he was turned down for an 
overdraft of £250 due to the reporting of the high balance on his credit card with Bank A. We 
have upheld that - and the redress included here reflects that also.
Mr H argues that hes missed investment opportunities  because he didnt have the cash or 
credit available for that. He hasnt quantified those  but I have to say that this is something 
that this service wont look to compensate Mr H for  as we would not consider these to be a 
direct consequence of what happened.
So  I believe that Mr H should be compensated by HSBC for what happened as follows:
HSBC should refund the initial balance transfer fee of £203.
Mr Hs balance was £7,000 more than it shouldve been at Bank A. So - HSBC 
should pay to Mr H the additional interest he paid to Bank A.. Ive calculated this as 
£7,000 for 13 months (between July 2020 and August 2021) at Bank As interest 
rate of 29.4% APR. This is £2,229.51.I havent seen that Mr H paid any fees to Bank A  such as over-limit fees. But if he 
has, he should quantify these and show us copies of the statements which show 
them.
Mr H has paid these sums of money to Bank A and HSBC and has been out of 
pocket  so he should also get the benefit of 8% per annum simple on the amounts 
from when they were paid to the date of refund.
Mr H spent a lot of time on the phone and in correspondence  particularly with Bank 
A  trying to sort things out. This went on for over a year  and it was only in August 
2021 when the final amount of £7,000 was refunded to Mr Hs account at Bank A. 
He was turned down for an overdraft of £250 at HSBC as a result of what 
happened. So  he should be compensated with an award of £1,000 for all of this. 
This is in line with what this service would expect to see  where there were 
repeated errors, and delays in putting things right.
Mr Hs credit file has been affected. Bank A advised that Mr H was borrowing a 
higher amount then they should have. Mr H showed us evidence that this affected 
his credit rating. This was due to HSBCs error  and so they must liaise with Bank 
A to ensure that Bank A corrects this.
Responses to the provisional decision:
HSBC accepted the findings. So did Mr H. But he queried the amount of interest to be 
refunded - as hed borrowed in excess of his limit with Bank A. And he made the point that 
he didnt ask for compensation from HSBC because he chose to bring his complaint to us 
instead.
So  I now need to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Ive considered the point that Mr H had made regarding the interest refund. I checked the 
interest rate he paid with Bank A  who told us that he paid the same rate for all of his 
borrowing with them, even though he was over his limit of £7,000. And  Ive said that he 
should also receive interest at 8% per annum simple on the refund of interest. So that should 
amount to an adequate payment to him. Because of the difficulty in working out the actual 
interest that Mr H has actually paid (as opposed to what was debited to Bank As account), I 
think that the simplest way is for HSBC to pay 8% per annum simple on the interest refund 
for the 13 months that the excess balance was outstanding. Ive referred to that in the 
section below.
Mr H hasnt come forward with any fees that he had to pay to Bank A  so that redress isnt 
needed.
Other than those points, and as HSBC accepted the findings, I wont be departing from the 
provisional decision.
(continued)
My final decisionI uphold this complaint.  And HSBC UK Bank Plc must: 
Refund the balance transfer fee of £203.
HSBC should pay to Mr H the additional interest he paid to Bank A. Ive calculated this 
as £2,229.51. HSBC will need to check the contractual rate with Bank A.
Pay interest at 8% per annum simple on the amount of refunds due. On both refunds, 
pay 8% per annum simple  from January 2020 to the date of settlement on the 
balance transfer fee; and from July 2020 to August 2021 on the interest refund. I 
calculate these amounts to be in the order of £31 and £193 respectively.
Pay compensation for distress and inconvenience of £1,000.
Liaise with Bank A to remove any adverse information advised to credit reference 
agencies by Bank A from July 2020 to August 2021. This to include the advice of 
balances that were reported as too high.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 November 2021.
