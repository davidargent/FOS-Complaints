The complaint
Mr T complains that NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibly when it approved credit card applications
for its Aqua and Amazon accounts and later increased the credit limits.
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. I said: 
Mr T applied for an Aqua branded credit card in December 2014. In the application, Mr T 
said he was self employed with an income of £25,000 and a council tenant. NewDay 
carried out a credit search and found four defaults totalling around £10,000 that were 
around 40 months old. NewDay used an unsecured credit figure of £1,400. NewDay 
approved an Aqua credit card with a £450 credit limit.
NewDay went on to increase the credit limit several times. In June 2015 it was increased to
£600, December 2016 £1,300, November 2018 £2,300, April 2019 £3,300 and August 2019
£3,800.
In November 2018 Mr T applied for an Amazon credit card with NewDay and said he was 
employed with an income of £55,000. NewDay didnt ask Mr T about his residential status 
but the application recorded accommodation costs of £100 a month and living costs of £400 
a month. NewDay found unsecured credit of around £20,000 and no adverse information. 
An Amazon credit card with a limit of £500 was approved.
NewDay increased the Amazon credit limit to £1,000 in July 2019 and £2,000 in October 
2019. NewDay says each credit limit increase was approved in line with its lending criteria.
Around the start of 2020 Mr Ts accounts fell into arrears. Both credit cards were closed with 
defaults recorded on Mr Ts credit file a short time later.
In June 2021 Mr T complained that NewDay had lent irresponsibly. NewDay didnt uphold Mr 
Ts complaint and it was referred to this service. An investigator partially upheld Mr Ts 
complaint but NewDay didnt agree it had lent irresponsibly. As a result, Mr Ts complaint
has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say NewDay had to complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Mr T could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable way. 
These affordability checks needed to be focused on the borrowers circumstances. The 
nature of whats considered reasonable and proportionate will vary depending on various 
factors like:
-The amount of credit;
-The total sum repayable and the size of regular repayments;
-The duration of the agreement;
-The costs of the credit; and
-The consumers individual circumstances.
That means theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. But lenders are required to 
consider the above points when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate.
I agree with the investigators view that NewDay lent irresponsibly in this case. But Ive 
reached my view for different reasons so have taken the step of issuing a provisional 
decision.
As our investigator has said, time limits in our rules mean we cant consider the original 
Aqua application from December 2014. Mr T also complains that the credit limit increased 
in June 2015 and as that falls within six years of the date he complained, the investigator 
explained this was an event we could consider. I agree.
In June 2015 NewDay increased the Aqua credit limit from £300 to £600. NewDay didnt 
find any new adverse information on Mr Ts credit file or evidence of further unsecured 
borrowing in his name. The amount of the increase was reasonably modest. NewDay says 
it considered Mr Ts credit file and account history before increasing his credit limit. Im 
satisfied those checks were proportionate to the credit limit increase. I havent found 
evidence of irresponsible lending.
Ive reached a different decision for the following credit limit increases. I think its important 
to note a sharp increase in the level of unsecured borrowing in Mr Ts name from this point. 
Its unclear from NewDays data why, but it didnt find any unsecured credit in Mr Ts name 
prior to March 2016 when it records a figure of about £5,000. But Mr Ts application in April 
2014 only gave a figure of £1,400 for unsecured credit. At the point NewDay increased the 
credit limit to £1,300 in December 2016 (more than doubling the existing credit limit) the 
unsecured debt figure had increased to about £9,000. Thats an increase of about £7,500 
from the original application and around £4,000 from March 2016 (when NewDay first 
started to record this information).
In my view, the sharp uptick in Mr Ts unsecured borrowing figures shouldve caused 
NewDay to consider completing better checks before offering more credit. There were a 
range of options available for completing more comprehensive checks like asking for 
evidence of Mr Ts income and expenditure or obtaining bank statements.
Ive considered what NewDay wouldve found if it had completed better checks. Im satisfied 
NewDay wouldve seen an increasing reliance on unsecured credit to make ends meet and 
that further borrowing couldnt be sustainably repaid by Mr T. Had NewDay carried out 
better checks, I think it wouldve declined to increase the credit limit to £1,300 in December 
2016.
It follows that further credit limit increases wouldnt be affordable to Mr T either. Ive looked 
at whether there was anything in the information available to NewDay that showed his 
circumstances had improved. But I havent found any evidence that Mr T was more able to 
sustainably manage further credit limit increases. By the time NewDay increased the credit 
limit to £2,300 (an increase of £1,000) in November 2018 Mr T owed around £19,500 in 
unsecured debt. That figure increased by a further £1,000 by April 2019 when the credit 
limit was increased to £3,300 and a total of £22,500 in August 2019 when the final credit 
limit was set at £3,800.In my view, it shouldve been clear to NewDay that better checks were needed to ensure 
Mr T could sustainably repay further debt. Had it done so, Im satisfied NewDay wouldnt 
have approved credit limit increases over £600.
Mr T applied for an Amazon credit card in November 2018 and gave a higher income figure 
of £55,000. But I think the application shouldve caused NewDay to ask more questions 
about Mr Ts circumstances. In the same month, NewDay had increased the Aqua credit 
limit by £1,000 to £2,300. And the application itself contained unrealistic figures for Mr Ts 
outgoings. The application doesnt record Mr Ts residential status but says he has 
accommodation costs of £100 a month. Thats unusually low, especially when considered 
against a further living costs figure of £400. In my view, a total outgoings figure of £500 for 
Mr Ts essential outgoings is unreasonably low, especially when taking what NewDay 
already knew about his increasing unsecured credit figure.
Im satisfied the information available to NewDay shouldve caused it to complete more 
comprehensive checks before deciding whether to proceed. In line with the approach Ive 
taken to the Aqua credit card, Im satisfied further checks wouldve found Mr T was unable 
to support further borrowing or sustainably repay it.
The Amazon credit limit was increased to £1,000 in July 2019 and £2,000 in October 
2019. By July 2019 Mr T owed around £22,000, an increase of about £2,000 from the 
application. By October 2019 Mr T owed around £24,500 in unsecured debt.
Again, Im satisfied the pace Mr Ts unsecured credit increased shouldve caused NewDay 
to carry out better checks. Had it done so, Im satisfied it wouldve found credit limit 
increases werent affordable for Mr T and declined to proceed.
I intend to uphold Mr Ts complaint and direct NewDay limited to refund all interest, fees 
and charges applied to his Aqua card from December 2016 onwards. I also intend to tell 
NewDay to refund interest, fees and charges applied to the Amazon credit card from 
inception.
It wouldnt be fair for NewDay to report adverse information where it lent irresponsibly. So I 
also intend to tell NewDay to remove all adverse bout both cards from Mr Ts credit file from 
December 2016 onwards.
I invited both parties to respond with any additional comments they wanted me to take into 
consideration before I made my final decision. Mr T responded to confirm he accepted the 
provisional decision. we didnt hear back from NewDay. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has provided new information for me to consider I see no reason to change 
the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. I still think Mr Ts complaint should be 
upheld for the same reasons. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ts complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to settle as follows:
- Refund all interest, fees and charges applied to the Aqua credit card from December
2016 to date- Refund all interest, fees and charges applied to the Amazon credit card from 
inception to date
- If the above refunds lead to outstanding balances remaining, NewDay should work
with Mr T to arrange a suitable repayment plan. No future interest should be applied
- If the above refunds lead to a credit balance, it should be refunded to Mr T along with
8% interest from the date the overpayment arose to the date of settlement
- Remove all adverse information reported about the Aqua credit card from Mr Ts
credit file from December 2016 onwards
- If the debts have been sold to a third party, NewDay should work with it to ensure the 
above settlement can be put in place. NewDay may need to consider recalling the 
accounts
- Remove all adverse information reported about the Amazon credit card entirely
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 July 2022.
