K821x#15complaint
Mr P complains about the short  term loans he took out with CashEuroNet  UK LLC trading as 
QuickQuid. Mr P says that he was in a circle of loans  that he couldnt get out of. He said 
QuickQuid shouldve noticed that he was dependent on short term credit and not lent to him. 
background
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be partially upheld. QuickQuid disagreed with 
the adjudicators  opinion.  The complaint was then passed to me. 
I issued my provisional decision saying that Mr Ps complaint should be upheld  in part. A 
copy of the background to the complaint  and my provisional findings are attached and form 
part of this final decision. 
QuickQuid and Mr P received my provisional  decision. And no one had anything to add after 
theyd seen it.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
QuickQuid and Mr P didnt raise any new points  after receiving my provisional decision. So 
Ive reached the same  conclusions I reached  before, for the same  reasons.
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
To put things right for Mr P, QuickQuid should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loans 3 to 5; and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ps credit  file about  these loans;
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ps complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 April 2019.

Mr P took out five loans between  September 2015 and July 2017. All of the loans were  due to be 
repaid over three periods.  They had two smaller  repayments  and then a larger one. Some  of the 
information QuickQuid has given us about the loans  is shown in the table below:

QuickQuid has looked at Mr Ps complaint and said that it shouldnt be upheld. It said that it did 
appropriate checks for all of the loans. And these checks showed that the lending was affordable 
based on Mr Ps declared monthly income. It didnt  think that Mr P was dependent on short term 
lending.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ps complaint  and recommended that QuickQuid refund the 
interest and charges that he paid on loans 1, 2 and 5. QuickQuid didnt agree  with this 
recommendation and so the case  has come  to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and 
good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
Having done so, Ive decided  to partially uphold Mr Ps complaint. Having  reviewed the evidence  I 
have available  I think QuickQuid was wrong to have given Mr P loans 3, 4 and 5. Ill explain  why.
One of our adjudicators  looked  at what Mr P and QuickQuid said.  He thought Mr Ps complaint should 
be partially upheld. He thought that it had made proportionate checks for loans  1 to 3. He didnt think  
that QuickQuid  had made proportionate checks for loans 4 and 5. 
But he thought  that QuickQuids checks  showed that loans 1 and 2 werent affordable for Mr P. He 
also thought if had made  proportionate  checks then it wouldnt have approved loan 5. This is because 
he didnt think that Mr P could  afford the repayments,  partly due to the problems  he had repaying  loan 
4. 
He didnt think  that he had enough information  to fairly  say that loans 3 and 4 werent affordable for 
Mr P and that QuickQuid  shouldnt have approved them. 
QuickQuid didnt comment  on our adjudicators findings about the proportionality of its checks  or the 
affordability of the loans,  nor did it provide any new information for me to consider. It responded  to our 
adjudication saying:
In response to FOS assessment which  recommends  QuickQuid uphold loans  which were funded 
after March 2015, we regret to inform you that we cannot  agree to FOS  recommendations.  Please  
note that in QuickQuid's  initial response to FOS we provided detailed information  indicating why the 
loans were responsibly lent to Mr P. Therefore, we kindly ask that you move this case to the 
ombudsman queue for a final decision. 
Ref: DRN47924794QuickQuid first mentioned  this argument in its business  submissions  to us in which  it said:
 We started implementing changes to affordability assessment in June 2014 and all the changes 
were completed by 28 February 2015. Starting 01 March 2015, before Mr P borrowed his first loan, 
QuickQuid had implemented affordability review that is consistent with the FCA Handbook and that 
was in place at the time we received authorisation by the FCA. We confirm that this assessment was 
conducted properly  and individually  for each of these loans. 
It provided further detail about the checks it had made  when it approved  loans from 2015 onwards in 
a document called CEU Lending Criteria and Proportional Checks. All of this information didnt 
change our adjudicators  opinion about the complaint. 
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic argument  directly and through earlier final 
decisions. So I am not going  to expand on this point any further here, though I have considered  it 
alongside everything else in making my decision. 
I would remind QuickQuid at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance in how 
complaints are to be dealt  with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In particular  DISP 
1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively  applied 
in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination  by the Ombudsman to the individuals  in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman  concerning complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals 
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance  produced by the FCA, other relevant regulators and the Financial 
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals  dealing with complaints in the 
respondent. 
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Ps complaint  and what  both parties have said about  this.
The FCA was the regulator  at the time Mr P borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in mind  the rules 
and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit Sourcebook 
(CONC), I would expect a lenders affordability assessment to vary with circumstance. (I am not 
quoting the specific regulations here because, as before, I would expect QuickQuid to be conversant 
with these  through previous  ombudsman decisions, particularly recent decisions, which  set these  out 
in detail.) 
In general, Id expect a lender to require  more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id expect  a 
lender to seek more  assurance by carrying out more detailed checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income; or
-the longer the lending relationship.
Turning to the specifics  of Mr Ps complaint,
QuickQuid says: 
it recorded Mr Ps monthly income  as being  £1,400 for loans 1 to 3 and £1,600 for loans 4 
and 5 
Ref: DRN47924795it recorded his monthly expenditure as £1077 for loan 1, £875 for loans 2 to 4 and £775 for 
loan 5
it validated the information it obtained using credit reference agency data
it used  the information it had gained from the credit  reports to adjust the amounts Mr P had 
provided to calculate  what it called his estimated disposable income  (EDI)  which is shown on 
my table above
were QuickQuids checks proportionate
Our adjudicator said that QuickQuid did proportionate checks for loans 1 to 3. Ive seen  a record of 
the information Mr P provided when he completed his loan applications. Mr P said he had a monthly  
disposable income  of over £300 for loan 1 and over £500 for loans 2 and 3. QuickQuids checks  led to 
it reducing this figure to around £200.  
I think  it was reasonable for QuickQuid to rely on the information it obtained  for these loans.  And Ill 
look at what it shouldve realised from this information  later in my decision.  
I dont think QuickQuid  made  proportionate checks for loans  4 and 5. By this time Mr P had been 
borrowing from QuickQuid  with very little break for around four months.  And the amounts he was 
borrowing were increasing. Mr P struggled to repay loan 4. 
So I think QuickQuid shouldve fully reviewed Mr Ps finances to for these  loans  to check if he could 
sustainably repay them. 
QuickQuid says that it looked at credit reference agency data and thought about this alongside  the 
information Mr P had provided. But its not provided any details about what the credit reference 
agency data showed. Although I havent seen the full details of all QuickQuids credit checks, it has 
provided me with its estimate of Mr Ps disposable  income. This is lower than deducting Mr Ps 
declared expenditure from his declared income for the lending. I dont know exactly how QuickQuid 
calculated Mr Ps EDI  but it has said that credit checks are one relevant  factor.
But because I dont know how QuickQuid actually worked out the EDI, I cant say this reflects  a 
proportionate check. And it doesnt seem to have reviewed his finances in any other way. 
That said I wont expand  further on the checks QuickQuid shouldve  made  here because Mr P has 
been unable to provide  further details about his circumstances. So, Im unable  to say what QuickQuid 
wouldve seen if it had made better checks in any event.
did quick quid  act correctly given the information  it had
For loan 1 Mr P needed  to repay just under £450 over the three repayment periods.  His EDI over the 
same period was just over £550. The last payment of just over £300 was greater than his EDI of 
£185. So Mr P would need to put money aside at the same time he was making the first two 
repayments to be able to afford the last one. 
I think  the repayments were  high in relation to his EDI and there was a good chance that Mr P may 
struggle to repay them. He didnt have much left over to put aside from the first two payments. That 
said, this was his first loan and it wasnt unreasonable for QuickQuid  to assume that Mr P could make 
these repayments over the shorter term given  the information that it had. I think this is a borderline 
lending decision,  but reasonable overall.  
Mr P took loan 2 over six months after he repaid loan 1, so it would  be reasonable for QuickQuid to 
think that his circumstances hadnt  deteriorated.  The loans and his EDI were  very similar, albeit a bit 
higher. Again, I think this is a borderline  lending decision. But given  the gap, and that Mr P repaid loan 
1 without issue, I think QuickQuids decision to approve loan 2 was also reasonable. 
Ref: DRN47924796Mr P repaid loan 2 within a few days. Around a week later he took loan 3 for a similar amount. I think 
this is a sign of financial difficulty and QuickQuid shouldve been aware of this. And Mr P had already 
repaid over £300 to QuickQuid a very short time earlier  and so it was unlikely he would be able to set 
any money aside to make  the final larger repayment without causing  problems. So I dont think  it was 
reasonable for QuickQuid  to have approved loan 3. 
Mr P took loan 4 a short time after making  the final repayment for loan 3. Again  the final repayment 
was larger than QuickQuid  recorded as his EDI. So Mr P would need to set money  aside in the two 
months before this to sustainably make this repayment. But its not now reasonable to assume  he was 
doing this as this was his third loan in around four months. So it seems more likely that the large final 
repayments were leaving Mr P short and he needed to borrow again. I think  QuickQuid shouldve  
realised this and not lent to him. 
And lastly, as all parties  to the complaint are aware, Mr P had significant problems repaying loan 4. 
He took over six months to fully repay it. Its clear  that he was experiencing financial  difficulty  at this 
time. I appreciate there is a gap of around  two months between the end of loan 4 and the start of loan 
5 but I dont  think  this was enough here, given the problems hed had. So I think  QuickQuid  was also 
wrong to approve  loan 5.
