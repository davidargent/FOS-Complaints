K820x#14complaint
Mr B, a director  of S, a limited company, complains that PayPal  Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA 
closed its account  and wanted  him to repay the negative balance left.
background
Mr B told us that one of Ss customers made multiple purchases of gift cards but then 
disputed the transactions and asked his card issuer to action chargebacks. The card issuer 
decided most of the chargebacks in the customers favour and Ss PayPal account was left 
with a negative  balance. PayPal has now closed the account and is asking him to repay  that 
money.
PayPal said it hadnt done anything wrong. It said the transactions in question  werent  
eligible for its Seller Protection so Mr B was liable for the negative  amount on the account.
Our investigator explained to Mr Y that this Service couldnt look into the actions of the card 
issuer. She could only comment on PayPals actions. She looked at PayPals  Seller 
Protection but could see that the sale of gift cards wasnt eligible for this. And because  
PayPal doesnt  have a duty to keep an account open she said she couldnt ask it to reinstate 
the account.
Mr B was unhappy with her opinion. He said he understood that the actioning of 
chargebacks is the responsibility of the card issuer but thought this was a legal fraud  and 
so PayPal should do something. And he didnt think PayPals Seller Protection was relevant. 
He said hed sent sufficient proof that the buyer  was falsely claiming the chargebacks.  And 
he didnt think PayPal  had sent all the relevant information to the credit card company.  So he 
wants this Service to investigate how PayPal managed the disputes.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see how strongly Mr B feels about this so I know he will be disappointed when I say 
that Ive reached  the same conclusion as the investigator for very similar reasons.
PayPals Seller Protection is designed  to protect  sellers against reversed or disputed  
transactions. But as our investigator explained  to Mr B a seller  has to meet its eligibility 
requirements. And under its terms and conditions the sale of gift cards  is specifically 
excluded. So I cant fairly find that it did anything wrong when  it asked for payment  of the 
negative balance on Ss account.
Mr B wants  this Service to look into how PayPal managed the disputes  with the card issuer. 
But thats not something we can do. We can only look at whether PayPal acted in line with 
its terms and conditions  when it reversed the payments after the buyers card issuer  
successfully challenged  the majority of disputed transactions. And as Ive already said I think 
it followed those terms and conditions.
I know Mr B wont agree  with me, particularly in light of the amount of money involved,  but I 
cant see PayPal has done  anything wrong.
