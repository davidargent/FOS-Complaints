The complaint
Mr W has complained that when he attempts to log-in to online banking, the PIN number 
field is pre-populated with an incorrect number. Mr W says this prevents him from being able 
type in the correct PIN number, which has resulted in him being unable to log-in to his 
account using online banking.
Mr W says that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt assist him in resolving the 
issue and says that it has an issue with its servers. Mr W says that branch staff suggested 
he try resetting his PIN number to overcome the issue.
What happened
One of our adjudicators assessed the complaint and they didnt think that NatWest had acted 
unfairly or unreasonably.
Mr W disagreed with the adjudicators assessment, so the matter was referred for an 
ombudsmans decision.
I note that Mr W raised another complaint point with the Financial Ombudsman Service 
about having difficulties paying for items using his NatWest account when shopping online. 
However, that matter did not form part of this complaint, and so Mr W will need to raise his 
concerns with NatWest in the first instance.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered everything, Im unable to say that NatWest is at fault for the issue that Mr 
W has experienced.
NatWest has explained that the difficulties Mr W is experiencing is due to an issue he has 
with his device, rather than there being an issue with NatWests servers.
In short, NatWest says that the issue is likely to be occurring because the device or browser 
that Mr W is using has the AutoFill or AutoComplete function switched on for the NatWest 
online banking log-in screens. This results in Mr Ws device auto populating some of the PIN 
number fields.
NatWest has suggested Mr W delete temporary internet files and cookies on his device. Mr 
W says he tried this, but it didnt work. NatWest also suggested he try logging-on through a 
different device or browser.
Overall, Im reasonably satisfied that what NatWest is saying is correct, and that the issue 
Mr W is experiencing is due to issues with the settings on his device or browser, rather than 
there being an issue with NatWests servers. 
I say this because I understand NatWests log-in procedure requires the account holder to 
provide three random characters of the PIN number. But it would undermine the purpose of 
asking for such information if NatWests own systems prepopulated the requested 
information for the account holder. Indeed, what Mr W has explained does sound very much 
like an issue that concerns the settings on his device, or at least the settings of the browser 
he is using. 
Im also mindful that different devices and different software will store such information in 
different places. So, I dont think NatWest could reasonably have been expected to provide 
very detailed IT support for Mr W, if he had cleared his cookies and internet files, but the 
AutoFill or AutoComplete function was still pre-populating the PIN number field.
I understand that Mr W was told in branch that resetting his PIN number may help resolve 
the issue. If Mr W wants to try that, he will need to contact NatWest directly to see if that 
might help.   
Overall, I do appreciate that it is hugely frustrating and inconvenient when you are unable to 
access your bank account online. And I can see this creates added difficulties for Mr W 
specifically, given what he has said about his circumstances. But I cant reasonably hold 
NatWest responsible for a technical issue which is in all likelihood caused by the settings on 
the device Mr W is using to log-in with. And I think NatWest has taken reasonable steps to 
try and help Mr W resolve the difficulties he is experiencing with his device.
My final decision
Because of the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 April 2023.
