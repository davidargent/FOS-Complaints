The complaint
Mr M complains about the amount that hes been charged by Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited for damage to a car that he returned to it when he voluntarily terminated 
his hire purchase agreement.
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a nearly new car was supplied to Mr M under a hire purchase agreement with 
Mercedes-Benz Financial Services in April 2016;
he agreed that he would maintain the car in a condition which was consistent with 
Mercedes-Benz Financial Services vehicle return standards and that:
 if the vehicle is not in good condition, repair and working order when it is 
returned to us, or if any additions, alterations or replacements have been 
made which we reasonably consider affect the value of the vehicle, then you 
have to compensate us for any loss that we suffer. In such circumstances, we 
will obtain estimates of the costs of any works or repair or replacement which 
we reasonably consider are necessary to restore the vehicle to the 
appropriate condition, we will then be entitled to choose whether to carry out 
some or all of these works. In which case the actual costs which we will incur 
will be immediately payable by you. If there are any works which we do not 
carry out, you will instead be liable to pay us the estimated cost of those 
works as agreed compensation for the consequent reduction in the sale value 
of the vehicle;
Mr M voluntarily terminated the agreement in January 2019 but the car wasnt 
collected from him until February 2019 when a third party, on behalf of Mercedes-
Benz Financial Services, collected and inspected the car;
the inspection report identified damage to the car with an estimated total repair value 
of £2,370.58 but Mercedes-Benz Financial Services charged Mr M £2,345.58 and 
then agreed to remove charges totalling £1,183.50 and to reduce the remaining 
charges by £300 because of the failed and late collection of the car  so the 
outstanding amount due from Mr M was £862.08;
Mr M accepts that the cars door, rear bumper and wheel were damaged when he 
returned the car but he says that the charges being applied are unfair and 
unrepresentative of the true costs to repair the car or the impact to the cars value;
he also says that the damage was repaired at a cost of about £300, that the charges 
dont take account of the cars lower mileage and that he didnt receive a maturity 
pack before he returned the car;
the third party identified the damage and the estimated repair value and I consider 
that it was fair and reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Financial Services to use those 
costs when it charged Mr M for the damage  its clear from the inspection report that 
there was considerable damage to the car and Im not persuaded that those charges 
were unfair or unrepresentative of the repair costs;
I dont consider it to be likely than a maturity pack was sent to Mr M as he voluntarily 
terminated the agreement before it matured  but he signed a voluntary termination 
confirmation in January 2019 in which he confirmed that he understood that he would 
be liable for any damage charges after inspection of the car and he chose to return 
the car knowing that it was damaged without having that damage repaired; 
Mr M had agreed to make 36 monthly payments of £171.69 for the car to be supplied 
to him and the allowed distance was 15,000 miles each year above which excess 
mileage charges would be applicable  but theres no provision for him to receive a 
refund of his payments (or a reduction in any additional charges) if he drove the car 
for less than 15,000 miles each year;
Mercedes-Benz Financial Services has accepted that Mr M was caused distress and 
inconvenience by the failed collection and then the late collection of the car and it has 
reduced the charges by £300 to £862.08 because of that distress and inconvenience;
Mr M returned the car in a condition that wasnt consistent with Mercedes-Benz 
Financial Services vehicle return standards and I consider that it was fair and 
reasonable for it to charge the amounts that had been recommended by the third 
party for that damage  so I consider that its response to his complaint was fair and 
reasonable; and
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require Mercedes-Benz Financial Services to further reduce the amount that its 
charged Mr M for the damage to the car, to pay him any other compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 November 2020.
