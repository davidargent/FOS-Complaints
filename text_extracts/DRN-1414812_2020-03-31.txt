The complaint
Mr F says Barclays Bank UK PLC mis-sold him a payment protection insurance (PPI) 
policy. 
What happened
Mr F bought the policy in 1996 sometime after he took out a credit card. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Mr F disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, so 
the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr Fs case.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Fs complaint for the following reasons.
The sale was a long time ago, so its understandable that neither Barclays nor Mr F have 
complete records from the time of sale. This means theres not enough evidence for me to 
conclude that Barclays didnt make Mr F aware that he had a choice about buying the PPI, 
or that he didnt choose to take it. 
Barclays recommended the PPI to Mr F, and it seems to have been right for him based on 
what Ive seen of his circumstances at the time. 
Its possible the information Barclays gave Mr F about the PPI wasnt as clear as it shouldve 
been. But Mr F doesnt appear to have been affected by any of the main things the policy 
didnt cover  and based on what I know about his circumstances it looks like the policy 
couldve been useful to him. So, I dont think better information wouldve stopped him buying 
it. 
Ive taken into account Mr Fs comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2020.
