The complaint
Mr B complains that his recurring payments were incorrectly processed by PayPal Europe 
Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal).
What happened
Mr B had a PayPal account. In March 2020, he added a credit account with a limit of £2,500. 
He then noticed that his recurring payments were being debited to the credit account, not his 
debit card as before. His statements between April 2020 and December 2020 showed 
recurring payments debited to the credit account.
Mr B complained that he wanted recurring payments to be made from his debit card  as 
before, not his PayPal credit account. As a result, hed paid interest. He had changed the 
settings, but this didnt work. He said that PayPals instructions to him didnt work - and their 
customer service was poor.
PayPal said that until Mr B added a credit account, he only had one funding source on his 
PayPal account  his debit card. After the credit account was added, he had to choose a 
funding source for payments. When Mr B contacted PayPal in April 2020, they gave him 
instructions on how to change the priorities of funding sources  and these had to be 
changed merchant by merchant. They offered compensation of £100 in view of Mr Bs 
comments about the service theyd provided to resolve his problem.
Mr B brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator said that she thought PayPal had 
acted fairly. Shed looked at what theyd told Mr B in April 2020 and in June 2020  when he 
was given the steps needed to make the changes. PayPal had also offered to make the 
changes for him, but Mr B hadnt responded.  She noted that some recurring payments had 
been changed so that they were debited to the PayPal balance, but others remained as 
being paid from the credit account. And so  where there wasnt a preferred source chosen, 
PayPals hierarchy would apply  and this meant that if there werent enough funds in Mr Bs 
PayPal account, then the credit account would be used. This was in PayPals User 
Agreement. She thought that PayPal had acted reasonably - and their offer of £100 was due 
to the frustrating experience Mr B had.
Mr B asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr B has complained that some of his recurring payments  for example, to subscription 
services  were being paid from his new PayPal credit account. Before he opened it, they 
were debited to his debit card. He says that he tried to make changes to this online with 
PayPal, but they didnt work. And  the service provided by them was poor.
It appears that what happened here is that when Mr B opened his credit account, this 
affected his arrangements with PayPal. Their User Agreement sets out the order of 
payments as it says: 
Funding Your Payment - Selecting a preferred funding source - You may select a preferred 
funding source when logged into your account. Subject to this user agreement, the preferred 
funding source will be used as the default funding source for payments you send from your 
account.
You can set separate preferred funding sources for some billing agreement payments.
Funding payments you send from your account - We will obtain electronic money for the 
payment you send from your account from the following sources in the following order to the 
extent they are available:
Special Funding Arrangements (if available for the given transaction)
Preferred funding source (if selected and available)
Pre-existing PayPal balance
Bank account (instant transfer via bank mandate)
PayPal Credit (where available)
PayPal-branded debit card (where available)
PayPal-branded credit card (where available)
Debit card
So  if no priority is selected as a preferred funding source, then PayPal will firstly try to use 
Mr Bs PayPal balance, and if funds arent available there, then his bank account, then his 
(new) credit account. The debit card option  in place before Mr B opened the credit account 
 came after that. So  when recurring payments were debited from his credit account, 
PayPal were acting in line with their User Agreement. 
I can see that PayPal advised Mr B what to do to change his preferences, step by step  in 
April 2020, and twice in June 2020. In my view, they were clear instructions. And in June 
2020, they offered to make the changes for him. But Mr B didnt respond.
Ive thought about the cost to Mr B of what happened. He had an interest-free deal on his 
new credit account. So  Ive seen that he didnt pay any interest between March 2020 and 
August 2020. He paid interest of £14.88 in September 2020  when the interest free period 
ended. But  PayPal have offered hm compensation of £100 for the frustrations he 
experienced, so this more than covers the interest hes paid.
Mr B has told us that his device didnt allow him to make the changes to his PayPal 
accounts, but he also told us that hes tech-savvy. So, on balance, I think he couldve 
followed the instructions given to him by PayPal. 
I can appreciate that this has been a frustrating experience for Mr B. But having looked at 
what happened here, I think that PayPal acted fairly and reasonably  and I wont be asking them to do anymore. PayPals offer of compensation still stands, so if Mr B wants to accept 
this, he should get in touch with PayPal to arrange for it to be paid.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 May 2021.
