K820x#14complaint
Ms B has complained about  the outstanding  balance  on a secured loan account with 
Blemain Finance Limited.
background
Ms B had a loan with Blemain that was secured on her home as a second charge. The 
property was repossessed in 2012.  Ms B believed the sale proceeds were  sufficient to 
discharge the full balance  owed to Blemain. Ms B is at a loss to understand why Blemain still 
claims there  was a balance due.
An adjudicator looked at the complaint. She explained to Ms B that we could  only look at 
what had happened  on the account after 1 April 2014; before that date the loan wasnt one 
we were able to consider under our rules.
The adjudicator noted that Blemain had refunded fees and interest in July 2016 totalling 
£522.79. This was following a review  of historic accounts. But she didnt think  Blemain  had 
done anything  wrong in the way it had handled  the account since 1 April 2014.
Ms B didnt agree. She said she couldnt understand why there was a credit on the account  
and a debit balance.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As the adjudicator explained,  were  unable to investigate any issues  that took place before 
1 April 2014. But I see from the account history  that when the property was sold in April 2013 
Blemain received a total of £36,627.72 from the proceeds of sale, when the balance  was 
£39,125.95. This left a shortfall amount of £2,497.23. After the refund of £522.79 in 2016  the 
balance stood at £1,994.92.
This appears  to be an accurate account. We can provide Ms B with a copy of the account 
history, if shed like us to, as this shows the full account history. But I must reiterate that 
anything that happened on the account before 1 April 2014 is outside our jurisdiction.
The fee refund in 2016 was made after Blemain reviewed accounts  to ensure regulatory 
compliance. Having  done this, Blemain  refunded  fees back  to the account. There is nothing  
untoward about this, nor is it indicative of any wrongdoing on the part of Blemain. 
I can understand that it was a shock for Ms B to learn there  was still an outstanding balance  
on the account. But Im satisfied that Blemain is owed the outstanding amount. No interest  or 
fees have been added  to the account  since April 2013, so the balance owed is not 
increasing.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
 
Ref: DRN69075792Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 April 2019.
