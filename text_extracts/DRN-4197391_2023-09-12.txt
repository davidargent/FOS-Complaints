DRN-4197391
The complaint
Miss B complains about how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) handled a fraud 
claim.
What happened
In July 2022, Miss B was selling a drone through an online marketplace. She was contacted 
by someone interested in purchasing the drone and they agreed on a sale price of £950. 
The buyer sent the funds to Miss Bs PayPal account and gave Miss B a shipping address to 
send the drone to. The buyer asked Miss B to send the drone to her son. Miss B posted the 
drone with tracked delivery and after receiving it, the buyer raised a dispute with PayPal 
claiming that shed purchased a hot tub from Miss B which hadnt been received.
PayPal asked Miss B for evidence relating to the sale. Miss B provided screen shots of the 
messages between her and the buyer and proof of delivery. PayPal considered the evidence 
and closed the case in the buyers favour, debiting Miss Bs PayPal account.
Miss B raised a complaint with PayPal, but they declined to return the funds to her saying 
the transaction wasnt covered by the Sellers Protection Policy as the drone was shipped to 
a different address than the one registered to the buyers account. A £12 fee was added to 
Miss Bs account in relation to the dispute.
Miss B wasnt happy with PayPals response, so she brought a complaint to our service.
Following the complaint coming to our service, PayPal agreed to write off the balance owed 
on Miss Bs account. 
An investigator put this offer to Miss B in resolution of her complaint, but she asked that 
PayPal pay compensation for the distress she experienced.
 
Having reviewed her case, the investigator recommended that PayPal pay Miss B £200 for 
the distress and inconvenience she was caused. The investigator highlighted that PayPal 
had chased Miss B for the repayment of the balance owed on her account despite knowing 
the claim was being disputed, and the length of time her PayPal account had been 
suspended for. 
Miss B accepted the investigators recommendation, however PayPal disagreed. 
PayPal said the claim against Miss B was opened on 24 July and they made their decision 
not to uphold it the next day. They felt they had reached the correct decision as she wasnt 
entitled to a refund under their Seller Protection Policy.
As the case couldnt be resolved, it was passed to me to review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As PayPal have already refunded Miss B for the funds she lost in relation to the sale of the 
drone and the dispute fee they charged her  I dont need to reach a decision on that part of 
her complaint. PayPal have done what I wouldve recommended if I agreed that Miss B had 
been the victim of a scam and that PayPal should be held liable for her loss.
So, Ive focused my decision on whether Miss B is entitled to compensation for distress and 
inconvenience caused by PayPals actions.
Miss B has told us about the worry she experienced due to the loss of £950 and the impact it 
would have on her financially if she had ended up without the drone and without the money. 
Shes also talked about having multiple conversations with different PayPal advisors and 
being requested to provide the same information on more than one occasion. 
From what Ive seen, PayPal continued to chase Miss B for the outstanding balance on her 
account, despite her having brought a complaint to our service. I think it wouldve been fairer 
for PayPal to wait for us to complete an investigation. Especially due to the amount of money 
that was involved in this case and the evidence that Miss B had provided which directly 
contradicted what the buyer had told PayPal. Also, I think PayPal couldve provided a better 
level of service by not repeatedly asking Miss B for the same information through different 
advisors.
But Im conscious that a lot of Miss Bs distress was caused by the fraudster who carried out 
the scam and I cant hold PayPal responsible for the impact of the fraudsters actions. 
Having considered everything very carefully, I think PayPal shouldve provided a better level 
of service to Miss B and have added to the distress she experienced unnecessarily. On that 
basis, Im satisfied that the £200 compensation awarded by the investigator is fair in the 
circumstances of this case.
Putting things right
To put things right PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA should pay Miss B £200 compensation.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and 
require them to compensate Miss B as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 October 2023.
