The complaint
Mr and Mrs G have a mortgage with Mars Capital Finance Limited and are unhappy with
how it has treated them.
Most of our  and Mars  contact has been with Mr G. For that reason Ill mainly refer just 
refer to him in this decision, but that should be taken to include Mrs G where appropriate.
What happened
Mr and Mrs Gs issues with Mars go back many years and theyve set out their account of 
events in considerable detail. 
I trust they wont take it as a discourtesy that Ive condensed their complaint in the way that 
I have. Ive done that because the details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so 
there is no need to repeat them again here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Although Ive read and considered the whole file, Ill keep my comments to what I think is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point, its not because Ive not considered it but 
because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach the right outcome. 
Any points I do comment on I wont be answering in as much detail as Mr and Mrs G have 
given us. Again, no discourtesy is intended by that, this service is impartial between, and 
independent from, consumers and businesses. What this means is that we dont represent 
either party, and I dont act under eithers instructions or take directions on how a complaint 
will be looked at. If I dont think I need to comment on a point in as much detail to reach the 
right outcome, then I wont do so.
Before I go any further, I think it is important to explain that were not the regulator and its 
not within my remit to tell a business what it should do in general terms, and it isnt my role to 
reprimand or sanction a business. 
We look at each complaint individually and if we think a business has already done enough 
to put things right then we wont necessarily go into the details of what went wrong. Were 
not about recriminations and attributing blame, especially in cases where the business has 
already admitted its mistakes. In this decision Im deciding if there are any other things I 
think Mars did wrong that it hasnt already accepted, and what needs to be done  if 
anything  to put things right.
I wont mention compensation in the main body of my findings, instead Ill leave that and deal 
with it at the end. Instead, in the main body, Ill concentrate on any financial losses and/or 
other things  if any  that need to be addressed to put things right.
Ive broken Mr and Mrs Gs complaint down into some broad areas. To be clear the 
complaint points Ive considered for this decision, even though I dont list all the points 
individually, are those contained within the following final response letters:
4 July 2018
1 August 2018
12 February 2019
8 May 2019
5 June 2019
5 July 2019
29 August 2019
Ive also considered the letter dated 15 August 2019 which set out Mars offer to settle the 
complaints.
I wont be considering anything that has happened outside of the letters Ive listed above, 
such as issues that happened once the complaint was with us.
Field agent
Due to a complaint from Mr G in 2014 Mars placed a note on the mortgage account to say 
that a field agent shouldnt be instructed. However, in June 2016 a field agent was instructed 
due to a payment shortfall on the mortgage.
Mars has apologised for the upset that had caused Mr and Mrs G and no fee was charged. 
Having considered everything theres nothing further Mars needs to do to put that right as 
there was no cost to Mr and Mrs G, and Mars has already agreed it made a mistake and 
apologised for that.
Which staff members Mr G can deal with, and how
Due to issues that Mr G had raised with some Mars staff members, in a response to a 
complaint on 1 August 2018 Mars said:
To ensure you receive a consistent standard of service from staff members who are 
familiar with your account I would recommend that in future you contact your dedicated 
Account Manager [JT] on any queries you have with your account. If [JT] is unavailable 
his Team Leader [NM] will be happy to assist you.
Having considered everything that seems reasonable. Mr G had been unhappy with the 
service hed received from other staff members, so Mars put something in place to try to 
ensure Mr G didnt need to deal with those other staff members.
Mr G has said even after that, on occasions other staff members dealt with him rather than 
just taking a message for JT and/or NM. I can understand Mr Gs confusion as that is 
contrary to how Mars said it would be handling Mr Gs account, but I can also understand 
why other staff members tried to deal with Mr Gs queries if JT and/or NM were unavailable. 
Having considered everything I dont think the other staff members acted inappropriately in 
trying to assist Mr G in those circumstances rather than just taking messages, but I would 
recommend Mars takes that feedback on board in terms of the confusion the mixed 
messaging could cause.
In any event, since then things have moved on and Mars has said:To prevent any further upset or distress being caused, I am advising we are changing 
the way we manage your account. This is to ensure you receive a good service from Mars 
Capital and to ensure there is not excessive amounts of your time being spent in 
contacting us, and to ensure Mars Capitals representatives time is being utilised to the 
fullest. You may still contact us by any method you choose to, however we will not 
engage in a telephone conversation. When you call, the Account Manager will note your 
account with the information that you require and Mars Capital will provide a written 
response within 5 business days to your query/queries. If you would like any of the points 
that you raise to follow our Complaints Procedure, please specify this within your 
communication.
Mr G has explained how difficult and distressing he has found contact with Mars, and I thank 
him for his frankness in explaining how that has impacted him and Mrs G. I must also keep 
in mind that Mars has a responsibility as an employer to its employees, and if it feels contact 
with Mr G is causing its employees distress then it has a responsibility to act on that. Having 
considered everything, I feel Mars decision to only respond to Mr G in writing to be a 
prudent decision for both sides considering the distress that has been caused by the phone 
conversations, and therefore Im satisfied that decision is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances.
It seems likely this will stop many of the issues Mr G has told us and Mars about in that he is 
left distressed with how the phone calls are handled and misinformation he receives in calls. 
The name used by an account manager
There is no regulatory requirement for a Mars employee to use a particular name whilst at 
work. It isnt at all unusual for a woman to continue to use her maiden (or other previous) 
name professionally after marriage, and theres nothing untoward in that. Mars has no duty 
to disclose its staff members personal information  including relationship status  to its 
customers. Ill refer to the staff member in question here as KW.
I understand Mr G is very upset that he was accused of accessing KWs social media 
information; he said he only used Google to find the information about her. Mr G says that 
Mars placed the burden of proof on him to disprove the accusation that hed accessed KWs 
social media which it is impossible for him to do.
It is clear that this issue has caused concern to both sides. Mars said Mr G acted 
inappropriately in searching for  and accessing  KWs personal information online. 
Whereas Mr G said he only searched for her in a list of Mars employees following a call with 
a team leader, and it isnt fair that the burden of proof has been put on him to prove he didnt 
look at KWs social media.
This is a case where I need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Theres no 
way of now proving what Mr G did and didnt look at; as Mr G says, the information that 
returns on a search has changed. Mr G said he looked at one thing, Mars said that wouldnt 
have shown the information Mr G knew. Whilst I can see  and I understand  how upset 
Mr G is about this, theres nothing further for me to do to put things right as all I would do is 
tell Mars to apologise and its already done that.Data Subject Access Request (DSAR)
Mr G is unhappy about some misinformation he was given about DSARs by JT, and he says 
another time Mars failed to fulfil a DSAR obligation.
Mars has accepted that JT provided incorrect information to Mr G in April 2019 and it 
explained the misinformation was corrected by email a few days later. Having considered 
everything theres nothing further Mars needs to do here as the mistake was corrected soon 
after and didnt cause Mr G any financial loss.
I understand some data was omitted from a DSAR, and after Mr G queried that the 
information was sent to him. Mars apologised for that mistake and as the information was 
later sent to Mr G then it seems theres nothing further that Mars needs to do there.
If Mr G has any broader concerns about how Mars has dealt with its data protection 
obligations then thats a matter for the Information Commissioners Office (www.ico.org.uk).
Note on Mr and Mrs Gs account
Its not in dispute that JT put a note on Mr and Mrs Gs account that said:
**WARNING** **CUSTOMER CAN BE DIFFICULT, TAKE CARE**
Its also not in dispute that it was inappropriate for JT to put the note on the account that 
reflected his personal opinion of Mr G. Mars has accepted that and apologised to Mr G. I 
understand Mr G is concerned that other staff members saw the warning and didnt take any 
action to remove it. Mars has apologised for any staff members that saw it and didnt take 
action, and has confirmed the note has been deleted.
If that note remained on the account now I would have ordered Mars to remove it as I agree 
that it was inappropriate for JT to express his personal opinion like that. But as that has 
already been done  and an apology has been made  theres nothing further for me to 
order Mars to do.
Arrears fees
I understand at times Mr G has been given incorrect information about arrears fees, and 
about when the amount of the fee was last reviewed.
I agree in the call between Mr G and a Mars team leader  who Ill call SB  that SB 
shouldnt have speculated on when the fee was last reviewed; that wasnt helpful. SB 
acknowledged that he shouldnt have speculated in that way in the call, and the correct 
information and an apology was later given in the response to the complaint about that.
Having considered everything Im satisfied that is enough as the right information was given 
to Mr G in the response, so theres no further information for me to order Mars to provide him 
with.
As all the misinformation was corrected, and apologies were made theres nothing further for 
me to order Mars to do.Customer service
Ive listened to the calls that I considered relevant to the complaint and it is clear from those 
that this has been a difficult relationship. I wont detail all the calls here, but I can reassure 
both sides that Ive listened to them and taken them into account even if I dont specifically 
mention them. Its not in dispute that some calls could have been handled better, Mars has 
accepted that.
Mr G asked different staff members how long a possession order lasted, as Mars held one 
on his property.
SB said six years, but under certain circumstances they may be longer than that if we make 
an application to the court. The conversation continued with Mr G asking if that meant an 
order was still in force on his property, as it had been obtained in 2011 and it was now 2018. 
SB said there was one in place and Mars had the legal mechanism in certain circumstances 
 such as a mortgage account being in significant arrears  to use it despite it being over the 
six years.
Mr G said he wanted to speak to someone else about it, and so the call was transferred to 
NM.
NM explained the same as SB, in that a possession order lasts for six years, but that a 
lender can apply to the court to still use it after that time frame has ended and it would be up 
to the court to decide.
Mr G said he understood that, but then continued to ask for a yes or no answer as to 
whether there was a possession order in place on his property. As SB and NM had 
explained, whilst the possession order had officially expired it could still be used if a court 
agreed to that. So it wasnt a question that could be answered with a yes or no, without that 
further explanation. As Mr G has highlighted throughout his complaints, it is important hes 
given the correct information and here he was given the correct information. Had SB and NM 
just said yes or no without qualifying that with the extra information, then that could have 
been misleading to Mr G.
I understand that fuller explanation wasnt on Mr Gs statements and instead they just said 
there was a possession order. I cant comment on the format of the statements that were 
issued to Mr G as that is a regulatory matter, but Im satisfied Mr G was told the correct 
position in these phone calls  in that the possession order expired after six years, but could 
still be used, subject to the agreement of the court  so I dont find he was misled such that a 
financial loss was incurred.
In other calls, staff members checked Mr Gs phone number in the middle of the security 
questions. I agree with Mr G that this meant he couldnt tell where security stopped and Mars 
obtaining voluntary information (that is, his phone number) started. Mr G has said that he 
accepts it wasnt done for underhand means, and Mars has accepted it wasnt clear. As 
Mars already had Mr Gs phone number on file, whilst I understand, acknowledge and agree 
with the points Mr G is making, Mars didnt obtain any information here that it didnt already 
have so Mr G hasnt been impacted by this (that is, he hasnt provided information to Mars 
that it didnt already have). I agree the provision and checking of voluntary information  
such as Mr Gs phone number  should come after the security questions have been 
completed, and I understand Mars has already taken that feedback on board.
Mr G has said he believes there was a conflict of interest as when he spoke to one of the 
team leaders about a certain member of staff their tone changed, and hes said the team 
leader was hostile towards him. Mr G thinks the team leader should have identified the conflict of interest and removed himself from the situation. Ive considered this point carefully 
but Im not persuaded by it. Theres no regulatory requirement for staff members working in 
a department like this to have no personal links, and it is up to Mars whether it is satisfied 
there is no detriment  or conflict of interest  caused by this. 
Ive listened to the calls in question, and whilst Mars has accepted they could have been 
handled better, theres nothing I can hear in those conversations that make me think the 
team leader handled the calls that way because of who the staff member in question was. 
That is, Im satisfied, on balance, there was no conflict of interest that meant the team leader 
should have removed himself from the situation.
Mr G said he wanted to check the name of the female staff member as he wanted to ensure 
the complaints team didnt have the complaint incorrectly logged against a different member 
of staff. That seems fair. The team leader confirmed it was the right person and there was 
only one person with that name in the department so the complaint was correctly logged 
against her. That should then have been the end of it as Mr G had received the reassurance 
hed asked for that the correct staff member had been identified. Despite that Mr G carried 
on asking more personal questions such as her marital status and whether she used any 
other names, none of which was relevant as it had been confirmed it was the right person 
which Mr G said was the reason for him querying it.
Having considered everything, I agree those calls could have been handled better, but I 
dont agree that was likely due to a conflict of interest such that the team leader should have 
removed himself from the situation.
Having listened to all the calls I felt were relevant to this complaint, I agree that some calls 
could have been handled better. Mars had already accepted that and apologised, so there is 
nothing further for me to order it to do. We cant change what has gone before and, as I said 
earlier, Mars has now said that it will respond to Mr G in writing, so that should help avoid 
issues like those that have been raised here from happening again.
Fair resolution
Mr G has said he needs to understand how Mars calculated the compensation figure it came 
to. Theres no set calculation for how compensation is worked out. By that I mean theres no 
tariff that says it is, for example, £25 for a poorly handled call etc. I dont know how Mars 
reached the figure it did, but I dont need to. For that reason, I havent asked Mars as Mr G 
thinks we should have. 
All I need to do is decide whether the total compensation figure Mars put forward in its letter 
of 15 August 2019 is more or less than I would award having considered all the issues 
across the final response letters that I listed earlier. If the figure is less than I feel is fair, then 
I need to decide how much extra should be awarded. If the figure is more than I feel is fair, 
then I dont need to set out how much I would have awarded as that would be moot due to 
there already being a higher offer on the table from Mars.
Having considered everything very carefully I can confirm that the total offer of £2,363.66 
(which is a £1,500 ex gratia payment, and the rest being fee reductions) is more than I would 
have awarded had that offer not already been made. For that reason I wont set out details of 
the figure I would have awarded, or how I reached my figure as that all becomes moot due to 
a higher offer already being available.
Mr G has said he needs to believe that Mars will change the way it treats him, and he needs 
to feel that the conduct of Mars staff has been investigated completely and thoroughly.Its not our role to investigate Mars conduct over and above looking at each complaint point 
and deciding if the complaint has been fairly resolved. Having considered each individual 
point Mr and Mrs G have raised - even though I havent noted each point individually in this 
decision - Im satisfied Mars has already done enough to put things right. We cant change 
what has happened, and we cant guarantee that nothing will go wrong in the future. 
Ive a great deal of sympathy for Mr G, and for Mrs G. It is clear things havent been easy for 
them for a number of years, and then Mrs G having to deal with her ill-health on top of that 
must have been very difficult. No amount of money or words from me can change what has 
gone before and/or will ensure nothing goes wrong in the future. It is important that both 
sides now look forward for the remaining term of the relationship, rather than look back with 
recriminations on what has gone before.
Mr G has been very open with us about the effects on him, and on Mrs Gs health, of what 
has been a difficult relationship over the years, and I thank him for being so frank with us. 
Bearing that in mind, and having considered everything, I think Mars decision to only 
respond to Mr G in writing will go a long way in solving the problems as it is clear from 
reading this complaint and listening to the calls, that a lot of the issues come about due to 
phone conversations. By removing that, then I would hope most potential future issues will 
naturally fall away.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint in the sense that I consider that the total offer set out by 
Mars Capital Finance Limited in its letter of 15 August 2019 is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances. I leave it to Mr and Mrs G to contact Mars directly if they now wish to accept 
that offer.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs G to 
accept or reject my decision before 10 May 2021.
