The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc has incorrectly calculated interest on his 
savings account. 
What happened
Mr S has a savings account with NatWest that pays a standard rate of interest and a higher 
bonus rate of interest if no withdrawals are made. 
NatWest says it wrote to account holders to advise that the interest rates payable would be 
reducing from 20 April 2020. 
On 1 April 2020 Mr S savings account received interest payments of £25.40 and £82.56 to 
cover the interest received in March 2020. On 1 May 2020 NatWest made interest payments 
of £16.17 and £44.68. On 1 June 2020 NatWest made interest payments of £1.31 and 
£44.68. 
On 4 June 2020 Mr S paid in £3,400 to his account. On 1 July 2020 NatWest made interest 
payments of £1.30 and £44.11. 
Ms S complained to NatWest as despite the amount he saved increasing the interest 
received had gone down. NatWest responded to Mr S complaint on 29 July 2020 but said 
the interest had been correctly applied after the interest rates it pays reduced. But NatWest 
apologised for providing poor service and paid Mr S £40. 
Mr S referred his complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. They said the 
interest had been correctly applied to Mr S savings account and didnt uphold the complaint. 
Mr S asked to appeal so his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr S is correct when he says that the amount of interest he is receiving has reduced, despite 
the amount he has saved increasing. The reason Mr S has received less is because both the 
standard and bonus interest rates NatWest has in place went down. 
Before 20 April 2020 Mr S received a standard interest rate of 0.2% but that reduced to 
0.01% on 20 April 2020. And before 20 April 2020 Mr S received a bonus interest rate of 
0.65% but that reduced to 0.34% from 20 April 2020. Adding those figures together, Mr S 
account was previously receiving 0.85% interest but that reduced to an overall interest rate 
of 0.35% from 20 April 2020. Given both the interest rates used to calculate what NatWest 
will pay Mr S reduced, the amount of interest being received also went down. 
I understand Mr S is concerned that NatWest has made errors when calculating the interest 
it has paid him. Ive checked the figures NatWest has provided and interest rates it has used. 
I found no errors in the level of interest NatWest has paid Mr S. 
The terms of Mr S savings account say NatWest can reduce the level of interest it pays by 
contacting its customers in advance. Unfortunately, NatWest hasnt been able to provide 
copies of its letters to Mr S setting out the new interest rates. But, on balance, Im satisfied it 
did write to the savings account customers, including Mr S, impacted by the decision to 
reduce the interest rates. Im satisfied NatWest gave reasonable warning of its intentions. 
NatWest has paid Mr S £40 because of poor service he received when he queried the 
interest payments hes received. I can see the situation has been stressful for Mr S and Im 
pleased NatWest has recognised it could have handled his queries better. I think £40 fairly 
reflects the impact of the service NatWest provided on Mr S so Im not telling it to increase 
the award. As Im satisfied NatWest has dealt with Mr S complaint fairly and that it has paid 
the correct amount of interest, Im not telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 November 2020.
