The complaint
Mr W complains that Mitsubishi HC Capital UK plc, trading as Hitachi Capital, wont refund to 
him the money that he and his wife paid for some holiday club membership points. Theyre 
being represented in their complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr W and his wife had an existing holiday club membership and they entered into a 
purchase agreement to buy some more membership points in June 2015. The price of the 
additional points was £4,400 and Mr W entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Hitachi 
Capital for a loan of that amount. He agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £65.58 to 
Hitachi Capital. 
Mr Ws representative made a claim to Hitachi Capital under section 140A of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974 in July 2018. It said that the terms of the agreements were unfair, an 
undisclosed commission was paid by Hitachi Capital to the holiday company and the 
membership was misrepresented to Mr W. It provided a statement from Mr W and his wife 
about the claim.
Hitachi Capital provided a detailed response to the claim and it said that the evidential 
threshold for this type of claim hadnt been met. Mr W wasnt satisfied with its response so a 
complaint was made to this service that: Hitachi Capital paid a commission to the holiday 
company that wasnt declared to Mr W; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr Ws ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured him into entering into the 
agreements and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure him; and the 
membership points were misrepresented to Mr W and his wife; - all rendering the agreement 
unfair pursuant to section 140A.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ws complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that Hitachi Capitals decision to turn down his claim under section 140A was unfair or 
unreasonable. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship 
between Mr W and Hitachi Capital was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would 
reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She also said that she hadnt seen 
anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr W.
Mr Ws representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
Mr W and his wife were sold a product with little or no benefit or value;
non-members regularly holiday at and have easy access to the resorts without 
requiring to purchase a membership or pay annual maintenance fees;
there is little or no secondary market for the membership as it has no intrinsic value;
the membership is in perpetuity with unlimited liability for management charges which 
was concealed at the point of purchase;
Mr W and his were pressurised into entering into an agreement on that day;
the contractual terms relative to maintenance charges were contained within 
voluminous documentation and were neither plain nor intelligible and did not 
accurately describe the liabilities incurred when entering into the contract which 
prevented Mr W and his wife from making an informed decision; and
there was no provision for withdrawal. 
It has also described its concerns about the way in which the finance was sold to Mr W.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ws complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ws claim under 140A as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Hitachi Capitals response to his 
claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Hitachi Capital has described the four purchases of membership points that Mr and 
his wife made from the holiday company between May 1999 and July 2012;
in June 2015 they increased their membership by buying some additional points and 
they signed documents including the purchase agreement, the terms and conditions, 
a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given, a key 
information document, a customer compliance statement, exchange membership 
documents and the loan agreement;
the compliance statement that they signed says: We understand that this document, 
the Purchase Agreement and the documents referred to in it form the entire 
agreement between the parties. We confirm that no oral or written representations 
have been made to us upon which we have relied and which are either not contained 
in the documentation presented to us today or noted by us below in the comments 
box;
the key information document said:  you are acquiring a contractual right to use 
the accommodation detailed in the  Disclosure Booklet; and detailed information 
about the membership was included in that document;
the terms and conditions said: You agree to pay annual Management Charges, 
which are described in Article 13 of the Articles of Association of the European 
Collection and in the Management Agreement. These documents are contained in 
the European Collection Legal Governing Documents. The charges will be calculated 
for future years as described in these documents;
further information about the management charges was included in the key 
information document and the compliance statement said: We understand that we 
must pay an annual management charge ; and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the charges that Mr W and his wife were required to 
pay for the membership points that they bought in June 2015 were unfair;
that statement also included two paragraphs about rentals and resales and said: We 
understand that [the holiday company] operates a Rental Programme ; but it also said:  there is no guarantee that the week will be rented out; and it said: We 
understand that there is currently no resale or buyback programme for our points;
the statement also said: We understand that the purchase of our points is an 
investment in our future holidays, but that it should not be regarded as a property or 
financial investment and that any subsequent resale will depend on market 
conditions;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mr W to have read those documents 
before signing them and, if they didnt include all of the terms that he was expecting 
to be in them, to have discussed those issues with the holiday company and, if the 
terms of the documents werent acceptable to him, not to have signed the 
documents;
Mr W and his wife had been members of the holiday club since May 1999 and the 
holiday company has provided details of the eleven holidays that Mr W and his wife 
took using their membership points between January 2016 and September 2017  
and the additional five reservations that they made but cancelled during that period;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the additional 
membership points that they bought in June 2015 were misrepresented to them or 
that they were induced into entering into the purchase agreement by any 
misrepresentations made by the holiday company;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of any applicable law or regulation for which Hitachi Capital would be liable in these 
circumstances or that the loan was mis-sold to Mr W;
Mr Ws representative says that the holiday company didnt conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr Ws ability to afford the loan - Hitachi Capital says that it searched 
Mr Ws credit record and used it with other information provided on his loan 
application to calculate an overall score which exceeded its minimum lending criteria 
and that there were no indications from the information that it had gathered that he 
would struggle to service the loan agreement;
it says that Mr W told it that his gross annual income was £25,000 - £30,000 at the 
time of the application, which was validated using data obtained from credit reference 
agencies, and that the information that it had gathered showed that there were no 
concerns about lending him £4,400 and that the monthly payments of £65.58 were 
affordable for him;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for Mr W when it was made to him in June 2015;
Mr W says that the holiday company unduly pressured him into entering into the 
agreements and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure him - but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that he and his wife were unduly 
pressured into entering into the purchase agreement, that he was unduly pressured 
into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptable 
sales practices against them;
Mr W and his wife had signed a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that 
could be given and, if theyd been unduly pressured into entering into those 
agreements, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have withdrawn 
from the agreements within the withdrawal periods  but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mr W complained to the holiday company or Hitachi Capital about those 
issues until his representatives letter to Hitachi Capital in July 2018  more than 
three years later;Mr Ws representative says that Hitachi Capital should have told him about any 
commission that it paid to the holiday company for arranging the loan  but Ive not 
been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by 
Hitachi Capital to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Hitachi Capital wouldnt 
have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any 
regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Hitachi 
Capital should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr W risked 
the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Ws relationship with 
Hitachi Capital was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr W and Hitachi Capital in 
these circumstances;
I consider that Hitachi Capitals December 2018 response to Mr Ws claim was fair 
and reasonable and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it 
has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr W about his loan; and
I sympathise with Mr W for the issues that he and his representative have described, 
but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require Hitachi Capital to refund to Mr W any of the money that hes paid under the 
loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2023.
