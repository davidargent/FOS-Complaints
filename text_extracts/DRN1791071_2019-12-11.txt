K821x#15complaint
Mr B says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny, lent to him irresponsibly. 
He says his financial  situation wasnt good and he struggled to repay his short term lending. 
He says Sunny shouldve  noticed this and not lent to him. 
background
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be partially upheld. Sunny disagreed with the 
adjudicators opinion. The complaint was then passed to me. 
I issued my provisional decision saying that Mr Bs complaint should be upheld  in part. A 
copy of the background to the complaint  and my provisional findings are attached and form 
part of this final decision. 
Sunny, and Mr Bs representative received my provisional decision. Sunny agreed with the 
outcome of my decision. Mr Bs representative didnt respond to my provisional  decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Sunny and Mr B didnt  raise any new points after receiving my provisional decision.  So Ive 
reached the same conclusions I reached before, for the same reasons.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 7 to 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from 7 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  7 to 17 should be removed from Mr Bs 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr B a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Bs complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 January 2020.

Ref: DRN17910712extract from my provisional  decision
This complaint is about  17 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr B between September  2016 and 
November 2017. Some of the information  Sunny has provided about  the lending  is in a table at the 
end of this decision.  
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought the business wasnt wrong to approve 
loans 1 to 5. But he thought  Sunny shouldnt  have approved loans 6 to 17.
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It said that Mr B had paid a low amount of interest on 
loans 6, 7, 10, 11 and 12. And he paid no interest at all on loans 8, 13 and 14 as he repaid the loans  
very quickly. It said Mr B had enough  income to repay the loans  and he displayed no financial 
problems. But it did say that it was likely that Mr B was reliant on short  term lending  after loan 15 so it 
offered to pay compensation in respect of loans 16 and 17. 
Mr B didnt accept this offer so the complaint has been passed to me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr B could repay the loans  
in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments  being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an 
indication a consumer  could sustainably  make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically  follow 
this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further.
Ref: DRN17910713Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. Ive provisionally decided  to uphold Mr Bs complaint  in part 
and have explained why below.
Mr B didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion  about loans 1 to 5. Because of this I dont think 
there is any ongoing disagreement about  these  loans. So I wont be making a decision about this 
lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Mr B had with Sunny. So they are something 
I will take into account when  considering  the other loans he took.
By the time Mr B took loan 6 hed had a lending relationship  with Sunny for just under  6 months.  I can 
see he repaid loans 1 and 2 early and there was a break of around a month between  loans 2 and 3. 
But Sunny should still have been concerned that Mr B would be able to repay  the loans sustainably  
and so I think  it shouldve fully reviewed  his finances. 
 
I dont think that Sunny  did this before  approving loan 6 and so I dont think  the checks it made were  
proportionate. But Mr B hasnt  been able to provide any further information  that would allow me to say 
with any degree  of confidence what Sunny  wouldve  seen if it had made better checks. So Im not 
intending to uphold Mr Bs complaint about this loan. 
I havent recreated  individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans  7 to 17 because I dont think  
that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr B, 
with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which  Sunny  should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Bs case, I currently think  that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have  realised  Mr B was not managing  to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr B had taken  out seven instalment loans within  11 months. I can see that on a 
number of occasions  he took out further  loans having recently repaid  a previous one. And he 
was committing  to make  repayments  for a further six months. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr B was having  to borrow  further  to cover the hole 
repaying his previous loans  were  leaving  in his finances and that Mr Bs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr Bs first loan was for £100 and loan 7 was for £500. At this point Sunny ought to have 
known that Mr B was not likely  borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to 
meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 7 onwards  Mr B was provided with a new loan within days  or weeks of settling a 
previous one. And he often had more than one loan running at the same time.
Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 17 was taken  out 
14 months after Mr Bs first. Mr B had paid interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period.  I accept that some of these interest payments were  not large, but this 
doesnt mean that it was right to lend to Mr B in this instance.
I think  that Mr B lost out because  Sunny  continued to provide  borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
potentially expensive credit (even if he did not always pay a large amount of interest for each 
loan) intended for short-term  use over an extended period  of time
the length  of time over which Mr B borrowed  was likely to have had negative  implications on 
Mr Bs ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these  high-cost 
loans. Each loan left a record on his credit file, irrespective of how little interest he paid.
So Im intending to uphold  the complaint about loans  7 to 17 and Sunny should  put things right.
