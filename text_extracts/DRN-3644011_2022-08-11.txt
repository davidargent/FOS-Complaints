The complaint
The estate of Mr M complains PayrNet Limited (trading as Pockit) wont release the funds in 
Mr Ms pre-paid card account, and hasnt communicated as it should about this. The estate 
of Mr M is represented here by Mr Ms mother, Ms M.
  
What happened
Mr M held a Pockit pre-paid card account. For ease, Ill only refer to PayrNet from now on.
Sadly, Mr M passed away in June 2021. Ms M says she contacted PayrNet to tell it she was 
dealing with his affairs and ask it to release the money in his account. Ms M says she sent 
PayrNet a copy of Mr Ms death certificate and a copy of his account card, and it told her 
there was over Â£600 in Mr Ms account. Ms M says PayrNet then ignored her. 
So on 13 September 2021 Ms M emailed PayrNet to complain. In this email exchange, 
PayrNet asked Ms M for Mr Ms death certificate and his reference number. Ms M told it she 
had provided the death certificate and she included Mr Ms account number in her email. 
Ms M emailed PayrNet again about two weeks later to chase things up. PayrNet 
acknowledged this but otherwise seemingly didnt respond.
On behalf of Mr Ms estate, Ms M brought this complaint to our Service. She said this matter 
had distressed her at an already very upsetting time and PayrNet should compensate her for 
this. Over the next few months our Service asked PayrNet for information, but it didnt 
provide the information requested. 
Our Investigator gave his opinion of this complaint based on the information he did have, 
from Ms M. He thought PayrNet hadnt communicated as it should have, and should put 
things right by telling Ms M whether shed provided all the information PayrNet needed to 
release Mr Ms funds  and if PayrNet needed more information, it should explain to Ms M 
what it needed and how to provide it. Our Investigator said that if PayrNet didnt need any 
more information, it should release Mr Ms funds to Ms M.
Ms M thanked our Investigator. PayrNet said it didnt know what documents Pockit would 
accept in the absence of a Will or Grant of Probate, and that it was talking to Pockit about its 
policy and would contact us once it had an update. Despite further prompts from our Service, 
PayrNet didnt respond further. 
As agreement couldnt be reached, this complaint was passed to me for consideration.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id firstly like to say how sorry I am to hear of Mr M passing away, and to give Ms M my 
condolences. I acknowledge this is a very difficult and upsetting time for her. 
Im also sorry to hear this matter has caused Ms M distress. However, I think its helpful for 
me to explain why I cant ask PayrNet to pay compensation to Ms M. Its not disputed that 
the account in question belonged to Mr M, and so it is the estate of Mr M that is the eligible 
complainant here. Ms M can represent the estate of Mr M in this matter, but she is not 
herself an eligible complainant. Therefore I cant award compensation to Ms M herself.
Our Service has asked PayrNet for information several times, but weve not received the 
information asked for. Therefore, my decision is based on the evidence I do have - this is 
Ms Ms testimony and a copy of the email exchange between her and PayrNet which started 
on 13 September 2021.
In this email exchange, I can see PayrNet asked Ms M for Mr Ms death certificate and 
reference number. Ms M then provides Mr Ms account number, and says she has provided 
PayrNet with Mr Ms death certificate. Ms M also told our Service she had provided PayrNet 
with the death certificate. Given Ms Ms consistency on this point, I think its more likely than 
not that Ms M has provided PayrNet with the death certificate. So Im satisfied Ms M has 
provided the information PayrNet asked her for in the September 2021 email exchange. 
But Ive not seen that PayrNet gave a proper response  it only acknowledged Ms Ms 
emails, even after she later emailed PayrNet again to chase things up. Its reasonable to 
think PayrNet should have responded here, to let Ms M know whether it had received the 
information shed provided and what the next steps would be. So Im satisfied PayrNet hasnt 
communicated about Mr Ms account as it should have. 
Putting things right
To put things right, PayrNet should contact Ms M to let her know whether it currently has all 
the information necessary to release Mr Ms funds. If PayrNet needs more information, it 
should clearly explain to Ms M what is needed and how she can send it. But if PayrNet 
doesnt need any further information, then it should release the funds in Mr Ms account, and 
Id expect this to be done without unnecessary delay. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold this complaint. PayrNet Limited should contact Ms M 
to let her know whether it currently has all the information necessary to release Mr Ms 
funds. If PayrNet needs more information, it should clearly explain to Ms M what is needed 
and how she can send it. But if PayrNet doesnt need any further information, then it should 
release the funds in Mr Ms account.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr M 
to accept or reject my decision before 8 September 2022.
