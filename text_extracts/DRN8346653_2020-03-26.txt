K821x#15Complaint
Miss B says Provident  Personal Credit  Limited provided her with multiple loans when it was 
clear she couldnt  afford to repay  them.
Background 
Miss B took 8 home credit  loans between August 2009 and September  2017. Provident  
provided the following information  about  the loans.
loan number start  date loan repaid
1 06/08/2009 £150.00 10/11/2009
2 09/11/2009 £400.00 not settled
3 04/12/2012 £200.00 not settled
4 30/12/2016 £100.00 08/03/2017
5 06/03/2017 £470.00 06/09/2017
6 20/06/2017 £200.00 15/09/2017
7 20/08/2017 £700.00 not settled
8 15/09/2017 £300.00 not settled
Our adjudicator recommended  Miss Bs complaint be upheld from loan 3 onwards. He felt the 
overall pattern  of borrowing  suggested Miss B had become persistently reliant on this form of loan.
Provident agreed with the adjudicators recommendations and said this amounted to writing 
off the outstanding debt of £1,618.80 and deleting the six agreements from the consumers 
credit file. Miss B did not accept this offer. She explained that the lending has had an impact 
on her health and wellbeing.
Provident didnt  propose to offer a further  sum for any distress  and inconvenience  caused. 
This was on the basis that it considered it was writing off £296.58 of unpaid capital as part of 
the resolution already offered.
I issued my provisional decision on 6 March  2020  explaining why I was thinking of awarding 
Miss B £250 for the distress and inconvenience  caused by Provident,  in addition to 
Providents offer to write off the loans.
Provident did not respond to my provisional decision. Miss B responded saying with regards 
to loans 1 and 2, the agent at the time had stolen customers money.
My findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account all the relevant 
rules, guidance  and good industry practice  when considering whether the offer made  by 
Provident is fair and reasonable.  
Provident has accepted it shouldnt have  lent Miss B loans 3-8. Miss Bs concerns centre  
around the offer made by Provident but she has raised an additional point in response to my 
provisional decision about the agent  intercepting consumers money at the time loans 1 and 
2 were running. 
Ref: DRN83466532I can only consider how these actions affected  Miss B and whether they caused  her any 
actual financial loss (as well as the distress  and inconvenience which Ive already 
considered). I dont  have  the power  to make punitive  awards  or punish  a business  that 
would be for the regulator.
I dont think these actions  have caused  Miss B a direct loss. I say this because
The business has recorded loan 1 as being  repaid  so it appears  the repayments  
Miss B made to the agent were correctly applied  to the loan account.
Even, if the agent did intercept Miss Bs repayments for loan 2  leaving the loan 
inaccurately recorded as unsettled  the business has not used the unsettled  amount 
from loan 2 to offset in its calculations  for loans  3-8.
So, I dont think Miss B has suffered an actual financial loss as a result. As Ive said above, I 
dont make awards for punitive  damages, but I have considered the overall impact  of 
Providents actions  on the distress  and inconvenience caused to Miss B below.
The adjudicator didnt uphold Miss Bs complaint that loans 1 and 2 were irresponsibly lent. 
These loans were early  on in the lending relationship and the repayments were not 
excessive in comparison to Miss Bs income.  I appreciate that this might not have been 
reflective of Miss Bs actual financial situation  at the time. But in these circumstances, Im not 
persuaded that Provident did anything wrong  when it provided  these first two loans.
Provident agreed with the adjudicators recommendations to uphold loans 3-8 and has 
confirmed that it will be writing off the balance which includes unpaid  capital. I am not 
persuaded the unpaid  capital is as high as Provident claims but overall,  this does not seem  
an unreasonable resolution  in terms of addressing Miss Bs complaint about irresponsible  
lending in the circumstances of this complaint.
However, Miss B says she has suffered as a result  of the loans. She has health  issues and 
says the lending has impacted on her health. So, I have  considered  whether or not 
Providents actions  have caused  Miss B any trouble and upset and whether it should pay 
Miss B compensation in respect of this.
The original  application  forms that Miss B completed for Provident  indicated that she was in 
receipt of Personal  Independence  Payment  a benefit payment for long term illness or 
disability  a fact that I think the agent would reasonably have been aware of. Miss B 
borrowed over a number  of years from an agent who visited  her at her home each week  to 
collect the repayments and presumably continued to do so when payments became  
outstanding. I therefore think that at some point  during the course of the eight-year 
relationship Provident had with Miss B, the agent(s) ought reasonably to become aware of 
Miss Bs health issues and that Miss B was potentially a vulnerable  consumer.
I would not expect an agent  to predict  the potential health implications of lending on an 
individual and I dont  think Miss Bs medical  conditions should necessarily preclude her from 
borrowing. Indeed,  the complaint in relation to the first two loans has not been  upheld. 
However, Provident says Miss B did not repay  a loan taken  in 2009, yet knowing this was 
still outstanding,  it agreed a further  loan in 2012. Miss B did not repay this loan either; yet 
again a further loan was also granted in 2016.  Miss B then went  from borrowing a loan of 
Ref: DRN83466533£100 in December 2016 to loans totalling  £1,000 just eight months later.  Provident  has 
concluded that it shouldnt have agreed any further  credit for Miss B beyond her first two 
loans. Whilst Provident is not responsible for Miss Bs underlying  health  conditions, I think  
the agent ought reasonably to have been  aware of the greater impact that further lending 
was likely to have on Miss B, given  her circumstances. 
Putting things  right
In addition to writing off the remaining balance, for the reasons explained above, I also make 
an award of £250  for the trouble and upset Provident has caused  Miss B.
My final decision
For the above reasons, and set out in my provisional  decision,  I partially  uphold  Miss Bs 
complaint and direct Provident Personal Credit  Limited to pay Mss B distress and 
inconvenience of £250, in addition to writing off the remaining balance.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 April 2020..
