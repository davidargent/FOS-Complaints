The complaint
S complains about an upheld buyer dispute claim with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
(PayPal). S was acting as the seller in the transaction. 
S is being represented by its director.
What happened
S agreed to replace a conservatory roof with a customer which was the result of an 
insurance claim. S says the work was arranged by the insurer and the claim was settled in 
cash with the customer. S then agreed to do the work and its customer paid a deposit 
through PayPal. 
S says it invoiced its customer and took a deposit for a custom-made roof for their 
conservatory. After several attempts to arrange to visit the property and install the roof, S 
says its customer changed the date multiple times, hadnt cleared the workspace to enable 
its workers to get in and start the installation and then ignored contact.
S says it then received a goods not received claim via PayPal by its customer. At this point S 
says it visited its customers property to attempt to deliver the roof. S says it was told by its 
customer that they no longer wanted the roof and to leave the property. S says at this point it 
was left with a custom product that couldnt be used anywhere else and its workers had also 
lost out on three weeks of work when they shouldve been installing the new roof. 
S responded to PayPal and the claim, suppling evidence of the order and the issues with 
delivery and installation. S says the dispute was then upheld in its favour. S says PayPal 
later changed the outcome in favour of its customer and reversed the money taken for the 
deposit. This left Ss PayPal account with a negative balance of Â£6553.95.
At this point S logged a complaint with PayPal, but it was rejected. So, S brought its 
complaint to our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt uphold it. Our investigator found PayPal 
had correctly followed its User Agreement and as S couldnt evidence the roof had been 
delivered, PayPal hadnt acted unfairly by upholding the dispute in the buyers favour. 
S didnt agree with the investigators view. It said it had sent pictures to PayPal and our 
service of the delivery driver attempting to deliver the roof at its customers property. Our 
investigator considered this point but wasnt persuaded to change her outcome. 
As S remined unhappy, the complaints been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the investigators outcome for largely the same reasons. Ill 
explain why.
Its very clear from the information S has given us that it feels very strongly about its 
complaint. Ive read through the information in its entirety, and having done so, Ive decided 
not to uphold it. I know this will come as a disappointment to S, but I hope after listening to 
my reasoning, it will understand how and why I reached my outcome.
When S opened its PayPal account, it signed up to its User Agreement. Within the 
agreement, it lists the terms in which a buyer and seller dispute can be raised and will be 
considered. The User Agreement says:
As per the User Agreement: 
To be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be 
met, as well as any applicable additional requirements: 
You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your 
PayPal account for the transaction. If you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping 
address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, 
you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection. We therefore recommend not using a 
shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof 
of shipping and delivery.
PayPal determines whether your claim is eligible for PayPal Seller Protection. PayPal will 
make a decision, in its sole discretion, based on the eligibility requirements, any information 
or documentation provided during the resolution process, or any other information PayPal 
deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.
So, the User Agreement is clear that any goods need to be delivered for a claim to be 
considered and successful in favour of the seller.
Although PayPals user agreement is the starting point here. Our service can ask PayPal to 
uphold a dispute in favour of either party when its followed the User Agreement if we think it 
arrived at an unfair outcome in doing so. Having considered the information from both 
parties, I havent found this dispute was settled unfairly. 
S has been honest with all parties involved that the roof wasnt delivered or installed, S 
confirmed this in its response to the dispute with PayPal and then again when it brought the 
complaint to our service. So, I cant fairly ask PayPal to go outside of its user agreement on 
this occasion when the buyer didnt receive the goods they paid for. 
I appreciate the difficulties S has said it had with arranging delivery and its customer 
accepting the goods. But in considering this complaint, Im looking at the actions of PayPal 
and whether its settled the claim fairly. Having considered the reasons PayPal have given 
for the outcome it reached, I havent found its acted outside of its User Agreement or treated 
S unfairly. 
I understand S wouldve had its own contract with its customer for the sale and installation of 
the roof, and my suggestion would now be to get legal advice and look at other avenues to 
pursue the claim for the return of funds. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask S to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 April 2023.
