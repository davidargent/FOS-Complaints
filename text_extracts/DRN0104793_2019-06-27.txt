K820x#14complaint
Mr M is unhappy  with HSBC UK Bank  Plcs actions following his request for a chargeback. 
background
In August  2018,  Mr M requested a chargeback from HSBC for the amount of £234.72. 
HSBC say that this chargeback has been credited  to Mr Ms account as per his request. 
Mr M feels the chargeback was carried out but then reversed. So in November 2018  he 
brought his complaint to our service, where  it was looked into by an investigator. 
Our investigator did not uphold Mr Ms complaint. He thought the chargeback had been 
correctly credited to Mr Ms account,  based on Mr Ms bank statements. Mr M disagreed so 
the case has been passed  to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked through the bank statements  for Mr Ms account, reviewing all the transactions  
between August 2018 and March 2019.  The statement dated 5 September  2018 shows an 
amount of £234.72  was credited to Mr M on 28 August 2018.
Neither the September statement, nor any of the following statements dated from
8 October 2018 to 8 April 2019 show the amount  in question  being deducted again. On this 
basis, I cant say that the chargeback was reversed  as Mr M believes. 
Taking everything into account,  I think Mr M was correctly credited with £234.72 in 
August 2018 as per his chargeback request. I appreciate Mr M feels his mobile app showed 
this amount being deducted afterwards. I cant explain why that may be. But Ive seen 
nothing to suggest the chargeback was reversed. So I wont  be asking HSBC to do anything  
more. 
my final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 July 2019.
