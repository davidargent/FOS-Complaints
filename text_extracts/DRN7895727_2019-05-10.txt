K821x#15complaint
Mr L complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mr L has been assisted  in making his complaint by a claims management company (CMC).  
But for ease, in this decision  I will generally  refer to all communication  as having been  with 
Mr L himself.
Mr L was given 11 loans  by QuickQuid between May 2012 and September 2016. One of 
those loans (loan 6) was a FlexCredit loan that provided Mr L with a revolving  credit  facility. 
The other loans  were repayable over between one and three  months. Mr L faced problems 
repaying his fourth loan needing to defer his repayment on a number  of occasions by paying  
some additional  interest,  before then entering a repayment plan with QuickQuid. And Mr L 
topped up four of his later loans by taking some  additional borrowing shortly after the original 
loan had been agreed. All of Mr Ls loans have been fully repaid  and a summary of his 
borrowing from QuickQuid is as follows;

Mr Ls complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think that 
QuickQuid should  have agreed  to lend to Mr L after, and including,  the fifth loan that was 
given to Mr L in March 2014.  So he asked  QuickQuid to pay Mr L some compensation.
QuickQuid didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mr L accepts my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
Ref: DRN78957272my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr L could repay the loans in a sustainable manner.  These checks  could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading guidance on Irresponsible Lending, and 
later the Consumer Credit  Sourcebook (CONC),  define sustainable  as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
Ref: DRN78957273The repayments on Mr Ls first two loans were  relatively modest compared to the income  
that he declared to QuickQuid. There was then a gap of just over five months before he 
asked to borrow again. So although  the amount Mr L asked to borrow  had greatly increased 
I dont think QuickQuid should have been  unduly worried  at that time about his financial 
position. And when  Mr L asked for his fourth loan the amount he asked to borrow  had fallen 
a little. So given  Mr Ls repayment amounts, what was apparent about his circumstances at 
the time,  and his history with the lender, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate  for 
QuickQuid to ask him for the amount  of information  that would be needed  to show this 
lending was unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr L provided or the information QuickQuid 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying.  So I dont  think QuickQuid was wrong to give these  four loans to Mr L.
But, Mr L appears to have had significant problems repaying his fourth  loan. He asked to 
defer his repayment  on three occasions and paid some additional interest.  And then he 
agreed a Pre-Default Payment Plan with QuickQuid to repay  his loan over a further four 
months. Although  Mr L met his revised  payment schedule, and then didnt ask to borrow  
again for around four months, I think QuickQuid should have  been  very concerned about his 
finances when  he asked to borrow again.
Looking at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history with Mr L, I think  when he asked  
for loan 5 the lender  should reasonably have concluded that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt 
provide any further  loans.  
I say this because:
The information Mr L had given to QuickQuid about his finances  hadnt changed 
between loans 4 and 5. It doesnt seem to me that QuickQuid had any reason to think  
that Mr L wouldnt face similar problems  repaying  new borrowing to those he had 
faced when repaying loan 4.
By the time Mr L asked for loan 5 hed been  borrowing from QuickQuid for a lengthy 
period and he wasnt making  any significant  inroads to the amount he owed the 
lender. By then Mr L had paid a considerable amount  of interest  to QuickQuid to 
effectively service  a debt over an extended period.
From  loan 5 onwards  Mr L was borrowing regularly  and repeatedly from QuickQuid. 
So QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr L was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ls indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
Although there were  some gaps, at one point of over four months, between Mr L 
repaying a loan and asking to borrow again,  I dont  think it would have been 
reasonable for QuickQuid to conclude these  were any indication that Mr Ls finances 
had moved on from whatever situation  had required his previous loans. 
Ref: DRN78957274I think that Mr L lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ls 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 11 and QuickQuid should  put things right.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Mr L after, and including, the loan that 
he took on 10 March  2014 (loan  5). So for each of those loans QuickQuid  should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken from loan 5 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  5 to 11 should be removed from Mr Ls credit 
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr L a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mr Ls complaint and direct  CashEuroNet UK LLC to 
put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 June  2019.
