K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs B complain  that HSBC UK Bank Plc reneged on its offer to let them  part settle a 
loan.
background
In 2008 Mr and Mrs B took out a mortgage with HSBC, secured on their home.  They fell into 
serious financial difficulties, and third parties  obtained interim  charging orders  on their home. 
In May 2013  HSBC  offered to allow them to settle their debts if they repaid £15,000. That 
sum was not paid at the time, and HSBC  said it would refer the matter  to its solicitors. In fact, 
nothing happened  until 2017.
In July 2017 Mr B asked  for a settlement  figure, with a view to releasing the charge. This 
time, HSBC was not prepared to accept £15,000. Correspondence continued into 2018, and 
the eventual outcome was that HSBC  asked for £46,936.22 (which  was the principal without 
the interest). Mr B complained, as he insisted  that HSBC should adhere to its original  offer to 
accept £15,000  in final settlement. HSBC said that offer had expired in 2013 and so it was no 
longer bound by it. Mr and Mrs B brought this complaint to our Service  in 2018. Mrs B has 
been represented by her husband. Mr B also complained  that a repayment of £900 seemed  
to have gone missing.
Our investigator agreed with HSBC that its original offer had expired in 2013 when it was not 
taken up. She said that HSBC was now entitled to ask for a larger amount. She suggested  
that if Mr and Mrs B were still in financial difficulties,  then they should  provide HSBC with 
their income and expenditure so it could  take their circumstances into account. But she didnt 
think HSBC had done anything wrong.
Mr B asked for an ombudsmans decision. He asked for an explanation of why HSBC had put 
forward three different  settlement figures in 2018,  and which  one was correct.  He also asked 
about the missing  £900 payment, and also about  what had happened to a £7,000  discount  
he had been offered.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I do not uphold it. I will explain why.
On 2 May 2013  HSBC sent Mr B an email in which it said the following:
We would be willing to accept £15,000  as a full and final settlement 
Please note that these funds  are to be deposited within 30 days for the successful  completion 
of this agreement.
I look forward  to your acceptance of the agreement within the next 14 days.
On 13 May Mr B agreed to pay £15,000,  but said he couldnt  pay all of it by the proposed  
deadline. The next day, HSBC replied to say this:
I acknowledge receipt of your email  enclosing  the acceptance  of the Bank's proposal  of a full 
& final settlement  at £15,000  The Bank would however request you to deposit £10,000 
within May 2013 and the residual balance  of £5,000 by 30th July 2013.
Ref: DRN08825492That deadline was later extended to the end of August. But the new deadline was missed  
too.
On 5 September the bank  wrote:
Please note that in the absence of the settlement  amount being deposited into the account 
within the next three days, the Bank will consider  the agreement null and void
No payment was made, and so on 30 September HSBC  refused to allow any further time 
and said it would refer the matter to its solicitors. (In fact, solicitors were  not instructed, and 
instead HSBC  instructed  a third party to collect the debt on its behalf, between  November 
2013 and October  2014. During this period  Mr B paid £900. No further  action was taken  until 
2017, and HSBC says it wrote  off the debt,  which was £47,023.22.)
Since HSBC  had always made it clear all along that the offer was subject to a time limit, and 
that time limit (after being  extended) expired without any of the £15,000  being  paid,  I think 
that the offer expired on 8 September 2013.  It follows that HSBC was no longer bound  by it, 
and it not have to accept  £15,000 when the matter was raised again in 2017  and 2018.  Four 
years later, when Mr B again asked  to settle, the bank was entitled to ask for more.
In July 2017 Mr B asked  the bank for a settlement figure. He didnt mention the figure  of 
£15,000, and shortly later he offered to pay £12,000.  So it appears that he did not consider 
the 2013 offer to still be in force either. That was not mentioned  until the bank  rejected  his 
offer of £12,000,  when he offered £15,000 instead, and insisted that they had to take it.
HSBC countered (in February 2018) with £57,689.50, which  it wrongly thought was the total 
amount then outstanding, because it had overlooked an earlier  repayment of £900. (HSBC 
has since recognised  this error, and said that the correct figure should have been  
£56,631.32.) In March, as a gesture of good  will, it reduced this figure to £51,082.56,  a 
discount of about £6,600 from its original (wrong)  figure. Four days  later HSBC reduced this 
figure by a further £1,000.  I think this is the £7,000 discount Mr B has asked about.  (Its 
actually a discount of £7,606 off the wrong  figure, or £6,549 off the corrected figure.)
It was at this point that Mr B asked what had happened to the £900 payment  he had made 
four years earlier. HSBC  wrongly told him that no such payment had been received. After  
Mr B provided evidence, HSBC agreed (on 13 April) that £900 had been received and 
apologised for its error. It reduced its proposed settlement figure again, this time to £47,023, 
which it said was the outstanding principal  without any interest.  Since that is a reduction of 
more than £900, I think that HSBC did enough  to address that issue.
This means  that the £900 payment has been  used to pay off £900 in interest. But since  
HSBC did not have to write off any interest   it had only agreed  to write off interest  as a 
gesture of good  will  I dont think it would be fair of me to order  the bank to reduce its 
settlement figure by £900. HSBC was entitled  to ask for the full £56,631.32,  so its offer to 
accept £47,023  amounts  to a discount  of over £9,000, or ten times the overlooked  payment.
In subsequent emails,  HSBC quoted  two more settlement figures,  which were £46,963.22 
and £46,936.22. Mr B has asked for an explanation of this. The banks answer,  which 
I accept, is that the figure of £47,023 should  have been £47,023.22,  but it was rounded 
down. It included a valuation cost of £60, which should not have been passed  on to Mr B. 
£47,023.22 minus  £60 is £46,963.22,  but due to a typing  mistake  this was written as 
Ref: DRN08825493£46,936.22. The difference is £27. HSBC has agreed to accept the lower  figure. That is why 
the latest figure is £87 less than the figure  which was given on 13 April 2018.
I think that HSBC is entitled to ask for a settlement figure of £46,936.22 if it wants to. It has 
already written off the whole debt, and it is not actively  pursuing  Mr and Mrs B for the debt. It 
has not sought to enforce the charge.  However,  it says that there  is enough equity in 
Mr and Mrs Bs property  to pay the debt if it is sold, so it is not willing to release the charge 
for less. Mr B disputes that there is enough equity  in the property, but I have not seen 
evidence about  the value  of the property, so I cannot comment  on it. If Mr B has evidence  
about how much the house is worth, then I would encourage  him to share this with HSBC.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision  before  4 November 2019. But if we dont hear from them, then 
we will presume that they reject it.
My final decision concludes this Services consideration of this complaint, which means Ill 
not be engaging in any further discussion of the merits of it.
