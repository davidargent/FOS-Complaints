The complaint
Mr J complains about poor service from NewDay Limited (NewDay) in respect of his credit 
card account and wants additional compensation for his time and the inconvenience caused.
What happened
In response to new regulations about helping people out of persistent debt NewDay 
proposed increasing Mr Js monthly payment above the minimum contracted amount. This 
would enable the debt to be repaid sooner. NewDay sent Mr J his statement for June 2019 
providing information about this. It suggested a payment of £177.06 rather than the minimum 
amount of £128.11 was taken on the monthly direct debit. The statement advised Mr J that 
he could opt out of the additional payment if he wanted by contacting them.
Mr J called NewDay and advised he wanted to opt out. But he didnt see any change to the 
proposed payment due on the NewDay banking app of £177.06 so he called again two days 
later. The staff member opted him out of the increased payment but said the banking app 
wouldnt reflect the lower payment. Mr J wasnt happy about this and was put though to the 
complaints team. Mr J was then told that the direct debit would be amended and that the app 
would be updated. He was annoyed at being given contradictory information. NewDay says 
it offered Mr J £20 compensation for having to make the calls to clarify matters, but he 
declined this saying it wasnt adequate.
During this call the staff member cancelled Mr Js direct debit in error. So the minimum 
payment due wasnt taken on time and Mr J had to make a manual payment in both July and 
August 2019. Mr J says NewDay made calls chasing the minimum payments despite it being 
its error and he had to call NewDay to try to resolve the issues. 
NewDay upheld Mr Js complaint and apologised for the errors and giving contradictory 
information. It said it would reimburse any late payment charge incurred and ensure no 
adverse markers were placed on his credit file. It said the app had reflected the amount on 
the statement even though Mr J had been opted out of the extra payment. But going forward 
both statements and the app would reflect the minimum contractual payment requested by 
Mr J. NewDay said it would feed this back to the developers of the app. It offered Mr J £50 
compensation for his inconvenience and credited this to his account.
Mr J didnt accept this and referred his complaint to our service. Our investigator looked into 
it but there was a delay in NewDay providing its records which annoyed Mr J further. When 
NewDay did provide the records it agreed its service wasnt good enough and offered 
another £75 in compensation. This brought the total offered to £125. Our investigator 
thought this was fair and reasonable compensation for the errors and service issues Mr J 
had experienced. She said NewDay didnt need to do any more than this. 
Mr J didnt agree. He said he wouldnt accept less than £250 in compensation as he had 
made eight calls taking up a lot of his time and then had to wait months for his complaint to 
be considered. He questioned why NewDay had opted him into the additional payment 
process, saying that it had told him this was an error itself on the phone. Mr J raised a 
number of points about NewDay saying his credit file had been marked as in dispute. He 
said he was in contact with the FCA and his MP over these matters as he felt our service 
didnt have the power to sort the problems out. The complaint has now come to me to 
decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I am upholding the complaint but wont be asking NewDay to do anymore 
than what it has already offered to resolve matters.
I know my decision will disappoint Mr J as he is clearly very annoyed about what has 
happened and I appreciate his patience as I know hes been waiting a while for a final 
answer. But I need to consider whether NewDay has acted fairly and reasonably in line with 
the terms and conditions (T&Cs) of the account, the law and industry good practice in its 
dealings with him and I think in making its revised offer of compensation to him, it has. 
As Mr J knows our role is that of an impartial dispute resolution service. We dont regulate 
the businesses we cover and cant punish it or compel it to make changes to systems and 
procedures. However we can look at whether a business has treated its customers fairly and 
reasonably and tell it to put things right if it hasnt. 
NewDay accepts it made errors and initially provided incorrect information to Mr J about the 
app. Errors and mistakes are unfortunate and annoying for customers but they do happen. 
How the business responds is important in treating customers fairly. In this case the 
problems related to a new system within NewDay and it corrected the errors, apologised and 
has offered compensation. 
NewDay has confirmed it was correct to include Mr J within the recommended extra 
payment programme. This was required by the rules in place as he had paid more in interest 
and fees than he had repaid on his borrowing over the previous eighteen months. 
NewDay did opt Mr J out at his request and it didnt take any additional payment from him. It 
refunded the late payment charge and said it would make sure his credit file wasnt 
adversely marked in relation to late payments. So Im satisfied that NewDay acted fairly and 
reasonably in resolving the problems.
NewDay has confirmed that is has not recorded a dispute on MrJs credit file. It advises it 
places an internal flag on an account if a complaint is received in order to prevent any action 
being taken in respect of it. The flag is then removed when the complaint is resolved. 
Because of this NewDay hasnt provided any additional information on the account to credit 
reference agencies. So on the credit file recent payments are shown with an identifying code 
of U, which is short for unclassified. This isnt an adverse marker and wont affect Mr Js 
credit rating. 
Initially NewDay paid Mr J £50 for his inconvenience but after he referred his complaint to 
our service it reviewed the complaint and offered a further £75 to give £125 in total.  I do 
think this is a fair and reasonable amount for what happened here including the phone calls, 
so whilst I am upholding the complaint as there were shortcomings in the service NewDay 
gave, I wont be asking it to do any more than this. My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint against NewDay Limited. 
I direct NewDay Limited to pay Mr J a further £75 in compensation for his trouble and upset.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 October 2020.
