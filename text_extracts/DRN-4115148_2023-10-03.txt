The complaint
Ms H complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Amazon Platinum Credit Card closed her 
account despite her ringing NewDay to see if she needed to take further action.
What happened
Ms H had a NewDay Amazon branded credit card, but NewDay wrote to Ms H in August 
2022 to let her know this card would be closing and it could be transferred to a new branded 
card. Ms H says she rang NewDay when she received this letter and she asked the call 
handler if she needed to do anything to transfer to the new branded credit card, but she says 
he told her she didnt need to do anything. Ms H says she was able to log into the new 
branded app, but she later realised she wasnt able to use her credit card, so she rang 
NewDay who informed her that her account had been closed due to her not taking the 
necessary action required to migrate her account to the new branded credit card. Ms H 
made a complaint to NewDay. She also complained about the service she received from 
NewDay.
NewDay partially upheld Ms Hs complaint. They said they sent her a notification between 
11-12 August 2022, advising her of an important notification regarding her account. They 
said between 1-2 September 2022 they sent her an email and a text message to remind her 
of the Amazon closure and confirming the switch date which would include an introduction to 
the new brand. They said they contacted Ms H between 20 - 23 September with a second 
and final reminder via email and text message about the Amazon closure. NewDay said that 
due to the fact there was no response to the notifications they sent her, they were no longer 
able to switch over her account as it had been closed. NewDay said they were disappointed 
to learn that she didnt receive a high level of customer service and as a gesture of goodwill 
they had credited her account with £45. Ms H brought her complaint to our service. 
Our investigator did not uphold Ms Hs complaint. He said although Ms H says she called 
NewDay in response to the letter she received, and she says she was told she didnt need
to take any action, NewDay has no record of this call, so he wasnt able to listen to what was 
discussed. He said NewDay gave clear and reasonable notice that her Amazon card 
wouldnt be usable after 11 November 2022. He also thought the £45 compensation for the 
customer service fairly addressed the service she received in the calls. Ms H asked for an 
ombudsman to review her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, Im aware that Ive only summarised Ms Hs complaint points. And Im not going to 
respond to every single point made by her. No discourtesy is intended by this. Our rules 
allow me to take this approach. It simply reflects the informal nature of our service as a free 
alternative to the courts. If theres something I havent mentioned, it isnt because Ive 
ignored it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual point to be able 
to reach what I think is a fair outcome.  
Ive considered what Ms H has said regarding her phone call with NewDay after she 
received the letter in August 2022. NewDay have sent our service a search of recorded calls 
from Ms Hs mobile number between 22 August 2022 (the date of the letter) to 6 November 
2022  the date which she had to take action to receive the new branded NewDay credit 
card. So Im satisfied that NewDay dont have a recording of the call Ms H says she had with 
NewDay after she received the letter, so Im unable to comment on what was said in this 
phone call.
Ive had a look at the letter dated 11 August 2022. Im satisfied that this is clear what Ms H 
needed to do. I say this because page two of the letter has a section of how she can get the 
new branded card. It tells her that she needs to opt into receiving one and she had to ring an 
automated phone number where she would have to enter her account number. On page four 
of the letter it is once again reiterated to Ms H what she needed to do to receive a new 
branded NewDay credit card, and it shows the automated telephone number and the 
instruction that she would need to enter her account number. It also shows she would need 
to activate the new branded card they send her within 90 days.
Ms H confirmed to our investigator that she couldnt find the telephone number quoted on 
the letter from her outgoing calls from August 2022 to February 2023. And as the letter was 
clear this was an automated telephone line, then Im not persuaded that she would have 
been able to speak to a call handler by ringing the specific number on the letter. Thats not to 
say that Ms H didnt speak to a call handler on a separate NewDay telephone number, who 
told her to do nothing, but it would appear that Ms H did not ring the specified automated 
telephone number and enter her account number as the letter said on two occasions she 
would need to do this. So as Ms H didnt take the action that the letter had set out for her to 
do by 6 November 2022, then I cant say that NewDay made an error in closing her account.
Ive considered what Ms H has said about the customer service she received from NewDay. 
It is not the role of this service to say how NewDay should respond to her complaint or who 
she should be able to speak to (such as a complaint handlers manager) as part of her 
complaint as these are decisions for NewDay to make. Ive looked at the wording from the 
complaint handler about him trying to ring Ms H on his March 2023 response to her, and Im 
persuaded he was just telling Ms H that he had tried to ring her, but he was unsuccessful. I 
know Ms H has said that she tried to ring him back, but she got through to an automated 
system telling her not to worry. But as the complaint handler set out his response and gave 
Ms H referral rights to our service, then NewDay are not required to keep communicating 
with the complainant after this point.
I know that Ms H wanted to speak to a manager in response to the complaint handlers 
response to her complaint. But she was informed that their complaint managers dont take 
calls. As this would be a commercial decision for NewDay to make, and not one our service 
can interfere with, then I cant say that NewDay should have made a complaint manager 
speak to Ms H. But NewDay have acknowledged that the service wasnt as good as it should 
have been. From Ms Hs testimony, she appears to have had issues in raising complaints 
with NewDay. So Im satisfied the £45 they credited her account was fair in these 
circumstances. So it follows I dont require NewDay to do anything further. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 October 2023.
