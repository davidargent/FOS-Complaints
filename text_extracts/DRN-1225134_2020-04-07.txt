The complaint
Mr S complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner. 
What happened
Mr S was given 32 loans by Sunny between May 2017 and February 2019. The first 26 loans 
were due to be repaid in twelve monthly instalments with the remaining loans due to be 
repaid in six monthly instalments. But Mr S generally repaid the loans much earlier than he 
was required to do so. At times Mr S had up to four loans outstanding at the same time. All 
of Mr Ss loans have been fully repaid and a summary of his borrowing from Sunny is as 
follows;

When Mr S first complained to Sunny it agreed that it shouldn't have given the last five loans 
to him. So it offered him some compensation in relation to those loans. But it didn't agree it 
had been wrong to give Mr S the remaining loans. Mr S didn't accept that offer so brought 
his complaint to this Service.
Mr Ss complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didn't think Sunny had 
been wrong to give the first four loans to Mr S. But he didn't think Sunny should have agreed 
to lend the remaining loans. So he asked Sunny to pay Mr S some compensation.
Sunny didn't agree with that assessment but increased its offer to include the last eight 
loans. Mr S didn't accept that offer either. So, as the complaint hasn't been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide. This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mr S accepts my decision it is legally binding on both parties. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr S could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
Sunny did some checks before it lent to Mr S. It asked him for details of his income, and his 
normal expenditure. And it checked his credit file before agreeing the loans. Ive seen a 
summary of those checks and I dont think they showed anything that should have caused 
additional concerns to Sunny.
As I mentioned earlier each of Mr Ss loans was repayable over a six or twelve month period. 
So the amounts that Mr S needed to repay each time were smaller than if hed taken a 
normal payday loan. But of course he was committing to making those repayments over a 
far longer period. And at times Mr S had a number of loans outstanding together. So Ive 
needed to consider the total amount that Mr S needed to repay to Sunny each month.
I think the fact that Mr S typically repaid his loans much earlier than planned should have 
caused some concerns to Sunny - only one of his 32 loans ran for more than half its planned 
length. That might be the sort of behaviour that would indicate that someone was facing 
problems managing their money and needing to refinance loans on a regular basis. So Ive 
also taken that into account when looking at whether Sunny should have given the loans to 
Mr S.
I don't think the checks Sunny did before agreeing any of the loans were proportionate. 
Although the amounts he needed to repay were relatively small, Mr S was committing to 
making those payments for a significant period of time. I think Sunny should have taken 
steps to gain an independent view of Mr S's finances at that time.
But having looked a Mr S's bank statements I don't think better checks would have led to 
Sunny declining Mr S's first four loan requests. Mr S's bank statements don't show any 
obvious signs that he was having serious problems managing his money at that time. So I 
don't think Sunny was wrong to give the first four loans to Mr S.
But I do think that Sunny should have realised, when Mr S asked for his fifth loan, that the 
way he was borrowing was suggestive of someone facing financial problems. By that time 
he'd been borrowing from Sunny for almost three months. And the amount he owed to the 
lender was continuing to rise. Mr S wasn't showing any signs that he had recovered from the problem that had caused him to borrow in the first place. So I don't think the fifth loan should 
have been agreed.
And further considering the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr S I think by 
loan 6 the lender should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldn't provide any further 
loans. 
This was now Mr Ss sixth loan request in just over four months. Each of the loans Mr S had 
taken had been repayable over a period of six months. But Mr S had paid the first two loans 
off far earlier than planned, but borrowed again very shortly afterwards. I think that pattern of 
frequent borrowing and repaying early should have indicated to Sunny that Mr S was most 
likely having significant problems managing his money.
I have considered that Mr S repaid the largest loan he'd taken at that point (loan 2) before he 
borrowed loan 6. But he still owed a significant amount to Sunny at that time. I don't think it 
would be reasonable to conclude that Mr S was making inroads into his debt.
From this point onwards Mr S often had multiple loans active at the same time. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr S was having to borrow further to cover 
the hole repaying his previous loans was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ss 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
I think that Mr S lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time. 
The sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ss ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr S from loan 5 onwards. Sunny 
needs to pay Mr S some compensation.
Putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr S after, and including, the loan that he 
took on 18 August 2017 (loan 5). So Sunny should;
refund all the interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 5 to 32
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ss credit file in relation to loan 5
remove all information about loans 6 to 32 from Mr Ss credit file
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ss complaint and direct Elevate Credit International 
Limited to put things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 May 2020.
