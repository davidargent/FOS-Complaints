The complaint
Mrs V complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that shes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Shes being represented in her complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mrs V entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance that she 
signed in May 2011 to pay for some holiday club membership points. The loan was repaid in 
December 2011 and the loan account was closed in January 2012. Mrs V also bought 
another holiday product in May 2013 but her complaint about that is being dealt with 
separately.
Mrs Vs representative complained to Barclays Partner Finance in July 2020 about a range 
of issues including that the membership was misrepresented to Mrs V and was null and void, 
the extortionate rate of interest for the loan created an unfair relationship between Mrs V and 
Barclays Partner Finance, proper credit checks werent carried out, an undisclosed 
commission was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company and the holiday 
company had been found liable for fraudulent activities by an overseas court. A complaint 
was then made to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Vs complaint should be upheld. She thought 
that Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of Mrs Vs claims to turn 
them down and she said that she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the 
lending was unaffordable for Mrs V. She also said that she didnt think that either the 
timeshare agreement or the related credit agreement was voidable.
Mrs Vs representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says that Mrs Vs claims arent time-barred and it has provided a detailed 
analysis of its understanding of applicable laws and regulations, including that the 
consideration was paid before the end of the withdrawal period, the withdrawal period isnt 
compliant with the regulations, and Mrs V had three years from the date of knowledge of the 
breaches to bring a claim under section 14A of the Limitation Act 1980.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Vs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Vs complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that shed 
made to it and I accept that she referred her complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to her 
claims;
Mrs Vs claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs Vs claim under section 75 is that the membership points were misrepresented to 
her and that she wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented to 
her - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance 
would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the 
time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs V could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her into buying 
the membership points in May 2011 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made to her and any loss would have been 
incurred as that was when she also entered into the loan agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made to Barclays Partner 
Finance until July 2020, more than nine years later, which was outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that her claim under section 75 is now 
time-barred;
Mrs Vs representative says that Mrs V only became aware that she could make a 
misrepresentation claim to Barclays Partner Finance after she took legal advice  but 
when she had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist her for the purposes of 
the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act, 
including under section 14A which applies to negligence claims, are extended where 
a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but 
I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mrs Vs claims;
Mrs Vs representative has referred to an overseas court judgment which it says 
found the holiday company liable for fraudulent activities - and the time limits referred 
to above are postponed under section 32 where misrepresentations were 
fraudulently made;
section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been 
deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the 
debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have 
been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a 
breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate 
concealment of the facts involved in the breach;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
deliberate concealment of any relevant information in these circumstances or that the 
holiday company made any fraudulent misrepresentations to Mrs V - I consider that 
many of the things that she says werent right ought reasonably to have been known 
to her at the time of the sale - so I dont consider that section 32 is applicable in these 
circumstances;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
has acted fraudulently and I consider that any such claim would now also be time-
barred;
Mrs Vs representative has also referred to the relationship between Barclays Partner 
Finance and Mrs V being unfair and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst 
other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that the loan was repaid in 
December 2011 and that the loan account was closed in January 2012 - so Mrs V 
would have had six years from then to bring a claim against Barclays Partner 
Finance about an unfair relationship with her  but a claim wasnt made until July 
2020, more than eight years later, which was outside of the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act so I consider that her claim under section 140A is also now time-
barred; 
Mrs Vs representative says that proper credit checks werent carried out but the loan 
was repaid in December 2011 and Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan 
wasnt affordable for Mrs V when it was made to her or that shes experienced any 
financial difficulties since then;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs V asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its credit checks before July 2020  as the loan was made to her in 
May 2011 I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have raised any 
concerns about the credit checks before then and I consider it to be more likely than 
not that any complaint about the credit checks or the affordability of the loan would 
now be time-barred;
Mrs Vs representative says Barclays Partner Finance should have told Mrs V about 
any commission that it paid to the holiday company for arranging the loan  but Ive 
not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by 
Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was normally 
paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays Partner 
Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mrs V risked 
the relationship being unfair;
Ive not been provided with a copy of Mrs Vs contract with the holiday company for 
the purchase of the points so Ive not been able to consider whether the withdrawal 
provisions in that contract are consistent with the regulations  but the loan agreement that was signed by Mrs V clearly set out her right to cancel the agreement 
within the fourteen days after the day she signed it;
immediately above Miss Vs signature on the loan agreement it says: This is a credit 
agreement. Sign it only if you want to be legally bound by its terms so I consider that 
Mrs V knew, or ought reasonably to have known, about her right to cancel the loan 
agreement but Ive seen no evidence to show that she tried to withdraw from it within 
the cancellation period;
Mrs Vs representative says that the extortionate rate of interest for the loan created 
an unfair relationship between Mrs V and Barclays Partner Finance  but Mrs V 
signed the loan agreement which clearly set out the annual and monthly rate of 
interest (and the APR), the amount of credit, the total charge for credit and the 
number and amount of the monthly repayments  if the rate of interest wasnt 
acceptable to Mrs V, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her not to have 
signed the loan agreement;
Mrs V entered into the loan agreement in May 2011 and I understand that the 
contract for the purchase of the membership points was entered into at the same 
time  but the loan account statement provided by Barclays Partner Finance shows 
that the purchase price was paid to the holiday company in June 2011, more than 
fourteen days after the loan agreement was signed, so Im not persuaded that the 
consideration was paid to the holiday company during the withdrawal period;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of any applicable laws and regulations for which Barclays Partner Finance would be 
liable and I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it to have relied 
on the Limitation Act and to not have upheld Mrs Vs claims in these circumstances; 
and
I sympathise with Mrs V for the issues that shes had with her membership points, but 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays Partner Finance 
to refund to her any of the money that she paid under the loan agreement, to pay her 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Vs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs V to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2023.
