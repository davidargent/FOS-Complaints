K820x#14Complaint
Miss W complains about fees and charges  that HSBC UK Bank  Plc applied  to her current  
account from 2009 to 2012. 
Background
Miss W originally complained to HSBC  about charges that were applied to her current 
account between  2009 and 2012. Miss W said the charges for the period totalled £1,911 and 
asked HSBC to refund  them.  
Miss W went  on to refer her complaint to our service  and it was passed to an adjudicator. 
The adjudicator said we couldnt  consider all of the fees Miss W had been charged because  
of the amount of time thats passed.  An ombudsman  also looked at the case and on 
28 October 2019 issued  a decision  setting  out how far back  our service could look. The 
ombudsmans decision said the Financial Ombudsman Service can look at charges applied 
after 12 June 2011. 
The adjudicator looked at charges applied to Miss Ws account after 12 June 2011.  They  
found four charges but noted that two had been refunded by HSBC already.  The adjudicator 
said charges applied on 24 August 2011  for £11 and 24 November 2011 for £75 had been 
added correctly and didnt ask HSBC to refund  them. 
Miss W asked to appeal and said that the way HSBC dealt with her complaint in 2017 was 
poor. As Miss W asked  to appeal her complaint has been passed to me to make  a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Please note that, in line with the previous  
decision dated 28 October 2019, Im going to look at charges applied  to Mrs Ws account 
from 12 June 2011.
Businesses are allowed to charge customers when an account isnt operated  in line with the 
agreed terms. In this case,  HSBCs  terms say it will charge account holders if the balance  
goes over the agreed overdraft limit. HSBCs terms say it can also charge a customer  if 
items are returned unpaid  due to a lack of funds. I know Miss W feels the level of fees 
applied was unfair, but Im unable to challenge  HSBCs actions on that basis. Ive looked at 
the account terms and Miss Ws statements to see whether HSBC  has made any mistakes. 
As the adjudicators already said, during the period in question  there were four charges. Ive 
looked at the £100  fee applied  on 24 June  2011 but can see it was refunded by HSBC on 
the same  day. The 24 December  2012 charge of £50 was also refunded by HSBC.  
Ive focused on the two remaining charged. On 24 August 2011 Miss Ws account  was 
charged £11. But the statements show that Miss Ws account had previously gone over the 
overdraft limit. HSBC charged  Miss W £75 on 24 November  2011 but her account balance  
exceeded the overdraft limit for around  10 days in the preceding  weeks. Im sorry to 
disappoint Miss W but Im satisfied  the charges have been  correctly applied, in line with the 
account terms. 
Ref: DRN41822142Businesses have to treat customers experiencing financial  difficulties  positively and 
sympathetically. Unfortunately, due to the amount of time thats passed, HSBCs  contact  
notes arent  now available. But HSBC did refund two charges it intended to apply during the 
period in question. I think that shows HSBC  was willing to provide some breathing space  to 
Miss W during a difficult period. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Miss W but, having  reviewed the charges applied  to her account  
after 12 June 2011, I havent found  any evidence of a mistake. The charges  were applied 
after Miss Ws account balance went over the agreed overdraft limit and are in line with the 
terms. Im satisfied  HSBC acted positively and sympathetically as it agreed  to refund 
charges during the period in question. As I havent  found that HSBC  acted unfairly  and Im 
satisfied its response to Miss Ws complaint was reasonable,  Im not telling it to do anything 
else.  
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 March 2020.
