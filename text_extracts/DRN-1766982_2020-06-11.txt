The complaint
X complains that NewDay Ltd put a block on a legitimate transaction they made using their 
credit card without explaining why. As a result they lost out on a retailers offer.
What happened
In what follows, Ive summarised events in rather less detail than theyve been presented, 
using my own words to do so.
X told us NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua blocked a credit card transaction they tried to make 
on 3 April 2019 to a retailer Ill refer to as A. The following morning A cancelled an earlier 
order of Xs because it couldnt request payment from Xs credit card. X also tried to use the 
credit card with another retailer but found that transaction was also declined.
X is unhappy that NewDay wont provide any information about which specific transactions it 
flags and fraud and why. X says theyve suffered a financial loss due their credit card being 
blocked because they lost out on an offer by the retailer worth £151.
X is also unhappy with the service they received from NewDay when they tried to complain 
about the problem.
To resolve the complaint X would like compensation for the £151 offer they lost out on, 
compensation for phone calls and compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Theyd also like NewDay to improve its security systems so that future transactions arent 
wrongly flagged or blocked.
X complained to NewDay and initially it didnt uphold the complaint. It explained that its fraud 
detection systems detect and record unusual transactions but sometimes they can prevent 
genuine activity. It explained that when it stops a transaction it will always try to contact the 
account holder to confirm if the transaction is genuine.
X wasnt happy with NewDays response so they referred their complaint to our service. 
Following Xs complaint to our service NewDay reviewed the complaint again. It still didnt 
uphold the complaint so far as the blocking of the account was concerned but it agreed that 
Xs calls werent handled as well as they should have been so it agreed to pay £75 
compensation.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Xs complaint should be upheld. He explained that 
its not unusual for a business to flag a transaction for further review if its fraud prevention 
systems deem it suspicious and our service wouldnt expect NewDay to divulge its fraud 
prevention measures as these are commercially sensitive.
Our investigator also explained that our service doesnt have the power to require NewDay 
to improve its security systems so that future transactions arent wrongly flagged or blocked.
The investigator also noted that NewDays system notes record that it tried to contact X by 
phone but as there was a problem with the contact number it sent a letter a letter. In view of this our investigator didnt think NewDay had done anything wrong and he didnt recommend 
that NewDay should do anything further.
X disagreed with the investigators view. They said their contact number was reachable on 3 
and 4 April so they dont understand why they didnt receive a call from NewDay. And X says 
they never received a letter from NewDay  and even if they had it wouldnt have been any 
use because X should have been told their card was blocked immediately. X thinks they 
should have been sent an email immediately after their card was blocked. X also says Aqua 
doesnt offer 24/7 customer support and this means if a customers card is blocked after 
NewDays operating hours it can take a long time to unblock it. Had they been notified their 
card was blocked, X could have arranged to pay with a different card.
In response to Xs further comments our investigator noted that NewDays contact notes 
show it updated Xs phone number on 31 March 2019. NewDays system notes show it 
attempted to call X but this wasnt successful as there was a fault on the line. The 
investigator accepted that X didnt receive NewDays letter but he couldnt say NewDay was 
responsible for non-delivery.
So far as not being able to contact NewDay outside its opening hours our investigator 
explained that its not for our service to tell a business to change its processes and nor do 
we have power to tell a business to improve the service it offers to its customers.
X thought their card was blocked around 9pm on 3 April. X wanted to know when NewDay 
tried to contact them by phone because they thought the investigators opinion that NewDay 
had acted fairly would only be reasonable if NewDay contacted him soon after itd blocked 
Xs card. X repeated that had they been sent an email immediately they could have 
contacted A to use another card to avoid the order being cancelled.
Our investigator thought NewDay had tried to contact X after their card was blocked, albeit 
not successfully. The investigator accepted that an email would have been useful but our 
service doesnt have the power to tell a business the systems and channels it should use to 
communicate with its customers.
X remains unhappy and has asked for an ombudsmans decision. X says that in their original 
complaint to NewDay they asked for compensation and for NewDay to improve its fraud 
prevention system. But X says they were more upset with NewDays decision letter which 
didnt address the points X made in their complaint letter and it only provided general 
information which didnt answer X specific complaint. To settle the complaint X would like 
NewDay to:-
apologise for the faults in its decision letter and improve its handling of customer 
complaints; and
improve its fraud prevention system so that their online transactions arent wrongly 
flagged or wrongly blocked; and
provide monetary compensation for Xs loss.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I thank X for their detailed points which I have read and considered. In keeping with our role 
as an informal dispute resolution service it isnt necessary for me to respond to every point 
made, but to concentrate on the crux of the issues. Having done so, I agree with the investigators view on this complaint and for broadly the same reasons. I realise X will be 
disappointed by this so Ill explain why Ive reached my decision.
I must also explain at the outset that there are some aspects of Xs complaint that our 
service is unable to consider. Our service doesnt have the power to require NewDay to 
change its security systems so that future transactions arent wrongly flagged or blocked and 
neither can we require it to communicate with its customers in a particular way  for example 
by requiring it to email its customers when a transaction has been blocked or flagged as 
fraudulent.
I realise X is also concerned that NewDay doesnt have 24/7 customer support but again our 
service doesnt have the power to require NewDay to operate in a particular way or to extend 
its customer services operating times.
So whilst I agree it would have been helpful had NewDay emailed X to let them know their 
card had been blocked, this isnt something I can require it to do or ask it to change.
I will make another observation before I address the merits of the complaint: X also 
complains that NewDays final response letter didnt respond to the complaint points made 
and that it was general and contained incorrect information. I must explain that our service 
doesnt have the power to look at how a financial business deals with its complaint-handling. 
Thats because this isnt a regulated activity under the rules that govern our service. This 
means that even if I think NewDay didnt deal with Xs complaint well, I wouldnt be able to 
uphold that part the complaint. So I wont spend any time in this decision on that and I will 
focus solely on whether NewDay acted fairly and reasonably when it blocked Xs credit card.
I appreciate that from their point of view X was making a legitimate transaction but I cant say 
NewDay treated X unfairly when it blocked their credit card. This is because the terms and 
conditions of Xs credit card account allow NewDay to block transactions and also to block 
the use of a credit card too. Financial businesses have a duty to protect their customers 
money from the ever-increasing threat of fraud and its not unusual for businesses to put in 
place fraud prevention systems and to flag transactions requiring further review. I realise this 
means that legitimate transactions may get delayed or blocked and that customers in those 
circumstances may be caused some inconvenience.
I can understand why X would like to know the types of transactions NewDay will decline 
and its reasons for flagging certain transactions but NewDay isnt under any obligation to 
provide this information because this is commercially sensitive.
NewDay told us that when a transaction is flagged by its fraud prevention systems, a hold is 
placed on the account until it can make contact with the customer to see if the transaction is 
genuine. Based on the information Ive seen I think NewDay tried to notify X soon after the 
transactions was flagged by its fraud prevention systems. NewDays system notes show it 
tried to phone X on 3 April 2019 at 18.59 about the transaction but it wasnt able to speak to 
do so as there was a fault. Im not able to say why the call failed but Im satisfied it tried to 
contact X, albeit unsuccessfully.
When it wasnt able to contact X by phone to verify the transaction, it blocked Xs credit card 
and sent a letter instead. I think this was fair and reasonable in the circumstances given that 
it had tried unsuccessfully to contact X by phone.
I appreciate X never received this letter but it appears to be correctly addressed and I dont 
see any reason why NewDay wouldnt have sent it. And it wouldnt be fair for me to hold 
NewDay responsible for post not arriving.I take on board Xs concerns that even if theyd received the letter, it would have been too 
late for them to pay the retailer with a different card. But as I explained above NewDays 
system notes show it tried to call. As NewDay wasnt able to speak with X Id expect it to 
make contact in a different way which it did when it followed up with the letter.
I also agree it would have been helpful had NewDay emailed X but as I explained at the 
outset our service cant tell NewDay the way in which it must communicate with its 
customers.
For the reasons given above I cant say NewDay treated X unfairly when it blocked their 
credit card so I will not be asking it to compensate X.
NewDay accepts that its customer service should have been better and it offered £75 
compensation by way of apology for the trouble and upset caused. The customer service 
issues here concerned whether or not NewDay would open a complaint for X. 
This aspect of NewDays customer service failings relates to Newdays complaint-handling 
activities and as I explained above this isnt something our service has power to consider. 
However it remains open to X to accept NewDays offer of compensation should they wish to 
do so and Id expect NewDay to honour the offer made.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask X to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 July 2020.
