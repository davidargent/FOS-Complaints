Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Bs complaint in part and thought loans  6 to 11 shouldnt have 
been given. Satsuma didnt respond to the adjudicators view; the complaint has been 
passed to me to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Satsuma needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Satsuma should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN17913732the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Satsuma was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
Satsuma needed  to do more when it approved loans 1 to 3. And whilst I think  it should have 
carried out more  checks for loans  4 and 5, I havent seen any evidence  that better  
information would have made  a difference to its lending decisions.  So I cant  conclude 
Satsuma was wrong to give loans 1 to 5 to Mr B.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of Satsumas  lending history with Mr B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Satsuma should  reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Satsuma should have realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think  that this point  was reached at loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Satsuma  ought to have realised  Mr B was not managing  to repay  his 
loans sustainably. Mr B had taken out six loans in under nine months, typically 
borrowing within days of repaying  a previous loan. So Satsuma  ought  to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mr B was having to borrow further  to cover the 
hole repaying  previous  loan(s)  was leaving in his finances and that Mr Bs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr B was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of settling a 
previous one. 
Ref: DRN17913733Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Satsuma.  Loan  11 was 
taken out 17 months after his first loan. And it was for larger  amount. Mr B had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Satsuma over an extended 
period.
The loans were  instalment loans, with between three to 12-month terms. But Mr B 
frequently repaid his loan in the same month  that hed taken  it out. This isnt how 
instalment loans should usually work.  I think this pattern of lending should have 
alerted Satsuma to the likelihood that Mr B was having problems managing  his 
money. I think  that Satsuma shouldve  been  concerned that Mr B might be borrowing  
elsewhere to repay its loans, again  increasing  his indebtedness unsustainably.
I think that Mr B lost out because Satsuma provided  loans  6 to 11 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
giving  these loans  was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Bs ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 11, and Satsuma should put things  right. 
putting things right  what Satsuma needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 6 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 means  any information  recorded about loans 6 
to 11 is adverse, so the entries about loans 6 to 11 should be removed from Mr Bs 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Satsuma to take off tax from this interest.  Satsuma must give 
Mr B a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Bs complaint. Provident  Personal 
Credit Limited (trading as Satsuma) should  pay Mr B compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 December  2019.
