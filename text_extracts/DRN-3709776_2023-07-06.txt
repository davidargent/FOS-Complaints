The complaint
Mrs C complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that shes made to it under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Shes being represented in her complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs C and her husband entered into a purchase agreement in February 2009 to buy 3,000 
holiday club membership points. The total price payable for those points was £3,990. Mrs C 
also entered into a credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in February 2009 
and she used £3,990 of the credit that was provided to her to pay for the points. The credit 
was on buy now  pay later terms so the purchase wasnt charged to her account until six 
months later. Mrs C repaid that credit in August 2009.
Mrs C and her husband entered into another purchase agreement in February 2010 to buy 
an additional 4,000 holiday club membership points. The total price payable for those points 
was £3,399 and Mrs C used the credit available to her under her existing credit card 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for those points. Mrs C made repayments 
to Barclays Partner Finance between March and October 2010, when the credit was fully 
repaid.
Mrs Cs representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance under sections 75 and 
140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in May 2017. It said that the holiday company: was in 
breach of contract in that it didnt conduct a proper assessment of Mrs Cs financial position 
and ability to repay the loan; applied considerable pressure to her to procure her 
agreement to the loan; breached EU Law; and accepted a commission from Barclays 
Partner Finance which rendered the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A.
Barclays Partner Finance responded to those claims in June 2017 and set out the reasons 
that it said that it was unable to uphold them. Mrs C wasnt satisfied with its response so a 
complaint was made to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Cs complaint should be upheld. She thought 
that Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of Mrs Cs misrepresentation 
and breach of contract claims to turn them down and that Mrs Cs claim under section 140A 
was made too late under the Limitation Act 1980. She also set out the reasons that she 
didnt consider that the level of commission risked making the relationship unfair under 
section 140A and she said that she couldnt consider Mrs Cs complaint about unaffordable 
lending.
Mrs Cs representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has raised its serious concerns about the way that the finance was sold to 
Mrs C and it has provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday company 
and the unfair terms that it used. It has also provided further documentation in which it says 
that theres been a fundamental breach of contract by the holiday company.
Mrs Cs husband also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance in March 2007 for a loan to pay for a holiday club membership. Barclays Partner 
Finance says that the loan was settled in May 2014. The letter that was sent by Mrs Cs 
representative to Barclays Partner Finance in May 2017 also made claims about her 
husbands loan agreement. I cant see that Barclays Partner Finance has responded to 
those claims and the complaint that was made to this service included a complaint relating to 
that loan. Mrs C wasnt a party to that loan so Im not considering any complaint relating to 
that loan agreement in this decision and Mrs Cs husbands complaint will be dealt with 
separately.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Cs complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Cs complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that shed 
made to it and I accept that she referred her complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to her 
claims;
Mrs Cs claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs Cs claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the 
holiday company and that the membership points that she and her husband bought 
in February 2009 and February 2010 were misrepresented to them and that they 
wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented to them - if the criteria 
for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would be expected 
to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time limits set out 
in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act 
and to not consider the claim;
Mrs Cs representatives letter to Barclays Partner Finance in May 2017 described 
the misrepresentations that it said had been made to Mrs C and her husband, 
including that they were advised that the only way that they could exit their 
membership was to purchase a fractional points membership and that they would be 
guaranteed to exit the fractional points membership after a finite number of years;
the membership points that Mrs C and her husband bought in February 2009 and 
February 2010 werent fractional points memberships and any representations made 
about buying a fractional points membership to exit their existing membership would have been made after theyd bought the membership points in February 2009 and 
February 2010 so wouldnt have induced them into making those purchases;
but even if misrepresentations had been made to them in February 2009 and 
February 2010, the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 
or 9 of the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action 
accrued (which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
Mrs C would have been able to make a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about any misrepresentations that could have induced her and her 
husband into buying the membership points no later than February 2010 as that was 
the latest time that any misrepresentations about those membership points would 
have been made to them and any loss would have been incurred as that was also 
the latest time that Mrs C used the credit provided by Barclays Partner Finance to 
make a purchase;
I consider that Mrs Cs cause of action would have accrued at that time, so she would 
have had six years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the 
holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt 
made until May 2017, more than seven years later which was outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a 
defence to her misrepresentation claim and I find that it wouldnt have been 
unreasonable for it to have rejected the claim;
the time limit for a breach of contract claim is also six years from the date on which 
the cause of action accrued and I consider that Mrs C would have been able to make 
a claim to the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance about the alleged 
breaches of contract that her representative described in its May 2017 letter in 
February 2010 after she and her husband had entered into the purchase agreement 
to buy the additional membership points;
she would have had six years from February 2010 to bring a breach of contract claim 
against either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a breach of 
contract claim wasnt made until May 2017, more than seven years later which was 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that Barclays 
Partner Finance has a defence to her breach of contract claim and I find that it 
wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have rejected the claim;
Mrs Cs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs C and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that Mrs C had repaid the 
credit by October 2010 and Ive seen no evidence to show that she has used the 
credit card agreement since then so I consider that it ended in October 2010;
she would have had six years from then to bring a section 140A claim against 
Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made until May 2017, more than six 
years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act, so I 
consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a defence to her section 140A claim and 
I find that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have rejected the claim;our investigator said that she couldnt consider Mrs Cs complaint about unaffordable 
lending but the credit was made available to Mrs C in February 2009 when she 
signed the credit card agreement so I find that I can consider Mrs Cs complaint that 
the credit wasnt affordable for her;
Mrs Cs representatives May 2017 letter says that the holiday company didnt 
conduct a proper assessment of Mrs Cs financial position and ability to repay the 
loan but its provided no further evidence to show that the credit wasnt affordable for 
Mrs C in February 2009 when it was made available to her;
Mrs C used £3,990 of that credit to pay for the membership points that she and her 
husband bought in February 2009 and she repaid that credit in August 2009, before 
the buy now  pay later period ended;
she then used £3,399 of that credit to pay for the membership points that she and her 
husband bought in February 2010 and she made repayments of £500 in March 2010, 
£800 and £1,000 in July 2010, £800 in August 2010 and £301.84 in October 2010 
(after the buy now  pay later period had ended so £2.84 of interest had been 
applied to her account);
Ive seen no evidence to show that the credit wasnt affordable for Mrs C when it was 
made available to her or that she asked Barclays Partner Finance for any information 
about its affordability assessment before May 2017  as the credit was made 
available to her in February 2009 and was repaid in October 2010, I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect her to have raised any concerns about the 
affordability of the credit before then;
Barclays Partner Finance issued a substantive response to Mrs Cs claims in June 
2017 in which it set out the reasons that it said that it was unable to uphold them - I 
consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it to have applied the 
provisions of the Limitation Act in response to those claims but Im not persuaded 
that the outcome that it reached was unfair or unreasonable in these circumstances; 
and
I sympathise with Mrs C for the issues that she and her husband have had with their 
membership points and the health issues that her husband has experienced, but I 
find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclays Partner Finance to refund to her any of the money that she paid under the 
credit card agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Cs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 August 2023.
