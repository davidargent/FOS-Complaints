The complaint
Ms E complains on behalf of Mrs E about the way in which Shop Direct Finance Company 
Limited trading as Very (Very) administered Mrs Es credit account.
What happened
Mrs E holds a credit account with Very.
On 25 November 2022 Mrs E made a payment of £80 towards her account. She intended 
this to be an early payment towards her December minimum payment.
Very issued a statement on 29 November 2022 requesting a minimum payment of £202.32 
by 19 December 2022. It stated that the payment made by Mrs E on 25 November 2022 had 
been received and applied to the previous statement.
Mrs E made further payments of £40 on 9 December 2022 and £40 on 16 December 2022.
Ms E (on behalf of Mrs E) contacted Very on 19 December 2022. She said she realised 
shed paid £80 before the statement was issued on 29 November 2022 and asked whether 
the payment could be allocated to the current statement.
The Very advisor told Ms E that this wasnt possible and offered to refund the £80 instead. 
Ms E declined this.
Mrs E made a further payment of £43 to the account on 22 December 2022. This was after 
the statement due date. The total payments made by Mrs E didnt meet the minimum 
payment due for December. Very charged an administration charge of £12 to the account 
because of the insufficient payment.
Very issued a statement on 30 December 2022 requesting a minimum payment of £296.75 
by 19 January 2023. It also said that the account was in arrears by £76.68.
The account was passed to the arrears support team.
Ms E  on behalf of Mrs E  contacted Very on 3 January 2023 and requested that the 
payment of £80 was refunded. Very refunded the £80 and recharged the account by the 
same amount.
Ms E contacted Very on 4 January 2023 to raise a complaint on behalf of Mrs E. She felt that 
Very had provided conflicting information and she didnt think the administration charges 
were fair. She was also unhappy about the number of calls and texts shed received from 
Very regarding the account.
Very didnt uphold the complaint. It said the level of communication was within the relevant 
guidelines and that it had a legitimate right to pursue customers for outstanding balances. 
Very said it had reviewed the information held on its systems but didnt find that any errors 
had been made.
Mrs E remained unhappy, and Ms E complained to this service on her behalf.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. They said they couldnt fairly say that Very had 
made an error by allocating the £80 payment to Decembers statement. The investigator also 
said that the administration charges had been applied in line with the terms and conditions of 
the account.
Mrs E didnt agree so Ive been asked to review the complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres no dispute that Mrs E made a payment of £80 on 25 November 2022. This was prior 
to the statement dated 29 November 2022 being produced and issued. Very has said that 
the FCA guidance means that it is unable to accept advance payments for future statements. 
So Very allocated the £80 payment to the previous statement.
I understand Mrs Es reasons for making the payment of £80 when she did. However, Im 
unable to say that Very made an error by not allocating the payment to the December 
statement. At the point when Mrs E paid the £80, the December statement hadnt been 
produced.
The December statement was produced on 29 November 2022. It detailed that the £80 
payment had been allocated to the previous statement and requested a payment of £203.32 
by 19 December 2022.
Mrs E made a payment of £40 on 9 December 2022 and £40 on 16 December 2022. This 
left £122.32 due by 19 December 2022.
Ive listened to the telephone call between Ms E and Very on 19 December 2022. During the 
call, Very explained why the £80 paid on 25 November 2022 wasnt classed as a payment 
for December. Very told Ms E that the £80 couldnt be transferred to Decembers statement. 
It offered to refund the £80 but Ms E said to leave it on the account.
So at the conclusion of the telephone call, total payments of £80 (£40 on 9 December and 
£40 on 16 December ) had been made for Decembers statement. Mrs E paid £43 on 22 
December 2022 but this was after the [payment due date so this payment was allocated to 
the following month. For December, Mrs Es payments had fallen short by £122.32.
In these circumstances, I dont think it was unfair of Very to apply an administration charge. 
This is because Verys terms and conditions (which Mrs E agreed to when she opened the 
account) state that if the minimum payment isnt made by the date shown on the account 
statement, default charges would be applied to the account.
Because Mrs E had agreed to the terms and conditions, Im unable to say that Very made an 
error when it applied the charges.
I appreciate that Ms E feels that shes received poor service from Very. Shes said that she 
was promised call backs which didnt happen. This service can only look into matters which 
are included in the complaint to the business. In this case, I cant see that Ms E complained 
about any customer service issues. So Im not able to consider these issues in this decision. 
That said, even if it was the case that Ms E had received poor customer service, this 
wouldnt change the fact that Mrs E failed to make the minimum payment due for December and that the account fell into arrears as a consequence.
Taking everything into account and for the reasons Ive explained, Im unable to say that 
Very has made an error here. So I wont be asking it to do anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 November 2023.
