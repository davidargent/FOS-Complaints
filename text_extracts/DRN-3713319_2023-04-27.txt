The complaint
Miss H complains that money she sent overseas via MoneyGram International Limited was 
not collected by the intended recipient. 
What happened
On 27 June 2022 Miss H instructed MoneyGram to send £111.70 to an individual known to 
her in a different country. She paid a fee of £3.29 for this service. The money was collected 
on 29 June 2022, but Miss H says it was not collected by the intended recipient, who had 
told Miss H she was too unwell to leave the house to collect the funds. Miss H asked 
MoneyGram to look into this.
MoneyGram didnt uphold Miss Hs complaint. It said that the person who collected the
money knew the name of the sender and the receiver, the eight-digit reference number for 
the transaction, and provided photographic identification in the receivers name. So 
MoneyGram said they had fulfilled their side of the contract. Miss H was unhappy with 
MoneyGrams response, so she referred her complaint to our service.
Our Investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He felt that MoneyGram had provided
evidence to demonstrate that the money had been collected by the intended recipient. 
Miss H disagreed, specifically she says she was told on 30 June 2022 by MoneyGram that 
the funds had not actually been collected, she also has some concerns about the timestamp 
of the payment in her online account. So as no agreement could be reached the complaint 
has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusions as our Investigator and for the same 
reasons.
Im satisfied that MoneyGram sent the funds as instructed, so Ive considered whether 
MoneyGram had enough information in order to release the money. MoneyGram has 
confirmed that the only way for the staff at the recipient location to find the relevant payment 
is via the reference number, which the terms and conditions state must only be shared with 
the intended recipient. MoneyGram has also provided a copy of the collection receipt that 
was signed by the recipient of the funds in the receiving country.
I can see that the person who collected the money did so by presenting what appeared to be
valid identification documents, in the correct name, and the correct reference number. So 
having considered all the evidence, Im satisfied that MoneyGram was reasonable to release 
the funds as the individual who collected the funds provided adequate information to confirm 
they were the intended recipient.
I acknowledge that Miss H says she was subsequently told the funds had not been collected, 
but Ive seen no evidence to support that, everything Ive seen suggests that the funds were 
collected, and that they were collected by the intended recipient. I also acknowledge that 
Miss H has concerns that the time stamp of the transaction in her online account is incorrect, 
its not clear why this timestamp didnt match the time the payment was made, but that does 
not change my finding that MoneyGram has acted fairly here. There is no question that the 
payment was sent correctly, so the timestamp on the payment doesnt cause me any 
concern. 
I know this will be disappointing for Miss H, but in the circumstances, I wont be asking 
MoneyGram to return any funds to Miss H.
