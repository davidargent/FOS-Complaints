DRN-3673173
The complaint
Mr and Mrs F complain about Lloyds Bank General Insurance Limiteds decision to decline 
their building insurance claim.
All references to Lloyds also include its appointed agents.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The policy defines a storm as a period of violent weather with wind speeds of 55 mph 
or more. Recorded wind speeds in the area of Mr and Mrs Fs property, around the 
time of the incident, dont meet the policys definition of a storm. But I also consider 
they dont come reasonably close to this definition either.
Lloyds sent a surveyor to inspect the damage to the property. It said the damage to 
the gable has resulted from a lack of lateral restraint which has caused the damage 
to happen gradually.  
The wind speeds present around the time of the incident wouldnt typically have 
caused the damage reported to the gable end of the property. Lloyds have also 
provided photos of the damage within their report, which show what appears to be a 
bowing of the gable. And Ive not seen anything that persuades me Lloyds 
conclusion is obviously wrong. So, I dont intend to interfere with its decision to 
decline Mr and Mrs Fs claim for the damage to the gable.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr and Mrs Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F and Mrs F to 
accept or reject my decision before 7 October 2022.
