K821x#15complaint
Miss I says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss I had 13 loans with QuickQuid. Her complaint is about loans 4-13.  Ive set out some of 
the information QuickQuid provided about  the loans in the appendix to this decision. Ive 
included loans 1-3 in the table as, although not part of Miss Is complaint, they still form part 
of the history  of lending.
An adjudicator considered  Miss Is complaint and recommended it be upheld. He didnt think  
QuickQuid shouldve approved loan 5b or any of the subsequent loans. QuickQuid didnt 
agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss I 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Miss I could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN46633012Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. The Office of Fair Tradings (the previous 
regulator) guidance on irresponsible lending (ILG)  had a similar focus on the importance  of 
repayments being sustainable.
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Is complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 4-5a would most likely have 
shown that these loans were  affordable  for Miss I. Theres been no further  dispute  about this 
since the adjudication and so I will say no more about these loans.
Our adjudicator thought proportionate  checks wouldve suggested loan 5b wasnt  affordable  
for Miss I. This was because he thought QuickQuid wouldve found Miss Is disposable 
income to be in the region  of £680  and the largest  payment following the approval of loan 5b 
was £630.
QuickQuid said that this means the loan was lent responsibly. I dont agree. Whilst it might 
be affordable on a strict pounds and pence  calculation, I dont think  this means  the 
repayment was sustainable. The repayment was significant compared to Miss Is income, so 
leaving only a £50 margin for unknown or unexpected other monthly expenses would not be 
sufficient to ensure  Miss I could make the repayment without undue  difficulty.  Im therefore 
upholding the complaint  about loan 5b.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Miss Is lending  history with QuickQuid, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid  should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Is case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6 (the FlexCredit  facility). I say this because:
Miss I had significant difficulties repaying loan 5. It was due to be repaid  on 
2 November 2012 but wasnt repaid until 2 August 2013. Miss I had to enter into a 
repayment plan and during this time she made  it clear the most she could afford  to 
repay was about  £80 a month.  Loan  6 was then approved just five days  after loan 5 
was repaid. Given that QuickQuid was aware  of Miss Is recent financial difficulties   
and that it had information suggesting  Miss Is true disposable income  was lower 
than it was estimating   it ought to have  realised it was more  likely than not Miss I 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances and that her indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN46633013The new facility provided  Miss I with her largest loan up to that point. QuickQuid 
ought to have realised this meant  Miss I wasnt  making  any real inroads to the 
amount she owed it. 
Loan 13 was taken out nearly  five years  after loan 4 (the first loan Im looking at and 
the first in this chain  of continuous  borrowing).  And it was for a larger  amount. Miss I 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to QuickQuid over an 
extended period.
I think that Miss I lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Is indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans, deferrals and payment  arrangements was likely  to have 
had negative implications on Miss Is ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6-13 too.
Id like to make it clear I have considered all the points QuickQuid raised  in response to the 
adjudicator. This includes the document QuickQuid provided about the changes  it made  to 
its lending processes in 2015. QuickQuid will be aware of what  this service  has previously 
said about that document, so I wont comment on it here  although I did take it into account.
More broadly, QuickQuid  has said it doesnt  accept that a pattern of lending can, in itself, be 
indicative of a problem.  Again, theres  little I can add to what  QuickQuid already knowns 
from previous decisions  and the information published on our website.
In Miss Is case, loans  4-13 cover a period  spanning August 2012 to June 2017  a period of 
about 57 months. I have  noted that during this time, there is (cumulatively)  a period of more  
than a year during which Miss I was not indebted to QuickQuid. But Ive also noted that there  
was no break between loan 4 and 5 and then only a gap of five days  between  5 and 6  
despite the repayment problems I mentioned  above. Miss I went  on to make  a large number 
of drawdowns from the FlexCredit facility,  which  ran for about  20 months.
There were some larger gaps later in the chain of lending. But as they occur  after I think 
QuickQuid shouldve stopped lending to Miss I, Ive placed less weight  on these. And I dont 
in any event think the larger gaps are so significant  that QuickQuid could safely assume they 
represent a true break in the lending during which time Miss Is situation may have improved.
The points raised by QuickQuid have not changed my decision.
Ref: DRN46633014putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss I paid on the loans approved  on and after 
17 October 2012;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5b from Miss Is credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 onwards should be removed from 
Miss Is credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Miss I a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Is complaint. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by taking  the steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss I to accept or 
reject my decision  before

Loan 6 was an open-ended credit (agreement QuickQuid called FlexCredit. It allowed Miss I to make 
drawdowns up to a limit (in this case £550)  and repay them  in up to 10 months.  Miss I made  17 
drawdowns between  August  2013 and December  2014  totalling  about £1,924.  The largest  repayment  
figure of £174  assumes Miss I draws down the maximum  amounts and repays it in 10 instalments.
