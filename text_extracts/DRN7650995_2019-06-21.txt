K820x#14complaint
Mr Z has complained that National  Westminster  Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt  close  his loan 
account down  when they should have, and this adversely affected  his credit score. 
background
Mr Z took out a loan with NatWest in 2016.  He took out another  loan with them in April 2017, 
using some of the money from the second loan to repay the first loan.  There was a problem 
with the final direct debit  payment for the first loan, which meant this loan stayed open when 
it shouldnt have done. NatWest closed the loan in July 2018.
Our adjudicator found that NatWest  made  a mistake when  closing the first loan, which  meant 
it stayed open  when it shouldnt have. But she felt that NatWest  acted reasonably  by closing 
the loan and writing  off the outstanding balance. Because of this, she felt NatWest didnt 
need to pay Mr Z any compensation. 
NatWest agreed with the adjudicator but Mr Z didnt. He feels  that NatWests error  had a 
negative impact on his credit score, which affected  him financially.  He also says he had 15 
months of distress and inconvenience and panic because  of what  happened.  He believes 
that NatWest should pay him some compensation. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
loan closure
Mr Z repaid the first loan with NatWest  on 24 April 2017, but his next loan payment was due 
to be collected  by direct debit on 26 April.  Because of this, NatWest  refunded  £261.81 of the 
settlement funds to Mr Zs current  account,  expecting the 26 April payment to clear the loan. 
But NatWest  also cancelled the direct debit, which meant that the 26 April payment was not 
collected. This meant that the loan stayed open  with an outstanding balance. It also meant  
that Mr Z received a refund of £261.81 he wasnt entitled to. 
In July 2018 NatWest  closed  the loan and wrote  off the outstanding balance,  meaning that 
Mr Z didnt  have to pay back the refund hed received.  I think  this was a fair way for NatWest 
to put things right.
Mr Zs credit file
Mr Z has provided  a copy of his credit  file. This shows that, between April 2017  and July 
2018, he had two NatWest loans and that his total borrowing was £262  more than it actually 
was  because  the first loan had an outstanding balance.  The credit file doesnt show  any 
negative or adverse entries (arrears etc.) relating  to the first loan. 
Mr Z says his credit score was affected  because of NatWests  actions.  He says he has been 
refused for even  [a] mobile contract or any kind of credit because of this, and it resulted [in] 
unsuccessful applications for jobs.
Ref: DRN76509952While Mr Z says this was the case, I havent  seen any evidence that hes been  turned down 
for either credit or a job because of having  the two NatWest loans on his credit file instead  of 
one. I cant comment on Mr Zs credit  score itself, as there are a number of factors that make 
up a score. But as Ive not seen any adverse entries  from NatWest in relation to the loan that 
was supposed  to have been  closed, I cant say what impact this had on Mr Zs credit  score.
I accept that Mr Z found having two loan accounts running at the same  time frustrating, but I 
cant agree  this had an adverse impact of his finances. I agree with the adjudicator that 
NatWests apology and writing off the loan was fair and reasonable in the circumstances  of 
the complaint.  So I wont  be asking them to do anything more.
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above I dont uphold Mr Zs complaint about National Westminster 
Bank Plc.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr Z to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 July 2019.
