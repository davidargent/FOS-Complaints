K821x#15complaint
Ms B complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC trading  as QuickQuid and Pounds  to Pocket  was 
irresponsible when  it provided a number of loans to her.
background
For ease of reference Ill refer to CashEuroNet UK LLC as CEN and Ive rounded  figures to 
the nearest whole number. Ive also prepared a table from some of the information CEN has 
provided about Ms Bs loans. This can be found in the annex to this decision.
Ms B took 24 loans  with CEN. 19 were payday loans  from QuickQuid. She also took two 
instalment loans from Pounds to Pocket  (loans 11 and 17 in the table). The second  of these 
was refinanced through new agreements on three occasions.
CEN objected to the Service looking  into the first seven of Ms Bs loans  because  it said that 
shed complained too late. Ms B has withdrawn her complaint about those so I am only 
making a decision  about the 17 loans taken from 25 April 2012 onwards (Loan  8 onwards).
In its final response letter  CEN made an offer to refund some interest and charges on one of 
the loans and to write  off Ms Bs outstanding balance on the last loan.  She didnt accept this 
offer.
Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Bs complaint  and thought the loans  from Loan  8 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. He thought that CEN  shouldve realised, from the pattern of 
lending, that Ms Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably and so it wouldnt  be right to 
continue to lend to her. CEN  disagreed and so the complaint  has been passed  to me  an 
ombudsman  for a final decision. If Ms B accepts this decision it will be binding on the 
parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have thought about what CEN has told us in response to our adjudicators recommendation 
but Im satisfied that Ms Bs complaint should  be upheld. I realise that CEN will be 
disappointed but I hope that my explanation below will help it understand why I've reached  
my decision.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending  including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly  speaking,  
this all means that CEN needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice,  this means it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make 
sure Ms B could  repay her loans in a sustainable  manner.  Additionally,  there may come a 
point where the lending  history and pattern of lending itself clearly  demonstrates  that the 
lending was unsustainable.
I think its important to remember  that CEN didnt have to only consider whether a loan was 
affordable on a pounds and pence basis. It also had to think about whether it was affordable  
Ref: DRN96361322in a sustainable way for Ms B  so, could  she repay  her loans out of her savings  or normal 
income without having  to borrow again?  And CEN shouldve borne  in mind that the purpose 
of the short-term high-cost credit products it was providing was to solve  a short-term  cash 
flow problem.  Using this type of credit  to meeting ongoing financial needs is likely to be 
unsustainable.
As I've mentioned  above, Ms B has confirmed that she has withdrawn her complaint about 
Loans 1 to 7. So although I'm not going  to make a finding on whether or not CEN acted 
irresponsibly in respect of those loans, the fact that they were taken is something Im going 
to take into account  when  considering the complaint about Loans  8 to 24.
By the time Ms B took 8  the first loan Im making  a decision on  shed taken seven  loans 
and three  top-ups in fifteen months  during which time she had only been  free of debt for 
around 18 days. Loan 8 was one of the highest  amounts shed borrowed and before she 
repaid it she topped it up with a further £400  advance. I think  it was clear at this point, if not 
before, that Ms Bs lending pattern  had become unsustainable.  On the same day Ms B 
repaid Loan 8 she took Loan 9 which was for £700. The same  happened when she repaid 
Loan 9: she immediately took Loan 10.
On repayment  of Loan 10 Ms Bs pattern of borrowing changed slightly in that she didnt 
return to QuickQuid for another payday  loan. She went  to the sister lender - Pounds  to 
Pocket - and took an instalment  loan of £1,150 to be repaid  over the course  of a year. Within 
six weeks - whilst the instalment loan was still outstanding - Ms B went  back to QuickQuid 
for another  payday loan (Loan 12). Loans  12A and 13 were also taken whilst the instalment 
loan was still live. It was eventually repaid on the day Ms B took Loan 14. Both Loans 13 and 
14 were payday loans for £950.
I acknowledge that Loans 15 and 16 were  for smaller amounts. And there were short breaks 
between the loans. But - given the background - I'm not persuaded that it was reasonable for 
QuickQuid to think that Ms B would be in a position to manage her repayments sustainably.  
Indeed 18 days  after Ms B repaid  Loan  16 she again returned to Pounds  to Pocket for an 
instalment loan which she refinanced three  times  each time adding further principal to the 
amount borrowed  and extending the term, even though shed been assessed for a late fee 
before the second refinance. And payday  loans 21 to 24 were all taken whilst Ms B was still 
repaying Pounds to Pocket  Loans 17 to 20. The cycle  was finally  broken  with Loan 24 which  
Ms B failed to repay as agreed. There is still a balance outstanding on that loan.
So Im satisfied that the lending history and particularly the pattern of Ms Bs borrowing 
demonstrated that further lending would likely be unsustainable  as far back early 2012. That 
pattern was clearly  indicative of a borrower  struggling to make ends meet  someone who 
was using high-cost  credit  to plug holes in her finances caused by the repayment of previous 
loans.  
So I think CEN was irresponsible to provide Loan 8 and all further advances from that point.
putting things right
I require CEN to
refund  all interest and charges Ms B paid on Loans 8 to 23 inclusive (as outlined in 
my table  in the annex)
Ref: DRN96361323pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove all interest and charges from the outstanding balance  on Loan 24 and apply 
any payments made by Ms B on Loan  24 against the principal sum originally 
borrowed. From what I can see it seems Ms B would then have repaid the principal 
owed in early 2016. From  the point she did repay the principal, CEN should refund all 
further payments  of interest and charges made by Ms B on Loan  24 and pay interest  
of 8% simple a year on those further refunded payments from the date they were 
paid to the date of settlement*
the number  of loans taken from 25 April 2012  onwards means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about loans approved  from this point 
onwards should  be removed  from Ms Bs credit  file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires CEN to take off tax from this interest. CEN must give 
Ms B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above I uphold Ms Bs complaint and require CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
to put things right in the way Ive explained.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 31 August 2019.
