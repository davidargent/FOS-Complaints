The complaint
Mr A complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he paid for a holiday ownership product. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr A entered into a credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in March 2007 and 
he used Â£14,921 of the credit that was available to him to pay for a holiday ownership 
product. The credit was on buy now  pay later terms so the payment wouldnt be charged 
to his accounts until six months after the purchase. Barclays Partner Finance says that the 
credit was repaid in October 2007.
Mr As representative, on behalf of Mr A, made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in 
February 2021 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Barclays 
Partner Finance didnt respond to those claims so a complaint was made to this service. 
Mr As complaint form says that: Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the holiday 
company which wasnt declared to Mr A; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr As ability to afford the loan (though it should have referred to the 
credit), unduly pressured him into entering the contracts and used aggressive commercial 
practices to pressure him; the product was misrepresented to him; and the holiday company 
was in liquidation so was in breach of contract as it cant provide the goods or service sold to 
Mr A; all rendering the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140. It said that the claim should 
also be considered under section 75. 
Mr A also provided a client statement in support of his claims in which he also described 
other purchases of holiday products  but I consider it to be clear from his representatives 
February 2021 letter and his complaint form that his complaint is about the purchase that he 
made in March 2007 (and the only document from the time of the purchases that has been 
provided is the credit card agreement that he signed in March 2007).
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr As complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of Mr As misrepresentation claim 
under section 75 to turn it down. He said that the resorts at which Mr A had his holiday 
ownership product were continuing to offer their services regardless of the holiday 
companys liquidation so he didnt think that there had been a breach of contract. He thought 
that Mr As section 140A claim was raised too late and he said that he hadnt seen any 
persuasive evidence to show that the credit was unaffordable for Mr A.
Mr As representative, on behalf of Mr A, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It said that it had instructed counsel to provide detailed submissions about the 
time bar, but no further information or submissions have been received. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr As complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr As complaint is about Barclays Partner Finances response to the claims that had 
been made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six 
years of the date of his representatives February 2021 letter to Barclays Partner 
Finance - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to his 
claims;
Mr As claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr As claim under section 75 is that the holiday company has gone into liquidation 
so is in breach of contract and that the holiday product was misrepresented to him 
and that he wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to him - if the 
criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would be 
expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr A could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him into buying 
the holiday product in March 2007 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been incurred 
as that was when he also entered into the credit card agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made under section 75 
until February 2021, nearly fourteen years later which was outside of the time limits 
set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a 
defence to the claim and I find that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have 
rejected that claim;
the time limit for a breach of contract claim is also six years from the date on which 
the cause of action accrued  I understand that the holiday company went into 
liquidation in January 2020 and Mr As representative made a breach of contract 
claim to Barclays Partner Finance in February 2021 so I consider that Mr As breach of contract claim was made in time;
our investigator said that the resorts at which Mr A had his holiday ownership product 
were continuing to offer their services regardless of the holiday companys liquidation 
so he didnt think that there had been a breach of contract  neither Mr A nor his 
representative has provided any further evidence in response to that finding to show 
that Mr As use of his holiday ownership product has been adversely impacted by the 
liquidation of the holiday company;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr As use of his 
holiday ownership product has been adversely impacted by the liquidation of the 
holiday company so I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
require Barclays Partner Finance to take any action under section 75 in response to 
the liquidation of the holiday company;
Mr As representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr A and 
Barclays Partner Finance because Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to 
the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mr A and the holiday company unduly 
pressured him into entering the contracts and used aggressive commercial practices 
to pressure him;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit was repaid in October 2007 and the 
buy now  pay later period ended in September 2007  Ive not been provided with 
any evidence to show that the credit card agreement continued after October 2007 
so Im satisfied that the credit card agreement ended in October 2007;
Mr A would have had six years from then to bring a claim under section 140A against 
Barclays Partner Finance but a claim wasnt made until February 2021, more than 
thirteen years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act 
so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a defence to the claim and I find that 
it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have rejected that claim; 
Mr As representative also says that the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr As ability to afford the credit but Mr A says that he used a pension 
lump-sum" to repay the credit and Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit card 
agreement ended in October 2007;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the credit wasnt affordable for Mr A in March 
2007 when it was made available to him or that hes experienced any financial 
difficulties since then; 
Ive also seen no evidence to show that Mr A asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its assessment of his ability to afford the credit before his 
representatives February 2021 letter  as the credit was made available to him in 
March 2007 and was repaid in October 2007, I consider that it would be reasonable 
to expect him to have raised any concerns about that assessment or the affordability 
of the credit before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the credit wasnt 
affordable for Mr A in March 2007 when it was made available to him;Barclays Partner Finance didnt respond to the claims that had been made to it so I 
cant say that its response to them was fair and reasonable  but if it had properly 
responded to Mr As claims I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for 
it not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mr A for the issues that hes had with his holiday ownership 
product and the other difficulties that hes described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair 
or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to 
refund to him any of the money that he paid under the credit card agreement, to pay 
him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 October 2023.
