The complaint
Mr S is unhappy with how TransUnion International UK Limited has handled updating his 
credit file to show he is registered on the electoral roll. 
What happened
On 24 January 2021 Mr S raised his concern that he was not appearing on the electoral roll 
and referred to the suggestion that his dispute had been successfully resolved in December 
2020. TransUnion responded on 29 January 2021 to assure Mr S the changes had been 
made. 
On 4 February 2021 Mr S queried why he was still not showing on the electoral roll. 
When TransUnion replied this time (on 5 February 2021) they apologised to Mr S for any 
confusion as it appeared a previous dispute to remove the wrong address from Mr Ss credit 
file had caused confusion with Mr Ss concerns that he was not appearing on the electoral 
roll. TransUnion explained that to update Mr Ss details to show he was on the electoral roll 
they would need to see an email or scanned copy or photocopy from Mr Ss local council to 
confirm his registration dates. 
On the same day  5 February 2021  Mr S emailed his local council, who replied to Mr S on 
9 February 2021. The local council confirmed to Mr S that he had been on the electoral roll 
since June 2017. Mr S forwarded the councils email to TransUnion on the same day. 
On 22 February 2021 TransUnion emailed Mr S to say that after investigation they could 
confirm they were making arrangements for the disputed entry to be amended on Mr Ss 
credit report. 
TransUnions notes on 29 June 2021 show they had recorded Mr S raising a dispute about 
the electoral roll and that they were awaiting evidence. And on 15 July 2021 their notes 
record that as no acceptable evidence was received from Mr S they were unable to progress 
things any further. 
Mr S contacted TransUnion again on 19 November 2021 to say his credit file still didnt 
appear to show him registered on the electoral roll. And as he received no response from 
TransUnion he emailed them again on 22 February 2022 and at the same time enquired 
about TransUnions complaint procedure. 
TransUnion considered Mr Ss complaint and approached their data team with Mr Ss email 
from the local council to see if it would be acceptable to amend his details. After their data 
team amended Mr Ss credit file, on 31 March 2022 TransUnion sent Mr S their final 
response about his complaint. 
Mr S brought his complaint to our service on 31 March 2022 with a screenshot to show that 
his report was still not providing any information about him being on the electoral roll. 
Our investigator reviewed what had happened and noted there was no evidence to support 
Mr Ss credit file had been updated - they proposed TransUnion update Mr Ss records and 
pay him £100 to resolve matters. This prompted TransUnion to provide their own 
screenshots showing Mr Ss electoral roll details had been updated on 31 March 2022. 
TransUnion also said theyd not done anything wrong as they couldnt update Mr Ss credit 
file without the appropriate evidence. TransUnion pointed out they had now updated Mr Ss 
records and they disagreed with the £100 payment proposed by the investigator. And they 
said Mr S should have known that some of their emails related to the previous problem with 
a wrong address rather than the matter to do with reporting Mr S on the electoral roll  so 
any confusion here wasnt their fault. 
Our investigator acknowledged Mr Ss details had been updated, but concluded that 
TransUnion should still pay Mr S £100 to reflect the inconvenience the matter had caused 
him in sorting this out. TransUnion disagreed, but provided no further submissions. 
As our investigator was unable to reach a resolution between the parties, the complaint has 
come to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I think Mr Ss complaint should be upheld for broadly the same reasons as 
the investigator. The parties should note that while Ive only included a summary of events 
above, Ive considered all the available evidence and submissions. 
Its not in dispute that Mr Ss credit file with TransUnion was not reporting him on the 
electoral roll. Or that there was an earlier dispute about a wrong address. But it seems these 
two events have caused some confusion in the exchanges between Mr S and TransUnion.
 
That said, I think its fair to say TransUnion were aware that Mr S was looking to have his 
electoral roll details updated on his credit file. And according to TransUnions emails, they 
acknowledged to Mr S on 5 February 2021 the confusion between the two events, and 
explained to Mr M the previous issue about the wrong address had been dealt with 
successfully as the address was removed. So I think its reasonable to say Mr S would have 
taken from this that the only matter outstanding now was the issue of reporting him on the 
electoral roll. 
Mr S emailed TransUnion on 9 February 2021 with a copy of his local councils email 
confirming hed been on the electoral roll since June 2017. It appears Mr S used the same 
TransUnion email address as he had done previously to communicate with TransUnion  so 
I think its fair to say from this point TransUnion had an email confirming Mr S was on the 
electoral roll. 
TransUnion suggest Mr S should have known their email to him on 22 February 2021 related 
to the earlier issue about the wrong address. But this email provided no detail of what the 
disputed entry was, and as Ive already noted from TransUnions email of 5 February 2021, 
I think its fair to say Mr S could reasonably have assumed the earlier matter already 
resolved, so that the 22 February 2021 email was in reply to his concerns about the electoral 
roll information. 
TransUnion provided screenshots of their logs and notes from 29 June 2021 and 15 July 
2021 which would suggest these related to the matter of the electoral roll. But I cant see 
what prompted them to create these notes given Mr Ss evidence is he last contacted 
TransUnion on 9 February 2021. I also think it likely that if there had been communications with Mr S around the end of June 2021, Mr S would simply have re-sent his email from the 
council as evidence of being on the electoral roll (as he did later on). 
Mr S further chased TransUnion in November 2021 and February 2022 as Ive described 
above. And eventually TransUnion accepted the email Mr S had sent on 9 February 2021 to 
update his electoral roll information. 
I think there are unclear points in the history of these events, but overall I have no reason to 
believe TransUnion did not have access to Mr Ss email from the council sooner than they 
have alleged, or that they could not have acknowledged some of Mr Ss emails sooner than 
they did to try and resolve the issue for Mr S earlier. Mr S raised and chased this matter with 
TransUnion on several occasions and it appears only when he made a complaint 
TransUnion sorted out the matter. 
Mr S has not mentioned any particular financial loss caused to him because of this problem, 
so I therefore think the offer of £100 is fair in the circumstances of this case to recognise the 
inconvenience having to sort this out has had for Mr S. 
Putting things right
TransUnion International UK Limited should pay Mr S £100.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint and TransUnion International UK Limited 
should pay Mr S £100. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2022.
