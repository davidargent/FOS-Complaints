The complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) didnt treat him fairly after he 
reported falling victim to a scam. 
What happened
Mr S needed to put insurance in place for a new car. He found what appeared to be a broker 
offering insurance for a good price. 
Mr S decided to go ahead. He was quoted a total price of £868.16, to cover the full cost of 
the insurance and an administrative fee.
Mr S wanted to make the payment using PayPal. The broker told him that payment would 
need to be received within 24 hours to allow the cover to be implemented with immediate 
effect, this Mr Ss requirement. But the broker warned that if Mr S sent the payment using 
PayPals for goods and services option it could take up to two weeks for the payment to be 
received. 
Mr S was told because he wanted the cover sooner, hed need to send the money using 
PayPals for friends and family payment option, and that this would immediately credit the 
brokers account.
Mr S sent the payment accordingly on 23 October 2022 at 11:16. He chose the for friends 
and family payment option as the broker had advised. 
Initially the broker said the money hadnt arrived. But when Mr S contacted PayPal, it told 
him the funds had been sent. Then later that day, the broker stopped responding to Mr S 
altogether. Despite having made the requisite payment, no policy was set up, and Mr S was 
unable to obtain a refund.
Concerned hed been scammed, Mr S called PayPal to report the transaction. That second 
call took place at around 17:35 on the same day. PayPal told him hed need to contact his 
bank and ask it to raise a chargeback. Because hed sent the money using the friends and 
family option, no protection was available through PayPals buyer protection scheme.
But when Mr S requested a chargeback with his bank, he was told there was no prospect of 
raising a valid chargeback in these circumstances. He was left significantly out of pocket. 
Mr S complained to PayPal, but PayPal reiterated that it could not help him, and again 
referred him back to his bank.
Our Investigator looked into what had happened. The Investigator said the payment Mr S 
had sent wasnt sufficiently unusual that he thought PayPal should have blocked it at the 
time, or otherwise have taken steps to intervene before processing it. But he noted that 
PayPals records showed that the sum of £568.16 had remained on the beneficiary PayPal 
account for over 24 hours after Mr Ss call to PayPal in which hed reported the scam.
The Investigator said PayPal ought to have taken steps following Mr Ss report of the scam, 
and that the money left on the beneficiary account should therefore have been prevented 
from leaving the account and ultimately returned to Mr S. He said PayPal should pay the 
equivalent sum to Mr S together with interest at a rate of 8% simple per year.
Mr S accepted the Investigators findings. But PayPal disagreed. It reiterated that Mr S had 
chosen to send the payment using its friends and family option, so he could not be refunded.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where 
appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time. 
In broad terms, the starting position in law is that a financial institution is expected to process 
payments and withdrawals that a customer authorises it to make without undue delay, in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the customers account. And I have taken that 
into account when deciding what is fair and reasonable in this case. 
Both parties agree that Mr S authorised this transaction, in the belief he was making a 
genuine payment for car insurance. Because of this, PayPal had an obligation to follow his 
instruction. 
The payment wasnt one I think should have caused PayPal obvious concern that Mr S 
might be at risk of financial harm through fraud or scam. I accept that it was simply not 
sufficiently unusual or remarkable in the context of a typical PayPal payment. So, I dont find 
PayPal at fault in not intervening before processing the instruction.
Furthermore, I accept PayPals point that its buyer protection policy doesnt apply to 
personal payments (the result of choosing the for friends and family option). This payment 
reason is designed for payments between friends and family and not to pay for goods and 
services. 
But I have to consider whether PayPal ought fairly and reasonably to have taken steps to 
assist Mr S, when he first reported the scam - regardless of him selecting family and friends 
and the regardless of the fact that PayPals buyer protection policy doesnt apply to this type 
of payment. 
Having thought about this carefully, I find it fair and reasonable to expect that PayPal should 
have taken steps beyond those it did. When Mr S raised the matter, I would have expected 
PayPal to have reasonably done what it could to try and help him. 
Industry good practice at the time offered bank customers the ability to claim back payments 
where theyd been the victim of a payment scam. PayPal, as operator of its own payment 
scheme, is not part of that banking model. But I can consider, as Ive noted above, whether 
those principles can (being good industry practice) be considered more widely.
I consider it fair and reasonable to have expected PayPal, where it is running both the 
sending and recipient accounts, to make an attempt to recover the funds, when one of its 
customers reports a scam to it and so try and help them recover their loss. Mr S had 
reported the scam and Im satisfied that report was conveyed unambiguously to PayPal in 
the call at 17:35.But, it doesnt automatically follow that where PayPal, in the circumstances of this complaint, 
didnt try to recover the funds, it must necessarily be required to refund Mr S. I also have to 
take into consideration what is more likely than not to have happened, had PayPal tried to do 
so. 
Here, not all of the funds remained. Some had already been moved on before the scam was 
reported. I cannot fairly hold PayPal liable for that sum  that loss did not result from PayPal 
failing to act on the scam report sooner, it was unavoidable at that point.
But I do find it fair and reasonable to hold PayPal liable for the sum that did remain in the 
beneficiary account at that point. PayPals own records show this sum to have been 
£568.16, and it remained on the account for some time after Mr Ss report. I consider that 
had PayPal taken the steps I consider it reasonably ought to have taken, these funds would 
ultimately have been recovered and returned to Mr S. Because it did not do so, I find it fair 
and reasonable in all the circumstances that PayPal should now reimburse Mr S accordingly.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I uphold this complaint. PayPal (Europe) Sarl & Cie 
SCA now needs to pay Mr S:
- the sum of £568.16, that being the amount I find it ought to have recovered at the 
time Mr S reported the scam on 23 October 2022; and,
- interest on that amount at the rate of 8% simple interest per annum from 23 October 
2022 until the date of settlement. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2023.
