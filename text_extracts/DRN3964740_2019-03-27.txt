K820x#14complaint
Miss S complains  that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) didnt process a refund 
correctly.
background
Miss S paid for two purchases  from a clothes retailer in November 2017 using her PayPal 
account. S also made two visits to the retailers store to return some of the items  shed 
bought. The first return was in December and the second was in February  2018.  Miss S has 
shared receipts  showing that the retailer processed the returns in the store but she didnt 
receive the money into her PayPal account or her credit card account.
Miss S says she contacted her credit  card issuer about the problem and they opened 
chargeback cases for the two amounts. The first chargeback  was approved  and processed  
in January 2018. The second chargeback was also approved by Miss Ss card issuer  but she 
says she didnt receive the refund  into her account.
Miss S has complained  to PayPal and asked  for her second refunded amount to be returned  
to her. PayPal didnt  uphold her complaint. First it said that the retailer hadnt initiated the 
refund. Then after the chargeback had been processed it says Miss S should  have been 
reimbursed directly by her card issuer. PayPal says it doesnt process chargebacks  itself,  but 
reverses the original  transaction   and both refunded amounts were  reversed from the 
retailer to the card issuer  here, so it thinks theres  nothing more to be done. 
Miss S was unhappy  with PayPals response  and referred her complaint to our service.  She 
says shes contacted the retailer and her card issuer  but theyve said they dont  have the 
money. An investigator considered Miss Ss complaint but didnt uphold it because  they 
couldnt see any evidence  to suggest  that PayPal had made a mistake or kept her money. 
During their review, PayPal offered to pay Miss S £11.50  the difference  between  what  
shed originally spent  and the total amount of the chargebacks  as a gesture of goodwill. 
Miss S wasnt satisfied with this view and asked for a final ombudsman  decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that this situation  must have been  very frustrating and upsetting  for Miss S, 
because shes not been able to find out what happened to her money. But Ive considered  all 
the evidence and Im not persuaded that PayPal  has made  a mistake here so I havent 
upheld her complaint.  Ill explain why. 
Its unclear why Miss S didnt receive her refund from the retailer through her PayPal 
account. I know shes tried to contact the retailer to get an answer  but hasnt been 
successful. But having reviewed all the evidence it doesnt seem to me that the retailer  
issued the refund to Miss S through PayPal as shed  expected.  So while  I realise that Miss S 
made her payment through PayPal and may have expected to receive the refund through it 
too  that doesnt look to be whats happened  here.
When Miss S raised her first chargeback claim her card issuer credited her account  with a 
balance adjustment,  with no money  passing  through her PayPal account.  Her card issuer 
Ref: DRN39647402was reimbursed from the retailer, through PayPal. This ties in with PayPals explanation that 
it doesnt approve or process chargeback claims on behalf of the card issuer. 
When she didnt receive her second refund  from the retailer, Miss Ss card issuer raised 
another chargeback claim on her behalf. Miss S said in April 2018 that her card issuer had 
told her this claim was successful, so she shouldve  received the refund to her credit  card 
within the next fortnight. This corresponds with PayPals records  that the second chargeback 
claim had been  approved  by her card issuer in May 2018. So Miss S wouldve  received  her 
money back from her card issuer   and her card issuer wouldve  been reimbursed by the 
retailer - in turn through PayPal. PayPal has confirmed that this amount was returned  from 
the retailers PayPal  account to her card issuer. Here  it looks like Miss Ss credit card 
issuer wouldve been the one refunding her account  directly once the chargeback claim was 
approved. But Im not considering the actions of that business, Im considering what  PayPal 
has done here. 
PayPal has explained  that it cant pursue Miss Ss original refund with the retailer  because  - 
according to its records - she was refunded by her card issuer  through the chargeback. A 
consumer cant be refunded twice for the same  thing, something thats explained in PayPals 
terms and conditions that Miss S accepted. But PayPal has said that if Miss S can evidence  
that her card issuer  hasnt refunded her, it could look into the matter  again. I suggest Miss S 
contacts PayPal again if she can provide this evidence that she hasnt been refunded to see 
if theres anything more it can do. 
Since we became involved, PayPal has also offered to credit Miss Ss PayPal account by 
£11.50 as a gesture of goodwill, because the chargeback amount was slightly different to the 
amount shed paid.  I dont  think PayPal was at fault here, so I think  thats a more  than 
reasonable offer to resolve  this dispute.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should  credit Miss Ss 
account with £11.50.  I make no further award  though.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 April 2019.
