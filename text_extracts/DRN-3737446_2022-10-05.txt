The complaint
Mr W complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) wont allow him to add his son 
to his account.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr W has a Reward Black account with NatWest in his sole name. Its a packaged bank 
account, meaning it comes with certain features in return for a monthly fee. In 2021 Mr W 
asked for his son to be made a joint account holder. To date, this hasnt happened, and that 
is the crux of Mr Ws complaint. 
NatWest has explained to our service it withdrew packaged bank account products 
(including the ability to add a party to existing accounts) in March 2020. This was because of 
the impact of the pandemic on the insurance the accounts provided. Given the disruption 
caused by the pandemic on travel, and therefore travel insurance, I find this was reasonable. 
In any case, its for NatWest to decide what products it offers.
In November 2020, NatWest changed its policy. It decided it would allow existing joint 
accounts to be upgraded, but not allow new customers to open packaged bank accounts, or 
allow existing packaged bank accounts to be made joint. NatWest is entitled to set these 
sorts of policies, and while an inconvenience to Mr W, he isnt being treated differently to 
others, so Im not persuaded hes been treated unfairly by not getting what he wants. 
NatWests policy hasnt changed since, so I cant fairly require NatWest to make Mr Ws 
account joint. NatWest, however, didnt handle this matter well. It didnt make clear to Mr W 
he would be unable to make his account joint for some time, and in the preceding months he 
appears to have been given differing instructions on how to do it, and been provided with 
some poor customer service. This caused Mr W unnecessary distress and inconvenience. 
Compensation is appropriate. NatWest offered Mr W a gift. Our investigator recommended 
Mr W be paid £50 compensation, which NatWest has since paid. NatWest has further said it 
is still willing to send Mr W a gift. I consider a gift and £50 compensation a fair resolution to 
this complaint.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require National Westminster Bank Plc to send Mr W a gift, as it 
has offered to do.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 November 2022.
