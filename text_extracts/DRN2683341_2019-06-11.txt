K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs M complain  that a mortgage offer issued by Barclays Bank UK PLC was 
ambiguous about  the expiry date of their fixed-rate mortgage product.
To resolve  their complaint  they want Barclays to give them the benefit  of the 2-year  fixed 
rate until April 2020.
background
Mr and Mrs M applied to re-mortgage their property  to Barclays  from another  lender. They  
told their broker  that they were looking for a completion date no earlier than 1 April 2018,  as 
otherwise the existing  lender would  make an early repayment charge. They took a two-year  
fixed-interest product  with the new mortgage.
The mortgage application proceeded to completion in April 2018 and they expected  that they 
would make 24 payments  at the new fixed rate. However they later found  out that the 
product would expire on 31 October  2019.  They feel that the Barclays offer was ambiguous.
On their complaint  to Barclays  it said the offer letter was generated using the first available  
date that the mortgage product could theoretically start. This was dependent on any current 
fixed rates  or pending the completion of the mortgage application. The offer specified  a 
fixed rate of 1.09% that will apply from completion until 31 October 2019. As this was the 
offer Mr and Mrs M had agreed  to and the product was chosen through  a broker, Barclays  
didnt consider it had made any error.  However it paid £200 to Mr and Mrs M for the distress  
and inconvenience  they felt from the rate ending on 31 October 2019.
Mr and Mrs M werent happy with this and brought their complaint to this service. They said 
there were ambiguities in the mortgage  offer which meant that their having  made  it clear  
when they wished to complete, it was logical to expect that the fixed  rate would run for two 
years after completion. The offer was evidently based on the mortgage  start date being 1 
November 2017.  
They said the ambiguous statements in the offer made it reasonable for them to assume, 
after the action  theyd taken, that the fixed rate would run until 31 March 2020 based  on a 
1 April 2018 start date.  These included:
this offer is provided on Barclays 2Yr Fixed  1.09% S&S Legal  (AW57) mortgage".
a fixed rate of 1.09%  that will apply from completion until 31 October 2019". See 
assumed completion date.
these payments  are based  on a loan amount of £500,999.00 and include the fees that 
are shown  in Section  8 as being  added to your mortgage and assume the mortgage  will 
start on 01 November 2017.
that there would  be "24 payments at a fixed rate of 1.09%".
Why was the fixed rate end date more important  than the proposed  start date and number of 
payments expected?  It was clearly ambiguous.
Ref: DRN26833412Our adjudicator didnt  recommend Mr and Mrs Ms complaint be upheld.  She said the key 
facts illustration dated 5 October 2017 confirmed  that: a fixed rate of 1.09% will apply from 
completion until 31 October 2019 and after this date a variable rate would apply.
The mortgage offer dated 24 October 2017 said: 
a fixed rate of 1.09%  will apply from completion  until 31 October  2019 
step 2 of your mortgage product starts after 31 October 2019, and the rate that will 
apply is a variable  rate.
after the fixed rate ends on 31 October 2019 for one percentage point increase in the 
BBBR, your monthly  payment will increase by around £262.25.
early  repayment charges are payable  until 31 October 2019.
The adjudicator said the documents provided to Mr and Mrs M by Barclays  were  clear and 
consistent, showing that the end date of the product was 31 October  2019.
The email  correspondence with Mr and Mrs Ms broker had discussed the completion date in 
April 2018 but when asked, the broker had confirmed the fixed rate would run for two years 
from completion. This information  was incorrect, but the adjudicator couldnt hold Barclays 
responsible for that.
Mr and Mrs M didnt  agree and asked  for an ombudsman to look at the case. They  said the 
adjudicator had disregarded  a key fact which provided the foundation of the complaint. 
Section 6 of the mortgage offer assumed a completion date of 1 November 2017 and an 
expected 24 month payment period at the fixed rate. 
All mention of the end date of 31 October  2019 was reliant on the assumption  in section 6. 
This was a clear error by Barclays  which allowed for an obvious ambiguity, especially in the 
light of Mr and Mrs Ms intention to complete in April 2018. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see where Mr and Mrs M are coming  from here. Barclays says that assuming 
completion on 1 November 2017,  the rate will expire on 31 October 2019. It follows  that if 
completion is later than that, then so is the expiry.
But it could equally be said from section 6 that there are 24 payments assuming a start date 
of 1 November  2017. It follows  that if the start date is later there will be fewer  payments.
I dont think Mr and Mrs M are saying that their interpretation must  be right and that Barclays  
must be wrong. The focus of their complaint is that there is ambiguity.
The need  for this wording  arises from the fact that the completion date isnt known  when the 
mortgage offer is issued.  Hence section 6 is an illustration.  But insofar as a commercial  
contract causes ambiguity, the duty to advise a party  as to the correct interpretation lies on 
that partys adviser, not on the other  party to the contract. 
Ref: DRN26833413The advice which Mr and Mrs M received from their broker in the completion pack was:
We have secured  a 2-year  fixed rate at 1.09% that runs to 31/09/2019.
That was clearly wrong as the rate ran to 31/10/2019. But thats not the essence of this 
complaint. The broker corrected the date later in the document where  it said:  On or before 
31/10/2019, you would pay 3% up to £15,030.  You will need to pay a fee of £80. On 
01/11/2019, you will revert to Woolwichs standard variable rate.  
But by this time I think Mr and Mrs M had already discerned the ambiguity. As they say: 
Why was the fixed rate end date more  important than the proposed  start date and number 
of payments expected?  It was clearly ambiguous.
So they sought advice from their broker by email dated 27 October  2017:
I also just wanted to question one thing on the mortgage offer. It states  that the 1.09% rate 
runs till 31 October 2019. I assume  though that the rate will run for 2 years from date of 
completion?
The broker  replied on 30 October: Regarding the rate, this runs for 2 years from date of 
completion.
That advice was also wrong, and in my view it was the proximate cause of the problem. 
Barclays, if asked to clarify the ambiguity,  would  have  said that the rate expired on 
31 October 2019. But Barclays wasnt Mr and Mrs Ms adviser.
Therefore Im not persuaded that Barclays actions  were the proximate cause of any loss 
which Mr and Mrs M may have sustained as a result of their misapprehension.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs M to 
accept or reject my decision  before  11 July 2019.
