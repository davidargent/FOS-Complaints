The complaint
Mrs C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc didn't raise a chargeback for her on 
debit card payments she made to a trading firm. To settle matters she'd like NatWest to 
refund the amounts paid to the trading firm
What happened
Mrs C told us she opened a trading account  with a trading firm, T, in April 2019. She used 
her debit card to make payments to her trading account. She explained that initially she 
made good profits. But towards the end of June 2019 she received a call from the firm to tell 
her she'd made significant losses. In September 2019 she found out that the profits she'd 
earned had disappeared, she could no longer access her account and her trading account 
was in debt.
In September 2019 Mrs C asked for NatWest's help to recover five payments in April and 
May 2019 of £1,160.00, £4,193.84, £638.29, £638.29 and £2,944.61 by way of chargeback. 
NatWest said it couldn't assist. In its final response letter it said it could only assist if the 
funds which debited from her account never reached her trading account.  And in Mrs C's 
case, she confirmed the monies had credited her trading account and were initially used for 
profitable trades prior to the funds being lost in later trades. 
Mrs C isn't happy with NatWest's response. She feels that because she used her debit card 
to make the transactions she should be protected either through NatWest or through Verified 
by VISA. She also says she used her debit card to pay for a service she never received.
Our investigator looked into Mrs C's complaint but he didn't recommend it should be upheld. 
He thought Mrs C received the product she'd paid for because she initially confirmed she'd 
made good profits. Although she later made losses the investigator didn't agree that 
NatWest was responsible for claiming this back under the chargeback scheme so he 
concluded that NatWest had treated her fairly.
Mrs C disagreed with the investigator's view and has asked for an ombudsman's decision.  
She thinks his view was one-sided. She reiterated that as she used her debit card this 
should provide payment protection. She also thinks that NatWest's call handlers are trained 
to support their employers.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise Mrs C may feel we are biased in favour of NatWest but it's important I reassure her 
that we're an independent and impartial service. I've considered carefully the information 
both parties have provided to reach my decision.Having considered everything Mrs C says I shall address what I consider to be the key 
issues. I must make clear that my decision is solely about NatWest's behaviour in relation to 
these transactions.  I realise Mrs C is concerned about the actions of the trading company 
but it is only NatWest's actions that fall within this service's remit.
Mrs C made the transactions from her current account to the trading firm using her debit 
card. I firstly need to think about whether the transactions themselves were properly made 
and secondly whether NatWest fulfilled its obligations when she asked it to return the 
payments.
I haven't seen anything to suggest Mrs C disputed the transactions at the time. Her own 
testimony is that she used surplus funds to trade and initially the trades were successful. 
NatWest debited the payments from her account and showed them on her statements. I 
therefore think she made the payments to the trading firm when she wanted and she didn't 
have any concerns until sometime after the transactions cleared - and she was told her 
trading account had suffered large losses.
Mrs C has suggested NatWest didn't contact her before the payments debited from her 
account. The onus is on the account holder to consent and authorise transactions. 
NatWest generally does have a duty to prevent fraud but I don't think it did anything wrong in 
processing the transactions Mrs C had authorised. 
Mrs C used her NatWest VISA debit card to make the transactions. The chargeback process 
is administered by VISA and not by NatWest. The VISA chargeback rules set out limited 
circumstances in which account providers can request the recovery of funds for account 
holders. NatWest's duty is to use its discretion to consider whether Mrs C's request for a 
chargeback fell within the circumstances of the VISA scheme rules. And in exercising such 
discretion NatWest must act fairly and reasonably. 
I appreciate Mrs C has concerns about  NatWest's call handlers but as I explained above 
NatWest doesn't set the rules of the chargeback scheme - it simply uses its discretion to 
consider if the circumstances of Mrs C's request for a chargeback fall within the 
circumstances of the VISA scheme rules. 
I must explain that the chargeback scheme is  a voluntary scheme and a consumer  has no 
right to a chargeback. 
The  VISA scheme rules potentially allow a chargeback to be raised when services aren't 
provided. In Mrs C's case she confirmed in her complaint letter to NatWest in October 2019 
that she initially received good profits and her trading account had a large credit balance in 
May/June. This demonstrates to me that she did receive services from the trading firm. I 
appreciate Mrs C was later told by the trading firm that her trading account had incurred 
losses due to unsuccessful trades but this was as a result of the actions of the trading firm. I 
can't say NatWest treated Mrs C unfairly when it reached the conclusion that it couldn't bring 
a chargeback for her on this basis.
The VISA  chargeback rules potentially allow a chargeback  to be made if the trading 
account hasn't been funded or where available funds in the trading account can't be 
withdrawn. 
I've explained above that in Mrs C's case the payments debited her account with 
NatWest and I can see from copies of Mrs C's trading account that the amounts were 
credited to her trading account. The information I've seen shows that her trading account 
was funded so I can't say NatWest acted unfairly when it said it wasn't able to bring a 
chargeback for her on this basis. appreciate she later discovered in September that she'd lost a significant amount of the profit she'd earned as a result of unsuccessful trades but I 
think NatWest acted fairly in saying it couldn't assist under the VISA rules. 
The VISA rules also allow a potential chargeback where the trading firm refuses to allow the 
cardholder to withdraw an available balance - where the cardholder is able to 
provide evidence of this. I've listened to a phone call in which Mrs C told NatWest that her 
trading account had been blocked by the trading firm and she couldn't withdraw funds. I 
have no reason to doubt Mrs C but I can't say NatWest treated her unfairly. I say this 
because she confirmed in her letter of complaint to NatWest in October 2019 that her trading 
account was in debt. This meant that there wouldn't have been any available funds for her to 
withdraw. So again I can't say NatWest acted unfairly in not bringing a chargeback for her on 
this basis.
Mrs C has explained the impact this has had on her and I sympathise with the position she 
finds herself in but for the reasons I've explained above I can't say that NatWest made a 
mistake here.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 July 2020.
