K820x#14complaint
Mr Js solicitor has summarised his compliant about A J Bell Management Ltd (AJB) in the 
following terms:
The SIPP provider failed  to heed  the guidance and implement  proper and thorough due 
diligence to protect customers.
background
Mr J says he was advised  by an IFA to transfer his pension to a SIPP  and to then invest  the 
entirety of his SIPP in the shares of a single small company.   The share was listed  on the 
Plus Market.
Mr Js complaint was looked  at by an investigator.  It was his view that the complaint should  
not be upheld.   He said it wasnt clear what Mr Js solicitor thought AJB had done wrong.  He 
said the shares Mr J bought were listed on an HMRC recognised stock exchange.  He 
therefore thought there  were no issues with Mr J being allowed to hold the share in his SIPP.   
Mr Js solicitor did not agree it said:
The Plus market  was a market for high risk small company shares.  AJB should  not 
have allowed Mr J to invest the entirety of his SIPP in a single high risk share.
By allowing Mr J to act in this way AJB failed to treat Mr J fairly.
AJB also breached COBS 2.1.1R   the clients best interests rule. 
AJB had nothing  further to add.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   Having done so, I have reached the 
same conclusions as the investigator and for the same reasons.
The bulk of the submissions made by Mr Js solicitor have concentrated on the suitability of 
the advice that Mr J was given  by his IFA.  He was advised to move  a number of pensions  
(including a final salary pension)  to a SIPP and then invest the entirety of his SIPP in a 
single high risk share.  I am not aware of Mr Js investment experience or financial 
circumstances but it seems probable that the advice he was given was unsuitable.  
However, the suitability  of any advice given by the IFA is an issue  Mr J needs to resolve with 
his IFA.  AJB is not responsible for the suitability of the advice. Mr J was given.   
AJB does have  obligations in respect of the due diligence it must  carry out on investments 
before allowing them to be held in a SIPP.  
Most of the attention and comment  around  the due diligence obligations  of SIPP  operators  
have concentrated  on issues arising  from holding non-standard investments.  However, the 
FCA has said due diligence obligations apply to all investments and not just non-standard 
investments. This was made  clear  in the FCAs Dear CEO letter  of July 2014  which  said:   
Although our thematic review focussed on non-standard investments, it is important to note 
that guidance on due diligence applies to all investments.
Ref: DRN94600822However, no specific guidance has been  issued  about appropriate due diligence on standard  
investments.  Investments listed on a recognised exchange  such as PLUS  Markets  are 
classified as standard investments.  Companies listed  on the PLUS Markets  had to abide by 
its rules.   These rules  covered things such as periodic reporting (interim and final),  the 
requirement for audited  accounts, the disclosure  of significant shareholdings and had a 
requirement for a regulated adviser to be appointed.  In my view the reassurance  provided 
by these requirements was such that it was reasonable  for AJB to have concluded that the 
shares Mr J purchased were an appropriate  investment to be held in a SIPP.
For these reasons I am satisfied that in allowing the PLUS Markets  shares to be held in Mr 
Js SIPP AJB did nothing  wrong.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 June  2020.
