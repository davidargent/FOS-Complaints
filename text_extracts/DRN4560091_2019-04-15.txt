K821x#15complaint
Mr R complains about a number of loans CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid)  lent 
to him. Mr R has said the loans were  unaffordable and was borrowing to repay debts.
background
Mr R complains about 35 loans QuickQuid lent to him between  December  2007  and 
July 2014. The loan amounts varied from £100 to £450. Ive set out some  of the information 
QuickQuid provided  about  these loans  in the appendix to this decision.
When Mr R complained through a third party, QuickQuid said hed complained  about  a 
number of the loans too late and it didnt uphold his complaint about the other  loans. 
Unhappy with QuickQuids response, Mr R referred  his complaint to this service where it was 
looked at by one of our adjudicators.
QuickQuid raised an objection to this service  looking into Mr Rs complaint about loans 1 to 
17 saying that the complaint about those loans have been made too late. As I understand it, 
Mr R has withdrawn his complaint about  those loans. And so our adjudicator  looked  at 
Mr Rs complaint about loans 18 to 35 and thought  that QuickQuid shouldnt  have lent Mr R 
loans 18 to 29 and recommended that the complaint  about  those  loans should  be upheld.  
Our adjudicator didnt  think the complaint about  loans 30 to 35 should be upheld.
QuickQuid disagreed with the adjudicators outcome  and argued that it lent the loans 
responsibly. As the complaint  hasnt been  resolved, it has come to me  an ombudsman for 
a decision.
Since our adjudication,  theres been no further  dispute about loans 30 to 35 and so my 
decision focusses on the loans still in dispute   loans 18 to 29
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Rs case. Although Im not looking at Mr Rs 
complaint about  loans  1 to 17, Ive taken them into account when thinking about  his lending  
history with QuickQuid.
Ive decided to uphold Mr Rs complaint  in part and have explained why below.
At the time of most of the loans, lenders such as QuickQuid were  regulated  by the Office of 
Fair Trading (OFT)  and at the time of the last loan, the Financial  Conduct  Authority (FCA)  
was the regulator. Both regulators  had similar guidance on lending  these types  of loans. 
Essentially, QuickQuid needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice this means that it should have carried  out proportionate  checks to 
make sure Mr R could  repay his loans  in a sustainable manner. So the fact that Mr R repaid 
all his loans, doesnt  automatically demonstrate he did so without difficulty.
Ref: DRN45600912The checks  could take into account  a number  of different things, such as how much  was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Rs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, Ive considered  the following questions in order to fairly and 
reasonably determine Mr Rs complaint. 
1.Taking  into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending increase Mr Rs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
2.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Rs complaint.
QuickQuid has told us what checks it carried out. It has said it checked Mr Rs income before 
lending each  of the loans.  I can see that Mr Rs income throughout the lending  varied from 
£1,600 to £2,100. And QuickQuid checked  Mr Rs expenses  before lending the last loan, it 
recorded his monthly  expenses  at the time as £790;  this included things like housing,  utility, 
transport, food and regular credit commitments.
QuickQuid hasnt provided a result  of its search of Mr Rs credit file and as Mr R hasnt 
provided a copy either, I cant  say there  were  entries  on the file that shouldve concerned 
QuickQuid.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 18 to 29 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Ref: DRN45600913Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Rs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending to see if there was a point at which  QuickQuid 
should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. 
And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  lending.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
18. I say this because  the amounts Mr R was borrowing were generally increasing  and in the 
instances where he wasnt borrowing more than previous  loans, he wasnt borrowing less 
either. And so there was steady chain of borrowing at least £200 and on several  occasions,  
more than that. QuickQuid ought to have realised  it was likely his indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr R wasnt making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid, and was in effect 
paying large amounts in interest to service this debt over an extended period. Mr R was 
effectively borrowing continuously  for around 16 months and during that time wasnt  able to 
free himself  from the need  to keep borrowing. To access this borrowing, he was paying large 
sums in interest and then needed to borrow again to refill the gap left in his finances. This 
wasnt a sustainable  position.
In the time Mr R was borrowing these  loans, he was dependent  on them and wasnt using 
them for their intended purpose.  QuickQuid  itself says that its loans arent  suitable  for long 
term use and I expect  that it shouldve questioned whether it was reasonable to continue  
lending to Mr R over such a long period of time. 
QuickQuid continued  to provide borrowing from loan18  onwards and Mr R lost out because:
these  loans had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive  credit over an extended  period of time,
the sheer  number of loans was likely  to have had negative  implications on Mr Rs 
ability to access  mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Rs complaint about  loans  18 to 29 because the overall  pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr R in some 
other way.  
Ref: DRN45600914putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 18 to 29;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were  paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number of loans taken from loan 18 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 18 to 29 should be removed from 
Mr Rs credit  file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Rs 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC should  pay redress  as Ive set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 May 2019.
