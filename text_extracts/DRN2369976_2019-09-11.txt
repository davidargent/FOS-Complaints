K821x#15Complaint
Mr G is unhappy with the way National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has dealt with his 
requests to transfer  funds to his barrister.  He feels NatWest didnt respond to his letters 
causing delay,  and didnt recognise he needs more help because  he was in prison.
Background
Mr G wrote to NatWest  in August 2018  to ask it to transfer £2,400 to his barrister for his 
appeal. He had to chase NatWest and received  a reply over five weeks  later. On the day 
Mr G sent a further chasing  letter.  NatWest  responded  and said it was unable  to process the 
request as Mr G hadnt signed an instruction. It suggested Mr G re-submit the request to his 
branch, send a fax or visit the website. As Mr G was in prison he was unable to take any of 
these steps. 
Mr G complained to NatWest. It issued a final response and said it had responded to all of 
his letters. It also explained it couldnt  make the payment to Mr Gs barrister because it 
needed confirmation of his signature.  It suggested Mr G speak  to a prison liaison officer.  
Mr G wasnt happy with NatWests response  as he didnt think  hed been treated fairly so he 
referred his complaint to this service.  
Our investigator looked into the complaint and thought NatWest hadnt responded to Mr G in 
a timely  manner or taken into account  his circumstances while  in prison. She said NatWest  
should have made the requested payment  as Mr G had signed his instruction and the 
signature wasnt dissimilar to the one NatWest held from 2009. She upheld  the complaint 
and recommended that NatWest pay Mr G £250 for delays and stress caused in the 
circumstances. NatWest  accepted the investigators findings and agreed to pay the £250 she 
suggested. 
Mr G accepted the investigators reasons  but didnt accept the £250 recommended offer. He 
didnt think the amount  was enough  to recognise the delays and stress  he had suffered. The 
complaints therefore  been  passed  to me to make a final decision.
My findings
I can see that NatWest has accepted it could have done better in dealing  with Mr Gs request 
to transfer the money to his barrister.  Its therefore agreed to pay Mr G £250 in recognition of 
its failings. 
The key issue thats still in dispute is whether the offer is fair in the circumstances of this 
complaint. So this is what I need to decide.   
The crux of the matter  was that NatWest  required a more up to date signature for Mr G as 
the signature on his recent communication didnt match. But when Mr G asked NatWest  to 
transfer the funds  on more than one occasion,  the bank didnt make him aware there was an 
issue with his signature. This was only communicated in the final response of October 2018. 
Until then Mr G was unaware  what  the actual issue was. 
There was some communication  from NatWest previously that Mr G hadnt signed  the 
requests hed sent. However, I cant see this would  have  been an issue  as all the letters he 
sent had his signature. I think NatWest followed its process but didnt take into account 
Ref: DRN23699762Mr Gs circumstances and the fact that he didnt have  access to any of the options NatWest  
gave to him. 
Despite all of the communication  sent to Mr G and him chasing,  NatWest was still ultimately 
of the view his signature didnt  match.  Ive had a look at Mr Gs signature  from when he first 
had it registered  with NatWest in 2009,  compared to his recent  signatures, and I dont  think 
they are that different.  The issue itself (to transfer the money) didnt get resolved as far as I 
can see and Mr G eventually made his own alternative arrangements to do this. I can see 
the money left Mr Gs account  in mid-November  2018.
I appreciate that NatWest  had to follow procedures and I also understand that protecting  the 
security of its customers are at the heart  of this. But NatWest applied the procedures  in the 
strictest sense and didnt  think  about  whether it was fair or reasonable for Mr G to have  
taken the steps  it was asking of him. The options it gave Mr G werent accessible to him.
As a result of a series of events, delays were caused, and there  was confusion and lack of 
clarity in the communication  NatWest sent. It didnt  acknowledge  or apply the procedures  in 
a fair and reasonable way for Mr G. This all caused Mr G a considerable amount of stress 
and worry.
Overall therefore I think NatWest didnt treat Mr G fairly or reasonably.  Ive taken into 
account that all of this caused a detrimental impact  on Mr G. But Ive also looked at our 
services approach to making awards  in situations  like this for distress and inconvenience  
which are generally modest. As such,  Im satisfied that from the available evidence  I have, 
the offer of £250 is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I think the £250  offer made by National Westminster Bank Plc 
is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 October  2019.
