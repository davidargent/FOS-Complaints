K820x#14complaint
Miss C complains about EuroNetCash LLC, trading as On Stride Financial (On Stride)
about a loan made to her in January 2018.  She feels that the business  lent to her
irresponsibly and that the monthly repayment  was excessive and not affordable. She wants
a refund of all interest and charges that have  been  applied to her account.
background
I set out the background  to this complaint, and my provisional findings, in a provisional 
decision issued in March  2019. A copy of that decision  is attached  to this. 
In that provisional  decision, I explained  why I thought  the complaint should not be upheld. 
That provisional decision has been  shared with the parties and they have been invited to 
comment. 
The business has advised that it has no further comment  to make. 
Miss C has not responded to the provisional  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As no further  arguments or evidence have  been  submitted in response to my provisional  
decision, my view remains the same as in that provisional decision. 
I therefore adopt my provisional decision and reasoning as my final decision. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out in my provisional  decision,  I do not uphold Miss Cs complaint and 
do not ask EuroNetCash LLC to do anything further.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 May 2019.
