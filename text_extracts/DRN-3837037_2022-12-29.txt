The complaint
Miss B complained because National Westminster Bank Plc didnt refund her for a cash 
machine withdrawal where she said she hadnt received the money.
What happened
On 27 August 2022, Miss B contacted NatWest. She said shed tried to take £140 from a 
non-NatWest cash machine. Ill call that other bank, which owned that other machine, O.  
She said Os machine seemed to be counting the money, but the screen then displayed a 
message saying that the transaction couldnt be carried out, so was cancelled. The machine 
returned Miss Bs card, but didnt pay her the £140. Miss B told NatWest that bank O had 
refused to help because her account was a NatWest one, not one of bank Os accounts.
Later that day, there was a £140 withdrawal, which took place at a NatWest cash machine, 
not a bank O cash machine.
NatWest investigated. But there was no £140 withdrawal from Miss Bs account from a cash 
machine with bank O.  There was only the £140 withdrawal which took place at a NatWest 
machine, which had gone through correctly. So NatWest rejected Miss Bs complaint.
Miss B contacted NatWest again by webchat on 20 September. NatWests adviser told her 
that the refund had been expected to reach her account in early September, and offered to 
raise a complaint for Miss B. Miss B told the chat adviser that all she wanted was her money 
back, and she was unhappy with NatWests handling and planned to switch banks. She 
complained.
NatWest replied to Miss Bs complaint on 21 September. It said it had read the webchat, and 
apologised for the confusion  because it said its adviser had given her the wrong 
information. NatWest said it had checked her account, but only one cash withdrawal for £140 
had debited her account on 27 August  and that had been made at a NatWest machine, not 
with bank O. It explained that the payment shed tried to make at bank Os machine hadnt 
been paid from her account. So it wouldnt be paying her a £140 refund.
Miss B wasnt satisfied and contacted this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold Miss Bs complaint. He looked at Miss Bs statements, and 
said there was only one cash machine debit from Miss Bs account on 27 August  which 
had been from a NatWest machine, not a bank O machine. The investigator said that 
although the webchat told Miss B shed be getting a refund, he believed this was because 
the adviser had got confused about which transaction was in dispute, because the bank O 
transaction hadnt shown on her account. Miss B had told the investigator that shed had to 
borrow money as a result, and had had to go to a branch to withdraw money because she 
hadnt received the money from the machine. But as there hadnt been a £140 debit to Miss 
Bs account from the bank O machine, she hadnt suffered any financial loss.
Miss B wasnt happy with this. She said the investigator was biased and NatWest had lied to 
her in the webchat, which she said the investigator clearly hadnt read.
The investigator replied that he had read the webchat, but as hed said, he believed there 
had been confusion about which transaction was in dispute, because only the NatWest one 
showed on Miss Bs account. 
Miss B wasnt satisfied and asked for an ombudsmans decision. She said the investigator 
had clearly not taken into consideration the lies the NatWest employee had told her. She 
said the issue was that her bank account had never been adjusted to reflect the failed cash 
withdrawal. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry that Miss B is unhappy with whats happened here and I can see she feels strongly. 
Ive looked carefully at all the evidence, including the webchat.
When Miss B first contacted NatWest, at around 9am on 27 August, she explained that shed 
tried to withdraw £140 at bank O at around 6.40am. She said what had happened, which Ive 
set out above, and said she was left without funds for shopping and getting to work, and that 
bank O had told her shed have to contact NatWest. 
Miss B later said that shed had to go to a branch to withdraw her money. She successfully 
withdrew £140 from a NatWest cash machine instead. I can understand that it was 
inconvenient to have to go elsewhere, because shed tried to make the withdrawal at bank O 
early in the morning, before branches would be open. So bank Os machine not working 
would have caused her some inconvenience.
But whats key to this complaint is that at no point was Miss Bs NatWest account debited 
with the £140 which she couldnt get from bank Os machine.
If her account had been debited with £140 which she didnt receive from bank Os machine, 
shed have been refunded. But as the money was never taken out of her account, it couldnt 
be refunded.
What was debited that day was the £140 which Miss B later took out from a NatWest 
machine instead  after she couldnt get money from bank Os machine. When Miss B 
complained, it was about the £140 failed debit from bank Os machine. Her complaint wasnt 
about the successful £140 debit from a NatWest machine, which was correctly debited.
I recognise that it can be confusing that there was a £140 cash machine debit on the same 
day as there was a failed £140 cash machine withdrawal. I think thats why NatWests chat 
advisor got it wrong  because he looked at the genuine NatWest machine debit. I think he 
probably got confused because there was no £140 debit from Miss Bs account as a debit at 
bank Os machine, so he must have thought it was the NatWest one. But as NatWests final 
response letter explained, the chat adviser was wrong.
As Mis B was never debited with the £140 she couldnt get from bank O, she cant get a 
refund for it. That doesnt change because the chat adviser made a mistake.
I do understand that Miss B was inconvenienced when bank Os machine didnt work, and 
she had to go to NatWest instead. But bank Os machine malfunction wasnt something 
which was down to NatWest. The chat shows that Miss B got very frustrated with NatWests 
chat adviser. I can see that he provided incorrect information, but I dont agree that he told lies, as Miss B believes. I think he misunderstood what had happened, because there was 
only one genuine withdrawal that day, so he wrongly assumed that was what the dispute 
was about. 
Miss B says that the issue is that her bank account was never adjusted to reflect the failed 
cash withdrawal. The reason why it was never adjusted is that the failed £140 cash 
withdrawal was never taken out of her bank account. So it wouldnt be fair and reasonable 
for NatWest to pay her for this, when the money was never debited from her account in the 
first place. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 January 2023.
