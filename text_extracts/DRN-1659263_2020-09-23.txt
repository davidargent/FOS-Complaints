The complaint
Mr S complains that Nationwide Building Society wont reimburse him for the money that he 
paid for four visas.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr S used his Nationwide credit card to pay a third-party processor to provide him 
with visas for his family for travel to another country - he says that he input the 
correct information but the visas were issued to him with an incorrect nationality and 
that he was told that the visas are fraudulent;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
one of those circumstances is that the price of each item must be at least £100 but 
Mr S paid £64 for four visas so hes unable to make a successful claim about the 
visas to Nationwide under section 75;
Nationwide has considered making a chargeback claim for the money that Mr S paid 
for the visas  but it says that it cant evidence that Mr S didnt provide the wrong 
information on the application form and that Mr S received visas which doesnt 
support his allegation about them bring fakes;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made - but if 
the right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules  and 
if theres a reasonable prospect of success  I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
Mr S applied online to a third-party processor for the visas  its website says that it 
provides expedited processing and guidance for visa applications and that it receives 
the application form, checks the information and then make the e-visa application;
I consider that the third-party processor provided those services to Mr S and that he 
was provided with the visas  but they were issued with a nationality that wasnt 
correct;
I can understand Mr Ss frustration that hes received visas that are of no use to him 
but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the error about the 
nationality was caused by the third-party processor or that the visas are fraudulent;
I dont consider that there was any reasonable prospect of a successful chargeback 
claim in these circumstances so I consider that Nationwide has responded to Mr Ss 
claim correctly; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Nationwide to refund to 
Mr S the money that he paid for the visas, to pay him any other compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 October 2020.
