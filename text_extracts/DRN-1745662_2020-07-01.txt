The complaint
Miss D complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) declined her dispute under 
the terms of its Buyer Protection as her claim wasnt raised within 180 days of the 
transaction. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
PayPals Buyer Protection terms say consumers have 180 days from the date of the
transaction to raise a dispute. Miss D tried to raise a dispute 217 days after the
transaction. As Miss Ds dispute wasnt raised in line with the terms, Ive considered
whether her call with PayPal in July 2019 changed things.
Miss D says that when she called PayPal in July 2019 she told the advisor she had
180 days from the start date of the trip to raise a claim and that they failed to correct
her. But PayPal says Miss D told the advisor she intended to raise her claim in
August 2019 and that the advisor confirmed that would be fine. Whilst I appreciate
Miss Ds concerns, I havent been persuaded PayPal gave her misleading
information when she called in July 2019.
I have to take into account that when Miss D opened her PayPal account she agreed
to its terms of service. And those terms say that consumers have 180 days from the
date of the transaction to start a dispute. As Miss D didnt raise the dispute in line
with the timeframe, I think PayPal acted reasonably when it declined to proceed.
Our investigator asked PayPal to consider accepting Miss Ds claim as an exception
but it declined. Im sorry to disappoint Miss D but I havent found that PayPal declined
the dispute in error or misled her. As a result, I have no grounds to uphold the
complaint or tell PayPal to refund the disputed transaction. As Im satisfied PayPal
dealt with Miss Ds complaint fairly Im not telling it to take any further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
DRN-1745662Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 July 2020.
