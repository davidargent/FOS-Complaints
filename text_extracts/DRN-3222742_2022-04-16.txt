The complaint
Ms P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has failed to pay her 
compensation.
What happened
Ms P says she was told by NatWest that she was due compensation. She says she didnt 
receive the compensation from NatWest and didnt receive any contact from it about the 
payment. Ms P says she should be paid the compensation which she says is £100.
NatWest says it wrote to Ms P in March 2021 to tell her and other customers that they may 
be due compensation following a review it carried out about credit card accounts. It says it 
asked customers including Ms P to contact it about any additional costs they may have 
incurred as a result of it increasing required minimum credit card account payments in 2018. 
NatWest says it hasnt received any such details from Ms P and says it tried to contact her 
by telephone on three occasions to discuss this with her.
Ms P brought her complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought Ms P had repaid her credit card account debt in September 2020 and hadnt 
provided NatWest with any of the additional cost evidence it required. The investigator didnt 
think there was an actual offer of compensation and suggested Ms P may wish to contact 
NatWest if she thought she may have incurred additional costs as a result of the increased 
minimum payment.
Ms P doesnt accept that view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint.
Im satisfied that NatWest wrote to Ms P and told her that she may be entitled to 
compensation. I dont think there was an actual offer of compensation. I can see that 
NatWest carried out a review following a decision to ask customers to increase their 
minimum credit card account payments and asked customers to provide it with evidence of 
any additional costs caused by that decision.
I have looked carefully at NatWests records and the information Ms P has provided. And I 
am satisfied that there is no evidence that Ms P has ever provided NatWest with the 
evidence it required about any additional costs. If Ms P has such evidence, then she can no 
doubt give that to NatWest, and I make clear that is separate to this complaint.
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest has not made a compensation offer to Ms P for £100 or 
for any amount. I think there may have been a misunderstanding caused by NatWests letter 
which it has now fairly explained. I make clear to Ms P that this complaint is about NatWest 
failing to pay agreed compensation and Ms P should contact NatWest directly if she thinks 
she may have been affected by NatWests decision to increase her minimum credit card 
account payment.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 May 2022.
