K821x#15complaint
Mr M, represented by a claims management  company (CMC),  complains that MYJAR 
Limited (MyJar),  lent money to him that he couldnt  afford to repay.
background
Based on the information provided, MyJar provided Mr M with nine loans between July 2015  
and August 2017.
Loan Date Repaid Amount Instalments
1 08/07/2015 16/07/2015 £100.00 1
2 16/07/2015 05/08/2015 £100.00 1
3 04/09/2015 15/10/2015 £100.00 1
4 15/01/2016 14/04/2016 £250.00 3
5 28/05/2016 01/09/2016 £200.00 3
6 03/09/2016 13/10/2016 £125.00 1
7 17/10/2016 17/11/2016 £575.00 6
8 22/01/2017 27/04/2017 £150.00 3
9 07/08/2017 28/06/2018 £300.00 12
Mr M says that at the time of the loans he was in a debt spiral.  He says that the proper 
checks werent carried out before the loans  were provided and that the loans were 
unaffordable. 
MyJar says that before  the loans were  provided  credit worthiness and affordability checks 
took place. It says it establishes a monthly  affordable amount which includes a validated 
income. It says five of Mr Ms loans were repaid early and four repaid on time. It also says 
there were gaps in Mr Ms borrowing.
MyJar did say that after further checks it believed loans one to three may not have  been  
suitable for Mr M. It offered to refund the interest and charges applied to these  loans along  
with 8% statutory interest and remove any adverse  information regarding these loans from 
Mr Ms credit file.
Our adjudicator noted that MyJar had made  an offer in regard to the first three  loans and so 
he didnt consider these further. 
Having investigated  this complaint our adjudicator thought that loans four to nine shouldnt  
have been provided. He said that for loan four, the monthly affordable amount calculated by 
MyJar was lower than the highest repayment amount for the loan showing it wasnt  
affordable. By loan five he said Mr Ms overall  pattern of borrowing suggested  he had 
become persistently reliant on short-term loans.  
MyJar didnt accept our adjudicators view and so this complaint  has been passed  to me, an 
ombudsman, to issue a decision.
my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
Ref: DRN50357292complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
MyJar needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent the repayment amounts and the 
consumer's income  and expenditure.  With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MyJar should fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MyJar was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans - not just whether the loan payments  were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
MyJar has said that on review it didnt think that loans  one to three were suitable for Mr M 
and has made an offer in regard to these  loans. I find this reasonable and havent  
considered these loans any further.
Loan four was taken out in January  2016.  It was Mr Ms fourth loan in around  six months. 
The loan was for £250 repayable over three  monthly  instalments. Before this loan was 
provided, MyJar determined a monthly  affordable  amount  which in the table it provided was 
recorded as just under £130.  It has explained  the data used for this calculation. However the 
highest monthly repayment was higher than this. I also note that if the expenses data MyJar 
collected is set against the monthly  income this leaves an amount of disposable income of 
£185, which would leave a very limited amount above the required repayment amount. 
Ref: DRN50357293Given this I think that MyJar should  have been  concerned that this loan wasnt sustainably 
affordable for Mr M.
By loan five, I think that MyJar  should have been concerned that Mr M had become 
persistently dependent on short term borrowing. I say this because  he had taken out five 
loans in around ten months and the amounts he was borrowing didn't significantly decrease 
over this period  and for the rest of the borrowing relationship. While there  were  a few gaps in 
Mr Ms borrowing, I dont  think it would have  been reasonable for MyJar to conclude  these 
were any indication that Mr Ms finances  had moved  on from whatever situation had required 
his previous loans.
Overall, I find that loans four to nine should  have been provided. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. MYJAR Limited should honour the offer it 
made on loans one to three and in regard  to loans four to nine it should:
A)add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr M towards  interest, fees and 
charges on these loans,  including  payments made  to a third party  where applicable, 
but not including anything  it has already refunded.
B)calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr M which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr M originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C)pay Mr M the total of "A" plus "B".
D)remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Ms credit file in relation to loan 4. 
The overall pattern  of Mr Ms borrowing for loans five to nine means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so any information  about  these  loans should  be 
removed from Mr Ms credit file. .
* HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR Limited  to take off tax from this interest. It must 
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 November 2019.
