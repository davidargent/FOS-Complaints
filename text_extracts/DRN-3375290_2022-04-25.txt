The complaint
Mrs J has complained that TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED are reporting 
incorrect electoral roll information for her.
What happened
Mrs J found out TransUnion were reporting that she was not on the electoral roll. She 
disputed this with TransUnion in August 2021. They acknowledged her dispute and asked 
Mrs J to forward them confirmation of her electoral roll data from her council. Mrs J sent 
TransUnion written confirmation from her council, showing that she was registered on the 
electoral roll and had been for some years.
TransUnion didnt respond. Mrs J complained. TransUnion claimed not to get her complaint 
and pushed their response back. They asked Mrs J for another copy of the councils written 
confirmation, which she provided again. But TransUnion claimed not to have heard from her, 
and closed her complaint.
The case came to us. We gave TransUnion a complete copy of Mrs Js correspondence, 
including her completed complaint form and the local authoritys confirmation. TransUnion 
claimed not to have received this even when we repeatedly re-sent it.
Our investigator upheld the complaint, proposing that TransUnion correct Mrs Js electoral 
roll data and pay her £150 compensation.
TransUnion didnt agree. They now say that not only did they never receive the councils 
written confirmation from Mrs J or our service, but that Mrs J never raised a dispute in the 
first place. The complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that TransUnion are misreporting Mrs Js electoral roll information, as confirmed by 
her local authority. And I can see that both Mrs J and our service sent TransUnion the 
necessary confirmation from her council in order to get this fixed, repeatedly, and to the 
correct respective email addresses, going back to August 2021. I can see that TransUnion 
were receiving correspondence at these addresses, since they occasionally replied. Im not 
sure what they hope to achieve by claiming that they never received anything.
For completeness, Ill attach another copy of the councils confirmation to this decision for 
TransUnion. But Im satisfied that TransUnion got what they needed to in order to correct 
Mrs Js file back in August 2021 and several more times since. And yet over eight months 
on, theyve still not put things right. This is very disappointing. It is wrong that TransUnion 
continue to knowingly report incorrect data for Mrs J. It follows that I require them to correct 
her file.
TransUnion said that they found it difficult dealing with local authorities, so they tended not to 
contact them. But, to be frank, thats something for TransUnion to sort out between 
themselves and the local authorities. Its not a problem for them to pass on to Mrs J.
TransUnion have given Mrs J very poor customer service here. They have ignored 
correspondence, repeatedly claimed not to have been sent things that were clearly sent 
properly, closed her complaint unfairly, delayed things, caused Mrs J to have to chase them, 
and so on. And they failed to address the underlying problem at all. Mrs J explained that 
shes not been impacted in getting credit, but it is clear that TransUnion have caused her 
some real trouble and upset in trying to get her file corrected. So TransUnion need to put 
that right too. I agree with our investigator that £150 compensation is fair in this case.
Putting things right
I direct TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED to:
Get Mrs Js electoral roll data corrected, working with her local authority where 
needed; and to-
Pay Mrs J £150 compensation
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mrs Js complaint, and direct TRANSUNION 
INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED to put things right in the way I set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 May 2022.
