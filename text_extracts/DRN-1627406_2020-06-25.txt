The complaint
Miss T complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) refused to help when she 
wanted to raise a dispute regarding a phone she purchased in 2016. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The customer agreement says a dispute can be raised under PayPal's Buyer
Protection scheme within 180 days of a purchase. Miss T purchased her phone on 4
January 2016 but didnt contact PayPal to ask for a refund until July 2019. Im
satisfied Miss T didnt ask PayPal to raise a dispute within the time limits given in the
customer agreement.
As a dispute wasnt raised within the time limits I havent found PayPal made an error
when it declined Miss Ts request for a refund.
PayPal paid Miss T Â£50 when it responded to her complaint. As I havent found any
evidence of a mistake by PayPal, Im not telling it to increase the award or take any
further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 July 2020.
