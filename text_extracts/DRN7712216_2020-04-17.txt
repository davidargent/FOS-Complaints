K821x#15complaint
Mr H says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading as Sunny  irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about one flex-credit loan and ten instalment loans  (for simplicity Ill refer to 
them all as loans in my decision) Sunny provided  to Mr H between  October  2014  and 
January 2016.  Mr Hs borrowing history is as follows:
In its final response letter,  Sunny upheld loan 11 and wrote  off the outstanding debt. Mr H 
didnt think this offer went far enough, so brought the complaint to this Service.  
The complaint was reviewed by two of our adjudicators. The first adjudicator upheld from 
loan 2 onwards.  Sunny  disagreed but offered to uphold  Mr Hs complaint from loan 7 
onwards. The offer was put to Mr H, but he rejected it. 
In the most recent assessment, the adjudicator partially upheld  Mr Hs complaint and thought 
the loans from loan 5 onwards shouldnt have been  given because  the behaviour  of his 
borrowing indicated Mr H was suffering from financial  difficulties  and was reliant  on these 
types of loans. Sunny didnt respond to this assessment.  
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different Loan Date Taken

Ref: DRN77122162things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period during which  a 
customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may signal 
that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint. Having done  so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 4. Mr H 
didnt respond  to the view. As there no longer appears to be a dispute with these loans, I 
wont be making any further findings  on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 5 to Mr H and the results of these checks 
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Hs fourth instalment loan in just under three  
months, I think  Sunny should have been  looking to build a clearer  picture about Mr Hs 
finances before lending  him this loan.  
Mr H was borrowing £150 on a monthly basis  and repaying each loan early and either the 
same day or a few days later then borrowing the same amount again. 
I think the fact Mr H repaid his loans much earlier than planned should have caused  some 
concern to Sunny. As that might  be the sort of behaviour that would indicate someone was 
facing problems managing their money  and needing to refinance  loans on a regular basis.  
Ref: DRN77122163Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because: 
at this point Sunny  ought to have  realised Mr H was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr H had taken out six loans in nearly  seven  months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably. 
Mr Hs first instalment loan was for £150 and loan 6 was for the same amount. At this 
point Sunny ought to have known that it was unlikely  Mr H was borrowing to meet  a 
temporary shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
He also wasnt really  making any inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 11 
was taken out 15 months after Mr Hs first loan and was for the same  amount. Mr H 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out because Sunny provided  borrowing for loan 6 onwards because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The length of time over which Mr H borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Hs ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Hs complaint about  loans  5 to 11. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts Sunny should buy these back  if Sunny is able to do 
so and then take the following steps.  If Sunny cant buy the debts back, then Sunny should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
A) Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made by Mr H towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  anything 
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by 
Ref: DRN77122164Mr H which  were considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Mr H originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should  remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr H as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr H having made 
overpayments then Sunny should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results  in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Mr H. However,  if there  is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr H. Sunny shouldnt 
pursue outstanding balances made  up of principal Sunny has already written-off.
E) Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  recorded on Mr Hs credit file in relation to 
loan 5. The overall pattern of Mr Hs borrowing for loans 6 to 11 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove  these loans entirely from Mr Hs 
credit file. Sunny does  not have to remove any outstanding loans from Mr Hs credit  file until 
these have been repaid, but Sunny should still remove any adverse information  recorded 
about these loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 May 2020.
