The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA didnt notify him that a payment he 
made towards his account had failed.
What happened
Mr S holds a credit account with PayPal. The monthly statement issued in February 2021, 
required him to make a minimum payment of £30.64 by 14 March 2021. Mr S made a 
payment of £100 on the due date. 
On 22 March 2021, the payment was returned unpaid. Mr S complained that PayPal didnt 
notify him of this. Hes also unhappy they recorded adverse information on his credit file. 
Mr S felt that PayPal called him excessively about the missed payment and a manager didnt 
give him a call as he asked.
PayPal said they emailed Mr S on 23 March 2021 and made several phone calls regarding 
the unsuccessful payment. Since the minimum payment was made late, this information was 
recorded on his credit file.
Our investigator said that PayPal had tried to contact Mr S about the missed payment by 
email and phone. She said the information about the missed payment was correctly 
recorded on Mr S credit file. Mr S disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to review his 
complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The terms and conditions of Mr S account requires him to make the monthly minimum 
payment by the due date shown on his monthly statement. It also explains that missing 
payments may affect his credit file.
Mr S statement of 17 February 2021, asked him to make a minimum payment of £30.64 by 
14 March 2021. He attempted to make a payment of £100 by direct debit. This wouldve 
more than covered the minimum payment but unfortunately it failed.
PayPal have explained the direct debit was returned unpaid on 22 March 2021 and reason 
code given was Rejected  Instruction Canceled (by bank or customer). In this situation, Id 
expect PayPal to notify Mr S without delay.
PayPal sent Mr S an email on 23 March 2021, letting him know that the payment he 
attempted to make was unsuccessful and to try again. I appreciate Mr S says he didnt 
receive this email until 4 May 2021 and has provided us with a copy of this email.
 
But having looked at PayPals system notes, Im satisfied they sent the email on 23 March 
2021 to the email address they held for Mr S on their records. I cant fairly say PayPal are to 
blame if Mr S didnt receive it. 
PayPals call logs show they also tried calling Mr S regarding the missed payment. I can see 
there were numerous calls attempted and three instances when PayPal spoke to Mr S. By 5 
April 2021, Mr S was informed that there was still an outstanding balance on the account as 
the payment he made failed. 
As well as the email and calls, PayPal have also explained their system automatically 
generated a letter which they sent to Mr S on 29 March 2021. Ive not seen evidence that the 
letter was actually sent as PayPal have explained it was automatically generated and a note 
isnt added to their system notes. 
But Ive seen a copy of this letter and it was correctly addressed to the details PayPal hold 
on their records. But I note that the address isnt the same as the one Mr S has provided to 
our service. So, it might be a possible explanation for why he might not have received it.
Overall, Im satisfied PayPal made reasonable attempts to let Mr S know about the missed 
payment by emailing and calling him.
Ultimately, Mr S is responsible to ensure the minimum payments are made towards his 
account on time. Although Mr S didnt intend to miss the payment, it was a reality of the 
situation in March 2021. 
PayPal are required to report true and accurate information to credit reference agencies. Im 
satisfied PayPal havent treated Mr S unfairly by recording the missed payment on his credit 
file as he didnt make the required payment until 11 April 2021 which was after the due date 
of 14 March 2021.
Mr S has said that the information recorded on his credit file wasnt a missed payment, 
instead was a default. PayPal have given us a copy of their system records which shows 
that they havent recorded a default. Mr S didnt provide us any evidence to the contrary. 
Based on this, Im satisfied a default hasnt been recorded.
I appreciate Mr S feels the calls PayPal made are excessive. While I agree the number of 
calls may seem disproportionate to the balance owed, most of the calls went unanswered. 
PayPal were trying to let Mr S know that the payment hed attempted wasnt successful. 
This was clearly important to Mr S as one of his complaint points is that he wasnt notified 
that the payment he made failed. Also, a missed payment could have a detrimental impact 
on Mr S  such as on his credit file, late payment charges and interest. 
So, I dont think PayPal acted unreasonably in their attempts to call Mr S to make him aware 
of the situation. And therefore, they dont need to compensate him for any stress or 
inconvenience this caused.
PayPal have accepted Mr S requested to speak to a manager. I can understand Mr S 
frustration and disappointment when he didnt receive a call from one. But I dont require 
PayPal to do anything in relation to this, as I can see they provided him with their final 
response letter which explained their position on his complaint. 
My final decisionFor the reasons explained above, my final decision is that I dont uphold Mr S complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 January 2022.
