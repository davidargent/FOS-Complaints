The complaint
Mr J has complained about a commercial loan he had with Barclays Bank UK PLC. Whilst I 
understand Mr J has other concerns about Barclays, this complaint only relates to the 
£50,000 commercial loan he took out in December 2014.
What happened
I issued a decision in November 2020 setting out which elements of this complaint we could 
look into. In that I explained we couldnt consider all the issues Mr J had raised, as some 
parts of the complaint hadnt been brought within the time limits allowed in our rules. I said 
we couldnt consider anything Barclays answered in its letter of 19 August 2019, but we 
could look at the other issues that had been dealt with in its later letters.
Since then one of our investigators looked at things, and he hasnt recommended Mr Js 
complaint be upheld. Mr J didnt agree so the case has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Although Ive read and considered the whole file Ill keep my comments to what I think is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive not considered it but 
because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach the right outcome
Mr J says that he made numerous requests for a redemption figure since 2017 but they were 
never provided to him by Barclays.
Barclays says its records only show one request for a redemption statement; that was in July 
2019 and a figure was provided to Mr J at that time.
Whilst Im not doubting Mr Js recollections, Ive looked through all the information and I cant 
see any earlier requests for a redemption statement. Im satisfied that if a request had been 
made that would show on the information we have been sent. It seems unlikely that various 
different Barclays employees all failed to correctly record Mr Js requests, and there would 
be no reason for Barclays to withhold a redemption figure from Mr J. It wanted its money 
back so it was in Barclays interests to provide a redemption statement if asked for one.
When considering any complaint like this, as Mr J is the one bringing the complaint against 
Barclays, to uphold the complaint Mr Js version needs to be more likely than Barclays 
version; not just as likely. Having considered everything I cant say Mr Js version  in that he 
requested redemption statements on numerous occasions and they werent provided  is 
anything more than just as likely, which isnt enough for me to uphold this part of his 
complaint.
Mr J borrowed £50,000 (plus £2,075 fees) on 3 December 2014, at an interest rate of 
Barclays base rate plus 4.90%. As the base rate was 0.50% at that time, this meant the 
initial charging rate was 5.40% and Mr J was paying £562.05 a month. 
The statement for December 2015 showed hed been charged £2,178.53 interest for the 
year and had made £6,182.55 in payments. It was 11 payments rather than 12, due to the 
timings of when the loan was drawn down in December 2014, when Mr J made his 
payments, and when the statement was generated.
The statement for December 2016 showed hed been charged £2,547.54.53 interest for the 
year and had made £6,744.60 in payments. The interest rate had fallen in August 2016 to 
5.15%.
The statement for December 2017 showed hed been charged £2,173.65 interest for the 
year and had made £6,744.60 in payments. The interest rate had risen back to 5.40% in 
November 2017.
The statement for December 2018 showed hed been charged £2,033.36 interest for the 
year and had made £6,744.60 in payments. The interest rate had risen in August 2018 to 
5.65%. 
The next two statements were for shorter periods, the first ran from December 2018 until 
October 2019, and the second from November 2019 until May 2020. Those statements 
showed that Mr J made his payments in December 2018 and January 2019 but then paid 
nothing further until he redeemed the loan in May 2020. The statements showed the interest 
rate charged fell to 5.15% on 11 March 2020, and then to 5.00% on 19 March 2020. But as 
Mr J had stopped making his monthly payments, under the terms of his contract Barclays 
could increase the rate of interest payable on such sums by 1% per annum.
Theres nothing in those statements that seems to run contrary to the commercial loan 
contract that Mr J entered into in 2014.
Its not possible for us to carry out a detailed or forensic audit of an account history. Its open 
to Mr J to ask a suitably qualified independent accountant to do that for him. That would 
have to be at his expense, though if an error were found to his detriment, he could include 
the costs of finding that error in any complaint that followed. That said, Ive looked at the 
transaction history and the comments on both sides, and having done so I cant see any 
mistakes. 
Mr J has said he felt rushed, which led to him not reading the paperwork he signed. 
From August 2014 until 19 November 2014 Mr J was intending to borrow significantly more 
to buy an investment property. But that was declined due to the fact the property put forward 
as security was down valued by a surveyor, which meant Barclays couldnt lend Mr J the 
£250,000 hed applied for. After that was turned down Mr J asked the Barclays commercial 
lending team (that had been involved in his £250,000 application) if he could instead borrow 
£50,000 to buy some land next to the property at auction.
Whilst the loan was drawn down the day after Mr J signed the paperwork I dont think that 
was because Barclays rushed him. The loan paperwork was issued on 26 November 2014 
and that showed Mr J had until 25 February 2015 to draw the funds down, but I understand 
he needed the money quickly as he wanted to buy some land at auction. Having considered 
everything it seems the urgency to this application came from Mr J, not from Barclays, so I 
cant hold Barclays liable if Mr J feels he rushed into things.In summary, Barclays lent Mr J the money he wanted, and the terms of that lending was set 
out in the legal contract he signed to enter into. The only rush for the funds was on Mr Js 
part so he could buy some land at auction. The available evidence doesnt suggest that 
Barclays has done anything other than charge in line with the contract, and the transaction 
history doesnt indicate that Barclays charged Mr J more than was fairly due. Finally, whilst 
Mr J says he asked for redemption statements on numerous occasions, theres simply 
nothing to show that Barclays received such requests and failed to act on them. Whilst I 
understand how strongly Mr J feels about everything that happened, for the reasons Ive 
given in this decision, I cant uphold any part of this complaint however much Mr J may want 
me to.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im 
required to ask Mr J to accept or reject my decision before 6 July 2021.
