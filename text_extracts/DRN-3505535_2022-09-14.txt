The complaint
Mr A is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, closed his account and reported adverse 
information to his credit file.
What happened
In February 2021, Mr A explained to NewDay that hed been involved in an accident such 
that he was no longer able to work and which he expected it would take approximately six 
months to recover from. Mr A also explained that because he would now have to apply for 
benefits, he wouldnt know what his income would be until his benefits application was 
completed. As a result, NewDay placed a 90-day medical hold on Mr As account and asked 
Mr A to contact them again when his new income was known.
While the 90-day hold was in place, arrears were still considered as accruing on the account. 
Because of these arrears, Mr A was sent a default notice by NewDay in April 2021. Mr A 
contacted NewDay in May 2021 and completed an income and expenditure assessment 
which showed he could only afford to pay £1 per month. NewDay accepted the £1 monthly 
payment amount but explained that arrears would still accrue on the account and that the 
account might still be defaulted. NewDay also sent a letter to Mr A at that time which 
explained that theyd terminated the credit agreement and that the balance outstanding on 
the account had been passed to NewDays recoveries team.
Mr A spoke with NewDay again in August 2021 and was told that his account had been in 
arrears for several months and was at risk of defaulting. Mr A then began a new plan with 
NewDay whereby he would pay £17 per month. One of the terms of the new plan was that 
NewDay wouldnt default the account and would report to the credit reference agencies 
(CRAs) that the account was in an agreed payment plan and payments were being made.
Mr A then contacted NewDay in November 2021 and asked whether he would still be able to 
use the account for new spending moving forwards and was told that he would be able to.
In March 2022, Mr A telephoned NewDay and explained that he was no longer experiencing 
financial difficulties and no longer needed the payment plan. Mr A was asked to call back the 
next day to request a new card to be issued to him. However, when Mr A did call back the 
next day, he was told that the account had already been terminated and as such was closed 
to future spending. Mr A wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint.
NewDay looked at Mr As complaint. They explained that the account had been terminated in 
May 2021 and that theyd informed Mr A about this at that time. However, NewDay 
acknowledged that Mr A had been given inaccurate information about the possibility of him 
using the account again when hed recently spoken with NewDay recently, and NewDay 
apologised to Mr A for this inaccurate information and credited his account with £25 as 
compensation for any trouble and upset that might have caused.
Mr A wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel NewDay had acted 
unfairly by terminating Mr As account when they had and they noted that NewDay had 
informed Mr A about this at that time. Our investigator also felt that the £25 compensation 
that NewDay had paid to Mr A already represented a fair resolution to Mr A been given 
inaccurate information by NewDays agents, and so they didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr A remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how Mr A, having told NewDay that he was no longer in financial difficulty 
and no longer needed the payment plan on his account, might be upset at learning that his 
NewDay account was closed to new spending and had been for some time  especially as 
Mr A had been told otherwise when speaking with NewDay in the recent past.
However, it seems clear that Mr A was unfortunately misinformed by NewDay that he would 
be able to use his account, and that his account had in fact been closed to new spending by 
NewDay several months previously. Additionally, having reviewed the circumstances 
surrounding Mr As account being closed to new spending by NewDay, Im satisfied that it 
was reasonable for NewDay to close the account for new spending when they did. 
Mr A has explained to this service that he was involved in an accident which unfortunately 
left him unable to work and therefore unable to meet the contractual monthly payments 
required on the NewDay account. And NewDay themselves recorded these points when Mr 
A first informed them of the accident during a telephone call in February 2021.
I can sympathise with Mr As position having been involved in the accident. But because he 
wasnt able to meet the minimum monthly payments required on the account, his account 
was considered as falling into a position of arrears, and it was initially reported as such by 
NewDay to the CRAs. One reason for this is because NewDay, like all credit providers, have 
a responsibility to make accurate reports to the CRAs, and that responsibility generally 
remains in place even when an individual isnt able to make the required payments because 
of an event over which they had no control, such as was the case here.
So, while NewDay did place an initial 90-day hold on the account, this hold only related to 
the accrual of further interest on the account and didnt prevent the account from falling into 
arrears if the monthly payments werent made. And, when Mr A couldnt make the required 
payments due on the account in the months immediately following the accident, his account 
did fall into a position of arrears accordingly. And I havent seen anything in the information 
provided to this service by either party which suggests that Mr A was told otherwise by 
NewDay when he first spoke with them in February 2021.
With the account in a position of arrears, NewDay sent a default notice to Mr A in April 2021. 
This notice explained that if Mr A couldnt clear the arrears on the account by 13 May 2021, 
that the account may then be defaulted. Mr A telephoned NewDay on 13 May, and updated 
his financial position with them, which included an assessment of Mr As income and 
expenditure which showed that Mr A had less than £5 disposable income per month and as 
such could only afford to make a monthly payment to NewDay of £1.
NewDay accepted the offer of £1 monthly payment from Mr A at this time. But again 
NewDay confirmed to Mr A that their acceptance of that amount wouldnt prevent the 
account from continuing to fall further into a position of arrears. And, with the account 
already in a position of arrears, and with Mr A having confirmed that he could only afford to pay £1 per month towards the account, NewDay made the decision to terminate the credit 
agreement, and sent a letter to Mr A dated 18 May 2021 informing him of this. 
The termination of the credit agreement had the effect of closing the account to any future 
spending and preventing further interest from accruing on the account. Additionally, the 
account at that time remained un-defaulted, and Mr A was required to clear the balance that 
had accrued on the account up to that time.
Given the circumstances described above, NewDays terminating Mr As account so that it 
would no longer be open for future spending does seem reasonable to me. This is because 
Mr A had confirmed to NewDay that he couldnt afford to clear the arrears that had accrued 
on his account at that time. And under such circumstances it wouldnt be expected that a 
credit provider such as NewDay would allow its customer to fall further into arrears on an 
account. Indeed, had NewDay allowed Mr As account to remain open given their knowledge 
of these circumstances, they may well have been considered irresponsible for doing so.
Furthermore, Im satisfied that NewDay did advise Mr A that his account was closed for 
future spending, both in the letter dated 18 May 2021 referred to above, and in a later letter 
sent to Mr A after he contacted them again in August 2021, which confirmed that Mr A 
wouldnt be able to use his account. Ive also listened to a recording of the telephone call 
that took place between Mr A and NewDay in August 2021, and towards the end of this call 
Mr A specifically asks NewDay if he would be able to use the account again moving 
forwards, and is told that he wouldnt be able to do so.
However, when Mr A spoke with NewDay again, in November 2021, and asked a similar 
question, he was incorrectly told that he would be able to use the account again. And it was 
also inferred to Mr A that he would be able to use the account when he spoke with NewDay 
in March 2022 and was asked to call NewDay back to request a new card be issued to him.
NewDay have acknowledged that Mr A was given inaccurate information on both these 
occasions, and theyve apologised to Mr A and made a payment of £25 to him as 
compensation for any trouble or upset he may have incurred as a result.
Matters of compensation can be subjective, but given the full circumstances of this 
complaint, I feel that the £25 compensation that NewDay have already paid to Mr A for the 
provision of inaccurate information is a fair amount, and I can confirm that its commensurate 
with what I would have instructed NewDay to have paid, had they not already done so.
In arriving at this position Ive considered that Im satisfied that it was reasonable for 
NewDay to have closed Mr As account for future spending when they did, and that as such 
any compensation payable to Mr A is for the provision of inaccurate information only. Ive 
also considered that Mr A had been given the correct information about the status of his 
account by NewDay on several occasions previously, as described above. 
As such I feel it was always the case that Mr A wouldnt have been able to use his account 
again following the termination of the credit agreement by NewDay in May 2021. And so 
while I can appreciate that Mr A may have incurred a degree of upset and inconvenience at 
having been told otherwise, I dont feel the impact of his being told otherwise is significant to 
the extent that it merits any further payment of compensation by NewDay in this instance.
Finally, Im aware that Mr A is unhappy with how NewDay are reporting his account to the 
CRAs. However, its notable that when Mr A spoke with NewDay in August 2021, NewDay 
agreed to remove the historical arrears reporting from his account and report instead that   
Mr A was making payments in line with an agreed payment plan. To this effect, NewDay 
have provided a copy of their reporting for Mr As account, which confirms that no arrears have been reported to the CRAs and that the worst historical status of the account is that it 
has previously been repaid in line with an agreed payment plan. 
This also seems reasonable to me, and I feel that this demonstrates NewDay did take into 
account the unfortunate circumstances that led to Mr A not being able to make the agreed 
monthly payments, and of Mr As status as a vulnerable customer at that time.
All of which means that I find it very difficult to conclude that NewDay have acted unfairly or 
unreasonably towards Mr A in the manner which Mr A contends here, and also that I feel 
that the response that NewDay have already made to Mr As complaint  including the £25 
payment of compensation for the provision of inaccurate information  already represents a 
fair and reasonable response to that complaint.
It therefore follows that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NewDay to take any 
further action. I hope that Mr A will understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made 
the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2022.
