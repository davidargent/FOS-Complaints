The complaint
Mr M complains that U K Insurance Limited over-priced his motor insurance policy.
What happened
From September 2014, Mr M had a UKI policy for a year. It automatically renewed for the 
following five years. Mr Ms son-in-law then went online and helped him to find a much lower 
premium. He complained to UKI on Mr Ms behalf that it had charged him unfairly high 
premiums. 
By a final response dated 20 February 2020, UKI turned down the complaint. Mr Ms son-in-
law brought his complaint to us in late March 2020.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She didnt think UKI 
had treated Mr M unfairly or that it caused him to suffer a financial loss.
Mr M disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. His son-in-law says, in summary, that:
Mr M did not contact UKI throughout these years to discuss the high increases in his 
cover for a number of reasons. He is elderly, very hard of hearing and never speaks 
on the telephone to anyone due to a great lack of confidence and hearing issues.
Had his family known of the dramatic increases in his car insurance premium, they 
would have acted sooner on his behalf.
The family entered all Mr Ms details including details of the 2 claims into UKIs 
website and they came back with a figure of approximately £320.00. Yet UKI were 
charging Mr M £1,206.00.
The family also entered all his details including claims into a car insurance 
comparison site and not one quote came to anything near £1,206.00 and in fact he is 
now insured for £220.00.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Ombudsman Service deals with an individual consumers complaint against an 
insurance company or other regulated financial firm. In our final decision we name that firm, 
but we dont identify any other party.
UKI had to treat Mr M fairly when setting a renewal premium. It wouldnt be treating him fairly 
if UKI increased the premium to take advantage of the likelihood that Mr M would remain 
loyal and renew the policy without questioning the premium.
I accept that Mr M didnt engage with UKI on any of the renewals. And the premiums were 
as follows:
2014    £227.72
2015    £650.84
2016 £1,098.29
2017 £1,086.40
2018 £1,144.64
2019 £1,206.24
So the premiums went up in all but one of the years. 
I accept that Mr Ms son-in-law found similar, cheaper quotes available through UKI and 
elsewhere.
However, that doesnt show that UKI had treated him unfairly. Insurers including UKI may 
offer lower prices to new customers. And different insurers may have different assessments 
of risk.
Shortly after Mr M took out the policy in September 2014, there was a claim in December 
2014. That caused Mr Ms no claim discount to be stepped back from 7 years to 3 years and 
increased his premium from the renewal in September 2015. 
Shortly after that renewal, there was a further claim in October 2015. This caused Mr Ms no 
claim discount to be stepped back from 3 years to 1 year and increased his premium from 
the renewal in September 2016.  
I accept UKIs evidence that these claims affected its view of the risk of further claims. I 
accept that UKI wouldve charged the same premiums to any policyholder in Mr Ms position 
regardless of the level of engagement with it over the premium.
So I dont find that UKI treated Mr M unfairly. And I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct 
UKI to make any refund.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct U K Insurance Limited to do any more in response to this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 April 2021.
