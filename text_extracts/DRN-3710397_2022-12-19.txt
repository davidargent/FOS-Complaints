The complaint
Miss C complains that Marks & Spencer Financial Services Plc (M&S) didnt honour her 
payment plan agreement.
What happened
Miss C had a personal loan from M&S. It was originally for £5,000 and was drawn in April 
1991. Repayments were £132.39 each month. These were made until May 1992 when Miss 
C ran into financial difficulty. On 8 May 1992 she obtained a settlement figure from M&S  
this showed a balance of £6,348.92 and a settlement figure of £4,688.60 if the loan was paid 
off by 23 June 1992. The difference was an interest rebate of £1,661.32. Payments of 
between £67 and £70 were made until August 1993  when the balance was £5,320.92. 
No data is then available until 2017  when payments of £7 per month were being made by 
Miss C.
Miss C complains that she had an agreement with M&S to make reduced payments to her 
personal loan  and that it was agreed that the settlement figure of £4,688.60 was agreed 
upon. She set out that she had paid in £5,037.60 since 1993  therefore she says she has 
paid in more than what was needed. She sent the cheques to M&S who then cashed them. 
She explained that she ran into financial difficulty at the time and came to an agreement with 
her creditors - and all agreed to reduced payments, and all have been repaid. She therefore 
argues that she is due a refund of £349.
M&S said they had little information about the settlement in May 1992. But they could see 
the settlement quotation was only valid until 23 June 1992, and Miss C didnt pay off the 
settlement amount of £4,688.60 by the expiry of the offer.  M&S said Miss C didnt maintain 
the contractual payments after that time and the account went into arrears. The loan 
defaulted on 28 March 1993 and the debt was transferred to debt collectors at that time. 
There is an outstanding balance of £1,347.32 and M&S said Miss C should contact the debt 
collection agency to discuss a repayment plan.
Miss C brought her complaint to us and our investigator said M&S acted reasonably. She 
said the settlement letter made for full repayment by 23 June 1992. The amount wasnt paid 
off by that date, and therefore the original amount of £6,349 was due and payable. The 
account was passed to a debt collection agency in 2014. Therefore, she said Miss C hadnt 
overpaid by £349.
Miss C didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of Miss Cs complaint is that M&S agreed to a payment plan in 1992  when the 
settlement letter was sent to her. She says that M&S agreed that she could repay the lower 
amount of £4,688.80. And shes set out the amounts she paid  which total £5,037.60. So, 
she says shes overpaid what she needed to.
On the other hand, M&S say she had to repay £6,349  the full amount of the loan. M&S say 
she still owes £1,347.
But because the events that took place in 1992 were so long ago, there is little information 
available on which to make an evidence-based decision. Where the information Ive got is 
incomplete, unclear, or contradictory (as some of it is here), I must base my decision on the 
balance of probabilities. That is  whats more likely than not to have happened in all of the 
circumstances here, based on the available evidence.
After the investigators view, we asked for more information from both M&S and Miss C.
M&S have shown us the settlement letter. And theyve also shown us a loan statement 
which shows that monthly contractual payments of £132.39 were made until May 1992. And 
then £67 was paid each month until December 1992; and then £70 each month to August 
1993. No other information exists until March 2017  after when £7 per month was being 
paid. 
Ideally, in support of Miss Cs complaint, she couldve shown us a letter which confirmed that 
the lower amount of £4,688 was payable. But that doesnt exist. But she showed us:
- A copy of the settlement letter with manuscript comment (added at the time) on it 
which said spoke to (Mr X) re above figures. These acceptable for reduced monthly 
payments re CAB letter (financial difficulties). This is inconclusive  as the figures 
could relate to either balance.
- A letter from M&S dated 9 June 1992 which said, future payments will be made by 
bank giro (or) you can send a cheque to the above address. This confirms that a 
payment plan was agreed. And Miss C did then send cheques to M&S as the letter 
set out.
- A letter from M&S dated 14 June 1992 which said request for an arrangement to 
pay your account. I am prepared to accept payments of £67 for the next 3 months, 
after which time I will contact you. Miss C has written on the letter (added at the 
time) that £67 was paid each month between June 1992 and August 1992. This is 
consistent with what happened  as those payments were made.
- A letter from M&S dated 29 September 1992 which says, I am writing to confirm I 
have agreed to extend the arrangement for a further three months. Miss C has then 
written on the letter (added at the time) : £70 for 3 monthsfrom January payment. 
She quotes the name of the staff member she then spoke to on 8 January 1993  to 
extend the arrangement. This is consistent with what happened  as those payments 
were made.
- A letter from M&S dated 9 January 1993 which says request for an arrangement 
to pay your account. I am prepared to accept payments of £70 for the next 3 months, 
after which time I will contact you. This is also consistent with what happened  as 
those payments were made.
Miss C has said that she took advice from the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) in 1992 when 
she ran into financial difficulty. And with CABs help, negotiated settlement figures with two 
other banks and met those agreements. She says the agreed payment plan with M&S was for £67, and then £70 each month; but then reduced to £7 when she had further financial 
difficulties following her family situation  she was a single parent with two small children.
The letters she has evidenced are consistent with her version of events; and with the 
payments made to her loan. 
But the key issue is: we havent seen a confirmation of the amount outstanding at the start of 
the payment plan  whether it was the lower amount of £4,688 or the higher amount of 
£6,349. The evidence provided doesnt say which.
We asked Miss C if she has any documents produced at the time, e.g. a letter from CAB 
showing her debts (including M&S) and the repayments agreed upon; and/or letters from 
other firms showing the payment arrangements with them. If we couldve seen these, I might 
have been persuaded that the M&S debt was the lower amount of £4,688. But unfortunately, 
these dont exist.
So  I must make a decision based on the information I have available. We are grateful for 
the information Miss C has put forward. But on the balance of the evidence, I cant say there 
was an agreement with M&S to repay the lower amount. And therefore, Miss C must contact 
the debt collection agency to repay the outstanding balance. I know this will be a 
disappointment for Miss C, but Im not asking M&S to do anything here. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 January 2023.
