The complaint
 A partnership which Ill refer to as L, complains that without permission or advance notice, 
WorldPay (UK) Limited (WorldPay) increased Ls card processing fees (the Fees). L also 
said that when trying to resolve its concerns the service provided by WorldPay was poor. 
In bringing this complaint L is represented by one of the partners who Ill refer to as Ms P.
 
What happened
 In July 2014 L entered into a merchant services agreement (the Agreement) with WorldPay 
to process card payments from Ls customers. 
On 1 May 2021 WorldPay increased the charges for processing Ls card transactions. L 
believed the way the increase came into effect was unfair because according to L, the letter 
WorldPay purported sent to it as notice of the increase wasnt received. L also believed the 
increase breached the terms and conditions of the Agreement. 
Ms P has told us she made a number of phone calls as well as sending emails to WorldPay 
in an attempt to resolve Ls concerns about the increase. She says, however, that phone 
calls were not returned despite WorldPays promises. And so, on Ls behalf, Ms P formally 
complained to WorldPay. 
In relation to their decision to increase the card processing fees they charged to L, WorldPay 
didnt think theyd done anything wrong. They said that on occasions such increases are 
necessary to reflect changes in the processing costs of respective card schemes. They said 
that for a certain period they themselves absorbed the increases of the various card 
schemes rather than pass them on to L. 
That being said, WorldPay believed that ultimately the Agreement allows them to alter their 
fees by giving advance notice. And in that connection, they point to their letter dated 27 
February 2021 in which they told L about the proposed increase.  So, WorldPay didnt think 
that L was due any refund of processing fees. 
WorldPay acknowledged, nonetheless, that aspects of the service they provided to L was 
poor. In particular, that a promised return phone call by one of their managers to L was not 
made. So, they offered L £25 in compensation. 
Ms P didnt think WorldPays offer of compensation went far enough. She said the fees 
should revert to those that were in place before WorldPays decision to increase them.  And 
Ms P said WorldPay should therefore, return the amounts L has already paid in excess of 
the original charges. Ms P also said WorldPay should also compensate L for the time she 
spent phoning and sending emails to them in its attempt to put things right. 
The complaint remained unresolved, however, and so on Ls behalf Ms P referred it to this 
service. 
Our investigator concluded that:
WorldPay were entitled to make changes to the card processing fees they charged L 
and furthermore, the terms and conditions of the Agreement allowed for that to 
happen subject to giving two months notice. She said WorldPays 27 February 2021 
letter gave details of the change two months in advance and therefore WorldPay 
complied with the terms and conditions of the Agreement. 
Although noting Ls testimony that the 27 February 2021 letter wasnt received 
probably, as L believed because it hadnt included Ls full address, she wasnt 
persuaded by that argument. She said the available evidence shows the letter was 
sent to the address WorldPay had on file for L. And whilst she acknowledged part of 
the address for L was omitted, she didnt think the omission was material and that 
WorldPay should be held responsible for the letter not being received. 
That being said, the investigator was persuaded that WorldPay provided poor service 
to L. And she didnt, think their offer of compensation went far enough. So, the 
investigator recommended WorldPay increase their compensation to £150. 
WorldPay agreed to the investigators recommendation, but L didnt and requested a review 
of its case by an ombudsman. 
On Ls behalf Ms P said L didnt know about the changes to the fees WorldPay intended to 
make and that had it know it would have changed suppliers as it did subsequently, resulting 
in a 50% saving per month in fees.  Ms P insisted WorldPays letter didnt have Ls full 
address, so that might account for L not receiving it. 
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Having done so, I agree with the investigators conclusions and for broadly the same 
reasons.  Ill explain why. 
For me to require WorldPay to compensate L by refunding the increase in the fees they 
charged, Id need to be satisfied that WorldPay had made an error or acted unreasonably. 
However, Im not persuaded they had. 
My starting point has been to look at the terms and conditions of the Agreement to determine 
whether WorldPay were entitled to increase the fees they were charging L.  
Section 4.4 of the Agreement says:
We may from time to time vary the Fees and/or introduce new charges in addition to the 
Fees, in accordance with clause 22.
Clause 22.3 says:
We shall be entitled to vary the provisions of the Agreement from time to time by giving you 
at least two (2) months' prior written notice. Such variations may be notified by reference to 
materials available on our website, as set out in clause 26.5. If we make changes to the 
terms and conditions herein affecting your payment services, you shall be entitled to 
terminate the Agreement immediately by providing written notice to us, PROVIDED THAT such notice is served upon us within two (2) months of you being notified of the variation. 
Otherwise, you will be deemed to have accepted any variation of the provisions of this 
Agreement two (2) months from being notified of it.
Im satisfied therefore, that under the Agreement WorldPay were entitled to vary, by way of 
an increase in the fees they charged L - subject to WorldPay giving L two months advance 
notice. 
Furthermore, Im also satisfied WorldPays letter to L dated 27 February 2021 did give L two 
months prior notice of the proposed increase and they set out the revised fees that would 
come into effect in two months time  on 1 May 2021.  
The above evidence leads me to conclude therefore, that WorldPay havent done anything 
wrong in the sense that they were entitled to increase the card processing fees they charged 
L subject to giving L advance notice of at least two months. WorldPays 27 February 2021 
letter satisfied that requirement. 
That being said Ive not ignored Ms Ps testimony that L did not receive the letter. But I dont 
think I can fairly blame WorldPay for that. 
Ms P says the letter was not received because it wasnt fully addressed. In that connection I 
have noted that Ls address is expressed along these lines: xx49 -  xx53. Whereas the 27 
February 2021 letter only contained the xx53 part of the number. Im not, however 
persuaded the omission of the first number in the sequence  xx49, was of such 
significance as to be a likely cause for L not receiving it. 
That being said, WorldPay have acknowledged they provided poor service to L and I agree. 
And they have accepted they needed to do more to put things right along the lines 
recommended by the investigator. In particular, the investigators recommendation that they 
pay L £150 which includes the £25 offer thats already been made. 
I can see that in an attempt to get its concerns addressed L called and e-mailed WorldPay a 
number of times without any meaningful response. And WorldPay have acknowledged their 
relationship manager didnt return a promised phone call to L, all of which point to poor 
service. Im satisfied L was caused some inconvenience by that poor service. 
Putting things right
 For the reasons given by the investigator, Im satisfied the £150 she recommended is fair 
and proportionate and fairly reflects the inconvenience that L experienced
My final decision
 My final decision is I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement WorldPay (UK) 
Limited should pay L £150 in compensation which should include the £25 they have offered 
if this hasnt already been paid. 
I dont require WorldPay (UK) Limited to do anything more than this, in respect of Ls 
complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask L to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 April 2023.
