The complaint
A company, which Ill refer to as E, complains that WorldPay(UK) Limited sent details of a 
chargeback to its premises by post. The pandemic meant the premises were closed, and E 
was unable to defend the chargeback in time.
E also complains that its attempt to register for WorldPays digital dashboard was 
unsuccessful.
What happened
E told us:
In July 2019, it took a card payment of £747 from one of its customers. The payment 
was a 50% deposit for a bespoke item. The intention was that the customer would 
pay the balance at a later date, and then receive the item.
In January 2020, its customer saw the finished item. The customer did not take the 
item away at that time, and E agreed to make some minor alterations to it.
In April 2020, its customer emailed to say the pandemic had greatly impacted her 
plans, and she would not need the item for some time.
In November 2020, its customer raised concerns about the item for the first time. She 
said it was not the same colour as the sample shed seen in July 2019.
In January 2021 its customer asked for a refund on the item. E refused, on the 
grounds the item had been made to order and its terms and conditions did not allow 
for a refund in these circumstances.
Later in January 2021, Worldpay wrote to E to explain that its customer had raised a 
chargeback request on the grounds the item was not as described. Worldpay gave E 
10 days to provide information with which to defend the chargeback request. That 
letter was sent by post to Es premises  but Es staff didnt receive the letter until 
after the 10 day deadline, because the lockdown meant its premises were closed. 
The chargeback was then applied, and £747 was deducted from Es account.
As soon as E found out about the chargeback, it complained to Worldpay. Worldpay 
did not uphold its complaint, on the grounds that E had not provided a response to 
the chargeback within the 10 day period. Worldpay said it had written to Es 
registered address and also put details of the chargeback on the Worldpay 
Dashboard system  but E did not have access to that dashboard.
It believes its customers chargeback request was raised out of time, and should not 
have been considered in the first place.
To resolve the complaint, it would like Worldpay to refund £747.
WorldPay said it had processed the chargeback request in accordance with its terms and 
conditions. It also said E hadnt asked for access to its dashboard until August 2021, and so 
any issues surrounding the dashboard wouldnt have affected the £747 chargeback. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but he did not uphold it. He said that E had 
previously asked for paper notifications, and so WorldPay sent the chargeback request by 
post rather than email. He didnt think WorldPay had agreed to communicate anything 
through the dashboard before August 2021. He also said the card schemes rules allow 
chargebacks within 120 days of the provision of a service, and not just from the card 
payment date  and so Es customers chargeback was within time. 
Overall, our investigator was satisfied that WorldPay had done what it was required to do, 
and he didnt think WorldPay had done anything wrong.
E did not accept our investigators conclusions, and asked for the matter to be reviewed by 
an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I want to start by making clear that I can only consider Es dispute with WorldPay. I cannot 
consider any dispute E might have with its own customer, and I cannot comment on whether 
any legal claim E might have against its own customer would be successful. My role is 
limited to deciding whether, in the context of this chargeback claim, WorldPay has treated E 
fairly and reasonably.  
The chargeback process was run by the card scheme (in this case MasterCard), and 
operated according to the card schemes rules. WorldPay did not operate the scheme, and 
was not responsible for deciding whether the chargeback should be successful  but it was 
responsible for deciding whether or not to attempt to defend the chargeback.
I am sorry to further disappoint Es director, but there is very little I can add to what our 
investigator has already said. At its heart, this is a case in which WorldPay did not defend 
the chargeback because E did not provide WorldPay with a defence in time. 
I think our investigator was right to say that WorldPay did what it had agreed to do. E had 
previously instructed WorldPay to send notices by post to its business premises, and that is 
what WorldPay did. I am satisfied that WorldPay did enough to bring the matter to Es 
attention, regardless of any issues with the dashboard. 
E did not respond to WorldPays correspondence by the deadline WorldPay had set. I think 
that deadline was reasonable in the circumstances, and so I also think it was reasonable for 
WorldPay to make no attempt to defend the chargeback. 
It is very unfortunate that Es premises were closed due to the pandemic, but I dont think 
that closure automatically means that WorldPay should have realised that Es director didnt 
have access to its premises. I agree with our investigator that if Es director had wanted 
WorldPay to use a different address, then it was the directors responsibility to provide that 
address to WorldPay.I make no findings as to whether the item was or was not as described by E to its own 
customer. That issue may well be relevant to Es dispute with its own customer, but it is not 
relevant to this dispute against WorldPay. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about WorldPay (UK) Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask E to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 May 2022.
