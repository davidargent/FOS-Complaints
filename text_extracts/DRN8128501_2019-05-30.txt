Mr D says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  my provisional  decision on 17 May 2019. A copy of it is attached and 
forms part of this final decision. I asked QuickQuid and Mr D to let me know if they had 
anything to add.
Both Mr D and QuickQuid confirmed they had nothing to add in response to my provisional 
decision.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
As neither party had anything to add in response to my provisional decision,  I see no reason 
to depart from it. So my final decision is the same as my provisional decision, for the same 
reasons.
QuickQuid should  settle the complaint as it proposed, if it hasnt already. 
my final decision
My final decision is that CashEuroNet UK LLCs offer to settle the complaint in respect of 
loans 6 and 7 is fair.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 June  2019.

complaint
Mr D says CashEuroNet UK LLC,  trading  as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr D had seven loans with QuickQuid  his complaint  is about loans  4 to 7 but Ive included all the 
loans in my table below for context and so the history  of lending can be understood.
Loans 1 to 6 were  payday  loans,  repayable between one and three payments and loan 7 was an 
open-ended credit (oec)  agreement.  This allowed Mr D to make drawdowns  up to a credit limit. Ive 
set out some of the information QuickQuid provided about the loans in the table below.
Loan no. Amount (£) Start date End date
1 250 31/12/2010 25/02/2011
2 150 09/04/2011 27/05/2011
3 500 04/06/2011 25/11/2011
4 400 25/11/2011 23/02/2012
5 600 25/09/2012 25/03/2013
6 750 26/05/2013 23/11/2013
7 (oec) 650-750 (limit) 23/11/2013 11/06/2015
An adjudicator considered the complaint and recommended it be upheld.  He didnt think QuickQuid  
shouldve provided any of the four loans Mr D was complaining  about. QuickQuid didnt agree, but did 
offer to settle the complaint in respect of loans 6 and 7.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive taken into account the law, good industry  practice and any 
relevant regulations at the time.
Im currently  planning to say QuickQuids offer is fair  Ill explain why.
Mr D asked for loan 4 on the same day he repaid loan 3. Loan 3 had been scheduled to be repaid in 
July 2011  but wasnt repaid until the following  November. Mr Ds income was recorded as £1,200 a 
month and the largest repayment for loan 4 was around £475  a substantial  portion of Mr Ds 
declared income. Mr D had been borrowing  from QuickQuid  for almost a year at this point,  with only 
modest gaps  between  loans 1 and 3.
With all this in mind,  I think QuickQuid ought  to have realised Mr D was likely to have  been struggling  
to repay his previous  loans  sustainably  and it shouldve done more to check  if loan 4 was 
affordable. In the circumstances of loan 4, I think QuickQuid shouldve  asked 
Mr D to provide  some  form of proof of his income and expenditure.
As QuickQuid  didnt do this, Id usually consider what a proportionate check  would  likely  have shown. 
Ive seen proof (via bank statements) of Mr Ds income   which was about  £1,380 a month at the 
time. But the bank statements from this period dont make Mr Ds usual  living expenses (like 
rent/mortgage, food,  travel,  utility costs etc.) particularly clear. So Im not currently persuaded it would 
be fair to uphold the complaint about  loan 4, as Im unable to say what  proportionate checks would 
likely have shown.
The largest  repayment for loan 5 was £750  more  than 60% of Mr Ds declared income. But Ive 
noted there was a seven month gap between loan 4 and 5  and that the loan was repayable  across 
three months. With this in mind, I think it wouldve been reasonable for QuickQuid to ask Mr D to 
Ref: DRN81285013provide it details of his income and expenditure  without necessarily asking  for supporting evidence.  I 
think its unlikely a check  of this nature wouldve suggested  loan 5 was unaffordable.
So Im not planning to uphold  the complaint  about loans 4 and 5. And as QuickQuid has now made a 
fair offer for loans 6 and 7, I dont need to make a finding about those loans.
my provisional  decision
Im planning to say that CashEuroNet UK LLCs offer to settle the complaint in respect of loans 6 and 
7 is fair.
