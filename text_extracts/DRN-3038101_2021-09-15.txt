The complaint
Mrs M complains that Lloyds Bank plc (Lloyds) reversed a charge back request she made in 
relation to goods she didnt receive. She would like the cost of the goods refunded.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusion reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons: -
The Chargeback scheme is a voluntary one that most banks sign up to.  There are a 
set of rules banks must follow with  chargeback requests. But there is no guarantee 
that a chargeback request will be successful.
Lloyds didnt accept Mrs Ms comment that she was working on the day the dress 
was collected as proof she didnt collect it. I would agree with Lloyds that doesnt 
evidence  that the dress wasnt collected.
From what I have seen Lloyds did all that we would have expected it to do. It 
provided a temporary credit for the goods and contacted the merchant. The merchant 
sent comprehensive information to show what had been ordered and when and  that 
the goods had been collected and signed for.  At this point Lloyds concluded it 
couldnt do any more and reversed the temporary credit I had applied to Mrs Ms 
account. Having seen the evidence, the merchant provided I think Lloyds acted 
appropriately and in accordance with the chargeback rules.
Having not found any evidence that Lloyds  has done anything wrong I dont feel I 
can reasonably ask it to refund the cost of the goods  as Mrs M would like
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2021.
