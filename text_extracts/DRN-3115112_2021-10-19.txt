The complaint
Mr H complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aquacard lent him money he couldnt afford to
pay back, and he was in persistent debt as a result of this.
 
What happened
Mr H said that NewDay lent to him irresponsibly. He wanted it to refund all charges and
interest, and pay him compensation.
NewDay didnt think it had done anything wrong. It said that Mr Hs aqua brand credit card
account was opened in March 2011. It could see that Mr H asked for a credit limit increase in
August 2011, from £500 to £750, and in August 2013 from £750 to £1,500. NewDay agreed
to both those increases. When NewDay sent this information to us, it said that hadnt
reviewed these lending decisions, because they happened more than six years before Mr H
complained. It had looked at everything that happened in the last six years.
In May 2016, NewDay had implemented an offered increase from £1,500 to £2,250. In
October 2016 it increased Mr Hs limit again, from £2,250 to £3,400. And in October 2017 it
made an increase from £3,400 to £4,600.
NewDay said when these increases were made, Mr H had no arrears with it or other lenders,
hadnt been charged any late or overlimit fees, he hadnt taken any of the lending as cash
advances, and the credit reference agencies (CRAs) showed no concerns about financial
difficulty or affordability.
NewDay said Mr H hadnt been using all the lending it had offered until October 2017. And
NewDay said even then, there wasnt any cause for concern. Mr H wasnt using the account
to pay priority bills, there were multiple retail spends at various retailers during that time.
So NewDay didnt think this lending was a mistake.
NewDay said that Mr H had told it he was having financial difficulties in May 2018, but he
hadnt responded to NewDays request for income and expenditure information at the time,
so it hadnt been able to offer him further support.
NewDay said it had implemented changes to comply with the new rules on persistent debt in
2018. It wrote to Mr H on 7 September 2018, in line with the guidelines set out by the FCA.
But Mr Hs account was already in arrears, and it was defaulted and sold to a third party debt
collector in December 2018, so no further steps were taken on persistent debt. The account
had already been closed before those further steps were triggered.
Our investigator thought this complaint ought to be upheld in part. He explained that our
service cant usually consider things that happened more than six years before someone
complains. He had looked at everything that happened in the last six years, which covered
the two credit limit increases in 2016 and one in 2017, as well as Mr Hs complaint about
persistent debt. Our investigator thought that Mr Hs complaint about the increase in 2017
should be upheld, but the rest of his complaint shouldnt.
Our investigator said that he needed to see if NewDay had done proper checks for each
lending decision it had made. And if it hadnt, then hed need to consider whether NewDay
wouldve reached a different conclusion if it had done.
Our investigator noted that Mr H wasnt working at the time of these increases. He was
receiving benefits which totalled around £812 a month. There was no other household
income, although Mr Hs wife did receive an inheritance at one point.
For the May 2016 increase to £2,250, our investigator said NewDay didnt appear to have
assessed Mr Hs individual financial situation at the time, but he didnt think things would
have been different if it had done so. He said Mr Hs account didnt show any signs of a
problem, payments were being made, the card was under its limit and there were no charges
or fees.
For the October 2016 increase to £3,400, our investigator said that again NewDay hadnt
assessed Mr Hs financial situation at the time. He said the balance on Mr Hs NewDay
account had decreased and the account was being managed well. There were no late or
overlimit fees.
Our investigator noted that Mr Hs external borrowing had doubled, around this time, but he
didnt think NewDay could have seen this, when it increased his credit limit. He didnt think
this would have shown on Mr Hs credit file at the time this increase was made.
For the December 2017 increase to £4,600, again NewDay hadnt considered Mr Hs
individual financial position. But our investigator noted that his NewDay card balance had
increased from around £800 in October 2016 to over £4,000, which is a significant amount in
fourteen months. And his external borrowing had increased a further £4,000 to over £18,000.
Our investigator said if NewDay had done reasonable and proportionate checks in
December 2017 he thought it would have decided a credit limit increase wasnt sustainable
for Mr H. He thought this lending wasnt responsible, and this limit increase shouldnt have
been made.
Our investigator thought NewDay should refund all interest and charges (and add interest if
appropriate) from December 2017 onwards. And he said any adverse markers on Mr Hs
credit report should be removed from December 2017 onwards because the increase given
then, clearly wasnt sustainable for him.
Our investigator didnt think Mr Hs complaint about persistent debt should be upheld. He
said NewDay did try to offer Mr H support, but Mr H hadnt given it the information it needed
to put him on a payment plan. And it had done what our investigator expected to discuss Mr
Hs debts with it, once the rules on persistent debt came into force.
Mr H agreed with that, but NewDay didnt. It said it doesnt obtain evidence of income and
expenditure, and it doesnt have to. It said that while Mr Hs overall debt may have grown by
the time of the last limit increase, the whole principle of credit allows customers to pay off a
balance over an extended period of time. It said it had considered whether Mr Hs payments
would be affordable, and it argued that there's no exhaustive list of what reasonable checks
should be. It said that it had considered the following - the type and amount of credit, the
borrower's income and credit history, the amount and frequency of repayments, as well the
consumer's personal circumstances. It said it had evidenced that.
Our investigator drew NewDays attention to what hed said about the increased lending Mr
H had with NewDay, and elsewhere. He said even if NewDay didnt have access to Mr Hs
personal bank statements, he thought the information it did have showed cause for concern.So he didnt change his mind.
NewDay wanted this case to be considered by an ombudsman, so it was passed to me for a
final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Firstly, Id like to set out that our service isnt looking at the lending decisions that 
NewDay made more than six years before this complaint came to us. And because 
Im not questioning the lending decisions made during this time, I dont think it would 
be appropriate to ask NewDay to refund any fees or interest charged on lending up to 
the limit of £1,500, which was put in place in August 2013, more than six years 
before Mr H complained.
Secondly, I think there is other information which is relevant to this case. When this 
case came to me, I noted that as well as the aqua branded card that Mr H has 
complained about, Mr H also held another card account with NewDay, a marbles 
branded card. The data from that lending, on the marbles card, is further information 
which was available to NewDay when it made the credit limit increases on this aqua 
card. So, whilst I cant consider a complaint about Mr Hs marbles card here 
(because he doesnt appear to have complained about that to NewDay yet) I asked 
NewDay to show me the lending history on this card.
I can see that Mr H applied for this card in July 2017. And he told NewDay then that 
he had a gross annual income of £14,000. Thats rather more than Mr H told us he 
had in income, and more than his bank statements seem to show. Its possible that 
Mr H may have inflated this figure. But the application data at the time also told 
NewDay that Mr H owed £16,100 elsewhere. So even if we assume that NewDay 
had accepted what Mr H told it about his income, it was still aware then that Mr Hs 
unsecured debt exceeded his annual income.
Taking into account this additional information, as well as the issues our investigator 
has already raised, I agree that the limit increase in December 2017 on Mr Hs aqua 
card should not have been made.
Ill now look at the earlier limit increases.
I can see that Mr H had stopped using this card for spending after December 2013. 
He had been paying what looks like the minimum payment consistently every month 
between then, and when his first credit limit increase took effect in May 2016. So his 
overall debt had reduced from around the previous limit of £1,500, to a little over 
£800.
Mr H didnt start using the card again after this May 2016 increase, and by the time of 
the October 2016 increase his overall debt had gone down to a little under £800.
But Mr H was making only the minimum payments at this time, to bring down his 
existing balance. In fact, Mr H doesnt seem ever to have paid significantly more than 
the minimum repayment. And NewDay was obliged, when it decided whether to lend 
Mr H more money, to assess whether Mr H was able to make the repayments on any 
revised credit limit sustainably. That means paying back what he owed over a 
reasonable period.I know that Mr H wasnt using his whole credit limit, either before or immediately after 
the credit limit increases that NewDay made in 2016. But that doesnt change the 
underlying rules - NewDay was required to assess whether Mr H could pay back all 
the lending it was offering to make him, when it made these increases.
NewDay didnt apparently have any detailed information on Mr Hs personal income 
and expenditure at this time. But it knew hed only ever paid the minimum monthly 
payment. So its not clear to me how NewDay reached the conclusion that Mr H 
would be able to repay the increased lending that it made to him in May 2016 or in 
October 2016, within a reasonable period, if he could only afford the minimum 
payments on a much lower balance.
Because of this, I think that NewDay ought to have considered Mr Hs financial 
position in more detail, before it made this lending. And I think that if it did so, given 
Mr Hs income at the time, it would have been unlikely to reach the view that any 
increased lending would be affordable for him.
For that reason, I think that NewDay should refund any interest and charges over a 
balance of £1,500, from the date of the limit increase it made on his aqua card in May 
2016. NewDay should use this money to reduce Mr Hs debt in the first instance. I 
dont anticipate that there will be anything left over, but if there is, NewDay should 
pay that money to Mr H, along with 8% simple interest. And NewDay should remove 
any adverse data on Mr Hs credit file for this card from May 2016, because I dont 
think that this additional lending should have been made.
Like our investigator, I do think that once NewDay was aware of Mr Hs financial 
difficulties it did try to assist him. And it contacted him about the debt on his card in 
the way I would expect. So I dont think that Mr Hs separate complaint point about 
persistent debt should also be upheld.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Mr H replied to accept my provisional decision. NewDay didnt reply.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the decision I originally proposed.
  My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd must refund any interest and charges applied over a 
balance of £1,500, from the date of the limit increase it made on his aqua card in May 2016. 
NewDay should use this money to reduce Mr Hs debt in the first instance, If there is any 
surplus, NewDay should pay that money to Mr H, along with 8% simple interest. And 
NewDay should remove any adverse data on Mr Hs credit file for this card from May 2016.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2021.
