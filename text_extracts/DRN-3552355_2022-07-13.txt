The complaint
Mr P is complaining that Loans 2 Go Limited (L2G) irresponsibly lent to him. Mr P says he 
was already struggling financially and Loans 2 Go shouldnt have lent to him in the 
circumstances.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision. 
The third-party representative on behalf of Mr P disagreed with the adjudicators opinion that 
this complaint shouldnt be upheld but didnt provide any reasons for its disagreement.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I wont be upholding this complaint and I have set out my reasons below:
L2Gs checks showed that Mr P had a county court judgement (CCJ) entered against 
him about four months before this loan. While I think it would have been reasonable 
for L2G to seek to understand Mr Ps financial circumstances further before it agreed 
to lend, that on its own doesnt mean it lent when it shouldnt have done.
Id also need to be satisfied that had those further checks been carried out, L2G 
would reasonably have concluded it shouldnt have lent to Mr P.
This service has asked Mr P to provide further information about his circumstances 
around the time of the loan but neither Mr P nor his third-party representative has 
provided this information.
Based on the information I have seen, I cant say L2G lent irresponsibly as I dont 
know what it would have seen had it carried out further checks. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint or make any awards against 
Loans 2 Go Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2022.
