DRN-3468105
The complaint
Mr N has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc held him responsible for a 
transaction which he says he didnt make or otherwise authorise.
What happened
In 2019, Mr N opened an account with NatWest and set up mobile banking. He did not pay 
any money in. The following week, his mobile banking was used to transfer his full overdraft 
limit away. This was validated using a one-time passcode sent to Mr Ns mobile phone. He 
also received a text confirming the payment had gone out.
In 2021, Mr N reported the payment as fraud. He confirmed hed registered the mobile app 
on his phone and not any other devices, but said he never used the account. He said that 
only he had access to his mobile phone and the app, he always had his phone on him, and 
he never gave anyone else access.
NatWest held Mr N liable for the payment in dispute. They said it had been made from 
Mr Ns mobile app, at his IP address, using his login details and a one-time passcode that 
was sent to his phone. They also questioned why hed waited so long to report it.
Our investigator looked into things independently and didnt uphold the complaint. Mr N 
asked for his case to be reviewed again. He said he never got the one-time passcode and 
he tried reporting things to NatWest earlier. He suggested hed been hacked somehow. He 
said he wanted more information on where the transfer went. The complaints been passed 
to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Broadly speaking, NatWest can hold Mr N liable for the payment in dispute if he authorised 
it. So Ive carefully considered everything that both sides have said and provided in order to 
determine whether Mr N authorised the transaction, or not. While I do appreciate that Mr N 
would like more information on the receiving account, thats not the role of our service. Im 
here to decide whether NatWest can hold Mr N liable for this payment or not, rather than to 
gather information for either side about the receiving account.
Im satisfied from NatWests technical evidence that the disputed payment was authenticated 
using Mr Ns mobile banking facility, his security details, and a one-time passcode sent to his 
registered mobile phone number. Mr N suggested he was hacked and this was made to look 
like him, but that is not supported by the evidence in any way.
It's not clear how anyone would have been able to learn Mr Ns security details without his 
permission. Even more importantly, Mr N was clear that only he had access to his mobile 
phone, he kept it with him, and it did not go missing. So realistically, only Mr N  or someone 
acting with his permission  wouldve been able to receive the one-time passcode that was 
sent to him. This one-time passcode was then used to authenticate the payment. Again, I am 
satisfied it was sent to Mr Ns phone.
So I dont see a likely or plausible way that anyone could have made this payment without 
Mr Ns knowledge or consent.
Further, the IP addresses used to make the disputed payment match up with the IP 
addresses from when Mr N previously set up his mobile banking and checked his account. 
This also strongly suggests that the payment was genuine activity of Mr Ns.
NatWest texted Mr N at the time to confirm the payment had been sent. And Mr N admits 
that he received that text. I can also see that he checked his account a number of times in 
the days following the disputed payment. And he was notified about NatWest closing his 
account. Yet Ive gone through Mr Ns contact history with NatWest, and I cant see that he 
told them anything was wrong until the summer of 2021. Thats over a year and a half later. 
Since Mr N was aware of the payment at the time, it does not seem plausible that he would 
wait so long to report it if it was really made without his consent.
Mr N now says he tried to report things earlier, but as I said above thats not supported by 
his accounts records. Further, Ive listened to a call Mr N had with the fraud department, 
where he told them he started trying to deal with this issue in June 2021. So from Mr Ns 
own previous testimony, it seems he did not report things earlier.
Lastly, Ive not seen any evidence that makes it seem implausible or unlikely that Mr N 
couldve authorised this payment or given someone else permission to make it.
In summary, Im satisfied that Mr Ns genuine mobile banking and a one-time passcode was 
used to make this payment. Based on the evidence, there isnt a likely or plausible way that 
someone could have done this without Mr Ns permission. The evidence also shows that the 
payment was made from Mr Ns normal IP address, and that he was aware of it at the time 
but did not report it as fraudulent. And theres nothing which substantiates that this payment 
was made without Mr Ns consent. That leaves only one likely possibility  that Mr N made 
the transaction or gave someone else permission to make it. This is a difficult message for 
me to give, and I know its a difficult message for Mr N to receive. But given the evidence 
I have, and the balance of probabilities, Im unable to fairly reach any other conclusion.
So based on everything Ive seen, I think its fair for NatWest to hold Mr N liable for the 
payment in dispute.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Ns complaint in this case.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2022.
