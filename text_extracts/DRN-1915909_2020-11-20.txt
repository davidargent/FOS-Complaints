The complaint
Mr L complains that a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement with 
Santander Consumer (UK) plc, trading as Santander Consumer Finance, wasnt of 
satisfactory quality. His daughter, who uses the car, is also involved with his complaint.
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr L under a conditional sale agreement with Santander 
Consumer Finance that he electronically signed in February 2019;
Santander Consumer Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for 
ensuring that it was of satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality will depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage 
of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr L was more than six years old, had been driven for 
58,497 miles and had a price of Â£6,199;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
a complaint was made to Santander Consumer Finance in February 2020  about a 
year after the car had been supplied to Mr L  about water leaking into the footwell 
and an engine failure; 
it asked for evidence that those issues were present or developing when the car was 
supplied to Mr L but it was told that no evidence of that was available;
a complaint was then made to this service but our investigator wasnt persuaded that 
the faults were present or developing when the car was supplied to Mr L;
Mr Ls daughter has described the faults with the car which she says started a few 
months after it was supplied to Mr L and shes provided photos showing water in the 
cars footwell  but shes not been able to provide any other evidence to show that 
the issues were present or developing within six months of the car being supplied to 
Mr L and shes not been able to provide any reports or job cards from a garage to 
explain the issues or any other independent evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr L;
Mr Ls daughter says that the cars mileage when its engine failed in February 2020 
was about 88,000  so in about twelve months she was able to drive nearly 30,000 
miles in the car;
I consider it to be more likely than not that there are some issues with the car but Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that those issues were present 
or developing when the car was supplied to Mr L or that it wasnt of satisfactory 
quality at that time;
I dont consider it to be likely that the car would have been able to be driven for about 
30,000 miles in about twelve months if there had been issues with the engine that 
caused it not to have been of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr L;
I sympathise with Mr L and his daughter for the issues that theyre having with the 
car, the other issues that Mr Ls daughter has described and the repair costs that 
theyre now facing  but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Santander Consumer Finance to allow Mr L to reject 
the car, to pay for it to be repaired or to take any other action in response to this 
complaint; and
if Mr L is experiencing financial difficulties so is unable to make the monthly 
payments due under the agreement, I suggest that he contacts Santander Consumer 
Finance about those difficulties  its required to respond to any financial difficulties 
that hes experiencing positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 December 2020.
