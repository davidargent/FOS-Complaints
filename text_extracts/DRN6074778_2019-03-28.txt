K821x#15complaint
Mr B says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr B had 16 loans with QuickQuid  Ive included a table setting out the history of borrowing 
in the appendix to this decision.
An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld  in part. She didnt 
think QuickQuid shouldve  approved loans 4-16. QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator, 
so the complaint was passed to me to decide. As theres been no ongoing  dispute  about 
loans 1-3, I havent  considered these  in my decision  but I will refer to them at times as they 
still form part of the lending history.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Bs case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Bs complaint and have  explained why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner.
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Bs income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Bs complaint. These  questions  are:
Ref: DRN607477821.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr B would be able to repay in a sustainable  way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr B would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Bs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Bs complaint.
Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr B would  be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr B would  have been  able to do so?
As I outlined  in the background  section of this decision, theres  no ongoing dispute about 
loans 1-3, and so I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for these 
loans.
I also havent recreated individual, proportionate  affordability checks for loans  4 to 16 
because I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next 
section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Bs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at which 
QuickQuid should  reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think  that this point 
was reached by loan 4. Ill explain  why.
By the time loan 4 was approved, Mr B had been  borrowing  from QuickQuid for 11 months. 
Hed had eight advances  during this time,  totalling  £2,900. The amounts Mr B was borrowing 
were generally increasing. Hed borrowed up to the limit on his FlexCredit account each time 
it was increased. And by the time of loan 4 he was borrowing £750  more than any previous 
drawdown. 
Mr Bs FlexCredit account was closed (by QuickQuid) in December 2014. During the time he 
had the account, hed drawn down (with one exception) up to the limit and repaid the 
drawdowns within about a month  similarly  to taking  a series of payday loans. So there 
were already  signs, before loan 2, that he had a persistent monthly shortfall  and that his 
need for extra funds wasnt  simply a short-term issue  by the time the FlexCredit account was 
closed.
Ref: DRN60747783Mr B repaid  the balance of his FlexCredit account  on 24 December  2014  and took out his 
first payday  loan ten days later. Loan 3 followed loan 2 by just 18 days  and then Mr B 
applied for loan 4 on the same day as repaying  loan 2. Mr B went on to borrow  regularly  
from QuickQuid for another two and a half years after this point.
Mr B was asking for short-term loans  the loans are intended to be for a short-term 
purpose. QuickQuids  own website acknowledges  this, stating: Short-term  loans should be 
used for short-term financial needs only,  and not as long-term financial solution. As a 
responsible lender, we do not encourage the frequent use of our service.
I think its clear  that Mr B wasnt using the loans to meet  a short-term financial need  the 
total period for which he borrowed from QuickQuid, with no significant breaks between the 
loans, was more  than three and a half years.
I think QuickQuid shouldve realised  Mr B wasnt using the loans to meet  a short-term 
financial need at the time he applied for loan 4. I say this because:
the amounts  Mr B was borrowing were generally  increasing, and QuickQuid ought to 
have realised it was likely his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably
Mr B had taken a large  number of loans/advances,  over a long period (for this type of 
credit) from QuickQuid  since  the beginning of the lending relationship 
Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid.  And he was 
in effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended period
I think that Mr B lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Bs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im upholding  Mr Bs complaint about  loans 4 to 16 because the overall  pattern  of lending 
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  and he lost 
out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr B in some  
other way.  
Ref: DRN60747784putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 4 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 4 means  any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 4-16 should  be removed from Mr Bs credit file
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must  give 
Mr B a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 April 2019.

Ref: DRN60747785Appendix
Loan 1 was an open-ended  credit  agreement (FlexCredit). Mr B could make drawdowns up to a 
credit limit and had up to ten months to repay the drawdown. The rest of the loans  were payday 
loans repayable in one or more monthly payments. Loan  3 was topped-up (3a); this is where 
extra funds were borrowed during the course of the loan agreement.
