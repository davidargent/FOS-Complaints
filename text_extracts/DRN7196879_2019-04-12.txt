K821x£15complaint
Mr H complains that PDL Finance Limited  (trading  as Mr Lender)  didnt do enough checks 
before lending him money and failed  to identify the loans were unaffordable.
background
Mr H had six loans from Mr Lender  between August 2013 and March 2015  as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 6 Aug 2013 £500 1m £675 28 Aug 2013 27 Sep 2013 
1 x Roll over
2 27 Sep 2013 £700 1m £910 28 Oct 2013 23 Jan 2014 
3 x Roll overs
3 20 Mar 2014 £750 1m £862.50 28 Mar 2014 27 Jun 2014
3 x Roll overs
4 27 Jun 2014 £850 1m £1,105 28 Jul 2014 28 Sep 2014
2 x Roll overs
5 28 Sep 2014 £1,000 6m £466.66* 27 Mar 2015 9 Mar 2015
6 9 Mar 2015 £850 6m £323* 28 Aug 2015 25 Sep 2015
* Maximum  monthly  repayment over the term
Mr H says Mr Lender was irresponsible to continue lending to him given the frequency  of his 
borrowing and the number of roll overs. He says Mr Lenders checks  didnt  go far enough 
and, in particular,  there  were no checks carried out when he chose to roll over some  of the 
loans. Mr H says the ability to automatically  roll over loans constituted an unfair relationship  
with the lender making the contractual obligations unsound.
Mr Lender says it carried out credit checks at the point of application  which indicated Mr H 
was creditworthy and permitted to use the rollover service.  It also asked Mr H about his 
income and expenditure and Mr Lender  said he sent a bank statement as proof  of earnings.
However, Mr Lender acknowledged that further  assessment  should  have been carried  out 
prior to Mr Hs final loan and offered to refund the interest on the loan.
Mr H did not accept the offer.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He wasnt  satisfied 
Mr Lender did enough  checks  before it approved  any of the loans. He found that had 
Mr Lender carried out proportionate  checks, its likely it would have found all the loans were 
unaffordable to him. He recommended that Mr Lender should  refund the interest  and 
charges on all the loans (plus  8% statutory interest) and remove  any associated  negative 
information from Mr Hs credit  file.
Mr Lender responded  to say, in summary, that it had income  and expenditure information  for 
each loan. It offered  to refund interest (plus 8%) on loans 4, 5 and 6.
Mr H did not accept the offer.
Ref: DRN71968792my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Lender was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make  sure Mr H 
could afford  to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr H was borrowing, and his lending  history.  But 
there was no set list of checks Mr Lender  had to do.
Loan 1
When Mr H applied for his first loan, he told Mr Lender that his income  was £2,513.  As the 
scheduled repayment was a large  proportion of this, I consider a proportionate check  should 
have included asking  Mr H about regular expenditure and other short-term loans. Mr Lender  
has now provided information about the expenditure Mr H declared at the time and its sent 
the results of the credit check it carried out. Mr Hs credit file now has a number of defaults  
on it, but all of these  were after the period  during which Mr H was borrowing from Mr Lender.  
There were no other indications of financial difficulty on Mr Hs credit file at the time and, 
based on his declared disposable income of over £1,400, the repayment appears affordable.
But I cant see any evidence that Mr Lender asked Mr H about other short-term loans. Had it 
done so, its likely to have found  that Mr H owed over £1,550 to two other short-term lenders 
with the repayments scheduled for August 2013.  So I dont think  Mr Lender would have 
approved the loan had it carried out proportionate  checks.
Loans 2 to 6
Mr H rolled over the repayment  of loan 1 and repaid  it the same day he applied  for loan 2. I 
consider the higher loan and the borrowing history should have prompted Mr Lender to carry 
out a full review  of his circumstances. Indeed, I find the same  applies to all remaining loans.
For loan 2, Mr H said his disposable income  remained at around £1,400. As I find Mr Lender 
should have carried  out a full financial review at this point, this would  have included  verifying  
the information Mr H provided. Although Im satisfied  his income  was only £100 less than the 
£2,513 hed declared, I found Mr Hs expenditure was much higher than his figure  of £1,110.  
Indeed, even after only taking into account rent at £620 and three regular loan repayments 
totalling £736, Mr H was left with around  £1,060 before food, travel and bills are taken into 
account. Given he also needed to make payments to at least  four other short-term lenders of 
over £2,500, its clear  the £910  repayment  required by Mr Lender wasnt  affordable to Mr H.
By the time Mr H applied  for loan 3, his income  appeared to have reduced slightly,  and his 
regular loan expenditure was just over £800. As he was still using other short-term lenders, 
Mr H needed to pay over £1,500 to at least three of those lenders  at the same time as loan 
3s repayment  was due. So, again,  Im satisfied Mr Lender would have found loan 3 to be 
unaffordable had it carried out proportionate  checks.
As Mr Lender has already  agreed to the recommendation on loans 4, 5 and 6, I wont 
consider those further here.
In summary,  I dont think Mr Lender should have approved any of the loans it did.
Ref: DRN71968793my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. PDL Finance Limited (trading  as Mr Lender)  
should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr H paid on all the loans;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about the loans from Mr Hs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender  to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 May 2019.
