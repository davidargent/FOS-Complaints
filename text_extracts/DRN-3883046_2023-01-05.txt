The complaint
Mr M has complained that Barclays Bank UK PLC has unreasonably and unfairly refused to 
refund him varying transactions on his bank account following the theft of his phone and 
wallet. 
What happened
Mr M said he was on a tube in the London Underground at around 5am on 2 April 2022 
when he fell asleep. When he woke up at a station, he noticed both his phone and wallet had 
been stolen along with his house keys etc. His phone had his online banking app plus Apple 
Pay cards and his wallet had several store cards and credit cards.
He said he reported the matter to the London Underground staff. He said he was able to 
cancel most of his cards except Barclays which he couldnt get through to until 9am. His 
credit cards were used by the fraudster. But he said the providers of those cards had 
refunded him. Barclays confirmed his phone was also accessed, and his email security 
questions reset. He was unable to use find my iPhone to locate his phone as he said the 
fraudster was using fake locations. He could see from his emails that his security was being 
bypassed as he received several verification emails asking for verification codes. There was 
a transfer of £1,000 from Mr Ms saving account to his current account which the fraudster 
wasnt then able to use as by that stage Mr M had cancelled his online account. 
Mr M disputed the following transactions: 
2/4/22 at 00.17 for £4.60 via mobile phone and Apple Pay
2/4/22 at 02.17 for £10.00 via mobile phone and Apple Pay
2/4/22 at 04.31 for £5.00 via mobile and Apple Pay
2/4/22 at 05.27 for £8.00 via mobile and Apple Pay
2/4/22 at 06.28 for £300.00 ATM cash withdrawal
2/4/22 at 06.30 for £200.00 ATM cash withdrawal
2/4/22 at 09.05 for £900.19 card purchase
Barclays said a new android phone was registered to Mr Ms banking app at 06.23 on 2 April 
2022. And it confirmed its records showed Mr Ms account was accessed via a webpage on 
2 April 2022 at 06.23 which it also said could be indicative of a third party accessing Mr Ms 
account using his stolen card, viewing his pin and then carrying out the cash withdrawals 
plus the large purchase from 06.28 onwards. 
But Barclays said that because Mr M disputed transactions made between 00.17 and 05.27 
this diminishes Mr Ms credibility as these were transactions using Apple Pay. This meant 
those transactions could only have been achieved with the use of his phone passcode or 
Face ID. Also, the new device could only be registered after successfully accessing the One 
Time Passcode (OTP) sent to his phone number. Barclays also said that there were several 
transactions which Mr M didnt dispute made from 17.47pm on 1 April 2022 and 04.20am on 
2 April 2022. These were as follows:
1/4/22 at 17.47 for £3.49 by card purchase via mobile 
1/4/22 at 21.48 for £20.90 by card purchase via mobile for a supermarket
2/4/22 at 00.20 for £21.00 card purchase via mobile to a nightclub
2/4/22 at 01.20 for £3.99 which was a recurring purchase for his make of phone
2/4/22 at 01.27 for £14.00 card purchase via mobile to a night club
2/4/22 at 02.12 for £2.90 02 by card purchase via mobile for public transport
2/4/22 at 02.49 for £28.00 card purchase via mobile to a nightclub
2/4/22 at 02.58 for £7.00 card purchase via mobile to a nightclub
2/4/22 at 04.03 for £7.00 card purchase via mobile to a nightclub
2/4/22 at 04.20 for £8.00 card purchase via mobile to a night club
Barclays said on the basis there were genuine transactions in between what Mr M had 
alleged as fraudulent transactions it couldnt see how if Mr Ms phone had been stolen he 
still had his phone to do any of the genuine transactions which he wasnt disputing. So, it 
refused to uphold his claim and it refused to refund Mr M any of the transactions he 
disputed.
 
Mr M then brought his complaint to us. The investigator was of the view his complaint 
shouldnt be upheld. Mr M disagreed that he had authorised any of the disputed 
transactions. He explained when he first brought his complaint to us, he then said he wasnt 
disputing the Apple Pay transactions and he acknowledged disputing those transactions 
might have been a mistake. But he said he was in a panic at the time and he simply didnt 
recognise these payments on his account.
So, on this basis Mr Ms complaint was passed to me to decide.
 
I issued a provisional decision 21 December 2022 and I said the following: 
There is no doubt in my mind that Mr Ms phone and wallet were indeed stolen when 
he fell asleep on the train. However, despite direct requests, Barclays has failed to 
provide the call recording of Mr M reporting this to Barclays. 
Mr M also explained to us that initially, given he was in such a panic he didnt 
recognise several of the payments out of his account, so he told Barclays he also 
disputed those transactions. I dont consider this to be unusual as varying vendors 
will use payments methods that arent the name of the vendor so not so easily 
recognised when they appear on the statement. And from the evidence of his 
transactions with a nightclub, it appears Mr M was out on a night out. 
Mr M has now clarified which of the transactions he is sure he didnt do himself, 
which are as follows:
  
2/4/22 at 06.28 for £300.00 ATM cash withdrawal
2/4/22 at 06.30 for £200.00 ATM cash withdrawal
2/4/22 at 09.05 for £900.19 card purchase
Given the evidence is that he had fallen asleep on the train and reported his cards 
phone and keys as stolen to the underground staff, I consider the likelihood of the 
theft being false is very unlikely. I also dont consider it was likely that Mr M arranged 
for a new android phone to be added on to his account at 06.23 on 2 April 2022 as 
he was busy reporting his phone was stolen and cancelling the cards with the 
providers he could get through to at that time, according to his own testimony. Barclays itself acknowledges that Mr Ms account was accessed via a web page on a 
new Android device around 06.05 and the PIN was viewed from that device at 
around 06.16 which could be indicative of a third party accessing Mr Ms account 
using his stolen card, viewing his PIN and then carrying out the cash withdrawals and 
making the purchase which occurred from 06.28 onwards. 
Barclays has appeared to base its refusal to refund Mr M anything, because he also 
disputed these transactions that he didnt recognise on his statement as well. Ive 
discussed above, I consider that its more than likely correct that Mr M made a 
panicked response as to what transactions he didnt recognise, and I accept his 
version of events that its only the transactions made via the new Android device that 
Mr M is now disputing. Therefore, I consider its fair and reasonable since Barclays 
itself acknowledges this, that it now refunds Mr M the following transactions with 
interest, namely:
2/4/22 at 06.28 for £300.00 ATM cash withdrawal
2/4/22 at 06.30 for £200.00 ATM cash withdrawal
2/4/22 at 09.05 for £900.19 card purchase.
I am satisfied that more likely than not the basis of Barclays own evidence these 
three transactions were not authorised by Mr M. 
I consider this has put Mr M to considerable trouble and upset and I consider 
Barclays could have opened a dialogue with Mr M to ascertain clearly what he was 
disputing, given the anomalies and indeed the evidence Barclays had with regards to 
the new device being added to his account. Therefore, I consider Barclays should 
pay Mr M the sum of £250 compensation for the distress and upset it caused him.
Both Mr M and Barclays accepted my provisional decision. Mr M said he had told Barclays 
that the only way for someone to know his pin was if they viewed on the app or website 
since they had access to his phone. He said that Barclays told him this was impossible but 
that wasnt correct. He said the fact it dismissed his claim so quickly makes him question 
whether they value him as customer of 10 years standing.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so again and in the absence of either party disagreeing with my provisional 
decision, I see no reason to depart from the reasoning and outcome detailed in that 
provisional decision.
My final decision
So, for these reasons its my final decision that I uphold this complaint. 
I now require Barclays Bank UK PLC to do the following:
Refund Mr M the amount of £1,400.19.
Add interest of 8% simple from the date of the transactions to the date to the date of 
its refund. If income tax is to be deducted from the interest, appropriate 
documentation should be provided to Mr M for HMRC purposes. Pay Mr M the sum of £250 compensation. 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 February 2023.
