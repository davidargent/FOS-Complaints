The complaint
Mr T complains that Close Brothers Limited trading as Close Brothers Motor Finance
(Close Brothers) was wrong to invoice him for damages after he returned a car that he had
been supplied with under a conditional sale agreement (agreement).
What happened
 In April 2021 Mr T entered into an agreement for a used car costing £2,295. The car was
approximately 16 years old and had covered approximately 119,000 miles.
Everything else being equal Mr T undertook to pay a deposit of £400 followed by 12 monthly
payments of £197.37  making a total repayable of £2,768.44 at an APR of 53%.
In December 2021 Mr T took the decision to voluntary terminate the agreement and return
the car to Close Brothers  as was his right. At this point in time the car had covered
120,771 miles.
The car was inspected by an agent of Close Brothers and the following damages noted in an
inspection report:
1. front bumper  scratch/paint defect over 125mm £97.30
2. N/A
3. front door  dent 16mm  100mm (with paint damage) £114.80
4. rear bumper  scratch/paint defect over 125mm £97.30
5. N/A
6. lights  cracked/broken/missing £35.00
7. o/s front wheel  damage 100mm+ (standard alloy) £40.95
8. quarter panel/rear window  scratch/paint defect over 125mm £114.80
9. door mirror  scratch/paint defect 26  125mm (thru paint) £30.80
10. N/A
11. N/A
12. boot/tailgate/door  scratch/paint defect 26  125mm (thru paint) £145.60
13. n/s front wheel  damage 100mm+ (standard alloy) £40.95
14. n/s rear wheel  damage 100mm+ (standard alloy) £40.95
15. rear door  dent 16mm  100mm (no paint damage) £67.50
total £825.95
On receipt of the above inspection report Close Brothers invoiced Mr T £825.95.
Mr T complained to Close Brothers that he shouldnt have to pay the sum of £825.95 it was
seeking from him. Close Brothers responded to say it stood by its decision to seek recovery
of £825.95, but as a gesture of goodwill it was prepared to reduce this sum by 25% to
£619.46.
In March 2022 Close Brothers issued Mr T with a default notice for £619.11. In the same
month, solicitors acting for Close Brothers, sent Mr T a letter seeking recovery of £619.46.
In April 2022 Close Brothers sent Mr T a sum in arrears notice for £700.35. In the same
month, solicitors acting for Close Brothers sent Mr T a letter seeking recovery of £619.46.
In May 2022 Close Brothers confirmed to our service that it had removed from the sum it
was seeking from Mr T items 1, 4 and 15 on the inspection report.
In May 2022 solicitors acting for Close Brothers sent Mr T a letter threatening court action.
In June 2022 Mr T confirmed to our service that Close Brothers had recorded (in his view)
incorrect and inaccurate information about his agreement with credit reference agencies.
In June 2022 an investigator at our service sent Mr T and Close Brothers his view on Mr Ts
complaint. In summary he said that Close Brothers should:
remove all damage charges
remove any adverse information it had recorded with credit reference agencies
pay Mr T £150 compensation
In July 2022 Close Brothers sent Mr T a sum in arrears notice for £413.36.
In August 2022 Close Brothers sent Mr T a liability notice for £413.71.
Close Brothers didnt respond, at least in a meaningful manner, to the investigators view.
Therefore, Mr Ts complaint was passed to me for review and decision.
In September 2022 I issued a provisional decision. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First, I would like to point out Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my
comments on what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point, its not
because Ive failed to take it on board and think about it but because I dont think I need to
comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right outcome.
Under the terms of the agreement, Mr T is liable for certain other charges. This includes
charges for damage beyond fair wear and tear.
So, in this instance, Ive to decide if the damage charges Close Brothers initially sought
payment of, or subsequently sought payment of, is within or outside fair wear and tear.
In deciding whether the damage charges were outside fair wear and tear Close Brothers
appears to have had regard to the British Vehicle Renting and Leasing Association
guidelines (BVRLA).
Now had Mr T took possession of a new car or say a used car that was a year old and had
travelled 10,000 miles, I might have agreed that having regard to the BVRLA guidelines in
determining what was or wasnt fair wear and tear on the cars return would have been
entirely appropriate.
But in this case what Mr T acquired was a car that was approximately 16 years old and
which had covered approximately 119,000 miles.So, in the particular circumstances of this case, I think that what Close Brothers should have
done was taken a more pragmatic and holistic approach to the damage on return of the car
when deciding what was, or wasnt, fair wear and tear, rather than applying the BVRLA
guidelines.
Now Ive looked at the photographs of the car provided by Close Brothers agent when the
car was collected from Mr T. And having done so I dont think its appropriate for it to charge
Mr T for any of the damage noted. I say this because all the damage could be viewed as
commensurate with the cars age and mileage on its return. Furthermore, I find Mr Ts
submission that all the damage noted by Close Brothers agent was there when he acquired
the car to be both plausible and persuasive, particularly given the very small amount of time
the car was in Mr Ts possession, the relatively few miles (less than 2,000) he added to the
odometer, the price he paid for the car and the cars age and mileage when he first acquired
it.
So, in summary, I find that Close Brothers should waive the damage charges its seeking the
recovery of from Mr T in their entirety.
Now I dont know what information Close Brothers has recorded with credit reference
agencies in respect of Mr Ts agreement. But given that I think Mr T acted both fairly and
reasonably in disputing the damage charges and not paying them, its my view that Mr Ts
agreement should be recorded with credit reference agencies as being voluntary terminated
in December 2021 with a nil balance and with no arrears or other adverse information
noted.
I also think that Close Brothers handling of this whole matter has been poor, and for that
Mr T should also be compensated.
Now given Close Brothers continued insistence that the damage charges (in full or in part)
remained payable by Mr T (over a period of several months), for what I feel has been very
aggressive collection action on Close Brothers part and for what information I understand
Close Brothers might have recorded with credit reference agencies I find that
Close Brothers should pay Mr T £300.
Mr T and Close Brothers responded to my provisional findings to say they accepted them.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given both parties have responded to say that they accept my provisional findings, I see no 
good reason to depart from them and I now confirm them as final.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and that Close Brothers Limited
trading as Close Brothers Motor Finance must:
Write off all damage charges its seeking the recovery of from Mr T.
Amend what is recorded with credit reference agencies to show the agreement as
being voluntary terminated in December 2021 with a nil balance and with no arrears
or other adverse information noted.
Pay Mr T £300 for the distress and inconvenience this whole matter has caused him.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 October 2022.
