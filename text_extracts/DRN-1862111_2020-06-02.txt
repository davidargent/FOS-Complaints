Complaint
Miss E says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly provided 
unaffordable credit to her.                           
Background
This complaint is about one running account facility and four high-cost short term credit 
instalment loans that Sunny provided to Miss E from October 2014 onwards. Miss Es last 
loan was provided in November 2017. 
Our adjudicator upheld Miss Es complaint and thought she shouldnt have been provided 
with instalment loans 3 and 4. Sunny didnt agree with our adjudicators assessment. So the 
complaint was passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the key relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss E could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided. Having 
looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss E, I think that Sunny should reasonably have seen that Miss E was unlikely to have been able to make her payments in a 
sustainable manner by the time it provided instalment loan 3. 
I say this because Miss E was being asked to commit a significant proportion of her income 
to the repayments for these loans. And this was in circumstances where Sunny also ought to 
have been aware that Mrs E already had a significant amount of short-term lending 
elsewhere. In these circumstances, Sunny ought reasonably to have realised that instalment 
loans 3 and 4 were more likely than not unsustainable for her. 
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss E paid on all instalment loans 3 and 4;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
 
any adverse information recorded about instalment loans 3 and 4 should be removed 
from Miss E credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss E a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss E complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Miss E compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 June 2020.
