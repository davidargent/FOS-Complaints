The complaint
Miss D complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA havent helped her when she 
transferred money to the wrong bank account by mistake. 
What happened
In July 2020 Miss D transferred £500 from her PayPal account to an old bank account that 
had been closed. This happened because Miss D had forgotten to update her bank account 
details with PayPal.
Miss D told PayPal and the relevant bank (that Ill refer to as Bank B) about her mistake. 
Bank B said that as the account had been closed for several years, the account number was 
now being used by another customer. Bank B said PayPal needed to request the money 
back from them. That would enable them to locate the customer whose account had been 
credited and try to get the £500 returned.
PayPal didnt issue the instruction to Bank B despite her asking it to help on several 
occasions.
Our investigator thought that PayPal shouldve done more to help Miss D. She said that the 
Payment Services Regulations 2017 say that a payment service provider (in this case 
PayPal) should take reasonable steps to recover money that have been mistakenly applied 
to an account. Those regulations set out certain timescales for payments service providers 
to act. In this case she thought that PayPal shouldve contacted Bank B about what 
happened within two working days as Miss D was upfront with it about her mistake.
Our investigator went on to say that she thought that if PayPal had acted according to the 
regulations it was likely that the money could have been recovered for Miss D quite quickly. 
As PayPal didnt contact Bank B as it should she thought that PayPal should pay Miss D the 
£500 plus interest from the date it was notified about Miss Ds mistake until the date the 
£500 was returned to her. Our investigator said that she was satisfied that Miss D had first 
told PayPal about her mistake on 4 August 2020. Thats because Miss D has provided us 
with a screenshot of an online conversation with PayPal on this date. So the interest should 
be calculated from 4 August 2020.
In addition to this our investigator thought that PayPal should pay Miss D £50 compensation 
for the stress and inconvenience it caused by not contacting Bank B about the £500 as it 
should. Our investigator said that Mis D had contacted PayPal on numerous occasions 
about this matter, but it still didnt contact Bank B as it should. Miss D was very frustrated by 
this.
PayPal disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to review this case. It didnt provide us with 
reasons why it disagreed with the substance of our investigators view. Instead it said it has 
no record of Miss Ds online conversation on 4 August 2020, and it didnt accept that the 
screenshot Miss D provided (of her 4 August conversation) matched anything on its system. 
It provided us with a record of its contact with Miss D. These show that an online chat was 
started on 24 August 2020 but no messages were exchanged. However, it did have a record 
of an online chat about this matter on 31 August 2020. 
Miss D accepted our investigators view. However, she couldnt provide us with any further 
information in relation to her online conversations with PayPal. She said that when she first 
contacted PayPal online it deleted some of her messages. PayPal asked for this matter to be 
reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I also think that PayPal should pay Miss D the £500 plus interest and pay 
her £50 compensation for what happened. Ill explain why.
Theres no dispute that Miss D made a mistake when she transferred the money to Bank B 
using her PayPal account. PayPal wasnt responsible for this mistake. However, it was under 
an obligation under the Payment Services Regulations to contact Bank B so that Bank B 
could try to recover the £500. PayPal didnt do this.
I understand why Miss D is so unhappy about what happened. It doesnt seem fair that she 
should lose the money to someone who isnt entitled to it because PayPal hasnt done what 
it is required to do.
In the circumstances, I think its fair and reasonable that PayPal should pay Miss D that 
£500. I say that because I think there was a chance that that money couldve been 
recovered if PayPal had done what it was required to do. However, as PayPal didnt contact 
Bank B, that chance was removed. I also think PayPal should pay Miss D 8% interest on that 
money from the date PayPal was notified about Miss Ds mistake and her desire for it to 
contact Bank B to ask for the £500 back until the date the £500 is returned to her. That 
reflects the fact that by not contacting Bank B and asking them to return the money PayPal 
effectively deprived Miss D of that money. The question I must go on consider then, is when 
did Miss D first let PayPal know about what happened?
PayPal has told us that it only had a substantive conversation with Miss D about this matter 
on 31 August 2020. It has provided us with evidence to support what it has told us. 
In her submissions to us Miss D has provided us with her a screenshot of initial online chat 
with PayPal. Miss D says this was dated 4 August 2020. Although the relevant screenshot 
shows the time of her chat, and PayPals response, it doesnt show the date of that chat.
Given that Miss Ds submission doesnt show the date of the first conversation with Miss D 
and bearing in mind what PayPal has said and provided, I think its fair and reasonable for 
me to say that in addition to the £500 PayPal should pay Miss D 8% interest on that £500 
from the 31 August 2020 until the date the £500 is paid. I have let Miss D and PayPal know 
about this. Miss D has said she is happy with that, and PayPal havent objected.
On top of that I also think PayPal should pay Miss D £50 for the inconvenience its handling 
of this matter has caused. That reflects the fact that Miss D had to contact PayPal about this 
matter on numerous occasions. But it still didnt act to help Miss D recover her money. I can 
see that this was very frustrating for her. 
Putting things right
To put things right PayPal should pay Miss D:£500, plus 8% per annum simple interest on this amount from the date 31 August 
2020 to the date of payment; and
£50 to reflect the inconvenience PayPals handling of this matter caused Miss D.
My final decision
 For the reasons set out above PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA should pay Miss D:
£500, plus 8% per annum simple interest on this amount from the date 31 August 
2020 to the date of payment; and
£50.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 November 2021.
