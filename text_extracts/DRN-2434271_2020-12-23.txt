The complaint
Mrs B believes that Lloyds Bank PLC have lost approximately £22,900 of her money from 
her ISA. 
What happened
In 2010 Mrs B opened an ISA with Lloyds. For the purposes of this decision I will refer to this 
ISA as ISA 1. 
In December 2018, Mrs B opened a new ISA with Lloyds  which I will refer to as ISA 2.
In August 2020, Mrs B reviewed her Lloyds statements and was concerned about the 
January 2019 statement for ISA 1. This statement showed that in January 2019, ISA 1 had a 
balance of approximately £22,900. However, at the time Mrs B reviewed this statement, in 
August 2020, the balance of ISA 1 was zero, and Mrs B couldnt account for where the 
£22,900 had gone.
Mrs B then visited a Lloyds branch to ask what had happened to this £22,900, but she didnt 
receive an adequate response and wasnt happy with the service that she received from the 
branch staff. So, Mrs B complained to our service that Lloyds had lost £22,900 of her money. 
Because our service can only review complaints after the business in question has had an 
opportunity to respond to the complaint themselves, and because Lloyds hadnt had this 
opportunity in this instance, we referred the complaint to Lloyds. They looked into the matter 
and apologised to Mrs B that she hadnt received an appropriate standard of service when 
she went into branch and made a payment of £200 to Mrs B as compensation for this. 
However, having reviewed Mrs Bs accounts, Lloyds advised that the £22,900 she believed 
they had lost had in fact been transferred from ISA 1 to ISA 2 in the period of time between 
the January 2019 statement date and the present day. Because this money was accounted 
for, and remained available to Mrs B, they didnt uphold that aspect of Mrs Bs complaint.
Mrs B remained dissatisfied and referred the matter back to our service. One of our 
investigators looked into this complaint and agreed with Lloyds that the money hadnt been 
lost, but rather had been transferred from ISA 1 to ISA 2. So they didnt uphold the complaint 
either. Mrs B didnt agree with our investigators view and so the matter was escalated to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
£22,900 is a large sum of money, and I can understand why Mrs B is concerned as she 
thinks this money has been lost by Lloyds. However, like our investigator, Im satisfied that 
Lloyds hasnt lost any of Mrs Bs money here. I say this as the movement of money between 
ISA 1 and ISA 2 clearly demonstrates that the £22,900 which Mrs B was concerned about, 
which was present in ISA 1 in January 2019, is now present and available to her in ISA 2.
I say this because of the transfers which took place from ISA 1 to ISA 2 in November 2019 
and June 2020, and I will explain this in more detail below. Importantly, the overall balance 
held by Mrs B in both ISA 1 and ISA 2 combined has remained consistent over time with 
what would be expected and hasnt reduced by £22,900 - as it would have done if that 
amount of money had been lost.
Starting in November 2016, the balance in ISA 1 was approximately £42,400. At this time, 
Mrs B chose to fix the interest amount on ISA 1 for a two-year period, ending in November 
2018. 
In November 2018, at the end of the two-year fixed interest period, Lloyds wrote to Mrs B 
and asked what she wanted to do with the money in her ISA. Mrs B didnt initially reply, and 
so Lloyds maintained ISA 1 as a cash ISA. The balance in ISA 1 at this time was 
approximately £42,900.
In December 2018 Mrs B transferred £20,000 from ISA 1 to ISA 2. This meant that the 
balance of ISA 1 went down to approximately £22,900 while the balance of ISA 2 was 
£20,000. The combined balance of both ISAs remained at approximately £42,900.
In January 2019, Mrs B received a statement for ISA 1 which confirmed that a balance of 
approximately £22,900 remained in the account. It is this money - £22,900 in ISA 1 - which 
Mrs B believes Lloyds have lost.
In November 2019, Mrs B transferred £20,000 of the money remaining in ISA 1 to ISA 2. 
This meant that the balance of ISA 1 went down to approximately £2,900, while the balance 
of ISA 2 increased to approximately £40,000. The combined balance of both ISAs remained 
at approximately £42,900.
In February 2020, Mrs B closed two savings accounts and a current account with Lloyds, 
and transferred the combined funds from these accounts, which totalled approximately 
£3,200, to ISA 1. This meant that the new balance of ISA 1 was now approximately £6,150. 
The balance of ISA 2 at this time remained at approximately £40,150. As such, the 
combined balance of both ISAs was now approximately £46,300.
In June 2020, Mrs B transferred the remaining balance of ISA 1 to ISA 2. This was 
approximately £6,150. The result was that the balance of ISA 2 increased to approximately 
£46,300, while the balance of ISA 1 went down to zero.
This was the situation with Mrs Bs ISA accounts when she reviewed the January 2019 ISA 1 
statement in August 2020. At that time all of the money from ISA 1 had been transferred to 
ISA 2, and it was for this reason that there was no money remaining in ISA 1. However, 
Lloyds records show that the overall total balance of both ISA accounts remained 
consistently above £40,000 and at no point went down.
I hope this reassures Mrs B as to why I cant say that Lloyds have lost any of her money, but 
rather that all of the money in ISA 1 has been moved to ISA 2. Ultimately here, the balance 
of Mrs Bs ISA account with Lloyds is as it should be. 
Because I have been able to confirm that Lloyds have not lost any of Mrs Bs money, and 
that the £22,900 which Mrs B was concerned about was transferred to ISA 2 and remains available to her, I cant say that Lloyds have acted improperly or unfairly, and so I wont be 
upholding this complaint.
Finally, I note that Lloyds accepted in their initial response to this complaint that Mrs B hadnt 
received an adequate standard of service when she visited the branch and that Lloyds made 
a payment of £200 to Mrs B as compensation for this. I consider that this was fair and 
appropriate compensation given the circumstances and so I will not be asking Lloyds to do 
anything further at this time.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 January 2021.
