This Loan Table is a brief summary of the approved loans  between QuickQuid and Mr C. 
There may be an outstanding amount due to QuickQuid for Loan  7. The last loan may still be 
outstanding but I do not have an up-to-date account  to tell me the current position.

I attach my provisional decision dated 7 June 2019,  which forms part of this final decision 
and should be read in conjunction with it. In my provisional decision I explained why 
I intended to uphold Mr Cs complaint  in part. I invited both parties to provide any further  
comments they may have  by 21 June 2019  before I reached a further decision.
Mr C has agreed  with my provisional decision and has nothing  further  to add. 
QuickQuid has replied  with additional  points which are summarised here:
1.it says its checks were  adequate  and proportionate and it disagrees  with the basis  of 
my provisional decision to uphold Loans 6 and 7;
2.it says that Mr Cs repayment history was a prudent  aspect  to include when 
assessing the applications, and Mr Cs ability to repay earlier  than scheduled was an 
indication of ability to repay the loans;
Ref: DRN673165023.it says that the affordability assessments from Loan 5 (post-2015) onwards were 
more robust than those carried out earlier;
4.it makes a point about Mr C having  to save for the first two months  of a multi-pay  
loan in order to repay  the larger final repayment figure. To underline  this element it 
has sent pre-contractual check boxes it says relate to Mr C and demonstrate 
acceptance of that saving  requirement;
5.it appears to concede that it could have asked more questions and further checks  
could have been done for the first top-up during the final loan to ensure Mr C was 
not dependent on its product. I take this to mean that it accepts it did not go far 
enough for Mr Cs application  for the first top-up in Loan 7.
As I have received  responses from both parties I think  that proceeding with the Final  
Decision is fair. 
my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
 
I respond to QuickQuids points using the same numbered paragraphs above to correspond  
with my further and final findings here.
1.the basis of the complaint is whether Mr C could afford or sustainably repay the loans 
approved by QuickQuid. It thinks Mr C could afford them. Mr C has complained he 
could not. The complaint  remaining  unresolved and still being in dispute  is with me 
now. I have considered Loans  6 and 7 and my provisional decision was that he could 
not afford them, and my view has not altered; 
2.early repayment of previous loans alone is not enough to suggest that Mr C was able 
to afford loans in the future;
3.this affordability review post-2015 argument has been  run many times before  and 
QuickQuid knows this services response  to that generic argument. So I say no more  
about it;
4.the check boxes  sent to me have nothing  to demonstrate that these relate to Mr C 
and the second one cites loan dates from 2016 which are not the dates  Mr C was 
borrowing from QuickQuid. So I have doubts  that they relate to Mr Cs agreements.  
If  Mr C saw it and signed  either  of the check boxes, this doesnt take away 
QuickQuids responsibility  to assess his risk in not being able to meet  his repayments 
sustainably. And given the speed at which he took out Loans 6 and 7 after repaying  
the previous borrowing, I dont  think  that it was reasonable  to agree to these loan 
repayments on the basis that he could  save. 
5.this concession is a useful point to note and I repeat what I said in point  1 above.
In the circumstances I do not think that anything that has been said or presented to me since 
my provisional decision alters my view and so I uphold Loans 6 and 7 for the reasons stated 
in my provisional decision and those stated here.  
Ref: DRN67316503what QuickQuid  needs to do to put things right
Because QuickQuid   should not have  given Mr C some of the loans, its not right that Mr C 
should have to pay interest  or charges on these, or have them affect his credit file in a 
negative way. QuickQuid  should do as follows:
if both loans have  been paid off, QuickQuid needs to refund any interest and charges 
already paid by Mr C in respect Loans  6 and 7; and
apply 8% simple interest  per year to any interest  and charges refunded from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse payment information  about  the loans from Mr Cs credit file.
If there is an outstanding balance  on Loan  7, QuickQuid is entitled to set off any of the 
monies arising from the redress  against any principal monies Mr C may owe it. Any unpaid 
charges and interest would need to be removed from Loan 7 first and any payments  made to 
it treated as if Mr C had paid down  the principal.
If having set off any refund against any capital  owing, there is a capital amount remaining, 
I would remind QuickQuid  of its responsibilities  to treat Mr C fairly and sympathetically. This 
may mean putting  in place a mutually  agreed  repayment plan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest and it must  
give Mr C a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one. If QuickQuid  
intends to apply the refund to reduce  any outstanding  capital balance,  it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision  dated 7 June 2019, I uphold  
Mr Cs complaint in part. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, should  put things right for Mr C in the way 
I have set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  on or before 28 July 2019.

background
In the submissions QuickQuid sent to us it made an offer to Mr C on Loan 7 (from the first top-up) 
which he rejected. But this demonstrates that QuickQuid has conceded in relation to those later 
additional borrowing approvals on 27 and 29 December  2015, and so I do not need to review those. 
One of our adjudicators  looked  at the complaint  in April 2018 and his opinion was that QuickQuid 
should put things right for Mr C for Loans 1 to 4 and Loans 6 and 7. Our adjudicator was aware  that 
there was an outstanding  balance on Loan 7 at that time and QuickQuid was able to set-off its refund 
with Mr Cs balance. The credit file was to be amended as well. 
QuickQuid did not agree. Its objection mainly related to the non-affordability  element of the 
adjudicators assessment. 
The complaint remaining unresolved, its been  passed to me for a decision. 
my provisional  findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide  what  is fair and reasonable  in 
the circumstances of this complaint. I have taken into account the law, any relevant  regulatory  rules 
and good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
Before lending  money  to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand whether  
the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner without it 
adversely impacting on their financial  situation.  
A lender  should gather  enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on the 
lending. Although the guidance and rules  themselves did not set out compulsory checks, they did list 
a number of things  a lender could take into account before agreeing  to lend. The key element  was 
that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to take into account a number of different things,  
including how much  was being lent and when the sum being borrowed was due to be repaid. 
the periods of time with no lending
There were  three periods  during which  Mr C had no outstanding loans with QuickQuid. These were 
March to August 2012, then August 2012  to June 2013 and October  2014 to October 2015. 
I think  that these were  long enough periods of time for QuickQuid to be able to approach  Mr Cs loan 
applications in August 2012, June 2013 and October 2015 as if he were  a new customer. I have taken  
this into account when considering Mr Cs complaint  as it makes a difference  as to what checks I 
would have expected QuickQuid to have carried  out in relation to each loan when Mr C applied for 
them. 
QuickQuids final response letter
QuickQuid makes reference in that letter to Mr C dated 14 December 2017 - 
It was noted your monthly income was stated as £2800  per month.  I compared your income to your 
total monthly repayment for each loan you took with us.
QuickQuid did not uphold Mr Cs complaint. As Mr C had declared his income  to QuickQuid as £1,015  
in February 2012 and then as £1,786 in May 2014 then I can see that the basis on which QuickQuid 
assessed Mr Cs complaint in December 2017 was flawed. 
Ref: DRN67316505Loans 1, 2 and 3
Mr C had informed QuickQuid that he earned just over £1,000 a month net. At that time QuickQuid did 
not ask its customers for expenditure. I think it ought to have done that with Mr C but I am not able to 
check what Mr Cs expenditure was at the time as we have no financial details  to use to find this out. I 
have read Mr Cs original  complaint letter of November  2017 in which he lists some outgoings. But it 
is not clear to which year these relate. Loans 1 and 2 were in 2012.  His complaint letter  was in 2017.
The loans were for medium sized amounts  and for relatively short  periods of time: 9 and 19 days 
respectively. The interest sums repaid  were modest and so all in all I do not think  it fair on the 
evidence I have at the moment to uphold  the complaint  in relation  to Loans  1 and 2. 
Loan 3 was after a significant gap, it was for a short  loan period and the interest repaid was £25. 
Added to which I have  no financial information such as bank statements  for that year to use to check  
Mr Cs outgoings at the time.  So I am not planning to uphold Loan 3 either.
Mr C has two weeks to supply more  information if he wishes to.
Loan 4 FlexCredit account
Loan 4 was applied  for after a significant break in lending  with Mr C. I have addressed this point 
earlier in this provisional  decision.   
I have read the emails  between  the parties.  After the FlexCredit account was approved then Mr C had 
an agreement where the limit was £500  for drawdowns to be repaid within a reasonable period.  
QuickQuid often gave a schedule of the usual  sort of proposed repayments over a ten month period. 
The first few were payment  heavy becoming lighter as the time went  on. And this proposed  schedule 
(set out below) assumed  the full credit limit drawdown on Day 1 of the account  starting date 
27 June 2013.
Payment Date Minimum Monthly  
Repayment 
 26 July 2013  £160.43 
 30 August 2013  £178.80 
 27 September 2013  £141.56 
 25 October 2013  £130.08 
 29 November 2013  £135.75 
 27 December 2013  £103.04 
 31 January 2014  £110.31 
 28 February 2014  £84.16  
 28 March 2014  £72.68  
 25 April 2014  £61.20  
Mr C applied for this after a long period of no lending with QuickQuid and  I  have addressed  that point 
earlier in this provisional  decision.  The highest proposed repayment amount was just under  £179 due 
at the end August 2013. I think that QuickQuid ought to have looked at Mr Cs income  plus his 
expenditure before  deciding on the FlexCredit  account which I dont think it did. But with a declared  
income of just over £1,000 net a month then its likely that approval may have been fair. 
However, I can see from the way that the account was run that this did not seem to proceed as the 
FlexCredit account agreement  envisaged. I explain here why I have decided to treat this as a series  of 
payday loans instead.  
Ref: DRN67316506I can see that on the first day of the account,  27 June 2013, Mr C drew down  £400 then on 13 July 
2013 a further £100 bringing him to his limit. So I think it ought to have been a repayment schedule 
very similar to the one outlined above. Instead  I can see that QuickQuid emailed  Mr C on 19 July 
2013 to remind him that the payment of £597.31  was due on 26 July 2013.  This seems like a request 
for the full sum. It shows on Mr Cs statement of account that he repaid this full amount. 
On 2 August 2013 Mr C got a further £400  and on 18 August 2013 he was reminded that the full sum 
due of £472.18 would  be charged to his bank card. 
And another example is on 29 April 2014 Mr C was told that his request for funds  of £500  had been  
processed and that his next repayment was going to be £619 on 30 May 2014  a month later. Then 
before that was repaid,  even  though Mr C was at his credit  limit, QuickQuid approved his request for a 
further £200  making  the next repayment due on the same date as before  30 May 2014 - £861.  I 
have not come across  any emails or new agreements to show that this credit limit of £500 was 
increased and agreed between the parties. 
This additional £200  drawdown  breached  the agreed credit limit. And the cycle of advances of capital 
plus payment  requests for the full sum continued. 
I think  this shows that the FlexCredit account was being  treated by QuickQuid  as a series  of ever 
increasing payday  loans, and it may have been in breach of the agreed limit. So I do not plan to 
consider this as a running account type of credit agreement as I do not think it was treated as that. 
I am treating it as a series of payday loans between June 2013  and October  2014. 
I note that the QuickQuid records show he increased  his declared monthly  net income to £1,786 on 9 
May 2014 which would have been during this period of lending.
A Notice of Variation was issued  by email to Mr C on 26 June 2014  just after Mr C had been approved  
for £600 and £100 on 1 and 3 June 2014 and this exceeded the agreed limit. The variation related to 
the repayment structure, not the credit limit. 
After that the emails refer to smaller repayment amounts and to the fact that Mr C had 11 monthly 
repayments remaining. This 11 month reminder  never reduced from June/July 2014 to November  
2014. And there was another  instance of Mr C being  approved drawdowns in excess  of the agreed 
limit. This was where Mr C took sums between 25 September and 22 October  2014 which led to the 
outstanding principal being £700.  
However, the bank statements I have for Mr C show very little for this period of time. I do not think that 
they are copies of his main account.  And if he wishes to send to me additional bank  statements or 
other financial information to demonstrate  to me his income and his outgoings I will be in a position to 
assess this part of his complaint more  fully.
At the moment I do not have enough to do this. So I am planning not to uphold Mr Cs complaint for 
this Loan 4 FlexCredit  account  part of his complaint. 
Loan 5
Loan 5 was applied  for after a significant break in lending  with Mr C. I have addressed this point 
earlier in this provisional  decision.   
By this stage QuickQuid  had an updated income figure from Mr C of £1,786 plus declared expenditure 
of £725. Mr C was applying for a £300 loan over 42 days with two repayment sums the largest being 
about £347. So I do think that QuickQuid had carried  out proportionate  checks at this stage  and 
therefore this loan would  have appeared  affordable.  
I do not think  that QuickQuid  did anything  incorrect  here. I am planning  not to uphold Mr Cs complaint 
for Loan 5.
Ref: DRN67316507Loan 6
The day after repaying  Loan 5 Mr C applied for Loan 6. He declared the same income and 
expenditure. As it was a loan for £550, which was much  larger  than Loan 5, and repayable in two 
repayments of £119 plus £669 over 54 days,  then I think additional checks  were  warranted. 
QuickQuid ought to have checked to see if Mr C had any other short term loan (STL) commitments as 
well as knowing his income and expenditure. I dont think it did that. 
I can see from the credit  report  log provided  by QuickQuid that it carried out some  credit bureau 
checks, but I have not been given  the results of those. So I have looked  at the bank statements we 
have for this period  for Mr C. I can see that he was repaying credit cards regularly, and he had an 
outstanding STL with another large  lender (Lender W). £400 was credited  to his account on 8 October 
2015 from Lender W and so would have been due to be repaid around the same time that the 
repayments for Loan 6 were due. 
With this in mind  and in view of the declared income  and expenditure  figures then I think its likely that 
QuickQuid would have seen that Mr C was not able to afford  this Loan.  
I am planning  to uphold Mr Cs complaint for Loan 6. 
Loan 7
This loan for £600 was applied for a couple of weeks after repaying Loan 6 earlier than scheduled.  It 
was for a larger sum than Loan  6 and was structured that three repayments of £178,  £134 and £730 
were due. This extended the debt period and at this stage  of the lending relationship  I think that a full 
review of Mr Cs financial situation would have been the correct  approach.
Looking at Mr Cs statements for this period,  which  are more detailed than in earlier years, I can see 
that he was earning about £1,276 net each  month and so less than he had declared. And I can see 
that he was taking  the £400 loan from Lender W regularly each month.  In addition,  on 6 November 
2015 he had £1,000 credited from another lender (Lender  Y). That had to be repaid  in £110 
instalments and was likely  a lengthy loan agreement. On 8 December  2015 he took a £750 with a 
third lender (Lender  Z). And on 11 December  2015 Mr C took a new £1,000 loan with Lender Y again.  
So its relatively likely that QuickQuid would  have seen  that Mr C was not able to afford  this loan with 
its three instalments. I say this because the combination of Mr Cs lower than declared income,  his 
ordinary outgoings  likely to have  been  similar  to his declared outgoings of £725,  together with the high 
number of STL he was committing to all lead to the likely conclusion he could not stretch to these  
Loan 7 repayments. 
QuickQuid has already conceded that the two top-ups he applied for within a few days  of Loan 7 
being approved are ones which it is content  to refund  the interest  and charges on. So I say no more 
about them.
I am planning  to uphold Loan 7 in its entirety.
