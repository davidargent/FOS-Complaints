K820x#14complaint
Miss D complains about issues shes experienced with a car supplied with finance from 
Vauxhall Finance  plc.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy  of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I proposed to partially  uphold  Miss Ds complaint 
and to require  Vauxhall Finance to pay compensation of £200. I invited Miss D and Vauxhall 
Finance to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wanted to make  before I 
finally determined the matter.
Miss D replied and said she accepted my decision.  Vauxhall Finance didnt reply.
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss D has indicated that she accepts my provisional decision and Vauxhall Finance hasnt 
said anything at all. So I see no reason  to reach  different  conclusions  from the ones  I set out 
in my provisional decision.
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is to partially uphold this complaint. Vauxhall Finance plc must pay 
compensation of £200 to Miss D.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 March 2020.
