The complaint
Mr S is unhappy HSBC UK Bank Plc send overseas credit advice letters by post instead of 
electronically. 
The details of this case are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again here. 
Instead I will focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusion reached by the investigator that this case should 
not be upheld. I do so for the following reasons:
HSBC has explained it is its policy to send advice letters by post, it is considering 
moving these online but has not yet done so. While advice letters can be sent by any 
durable medium, in this instance HSBC chooses to send them by post. It isnt my role 
to interfere in a banks day to day operations and I wont be doing so here. 
I appreciate why Mr S wants HSBC to make an exception for him in this case, but it 
isnt within my power to force HSBC to do so. Im satisfied it has considered his 
request and explained why it is unable to make an exception in this instance. 
Complaint handling itself isnt a regulated activity, so I wont be commenting on how 
HSBC chose to respond to Mr Ss complaint or how it sent its response to him.
Mr S has pointed out occasions where he feels he has received poor customer 
service. I can see HSBC has apologised to him in its final response and 
acknowledged his strength of feeling and frustration about the matter. I think is 
sufficient and no compensation is due. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I reject Mr Ss complaint against HSBC UK Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 February 2022.
