The complaint
Miss P is complaining about a loan she took out with National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest). 
 
What happened
In December 2018, Miss P took out a loan with NatWest by completing an application though 
a digital platform. The loan was for £10,000 and the repayments were over a period of 24 
months.      
Miss P says that shortly after taking out the loan she visited a NatWest branch and she 
received poor customer service. She says that she was told that the 14-day cooling off 
period was based on business days not calendar days. So later, when she called to cancel 
the loan, she says she was told it was too late. She is also unhappy that on numerous 
occasions she requested a copy of the loan agreement from NatWest, but this has not been 
provided. 
In January 2019, NatWest wrote to Miss P to summarise the conversation they had on the 
same day. In summary, NatWest apologised for the service Miss P received when she 
visited the branch. They offered to close Miss Ps loan account down provided she pays 
back the loan principle. With this offer they agreed to waive the interest of £60.85 and the 
early settlement interest of £151.75, but Miss P declined this offer. 
Unhappy with NatWests response she brought her complaint to our service. 
While this complaint was at our service, NatWest offered £100 compensation for the delays 
in providing Miss P with a copy of the terms and conditions of her loan agreement.
Our investigator thought that the offers made by NatWest were fair and reasonable. 
Miss P disagreed with the investigator, so the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss P is unhappy with the service she has received when, at the NatWest branch, she was 
incorrectly told that the 14-day cooling off period was based on business days not calendar 
days. And she is unhappy because when she later tried to cancel the loan, she was told it 
was too late. 
I agree with Miss P that she was given incorrect information, but I can see that NatWest tried 
to put her back in the position she wold have been in had this error not occurred. During a 
call with NatWest, they offered to close the loan account, provided she pays back the 
principle of the loan. In this offer NatWest said they would waive the interest of £60.85 and 
the early settlement interest of £151.75. But Miss P declined this offer. 
In January 2019, NatWest also confirmed this offer to Miss P in a letter. I think this offer was 
fair and reasonable, as at the time it allowed Miss P to cancel the loan just as if she was still 
in the 14-day cooling off period. Considering NatWest was willing to refund interest accrued 
and waive the early settlement interest there would have been no financial loss suffered by 
Miss P. It is also reasonable that NatWest asked Miss P to pay back the principle of the loan, 
as she would have needed to do that regardless of whether the loan was cancelled within 
the 14-day cooling off period or shortly after when this offer was made to her. So considering 
this, and the fact that Miss P declined this offer and continued to have the benefit of the loan, 
Im not asking NatWest to take any further action regarding this point. 
Miss P is also unhappy that on numerous occasions she requested a copy of the loan 
agreements terms and conditions, but it took NatWest several months to finally provide this 
to her. 
Miss P did her loan application though a digital platform and before she agreed to proceed 
with the loan, most likely she would have access to the terms and conditions of the loan 
agreement. However, considering that afterwards, she says, she could no longer access a 
copy of the agreement I think NatWest could have provided a copy to her sooner than it did; 
especially as she requested this on several occasions. NatWest has since agreed to pay 
Miss P £100 compensation for the delays in providing a copy of the terms and conditions of 
her loan agreement. Based on the circumstances of this complaint, I believe this is 
reasonable, as it provides a fair level of compensation for the distress and inconvenience 
Miss P has experienced as a result of the delays.  
While I realise that my decision will come as a disappointment to Miss P, taking all the 
available evidence into consideration, Im not asking NatWest to take any further action 
except to pay her the £100 compensation already offered.  
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, my final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc 
should pay Miss P the £100 they have offered to pay.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 December 2020.
