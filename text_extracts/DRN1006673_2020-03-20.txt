K821x#15complaint
Mr S complained that MoneyGram International Limited released an international payment to 
the wrong person. 
MoneyGram said it followed  the correct procedure, and refused to refund the money.
background
Mr S, and his girlfriend Miss S, live abroad. Miss S was coming to the UK. She had an offer 
of a job, and the employer  asked  her to send  money to herself to prove she had funds. The 
employer also said it wasnt safe to travel with a lot of cash, so she should use MoneyGram  
to transfer money  which she could  collect  when  she arrived in the UK. Miss S told them she 
planned to arrive in the UK on 21 November 2017.
MoneyGrams systems wouldnt allow Miss S to send the money to herself,  so Mr S sent it 
instead, for Miss S to collect.  The amount was the equivalent of £970.01, and it was sent on 
20 November 2017 from the country in which Mr S and Miss S lived.
The employer asked  Miss S for a copy of the sending certificate from MoneyGram.  
MoneyGrams form has a warning not to disclose the reference number, and Mr S said that 
he and Miss S covered up the reference number, before sending it to the employer. So the 
information disclosed was Mr Ss name as sender, Miss Ss name  as recipient, and the 
amount of money.  
The next morning,  21 November, someone collected the funds in the UK from a MoneyGram 
location at around  6.30 am. The person collecting it provided the names  of Mr S, Miss S, the 
eight-digit reference number, and a passport in the same name as Miss S. Ive seen  the 
passport presented by the fraudster,  and Miss Ss genuine passport. The fraudsters 
passport had a:
-different nationality, in other words the passport was for a different country.  And the 
country on the fraudsters passport wasnt the country from which  the payment had 
been sent;
-different passport number;
-different date of birth  by some  ten years; and
-different ethnicity on the photo.
On 29 November, Mr S contacted MoneyGram for some information,  and was told the 
money had already been collected. The real Miss S hadnt collected  the money, and hadnt 
been in the UK when the fraudster had collected the money. They  complained.
MoneyGram refused  to refund  the money.  Mr S and Miss S complained to this service. 
Weve recorded  the complaint in Mr Ss name  because he was the sender.
In its response to our investigators questions, MoneyGram said that its agent had thought it 
was suspicious when  Miss S had originally asked to send money to herself. It also said that 
its agent had warned  them not to give the reference  number to any third party.
MoneyGram said that Mr S had given two different accounts. First, hed said that Miss S 
didnt want to carry cash with her when she travelled to the UK. Hed later said that Miss S 
had had a job offer in the UK, and theyd told her she had to complete a MoneyGram 
transaction as proof of funds  availability. Mr S said the transaction details had been shared 
Ref: DRN10066732with a third party,  but not the reference number. Our investigator asked MoneyGram for a 
call recording  of these calls, but MoneyGram  said they were no longer available.
MoneyGrams terms and conditions warn customers not to share information with third 
parties:
5.3 You must not give the reference number, test answer or recipients details to anyone  
other than your chosen recipient, and do all you reasonably can to make sure no-one  else 
can obtain them  for example, by (a) not letting anyone see the form; and (b) not writing  
down the test question answer or the reference  number in a way that can be recognised, nor 
letting anyone overhear you tell the recipient  what they are.
MoneyGram explained its processes. It said that its agent had had the senders name;  
receivers name, the eight  digit reference  number; and some  form of identification. So it had 
correctly paid out the money.
MoneyGram also said that its agents  didnt know what  the receiver should look like, what 
age they were, or what type of identification  they should have,  and could only apply a 
reasonable evaluation of legitimacy to the identification provided.
The investigator upheld  Mr Ss complaint. MoneyGram had supplied a copy of the passport 
used to receive the funds. This was very different to Miss Ss real one. It had Miss Ss name 
but a different nationality and a different date of birth. The investigator noted  that 
MoneyGram had said that Mr S might have sent some transaction  details to the fraudsters. 
But hed also said the reference number hadnt  been sent. The investigator considered that a 
fraudster who could  obtain a fake passport might also have  the ability to obtain the reference 
number. So he considered that MoneyGram should  pay Miss S the £970.01  she should have 
received, plus 8% simple  interest to the date when compensation is paid.
MoneyGram didnt agree  and asked for an ombudsman  decision. It said that the terms and 
conditions advise consumers that if they breach  the terms of the contract,  including security 
warnings, MoneyGram  wouldnt be liable if a fraudster  collected the transfer.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I asked both Mr S and MoneyGram for 
more information,  which I have also taken into account.
Unfortunately, Mr S and Miss S were  victims of fraudsters, who stole  the money which was 
sent from Mr Ss account. What I have to decide  is whether that loss should be met by 
MoneyGram, or by Mr S.
MoneyGrams sending  form, signed  by Mr S, contains a warning DO NOT give your 8 digit 
MoneyGram reference number to a third party. I have considered whether or not Mr S or 
Miss S did give the reference number to the fraudster posing as an employer. Mr Ss 
evidence is that they didnt, and that they hid the reference number on the form. I accept 
this, because I consider  that their version  of events, and the fraud of which  they were 
victims, is credible. I dont  consider, as MoneyGram claims, that the two pieces of 
information which Mr S told MoneyGram conflict with each other.  I accept that its true both 
that Miss S didnt want  to carry a lot of cash when travelling, particularly after the fraudsters 
Ref: DRN10066733had advised her not to do so, and that the fraudsters  had told her she had to complete a 
MoneyGram transaction as proof of funds availability.
This does  raise the question of how the fraudsters obtained the reference number. I dont 
know how this was done, but here, the fraudsters showed signs of being  adept and having 
the resources  to carry out this kind of fraud. I say that because they had the resources  to 
create and forge a passport  and the circumstances  behind  the fraud here show signs of 
organisation. There were  some notable issues with the passport forgery, which Ill come to. 
But I consider that fraudsters of the sort involved here would have been very likely  to have 
been able to obtain the reference number,  once they had a copy  of the rest of the form, 
including Miss Ss name, the exact  amount of the transfer, and date it was sent.  
I note that the terms and conditions of the MoneyGram transfer also refer to a test 
question. No test question was set for this transfer.  I asked  MoneyGram why this was, and 
it said it is not necessary  for the sender  to set up a test question  and answer.  I appreciate 
that a test question  and answer might also be obtained by fraudsters, but it would  be an 
extra level of security, and one which MoneyGrams own documents mention. Here, theres 
no evidence that this was even offered to Mr S and Miss S.
Had it been offered  here, I think a test question  might have made a difference.  The passport  
seems to have been created with a knowledge  of MoneyGrams processes and procedures.  
That is, that it might not be checked in any detail. But I think there were enough 
discrepancies in the passport that MoneyGram should  really have thought  twice  about 
accepting this on face value - even taking into account the checks  it says it does.  If 
MoneyGram had acted on the passports  discrepancies, then it could have asked the test 
question and that could have prevented the transfer from being made to the fraudster.                             
But in any event, it was the passport that MoneyGram accepted as proof of identification 
here. As Ive set out above, every single aspect  of the fraudsters passport was different from 
the genuine one. MoneyGram has argued that its agents dont know what  the receiver 
should look like, or what age they are. This service doesnt tell financial institutions  what 
procedures they must  implement. But where  those procedures dont adequately protect the 
consumer, we can assess whether the consumer was treated fairly  and reasonably.   In Miss 
Ss case,  I find that for MoneyGram to have paid out on such a completely different passport  
was unfair  and unreasonable in the individual circumstances here.
I consider that MoneyGram failed to make  adequate checks to prevent the fraudsters from 
stealing the money which Mr S and Miss S sent.  So I find it should refund Mr S the money  
which was sent from his account,  plus interest  to compensate  for the time without  access  to 
the money.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I order MoneyGram International Limited to 
pay Mr S:
-£970.01, which was the amount of money  which MoneyGram paid over to the 
fraudster; and
-Interest at 8% on this amount, from 21 November 2017 when the money should have 
been correctly  collected, to the date when MoneyGram  pays the award.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 April 2020
