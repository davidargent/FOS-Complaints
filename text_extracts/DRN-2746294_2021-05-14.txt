The complaint
Mr S complains about the amount that hes been charged by LeasePlan UK Limited for 
damage to a car that he returned when his hire agreement ended.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mr S under a hire agreement with LeasePlan that he signed in 
September 2017. He returned the car when the hire agreement ended and it was inspected 
by a third party on behalf of LeasePlan in September 2020. The vehicle condition report 
identified scratches on the front bumper, left front wing and tailgate and a cut in the left rear 
seat back and it said the seat cover needed to be replaced. LeasePlan charged Mr S 
£530.04 for the damage, which included £408.54 for the replacement seat cover.
Mr S complained to LeasePlan about the charges but it said that the damage was outside 
the parameters of fair wear and tear and that the seat couldnt be repaired so had to be 
replaced. Mr S has accepted the charges for the scratches and has paid £121.50 to 
LeasePlan but complained to this service about the charge for the replacement seat cover.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She thought that the 
charge had been applied in line with the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association fair 
wear and tear guidelines and that LeasePlan was entitled to charge for damage that goes 
beyond fair wear and tear so she didnt think that the charge was unreasonable.
Mr S has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that hes astounded that the tear to the rear fabric in the boot resulted in LeasePlan 
replacing the whole seat and the cost compared to the actual size of the tear hasnt been 
considered. He says that this isnt a fair process in assessing the level of damage and value 
for money repair in line with the minimal damage in the boot.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the hire agreement, which was signed by Mr S, says: If, when this agreement ends, 
the Vehicle is for any reason returned in a condition not consistent with the 
performance of your obligations (fair wear and tear as defined by the British Vehicle 
Rental and Leasing Association excepted), we shall be entitled to reclaim from you a 
sum equivalent to the actual or estimated cost of repairs, including parts ;
when Mr S returned the car at the end of the agreement it was inspected by a third 
party on behalf of LeasePlan  the vehicle condition report noted the cars mileage as 
32,385 and identified three scratches and a cut of over 10mm in the left rear seat 
back cover which it said needed to be replaced  and a photo of the tear in the seat 
cover has been provided;
LeasePlan charged him £121.50 for the three scratches, which hes now accepted 
and paid, and £408.54 for a replacement seat cover, and it said that the seat cover 
couldnt be repaired and needed to be replaced; 
I consider than the tear in the fabric of the seat cover is more than fair wear and tear 
in accordance with the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association guidelines on 
fair wear and tear so its fair and reasonable for LeasePlan to charge Mr S for that 
damage;
the vehicle condition report recommended that the seat cover needed to be replaced, 
LeasePlan has said that the tear cant be repaired and Im not persuaded that its 
unfair or unreasonable for LeasePlan to charge Mr S for the cost of replacing the 
seat cover  nor I am persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
charge is excessive  and the charge is for the cost of a replacement seat cover, not 
a replacement seat;
the cars mileage when it was inspected was 32,385 and the agreement included an 
annual mileage allowance of 12,500 so, over the three years of the agreement, the 
allowed mileage was 37,500  and Mr S had agreed to pay an advance rental of 
£661.63 and 35 monthly rental payments of £220.48;
Mr S says that he returned the car with 5,000 less miles than the allowed mileage  
but theres no provision in the agreement for him to receive a refund of any of his 
payments if the car is retuned with less than the allowed mileage and I dont consider 
that theres any requirement for LeasePlan to refund to Mr S any of the payments 
that hes made to it or to reduce the damage charges because of the mileage that 
hed driven in the car;
I sympathise with Mr S for the cost that he has to be pay for the replacement seat 
cover but I dont consider that LeasePlan has acted incorrectly in these 
circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require LeasePlan to reduce (or 
waive) the charge for the replacement seat cover, to pay any compensation to Mr S 
or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 June 2021.
