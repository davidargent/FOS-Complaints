The complaint
Miss L complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) incorrectly declined her 
claim of a refund for an item she says she did not receive.
What happened
Miss L purchased an item online in December 2020 and used PayPal as a method of 
payment. Miss L says the item did not arrive, so she contacted PayPal to raise a dispute with 
them.
PayPal say they requested information from the seller for shipment details for the item. They 
say the seller provided it with the relevant tracking information, which confirmed the item had 
been delivered to the correct address. So, they declined Miss Ls claim. PayPal say they 
relied on their User Agreement terms and so Miss L didnt qualify for a refund under their 
PayPal Buyer Protection scheme.
Miss L says she received an email in January 2021 from the seller saying her item was on its 
way. Miss L says she told PayPal about this email she received as it differed from what the 
seller had provided PayPal to show proof of delivery.
Miss L believes this shows there has been some miscommunication between the seller and 
PayPal and that the item has not been received. Miss L would like a refund for the item that 
she believes has been undelivered. PayPal believe the seller had provided proof of the 
tracking delivery to them and declined her claim of a refund.
Miss L, unhappy with PayPals response, brought her complaint to our service. Our 
investigator found that PayPal hadnt acted fairly in declining Miss Ls claim for a refund. She 
found that the information the seller had provided of the shipment details didnt satisfy the 
requirements of proof of delivery PayPal required under their own terms. She says PayPal 
did provide tracking information to show confirmation of delivery. But as this was from a third 
party, rather than the delivery company the seller says they used, she couldnt wholly rely on 
it. She also noticed, among other things, the address details on the third-party site were 
inconsistent with where the seller says the item shipped from.
PayPal responded saying they verified the delivery details on the shipping companys 
website around the time the claim was made. But as the claim was more than four months 
ago, it is no longer available to view on their own website.
PayPal requested the complaint to be referred to an ombudsman and so it has been passed 
to me to decide on.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding this complaint and Ill explain why below.
PayPals terms for claims under Item Not Received within their User Agreement state:
Your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not 
Received claim, if: The seller has provided proof of delivery. If the seller presents evidence 
that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favour of the seller for an Item Not 
Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.
It goes on to say that proof of delivery is defined as:
Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:
Date of delivery and delivered status
An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the Transaction 
details page
An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or zip/postal 
code (or international equivalent).
PayPal has provided a shipping label they say was sent to them from the seller. They say 
they received this shipping label when they contacted the seller once Miss L raised a claim 
with them. The shipping label shows Miss Ls address as its destination as well as a return to 
sender address. But it does not include information confirming the date of delivery and the 
delivered status of the shipping label.
Due to the length of time that has passed, the details on the shipping label cant be traced on 
the shipping companys website. So, I cant be sure that the item was correctly delivered to 
Miss Ls address. PayPal say they verified the delivery details on the shipping companys 
website around the time the claim was made, but they havent been able to provide a copy 
or a screenshot to show the checks they had made.
PayPal has provided us details from a third-party tracking website. But the information 
provided isnt specific enough to again satisfy PayPals own definition for proof of delivery. 
The details provided dont show delivery to an address that matches the shipping address or 
show at least the city or postal code the item was delivered to. So, I cant be sure the item 
was delivered to Miss Ls address using the details from this third-party tracking site.
Furthermore, the third-party tracking website shows the item was collected from an address 
which is different to the return to sender address on the shipping label provided by the seller.
From the delivery information provided by PayPal, I cant see that any of it wholly meets its 
own definition of proof of delivery under their own terms.
PayPal say that the item was delivered on 21 December 2020. But Miss L has also provided 
an email she received from the seller a few weeks later that suggests the item was still on its 
way to Miss L. While it is possible this email was sent to Miss L in error, it does go some way 
to show further checks should have been made around the time Miss L made her claim.
PayPal say they review the claim on the evidence and tracking that is provided from the 
seller directly. While that may be so, if they had considered the information Miss L had 
provided earlier on, then it might have resulted in a different outcome and prevented delays 
in the resolution of this complaint. Or it may have provided further clarity on where the item 
was delivered. However, in this instance, I can only rely on the information in front of me. 
And from what I have seen, PayPal hasnt applied its own terms correctly when declining 
Miss Ls claim for a refund.Putting things right
Im not satisfied PayPal has been able to show proof of delivery in line with their own terms. 
And as a result, Miss L is out of pocket for the cost of the item she tried to purchase. 
Furthermore, Miss L experienced unnecessary frustration and inconvenience as a result of 
PayPal unfairly turning down her request for a refund. So, I instruct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et 
Cie SCA to:
Pay Miss L the cost of the item she purchased but did not receive, plus 8% simple 
interest per year from the date they provided their final response to her complaint 
until the date the payment is made*.
Pay Miss L Â£125 for the inconvenience caused.
*If PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct 
income tax from that interest, it should tell Miss L how much its taken off. It should also give Miss L a 
tax deduction certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs 
if appropriate.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold this complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et 
Cie SCA to put things right by doing as Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 February 2022.
