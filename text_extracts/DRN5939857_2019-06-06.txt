K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains that he was mis-sold  a contract  purchase agreement with Mercedes-Benz  
Financial Services UK Limited  (MBFS).
background
In March 2018 Mr R was supplied with a car and entered into a contract  purchase 
agreement with MBFS.
Prior to entering into the agreement Mr R told the salesperson he wanted  to pay no more 
than a £5000 deposit. An initial quote  was prepared by the salesperson as follows:
£500 deposit from Mr R (paid to reserve the car)
£2950  deposit  from Mr R
£1800  part exchange
£1304  dealer contribution
The total deposit was £6,554. It was agreed that of this sum, £250 would be refunded to Mr 
R upon the dealership receiving the log book for the part exchange car. Taking this into 
account, and excluding the dealer contribution of £1304, the deposit was £5000  which  was 
in accordance with Mr Rs wishes. 
The resulting  contract  purchase agreement was for a term of 48 months  with monthly 
payments of £259  plus an optional final payment at the end of the term.
Mr R then asked the salesperson  to reduce the monthly payments to £250. The salesperson  
agreed to increase the value of the part exchange  from £1800 to £2100. This had the effect 
of increasing the total deposit  by £300 to £5300. This resulted in monthly  payments of £250, 
which was in accordance with Mr Rs wishes.
Mr R signed the contract  purchase agreement at the dealership. After signing he noticed that 
the deposit was £5300. He told the salesperson he didnt want  to go ahead with the 
agreement because he only wanted to pay a deposit  of £5000.
The salesperson told Mr R that because he had already signed the agreement on the 
premises it couldnt be cancelled.
Mr R complained to MBFS. He was unhappy that his deposit had been  increased from 
£5000 to £5300. He feels that because the value of his part exchange increased by £300 he 
is entitled to £300 back. He doesnt  agree that the £300 should be used towards  the deposit. 
Mr R felt the agreement  had been  mis-sold and asked MBFS if he could reject the car.
In its final response MBFS said there  was nothing to suggest  Mr R had made an 
overpayment or that he was owed a refund.
Mr R was unhappy with this response and complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. She said that although there had been a 
change to the deposit amount from the initial illustration provided to Mr R, this was a change  
to achieve what  Mr R had asked for i.e. to reduce the monthly payment to £250.  The 
investigator concluded that the agreement hadnt been mis-sold.
Ref: DRN59398572Mr R didnt agree. He said that when he asked for his monthly payment to be reduced to 
£250 it was on the basis that his deposit would  be £5000. He feels that hes owed £300.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the screen shot provided  by Mr R. This shows  the cost of the agreement  
based on a £5000 deposit. The monthly payments (based on a £5000  deposit) are £259.
Ive also looked  at the contract purchase agreement which Mr R signed. This shows  a £5300 
deposit and monthly  payments of £250.
I understand why Mr R is unhappy.  He told the salesperson he didnt want to pay more than 
£5000 deposit  and the agreement he entered into shows  a deposit of £5300.  However, Im 
satisfied that it was necessary for the salesperson to increase the deposit (by increasing the 
value of the part exchange) in order to facilitate Mr Rs request for monthly payments of 
£250. It wouldntve been possible to reduce the monthly payments to £250  without  a 
corresponding adjustment to the deposit. 
Mr R hasnt suffered any financial loss here, because  the deposit  was increased by inflating 
the part exchange value of his old car by £300. If the value of the part exchange car hadnt  
been increased by £300,  the monthly  payments under the agreement  would have been 
£259.
In considering whether theres been a misrepresentation (and whether the agreement was 
mis-sold as a result)  I need to be satisfied that there was an untrue statement of fact that 
caused Mr R to enter into the agreement.
In Mr Rs case, Im unable to say that the salesperson made  an untrue statement of fact. The 
deposit increased from £5000 to £5300  because of the increase in value of the part 
exchange. This achieved what Mr R had asked for, namely monthly payments of £250.  I 
cant see that the salesperson ever suggested or agreed with Mr R that he would receive  a 
refund of £300  and Im unable to agree  that a refund is due.
For the reasons  Ive given, I cant conclude that theres been  a misrepresentation or that the 
agreement was mis-sold to Mr R. So I cant fairly ask MBFS to allow  Mr R to reject  the car or 
to provide him with a refund. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 July 2019.
