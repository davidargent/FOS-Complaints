The complaint
Mr F complains about the amount that hes been charged by Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, for damage to a car that he 
returned when he voluntarily terminated his hire purchase agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr F under a hire purchase agreement with Mercedes-
Benz Finance that he signed in July 2016 and which included its vehicle return 
standards;
he voluntarily terminated the agreement in May 2019 and the car was collected and 
inspected by a third party;
the inspection report identified significant damage to the car and estimated the repair 
cost as being £1,827.69 - the report included photos of the damage;
Mercedes-Benz Finance charged Mr F a total of £2,330.21 but it then removed the 
charge for a key and reduced the charge for excess mileage which reduced the total 
charge to £1,970.25 and included £1,050.32 for a scratched left headlight; 
Mr F complained about the charges, including the charge for the scratched headlight, 
but wasnt satisfied with Mercedes-Benz Finances response so complained to this 
service; 
our investigator recommended that the charge for the headlight should be reduced to 
the estimated charge of £814.94 that had been included on the inspection report;
Mercedes-Benz Finance has accepted that the cost of the headlight was less than 
the £1,050.32 that Mr F was charged for it but it says that more damage was found 
on the car and that its cost it about £4,500 to rectify the damage but Mr F has only 
be charged a total of £1,542.69 for the damage;
its clear from inspection report that there was considerable damage to the car, 
including to the left headlight on the car, and I consider that the damage is more than 
would reasonably be considered to be fair wear and tear in accordance with 
Mercedes-Benz Finances vehicle return standards  so I consider that its fair and 
reasonable for Mr F to be charged for the damage;
Mercedes-Benz Finance accepts that the cost of the headlight was less than the 
amount that it charged Mr F and I dont consider that its fair or reasonable for it to 
charge a higher amount than the repair cost or to charge a higher amount for one 
item of damage because there was other damage to the car for which Mr F hadnt 
been charged  and I dont consider that Mercedes-Benz Finance has properly 
justified a charge of £1,050.32 for the headlight;
I consider that the other charges that Mercedes-Benz Finance has made are fair and 
reasonable so Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require 
it to reduce any of those charges; and 
the inspection report and the third partys estimate of the repair costs refer to a 
charge for the headlight of £814.94 and I consider that its fair and reasonable in 
these circumstances for Mercedes-Benz Finance to reduce the amount that its 
charged Mr F for the scratched headlight from £1,050.32 to £814.94. 
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Mercedes-Benz Finance 
to reduce the amount that its charged Mr F for the scratched headlight from £1,050.32 to 
£814.94 but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Fs complaint and I order Mercedes-Benz Financial Services 
UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, to reduce the charge for the damage to the 
cars headlamp from £1,050.32 to £814.94.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2020.
