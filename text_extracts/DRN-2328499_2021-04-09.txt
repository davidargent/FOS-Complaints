The complaint
Mr D and Miss G are unhappy that their buildings and contents insurance premiums with 
Lloyds Bank General Insurance (Lloyds) increased by a lot over the life of their policies.
What happened
Mr D and Miss G took out buildings and contents insurance with Lloyds in 2009. Mr G says 
he switched after Lloyds badgered him constantly, and because he had held a bank 
account with Lloyds for over 30 years and trusted it. He also thought having insurance with 
Lloyds would keep things together. For the next 11 years, Mr D and Miss G did not make 
any claims on their insurance or make any enquiries with Lloyds. Their insurance renewed 
automatically every year. In 2020 Mr D shopped around and says he was able to find 
comparable insurance with another insurer for £1,000 less than the renewal quote from 
Lloyds, plus a further saving on his car insurance.
When Mr D and Miss G got the new quote from the other insurer, they complained to Lloyds.
Lloyds said the premiums Mr D and Miss G were charged were correct for the cover 
provided. It said the way premiums are calculated is confidential, but that factors such as 
changes in its view of risk contribute towards premiums, and new policies often include an 
introductory discount.
Mr D and Miss G were not happy with the response from Lloyds, and complained to this 
service. One of our investigators looked into their complaint, and partially upheld it. 
The investigator looked at whether the price increases were fair. He said if Lloyds only 
increased the price because Mr D and Miss G were likely to renew the policies without 
question and there was no apparent change in the insured risk, this would indicate it was 
taking advantage of the fact that they werent engaging. This wouldnt be fair. However he 
said it might be fair to increase the premiums when a new business discount was removed. 
He said Mr D and Miss Gs property was in an area at risk of flood, and it might also be fair 
to increase the price of their policies if the way the flood risk was assessed changed. So he 
looked at whether Mr D and Miss Gs premiums increased in line with these changes, or 
whether Lloyds treated them differently because they didnt engage with it at renewal. 
The investigator explained that this service has worked closely with Lloyds at a senior level 
to understand how it sets its prices. Lloyds provided details of how it had calculated Mr D 
and Miss Gs premiums. The investigator looked at these and said that Lloyds had 
demonstrated that it treated Mr D and Miss G in the same way as it treated other customers 
in most of the years of their policies. However he said in the years 2017 and 2018 Lloyds 
charged Mr D and Miss G more than it would have charged other customers in similar 
situations, and so Lloyds was likely taking advantage of their loyalty. He said Lloyds should 
refund £293.75, which was the amount overcharged.
Mr D and Miss G and Lloyds were not happy with the investigators view and so the 
complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
Mr D and Miss G still maintain that they have been overcharged by £1,000 during the life of 
their policies with Lloyds and cannot see any justification for this. They say their property is 
low flood risk according to the government website. Mr D acknowledges that he should have 
looked better at the policies, but feels that Lloyds have no moral standards and have 
robbed him for years.
Lloyds said it disagreed with the investigators view because it did not believe that the 
specific criteria that apply to pricing complaints had been met in this case. It said first it 
would consider if the customer was vulnerable and if so, whether this vulnerability 
prevented them from engaging with Lloyds or the wider market to get a lower price. Lloyds 
said where customers are not vulnerable and have engaged, it would look at whether they 
had expressed a clear need for a cheaper product which it had not met. Lloyds said Mr D 
and Miss G were not vulnerable and were able to engage and to shop around, because they 
did so in 2020. Lloyds said that when Mr D and Miss G contacted it in 2020, there was no 
discount or cheaper policies available to them because of the high flood risk at their 
property.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Whilst I do not agree completely with Mr D and Miss G, I do think that Lloyds did charge 
them too much for their insurance in two years of the policies, and it should refund them the 
mount of £293.75 plus interest. I will explain why I think this and what Lloyds needs to do put 
things right.
In deciding whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint, there are a 
number of things I need to consider. I need to consider whether there have in fact been 
changes to the risk which would justify increases in Mr D and Miss Gs premiums. If so, I 
need to consider whether Lloyds should have then found a way to reduce those premiums. 
And I need to consider whether Lloyds has stayed within its own policies for increasing 
customers premiums and whether the price increases are consistent with other customers 
regardless of the degree of engagement. Here at the Financial Ombudsman Service we 
arent underwriters or here to tell an insurer how it should set its prices, but we want to make 
sure customers are treated fairly. We need to be confident an insurers approach to the risk 
is consistent and fair. An inconsistent approach to the same risk wouldnt be fair.
Mr D and Miss G live in an area that is at risk of flooding. Like most insurers, Lloyds has 
changed the way it views flood risk as it learns more about the areas it insures and as things 
change that affect that risk. Lloyds has told us it uses a number of different sources of 
information to decide flood risk. Lloyds normally rates flood risk out of 30 and a customer 
with a rating of 5/30 would represent a low flood risk  anything from 20/30 upwards would 
be deemed a high flood risk. Lloyds have told us that, following an update to their risk 
models, Mr D and Miss Gs propertys flood risk rating increased from coastal band 18 to 
band 28 in 2018.
I need to look at whether it would have been fair for Lloyds to have found a way to reduce Mr 
D and Miss Gs premiums. A scheme called Flood Re was introduced in 2016 to help make 
flood risk insurance more affordable for customers with homes built before 2009 in areas at 
risk of flooding. Insurers must pay into the scheme and the money raised makes a reserve 
for successful claims. The insurer passes the cost of the flood risk part of the policy onto 
Flood Re for a fixed price for each policy. Then if a valid claim is made the insurer will pay it 
and claim a reimbursement from Flood Re. If Flood Re was available, we would want to 
make sure it was offered where appropriate. We wouldnt consider it fair for an insurer to charge a much higher premium due to flood risk when it could have ceded this to Flood Re 
to enable the customer to pay a lot less for their cover. 
Lloyds has told us that it did not cede Mr D and Miss Gs policies to Flood Re before the 
increase in the flood risk banding in 2018 as this wouldnt have made their insurance any 
cheaper. Following the increase the policies were ceded to Flood Re which resulted in a 
reduction in the cost. Lloyds have also told us that when Mr D contacted it in 2020, it looked 
to see if there were any alternative policies or discount which would reduce the cost of the 
premiums. There were not. Lloyds has also told us that there wouldnt have been discounts 
available on the policies at any point. So I dont think that Lloyds should have found a way to 
reduce the cost of Mr D and Miss Gs premiums further by applying a discount, changing the 
policies or ceding to Flood Re earlier.
So I need to consider whether Lloyds has treated Mr D and Miss G fairy compared to other 
customers by staying within its own pricing guidelines.
Lloyds introduced a target pricing model in 2016 and is able to apply this model 
retrospectively to 2014. Target pricing represents an effective cap on the price Lloyds will 
charge. The target is based on what Lloyds feels it needs to charge in order to be able to 
meet the costs of covering the risk, its operating costs and agreed profit margins. Lloyds is 
entitled to set the price of its insurance and charge what it feels it needs to in order to cover 
this risk. The target pricing model demonstrates it is applying a consistent approach to its 
pricing with all its customers and not taking advantage of their lack of engagement.
From 2014 Lloyds should be able to demonstrate whether the price it charged was within 
this target pricing range. If the customer hasnt paid more than the target price for the years 
Lloyds can demonstrate this was in place, wed likely say this is fair.
If the target price has been exceeded and the customer was vulnerable or was unable to 
shop around because of a barrier to them being able to do this - a perception of loyalty being 
rewarded is an example of this - Lloyds has said it will refund anything paid above the target 
price. 
What the target price is and how Lloyds reaches it is commercially sensitive and I cant 
share this with Mr D and Miss G. 
We asked Lloyds to show us what it charged Mr D and Miss G for their insurance since they 
took the policies out.

I think it should have been clear to Lloyds after the 2013 renewal that Mr D and Miss G 
werent engaging with the renewals of their insurance. I also think it reasonable to say that 
any new customer discount on the original policies had been recouped by this time. (The 
policies were not originally underwritten by Lloyds, so the exact figures on this are not 
available). So I need to see if the increases after this were fair, or whether Mr D and Miss G 
were treated less fairly than other customers. I have looked at the target prices Lloyds have 
provided in respect of the policies and I can see that Lloyds charged Mr D and Miss G more 
than the target price in 2017 and 2018. The total amount charged over the target price was 
£293.75.Lloyds has said it shouldnt have to refund this amount because Mr D and Miss G are not 
vulnerable, and anyway it is only a small amount. I dont agree. Lloyds have told us that, 
after it received Mr D and Miss Gs complaint, it tried four times unsuccessfully to speak to 
them to discuss things. It then decided they were not vulnerable based it seems only on the 
fact that in 2020 they did shop around and did contact it. Mr D has told us he took out the 
policies with Lloyds because he had banked with it for over 30 years and trusted it. Mr D also 
told us when he first contacted this service that he prefers personal contact, doesnt use 
email or the internet greatly, and only started using comparison sites recently. Mr D also told 
us he prefers contact by phone but he works and he isnt always available. He rarely hears 
his mobile phone.
On balance I think that Mr D and Miss G are vulnerable in the context of Lloyds pricing 
policy.
Putting things right
To put things right, Lloyds needs to refund the amount overcharged to Mr D and Miss G, 
plus interest to compensate them for the time they were without the money.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I am upholding this complaint in part. I require Lloyds Bank 
General Insurance Limited to pay Mr D and Miss G the sum of £293.75 plus simple interest 
at 8% from the time the premiums were paid to the date of settlement. If Lloyds Bank 
General Insurance Limited considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct 
income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr D and Miss G how much it has taken off. It 
should also give Mr D and Miss G a certificate showing this if they ask for one, so they can 
reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D and Miss G 
to accept or reject my decision before 7 May 2021.
