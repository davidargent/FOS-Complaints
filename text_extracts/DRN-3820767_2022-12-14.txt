The complaint
Mr G complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA refunded a buyer under its buyer 
protection policy without requiring them to return the item he had sold them. Mr G says this 
left him without the items or the payment. 
What happened
In mid-2022, Mr G received a payment of £4,400 into his PayPal account after selling an 
item online. A few weeks later the buyer raised a dispute under PayPals Buyer Protection 
policy, claiming the item was significantly not as described.
PayPal says the dispute was escalated to a claim after the matter couldnt be resolved 
amicably between Mr G and the buyer. It says that as Mr G didnt respond to its request for 
information, the case was closed in the buyers favour. PayPal refunded the buyer £4,400, 
without requiring them to return the item to Mr G. 
Mr G says the buyer didnt return the item, so he had lost this as well as the payment. He 
complained to PayPal but the matter wasnt resolved. So, he asked our service to consider 
his concerns.
Our investigator thought Mr Gs complaint should be upheld. He didnt think PayPal had 
acted fairly towards Mr G and recommended it refund him for the item he had sold. 
PayPal disagreed with our investigators outcome. It said it had acted in line with its user 
agreement. It said the claim had been closed correctly as Mr G hadnt responded to it once 
the dispute was escalated to a claim. So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold Mr Gs complaint. Ill explain why.
PayPal says the buyer opened the dispute on 17 June 2022. This was escalated to a claim 
on 24 June 2022, at which point PayPal says it stepped into investigate. 
I can see that PayPal notified Mr G that the dispute had been escalated to a claim and sent 
him reminder emails on 28 June and 2 July. PayPal says that Mr G didnt respond, so it 
closed the case in the buyers favour on 4 July, without requiring them to return the item.
Both parties have provided information that shows Mr G agreed to refund the buyer if he 
sent the item back before the buyer escalated the dispute to a claim. The buyer requested 
his return address, and this was provided by Mr G on 18 June 2022.
PayPals email of 24 June 2022 says: The buyer opened a claim. The buyer stated that the 
item was defective or not as described Please help us to resolve this issue by logging into 
the Resolution Centre and providing us with any information that can assist us with our 
investigation.
Given that Mr G had already agreed to refund the buyer, I dont find it surprising that he 
might not have felt the need to respond to PayPal. He doesnt appear to have intended to 
dispute the buyers claim that the item wasnt as described.
PayPal says the buyer was ready to return the item but was waiting for Mr G to respond to a 
question they appear to have asked a few days after the dispute was escalated to a claim 
(on 27 June 2022): Can you please confirm this is the complete address below to send it to, 
including post code?
I note that Mr G didnt include the post code when he provided his address to the buyer. 
However, I think this issue could easily have been resolved if PayPal had asked Mr G for 
specific information. The reminder email PayPal sent on 28 June says: If you have any 
additional supporting documentation to help us resolve this case, please log into your 
PayPal account and go to our Resolution Centre to send it to us before 4 July 2022. Theres 
no mention of what was required in this email or the final reminder sent on 2 July.
PayPal has acknowledged having Mr Gs return address on file, but it says it doesnt select 
the customers address they wish the return to be sent to. Given that Mr G had already told 
the buyer where he wanted the item returned to, its unclear why PayPal couldnt have 
confirmed the post code and asked the buyer to return the items.
I can see that PayPal informed Mr G that the case would be closed in the buyers favour if he 
didnt respond to its emails by 4 July 2022. The emails also say that PayPal cannot 
guarantee the return of Mr Gs goods if the case is found in the buyers favour. However, not 
guaranteeing the return isnt the same as not requesting that the goods be returned. 
PayPals user agreement says that if a buyer a is filing a Significantly Not as Described 
claim, PayPal may require (them), at (their) expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to 
PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of 
delivery.
I havent seen anything to suggest that PayPal requested the buyer return the item to Mr G 
or anywhere else before processing the refund.
Mr G has sent us recordings of telephone conversations he had with PayPal after the case 
was closed in the buyers favour. In these calls the address was discussed, and PayPal 
agreed to re-open the dispute, assuring Mr G that the refund hadnt been issued to the 
buyer. However, PayPals records suggest that Mr Gs appeal was rejected without any 
further consideration to what he had said. 
Having considered what happened, I dont think PayPal has treated Mr G fairly. As PayPal 
refunded the buyer without requiring them to return the item to Mr G, he was left without the 
item or the payment. So, I think it would be fair for PayPal to reimburse Mr G the amount that 
it refunded to the buyer (£4,400).
Putting things right
PayPal should pay Mr G £4,400.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mr Gs complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et 
Cie SCA to put things right by doing as Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 January 2023.
