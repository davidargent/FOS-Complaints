The complaint
A company, which Ill refer to as J, complains that ClearBank Ltd (ClearBank) wont
reimburse the money it lost in a scam. Ms L, who is the sole director of J, brings this
complaint on Js behalf.
What happened
What Ms L says
J had an account with ClearBank. Js director was contacted by messaging on social media
by someone purporting to be her son. Ms L didnt know at the time, but the messages were
actually from a scammer. The scammer said he dropped his phone, with his bank card in the
case, down the toilet. As a result, his banking apps had been temporarily blocked. The
messages said that two payments needed to be made urgently to pay for a new phone and
to pay an outstanding debt to the same person. After Ms L made these payments, she was
asked to make a further payment to the same person. The payment was returned and Ms L
was asked to make a further payment, which the scammer told her would be the last. But the
scammer then asked for further payments. 
On 22 November 2021, Ms L made seven payments made from the Js account as follows:
Payment 
numberTime Amount Payee
1 10.59 £685 A
2 13.01 £512 A
3 14.47 (returned 14.53) £505 (returned 14.53) A
4 15.30 £678 B
5 16.14 £612 C
6 16.48 £593 C
7 17.19 £499 B
Ms L thought the messages were from her son because he has a condition that means he
can behave erratically. The scammer told Ms L he would call to explain things that evening.
When her son didnt call as agreed she became worried and showed the messages to her
partner, who told her he thought she had been scammed. Ms L contacted ClearBank at
22.16 to report her concerns.
ClearBank contacted the firm that received Js funds the following day and later told Ms L
that no funds remained to return to her.
Ms L complained on behalf of J. She said the payments were made fraudulently and
ClearBank should have questioned or verified them. Ms L also thought ClearBank hadnt
done enough to recover her funds as she reported the scam on the evening of 22 November
2021 but ClearBank didnt contact the receiving firm until the following day. Ms L said she
contacted ClearBank well before 00.16 on 23 November 2021 (not as ClearBank had
claimed it had). But ClearBank didnt respond until after 11 am the following day.
What ClearBank say
ClearBank accepted it hadnt contacted the beneficiary bank as quickly as it should have but
said that had it done so it wouldnt have made a difference in this case. This was because it
had evidence from the firm that received the funds that they were removed before 00.16 on
23 November 2021. So even if ClearBank had acted more quickly, it wouldnt have been
able to recover any funds. ClearBank also said that as it isnt signed up to the Contingent
Reimbursement Model Code (CRM Code) there was nothing more it could do.
Our investigation so far
J brought its complaint to us. Our investigator said ClearBank should refund the payments
from the fifth one onwards. This was because the investigator thought the pattern of
payments made on the day in question were unusual for the way in which J operated its
account in the months before. He said ClearBank shouldve contacted J to discuss payment
five. If they had, then the scam would likely have been uncovered and some payments
wouldve been stopped.
The investigator also felt that ClearBank had done what it could to recover Js funds and the
delay in contacting the receiving firm hadnt made a difference in this case.
ClearBank didnt agree. They said the messages showed that Js director was concerned
about what was happening, and there was an onus on her to question the payments. The
seven payments were made over a period of seven hours and there were enough red flags
to suggest that Js director shouldve been on alert. It wasnt unusual for a business to make
multiple payments in a day, as was the case here. On the matter of ClearBanks response to
Js contact  they said their fraud team worked the hours between 8am and 6pm, and
therefore couldnt respond until the next day.
Js complaint has come to me to consider.
I reached a provisional decision which said:
Im sorry to hear that Ms Ls business has lost money in a cruel scam. Its not in question
that Ms L, on behalf of J, authorised and consented to the payments in this case. So
although Ms L didnt intend for Js money to go to the scammer, J is presumed to be liable
for the loss in the first instance.
The CRM Code doesnt apply in this case because ClearBank hasnt signed up to it. But,
taking into account the law, regulatory rules and guidance, relevant codes of practice and
good industry practice, there are circumstances where it might be appropriate for ClearBank
to take additional steps or make additional checks before processing a payment in order to
help protect its customer from the possibility of financial harm from fraud.
In this case, I dont consider ClearBank acted unfairly or unreasonably in allowing the
payments to be made. Whilst I understand the loss has had a big impact on J, I dontconsider the payments were so out of character that ClearBank ought reasonably to have
had concerns that J may be the victim of fraud. I am mindful of the fact the payments were
made from a business account where larger payments arent unusual.
None of the payments were particularly significant in value and J had made payments of
similar value in the months before the scam. For example, there was a payment of £890 in
October 2021. So the payments in November 2021 dont stand out. The pattern of
transactions also doesnt fit the usual pattern of scam payments which increase over time.
And whilst all the payments were made on the same day, they werent made in rapid
succession and didnt totally drain the account of funds.
Theres a balance to be struck: ClearBank has obligations to be alert to fraud and scams and
to act in their customers best interests, but they cant be involved in every transaction as this
would cause unnecessary disruption to legitimate payments. In this case, I think ClearBank
acted reasonably in processing the payments.
Recovery
We looked at whether ClearBank took the necessary steps in contacting the bank that
received the funds  in an effort to recover the lost funds.
ClearBank told us that their fraud department is open between 8am and 6pm  and so they
couldnt contact the recipient bank until the following day, which they did at 11am  which I
think was reasonable. And by that time, the funds had been removed from the beneficiary
account. The recipient bank told ClearBank the money was removed before midnight on 22
November 2021.
We asked the recipient bank for more details about the exact time the funds were removed.
But in this case, we found that bank isnt based in the UK, nor regulated by the Financial
Conduct Authority, and so couldnt give us any more information. We were told though that
because of local law funds could only be returned if the account holder agrees, which is
highly unlikely here. So I dont consider earlier contact by ClearBank would have made a
difference in this case.
Therefore, we accept that the funds were removed before midnight on 22 November 2021.
And given that ClearBank contacted the recipient bank at 11 am on 23 November 2021, its
understandable that ClearBank couldnt recover any of the money.
J has been the unfortunate victim of a cruel scam, and I know Ms L will be disappointed by
my provisional decision  which is that ClearBank dont have to do anymore here.
Responses to the provisional decision:
ClearBank didnt have any comments, but Ms L did. She said:
She couldnt see how a decision could be reversed if the bank appeals.
The provisional decision didnt make reference to ClearBanks final response, which 
upheld the complaint and said the response times of their agents wasnt good 
enough. She said the provisional decision focused on what ClearBank told the 
service and not the banks final response.
The pattern of payments was unusual  between January 2021 and November 2021 
there were only two payments from the account. 
The pattern of payments was typical of a scam.
The bank should therefore have intervened.The view that had the bank have acted quicker, then that would not have made any 
difference isnt based on any evidence.
I now need to consider these points and make final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered Ms Ls points:
Process: It is our process that our investigator issues a view to both consumer and the firm 
(in this case, ClearBank). If one or other party disagrees, then the complaint is sent to an 
ombudsman for a decision. Thats whats happened here  ClearBank didnt agree and so 
the complaint came to me, as an ombudsman, to consider. 
I can see the process was described in documents sent to Ms L by our investigator.
ClearBanks final response not referenced: the provisional decision does detail ClearBanks 
final response  under what ClearBank say. I agree that the banks final response upheld 
the complaint  but there wasnt any refund of money, which was obviously Ms Ls main 
issue in bringing the complaint to us. 
ClearBanks final response did say they provide a 24/7 service. In considering the 
complaint, I asked for more information from the bank about that. And  as referenced later 
in the provisional decision, the bank told us that in fact, the fraud team  who needed to deal 
with the scam and try to get the money back  worked the hours of 8am-6pm. So they 
couldnt deal with matters until the morning of 23 November 2021. We cant make a firm 
change its working hours.
Pattern of payments: I acknowledge that there were only a small number of payments before 
the scam. But the provisional decision also sets out that on balance, we would not have 
expected ClearBank to intervene because:
- The value of the payments was relatively low
- There was a time lag between each one  between half an hour and two hours.
- The account wasnt drained of funds
- The payments were to three different payees.
These characteristics are not typical of a normal scam  and therefore, we would not have 
expected ClearBank to step in in those circumstances.
Time that ClearBank contacted recipient bank: to clarify, the provisional decision said that 
had ClearBank acted quicker, it wouldve made no difference  that was because the 
recipient bank is based outside the UK, nor is it regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority. And under the local laws in which that bank operates, the scammers authority 
would be needed to release the funds  and of course, that was very unlikely to happen.I looked further at what happened  and we have been told by the recipient bank that the 
funds were removed by 00.15 on the morning of 23 November 2021. And because 
ClearBanks fraud department wasnt open until the following morning, no funds could ever 
have been recovered.
So  I know this will be disappointing to Ms L, but having considered her points, my final 
decision is unchanged from the provisional decision.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask J to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 June 2023.
