The complaint
Mr F complains that MotoNovo Finance Limited has acted unfairly by declining his request to 
remove a hard credit search from his credit file.
What happened
In June 2021 Mr F attended a dealership as he was interested in acquiring a car. Mr F says 
unknown to him this dealership applied for two different credit agreements with two different 
credit providers.
Two days after attending this dealership, Mr F visited a different car dealer. This time he 
authorised the dealer to apply for a credit agreement with MotoNovo. MotoNovo declined his 
application as it said Mr Fs credit file didnt meet its criteria to obtain finance.
Mr F says he then discovered the two unauthorised applications which had been recorded 
plus he also discovered that his bank had made an error, and his bank account hadnt been 
recorded on his credit file. Mr F says the inaccurate information was corrected and he asked 
MotoNovo to remove the record of its search which had resulted in the declined application 
for credit. He said it was unfair to record the hard search since the decision to decline his 
application had been based on inaccurate information on his credit file.
MotoNovo declined to remove its search. It said it was obliged to report accurate information 
to the credit reference agencies which it had. MotoNovo said Mr F had authorised a credit 
application to be made to it and that it had used the personal information hed provided as 
well as information obtained from credit checking. It said Mr F hadnt met its minimum 
lending criteria and so his application was rejected.
Mr F disagreed with MotoNovos view and complained to this service. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He said that although there had been 
inaccurate information on Mr Fs credit file this wasnt due to anything MotoNovo had done. 
MotoNovo had made checks as authorised by Mr F when he applied for a credit agreement 
and this was all it had reported. Our investigator said MotoNovo had acted fairly and 
reasonably in reporting its search and he wouldnt ask it to remove that information.
Our investigator said he couldnt speculate as to the reason why MotoNovo had declined Mr 
Fs credit application. He said several factors would have been taken into account including 
Mr Fs personal circumstances as well as his credit file. So, he couldnt say the inaccurate 
information had been the cause of MotoNovos decision to turn down Mr Fs application.
Mr F disagreed with the view of our investigator. He said that his credit file had contained 
incorrect information, and this had led to MotoNovos decision to decline his application. Mr 
F said it would be unfair and unjust for that decision to be maintained in light of the new 
findings. He said he had been able to obtain a credit agreement once his credit file had been 
amended although hed had to take a higher interest rate due to MotoNovos search still 
being shown.
As the parties werent able to reach an agreement the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It isnt disputed that the credit application made to MotoNovo had been authorised by Mr F. 
And that this application permitted MotoNovo to look at personal information Mr F had 
provided as well as look at his credit file. MotoNovo assessed Mr Fs application in line with 
its lending criteria and declined it as Mr Fs application didnt meet the minimum required for 
a credit agreement to be approved.
Following the decision by MotoNovo, Mr F says he became aware that there was incorrect 
information on his credit file. He says that there had been two unauthorised credit 
applications resulting in two hard searches and that his bank account was also not reported 
on his credit file. Mr F says that his credit file has since been amended and once it was, he 
was able to obtain a credit agreement though due to the hard search recorded by MotoNovo 
this was at a higher rate of interest.
MotoNovo is obliged to record accurate and fair information with the credit reference 
agencies. Mr F says that the search undertaken by MotoNovo wasnt fair because its 
decision wasnt based on accurate information. However, Im afraid I disagree, and I will 
explain why.
It's agreed that the errors on Mr Fs credit file werent due to any actions of MotoNovo and 
that its searching of Mr Fs credit file had been agreed by him. So, MotoNovo had reported 
accurately that it had searched his credit file.
Looking at whether the reporting of this search was fair Ive seen that its also not disputed 
that it would appear there was inaccurate information showing at the time MotoNovo 
undertook the search. And Ive seen MotoNovo informed Mr F that it had declined his credit 
application due to his credit file not meeting the criteria needed to obtain finance. 
But I cant reasonably say that MotoNovos decision to decline was based solely on the 
wrongly recorded previous searches and the lack of a bank account. Eligibility criteria for 
credit will have included a number of factors both personal and those held within a credit file. 
While I appreciate Mr F says he was later able to successfully obtain a credit agreement 
once the correct information was showing on his credit file, Ive seen this was for a higher 
interest rate with a different credit provider. Since each credit provider will operate its own 
set of criteria for lending, I cant reasonably say this is evidence that MotoNovo would have 
reached a different decision had Mr Fs credit file contained only the accurate information.
Taking into account that MotoNovo hadnt acted unfairly when carrying out the search of Mr 
Fs credit file, and that I cant reasonably say the inaccurate information was the sole cause 
of Mr F being declined credit, then I think what was recorded by MotoNovo was accurate and 
fair. And although I appreciate this will be of disappointment to Mr F, Im not upholding his 
complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above Im not upholding Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 April 2022.
