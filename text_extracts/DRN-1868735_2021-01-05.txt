The complaint
Miss W has complained about incorrect information given to her by National Westminster 
Bank Plc (NatWest) about overpayments to her mortgage account. Miss W says that, as a 
result, she has lost over £16,000, which she is asking NatWest to reimburse.
What happened
In 2012 Miss W took out a two-year fixed-rate interest-only mortgage with NatWest. The 
product terms provided that an overpayment of up to 10% could be made during the fixed-
rate period without incurring an early repayment charge (ERC). Miss W made overpayments.
However, NatWest also has a policy that, where a customer is within 110 days of a product 
expiring, an overpayment of 30% of the mortgage balance can be made. Miss W didnt know 
about this until December 2019 when she contacted the bank about making a 10% 
overpayment.
Miss W complained to the bank. NatWest upheld the complaint and refunded £2,557.41 
representing a refund of interest that Miss W would not have had to pay if she had made the 
30% overpayments each time she switched product. The bank paid compensation of £500 
for trouble and upset. NatWest also said that Miss W could have been due a refund of 
£16,154.15.
Miss W wasnt happy with the compensation offered by NatWest and wanted the bank to pay 
her the additional £16,154.15. She complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
An investigator looked in some detail at what had happened. In a letter dated 15 May 2020 
the investigator made the following findings (which I have anonymised as appropriate):
I have been able to gather where this figure of £16,154.15 comes from and can 
explain why this isn't an additional refund due to Miss W.
NatWest have confirmed that had Miss W made the 30% overpayments then this 
would have meant a 30% overpayment in August 2014 for £17,529.16, a 30% 
overpayment in November 2016 for £8,596.42 and finally a 30% overpayment in 
December 2018 for £3,928.97. This means that Miss W's mortgage balance could 
have been reduced by the total amount of £30,054.55. Since Miss Ws contractual  
monthly payment (CMP) is calculated based on the mortgage balance. This means 
that Miss Ws CMP would have been lower had the 30% overpayments been made.
The £16,154.15 is the amount Miss W's CMP would have been reduced by if she had 
made the 30% overpayments. If NatWest were to refund the £16,154.15 that Miss W 
could have been saved from paying as part of her CMP this would then increase her 
mortgage balance by £16,154.15 since this amount is still due to NatWest.
NatWest have factored in the £30,054.55 overpayments that could have been made 
and found that she would have saved £2,557.41 in interest and I can see that 
NatWest have already refunded this to her mortgage balance
The investigator noted that NatWest had agreed to allow Miss W to settle her mortgage 
balance (about £15,000) without incurring an ERC, which he thought was fair. He was also 
satisfied the £500 paid by the bank for trouble and upset was fair and reasonable.
Miss W didnt accept the investigators findings. She has made one further point  which is 
that she says she was told by NatWest that the bank didnt want to pay the money she was 
owed.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed everything, Ive reached the same outcome as the investigator, for largely 
the same reasons.
NatWest has accepted its mistaking in not letting Miss W know that, within 110 days of a 
product ending, she could make a 30% deposit of the outstanding balance to her mortgage 
account. Where a mistake has been made, what I have to do is to ask the bank to put 
Miss W in the position shed have been in if the mistake hadnt been made.
NatWest has calculated that, if Miss W had made the overpayments (as set out above), 
shed have saved £2,557.41 in interest, and would also have had a lower CMP, so shed 
have paid £16,154.15 less overall if shed made the overpayments totalling £30,054.55.
NatWest explained this in an email sent to Miss W dated 24 February 2020. 
The £16,154.15 is the difference between the monthly payments you would 
have made had the 30% part redemptions been applied from the payments 
you actually made. After each part redemption, there would have been a 
recalculation to reduce the monthly payment to take into account the lower 
balance. Our rework calculates the overpayments made had the part 
redemptions been applied at the specified times. This is the £16,154.15 figure 
quoted and would only be due to be paid back to you if you had actually paid 
us the additional allowance of £30,054.55
But because Miss W didnt pay the part redemptions totalling £30,054.55 to NatWest, Im 
satisfied she isnt due a refund of the £16,154.15, which is the difference in what she actually 
paid and the amount she would have paid if those part redemptions had been made. 
I appreciate Miss W probably would have made the 30% overpayments if shed known about 
them at the time. But if Miss W had made those overpayments, shed have had £30,000 less 
in savings available for her own disposal. Given this, it would not be fair or reasonable for 
Miss W to keep her £30,000 and have an additional £16,000. 
NatWest has refunded £2,557.41 in notional interest, paid Miss W compensation of £500 for 
trouble and upset, and has also agreed that she can pay off her current mortgage without 
any ERC (if applicable). I think this is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances, and Im 
not ordering the bank to pay anything further.
My final decisionMy final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 February 2021.
