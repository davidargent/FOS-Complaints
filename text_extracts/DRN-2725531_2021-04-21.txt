irresponsibly. He says he was forced to take these loans when this wasnt appropriate. 
What happened
This complaint is about 11 payday and instalment loans Moneyboat.co.uk approved for 
Mr H between April 2015 and June 2019. Ive included some of the information I have been 
provided about the lending in the table below.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that Moneyboat.co.uk shouldnt 
have approved loan 5 and loans 7 to 11. Moneyboat.co.uk agreed with the adjudicators 
findings and said it would pay compensation on the same basis as the adjudicator 
recommended for these loans. 
Mr H disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. He said that he thought the first chain of 
lending should be looked at further as there were short gaps in between the loans. He says 
that if Moneyboat.co.uk had looked further into his circumstances it wouldve seen that he 
was having problems managing his money. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Moneyboat.co.uk needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Mr H could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Moneyboat.co.uk should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to partially uphold Mr Hs complaint and Ive explained why below.
Moneyboat.co.uk has agreed to pay compensation for loan 5 and loans 7 to 11. 
Mr H didnt disagree with this outcome for these loans. And he didnt disagree with the 
adjudicators opinion not to uphold loan 6. 
Because of this I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont comment further about this lending save to say I agree with the adjudicators findings 
and for the same reasons. And for completeness, Ive included the agreed compensation in 
my putting things right section below.
So, in this decision Ill only be looking at the sale of loans 1 to 4 in detail. 
For loans 1 to 3 Mr H needed to make monthly repayments of around £300. This fell to 
around £175 for loan 4. He needed to make monthly repayments for two months for loans 1 
and 3 and six months for loans 2 and 4. Ive seen a record of the information Mr H provided when he completed his loan applications. 
Mr H said he had a monthly income of around £1,500 for loans 1 and 2 and £2,000 for loans 
3 and 4. He had regular monthly outgoings of around £750 for loans 1, 2 and 4 and £1,000 
for loan 3. So, it would have been reasonable for Moneyboat.co.uk to think that Mr H could 
afford the repayments Mr H was committed to making. 
I havent seen any further information that shows its likely Moneyboat.co.uk was made 
aware of any financial problems Mr H mightve been having. Or anything that wouldve 
prompted it to investigate Mr Hs circumstances further. 
I dont think, especially in the early part of this lending pattern that the proximity of the loans 
to each other looked especially problematic. In fact there was a break of a few weeks 
between loans 3 and 4 which suggested Mr Hs finances may be improving. 
Overall, I think it was reasonable for Moneyboat.co.uk to rely on the information it obtained. 
And so, in these circumstances, I think the assessments Moneyboat.co.uk did for loans 1 to 
4 were proportionate. And I think its decision to approve these loans was reasonable and Im 
not upholding Mr Hs complaint about them. 
Putting things right
Moneyboat.co.uk shouldnt have given Mr H loan 5 and loans 7 to 11.
A) Moneyboat.co.uk should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr H towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B) Moneyboat.co.uk should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made 
by Mr H which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr H originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Moneyboat.co.uk should pay Mr H the total of A plus B.
D) Moneyboat.co.uk should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Mr Hs credit 
file in relation to loan 5 and loans 7 to 10. The overall pattern of Mr Hs borrowing at loan 11 
means any information recorded about it is adverse, so it should remove this loan entirely 
from Mr Hs credit file. If Moneyboat.co.uk has sold any of the loans Moneyboat.co.uk should 
ask the debt purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Moneyboat.co.uk to deduct tax from this interest. 
Moneyboat.co.uk should give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax Moneyboat.co.uk has 
deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Evergreen Finance London Limited trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk should put things right by 
doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2021.
