The complaint
Miss P has complained that in September 2018 she was incorrectly told by National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) that she wouldnt qualify for a mortgage. To settle the 
complaint Miss P wants NatWest to offer her a mortgage at the rates that were available in 
September 2018.
What happened
In September 2018 Miss P wanted to remortgage her property to NatWest from her existing 
lender in order to consolidate some unsecured debt. Miss P wanted to borrow £150,000 and 
was given a decision in principle (DiP). An appointment was made for her to see a mortgage 
adviser at one of NatWests branches. On the day of the appointment Miss P went to the 
branch but the adviser wasnt there  hed gone to a different branch thinking the 
appointment was going to take place there.
Miss P spoke to the adviser on the phone to re-arrange the appointment but he said he 
didnt think that Miss P would qualify for a mortgage because of her employment situation  
as she was a contractor paid through an umbrella company and that this arrangement had 
been in place for less than one year. Miss P was disappointed but thought the adviser was 
correct.
A year later, in September 2019, Miss P approached NatWest again about a mortgage. This 
time Miss P was told that further enquiries should have been made about Miss Ps 
employment status in September 2018 in order to determine if she met lending criteria. But 
NatWest explained that in September 2019 Miss P didnt meet its affordability criteria and so 
the bank wasnt able to proceed with an application.
Miss P was very unhappy about this and complained. NatWest looked at what had 
happened. The adviser was no longer with the bank so NatWest looked at the diary notes 
and at what Miss P had said. Having done so, NatWest apologised for the mix-up in relation 
to the appointment. NatWest paid Miss P £250 for this. 
The bank accepted it should have made further enquiries in September 2018 over Miss Ps 
employment status. But NatWest said that it wasnt now able to offer Miss P a mortgage at 
the interest rates that applied in September 2018. Although shed had a DiP for a mortgage 
at that time, the bank explained that any application would have been subject to 
underwriting. In September 2019 Miss P didnt qualify for a mortgage in any event so 
NatWest wasnt able to lend to her.
Miss P complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service where an investigator looked at the 
complaint. He didnt think it should be upheld. Although he noted what had happened, he 
thought the £250 was fair and reasonable compensation for the trouble and upset Miss P 
had been caused. 
Miss P disagreed with the investigators findings and asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. Miss P has made some further points, which I summarise below.
The decision NatWest made in 2018 has severely impacted on her financial status and 
credit rating. She is no longer able to obtain a mortgage from NatWest due to 
affordability, yet up to 2018 she had a very good credit rating.
Miss P says she is constantly living in my overdraft for which I am charged every month. 
The interest that I pay monthly on my credit cards would not be getting incurred now had 
I even had the option to proceed.
If NatWest had checked her affordability in 2018, she would have passed.
As NatWest isnt able to offer her a mortgage at this point, the only reasonable option is 
that the bank now offers her substantial compensation. 
NatWests misguidance was so compelling that she believed no-one would offer her a 
re-mortgage in her circumstances.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not asking NatWest to pay any further compensation. These are my 
reasons.
Miss P has explained that she had a DiP in September 2018, but Im satisfied that this does 
not create any binding offer on the part of NatWest to offer a mortgage to Miss P. Any 
mortgage offer is subject to underwriting, ensuring that the application meets lending and 
affordability criteria.
Miss Ps application never reached that stage, due to a mix-up over the location of the 
appointment. NatWest has acknowledged that the information Miss P was given when she 
spoke to the adviser to re-book the appointment was incorrect  and that NatWest could 
have carried out further enquiries about Miss Ps employment status at the time. I agree 
NatWest should have done this, because its criteria around how it assesses contractors 
earnings are complicated, particularly where they are paid via an umbrella company. 
Because no application was submitted, NatWest wasnt able to assess whether or not 
Miss P would have met affordability or lending criteria. A year later, NatWest determined that 
Miss P didnt meet affordability criteria when she applied to the bank again. 
Miss Ps position is that shes aware NatWest might have declined the application in 2018, 
but then again it might not have. So even though Miss P acknowledges that on a later 
application she didnt meet NatWests affordability criteria, she believes the bank should 
nevertheless offer her the mortgage she might (or might not) have qualified for in September 
2018 if it had looked at her application at the time.
Im afraid I dont agree with Miss Ps argument that, because she was denied the opportunity 
to have her application assessed in September 2018, she should be given a mortgage over 
a term and at the rates which applied at the time. I cant second-guess whether or not Miss P 
would have met affordability criteria at the time and I dont have any power to compel 
NatWest to offer Miss P a mortgage.
In the circumstances, Im satisfied that the £250 NatWest has already paid Miss P for trouble 
and upset is reasonable. I can see no basis upon which it would be fair to order the bank to 
compensate Miss P for a mortgage for which she might not have qualified had an application 
been considered. This is particularly so given that a year later Miss P didnt meet affordability 
criteria, despite her employment status remaining unchanged.Miss P says that NatWests actions have severely affected her credit rating, without 
specifying exactly how or providing any evidence to support her claim. No mortgage 
application was submitted, and so I think its unlikely NatWest carried out any credit search 
that would show up on Miss Ps credit file. If Miss P is unhappy at any entries on her credit 
file, she will need to clarify the position with the relevant credit reference agencies. 
I know this isnt the outcome Miss P was hoping for. I note from what Miss P has told us that 
she is having difficulty managing her finances, particularly her overdraft and credit card debt. 
If Miss P would like some advice about this, she might find it helpful to contact one of the 
free debt advisory services such as StepChange, Citizens Advice or Shelter. We can provide 
contact details for those organisations, if Miss P would like us to.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
This final decision concludes the Financial Ombudsman Services review of this complaint. 
This means that we are unable to consider the complaint any further, nor enter into any 
correspondence about the merits of it.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 November 2020.
