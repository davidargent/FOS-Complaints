The complaint
Mr G complains that National Westminster Bank Plc has recently reworked a foreign 
exchange transaction, that he always thought it had got wrong. But he said its just got it 
wrong again. 
What happened
Mr G was very concerned about an exchange from dollars to pounds that NatWest did for 
him in 2011. He said hed lost $1,500 to $2,000, and it was now widely known that banks 
were fixing rates at that time. He said he had raised a complaint with our service about this 
previously, but it was out of time. 
But Mr G said that in May 2020 NatWest sent him just under £20 for having used the wrong 
exchange rate on this transaction in 2011. NatWest said it had used the wrong rate then. So 
it had reworked the transaction now, using an industry standard exchange rate. And it 
thought it owed him just under £20, after tax.
Mr G said he thought that the Bank of England rate shouldve been used when NatWest 
worked out this transaction again. And he said it hadnt used the industry standard rate it 
mentioned either, because hed checked, and that rate was much more favourable to him. 
He also said that rates vary through the day, and NatWest was just picking the best one. Mr 
G said hed complained about this to NatWest, and been told he could bring this complaint to 
us.
NatWest said that it had looked back at currency exchange transactions between 2010 and 
2014. It said that some of those transactions had the wrong exchange rate applied. That had 
happened because changes were made to one of the systems it used to set foreign 
exchange rates, which meant that system wasnt always using the right rate when it 
converted from one currency to another.
NatWest said that for some of the transactions which had been done back then, it had been 
able to find the rate that shouldve been used. For others, including Mr Gs transaction, it had 
used historical market data from an independent, industry-respected source. 
NatWest said it had paid a refund of the difference between what Mr G had been paid at the 
time, and what it now thought he shouldve received, plus 8% simple interest, minus tax. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said that the exchange rate 
that NatWest had set the redress at was reasonable, when considered along with the 
exchange rate at the time. He said NatWest couldnt be certain of the rate that shouldve 
been used at the time of the transfer, because of the amount of time that had passed since, 
but our investigator thought NatWest had calculated this in a fair and reasonable way.
Mr G didnt accept that. He said that NatWest hadnt used this industry standard rate in 2011 
as the basis of its exchange transaction, and by using it now it had not put right the "fixing" of 
exchange rates in 2011. NatWest had still applied exchange rates that were favourable to 
itself and still not fair to the clients.
Mr G said he thought NatWest as a large institution was still taking advantage of individuals 
as it was able to cover up what was done when certain traders in banks "fixed" exchange 
rates to make greater profits for the banks. He still thought he shouldve got around £1,000 
more in 2011 than he did.
Because Mr G didnt agree, this case was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
Ive looked closely at the facts of Mr Gs complaint, and then confirmed with NatWest my 
understanding of what it thinks went wrong in 2011. This is what its trying to put right now. 
NatWest doesnt think it fixed exchange rates in 2011. That isnt what its looking at now.
In 2011, NatWests exchange transactions werent always done on the day the money came 
into the bank. Sometimes, for payments received at NatWest late in the day, the money 
wasnt exchanged until the next day. NatWest thinks it shouldve done the exchange 
transaction on the same day it got the money.
NatWest thinks this applies to the transaction Mr G did in 2011.
NatWest didnt receive Mr Gs money until late in the day, on 26 September 2011. It thinks 
its internal systems may have delayed the exchange of Mr Gs money until the next day. So 
it thinks the money was received on 26 September, but it used the exchange rate for 27 
September 2011. 
NatWest now knows that the exchange rate 27 September was lower than for 26 
September. It wanted to make sure that Mr G wasnt worse off because of this. (If the 
exchange rate had been higher, in Mr Gs favour, he would not have been asked to return 
any money.)
So NatWest then recreated the same transaction, as far as it is able to, for Mr G, based on 
the reference rate from the 26 September 2011. NatWest doesnt have access now to the 
live rates it wouldve used then. It was nine years ago. So its used a reputable historical 
record of exchange rates to provide the starting point for its calculations. And its used its 
own records of exchange rates from transactions it did make at the time to see how close to 
that rate it wouldve been. I think thats a reasonable approach.
NatWest worked out the difference for Mr G, which it has paid him. 
So what NatWest has done is to change the underlying, or reference, rate it used to work out 
Mr Gs exchange. But, most importantly, it hasnt changed how it approaches that rate. 
NatWest still applies its own mark-up to the daily rate. 
I think its this mark-up that Mr G objects to. He thinks that he should get the rate he can see 
on the historical record, not the rate NatWest has given him, which isnt as good. He says if 
hed got the rate on the historical record, he wouldve been about £1,000 better off.I know Mr G didnt get the rate on the historical record. But NatWest doesnt just apply that 
rate. It adds its own mark-up to the rate. Thats partly to cover costs, and partly to make 
some profit on the transaction. And thats not unusual. Most banks apply a mark-up to the 
Bank of England rate when they make a foreign exchange transaction. They are allowed to 
do that. Thats not fixing exchange rates, and its not automatically unfair. 
I havent seen anything to suggest that NatWest isnt allowed to add this mark-up onto 
reference rates now (or indeed, wasnt allowed to in 2011). I dont think that NatWest has 
made a mistake in how it calculated Mr Gs exchange rate refund.
I know Mr G will be disappointed, but I dont think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 November 2020.
