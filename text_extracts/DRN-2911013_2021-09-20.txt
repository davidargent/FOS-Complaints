The complaint
Miss B complains that she paid too much for her loan with Bank of Scotland plc trading as 
Halifax (Halifax).
What happened
In May 2017, Miss B took out a loan of £15,000 with Halifax. It was payable over 72 months 
at an interest rate of 23.9% APR. Repayments were £373.54 per month. In August 2020, 
she paid off the loan with a payment of £14,368.05  the early settlement figure provided by 
Halifax. During the life of the loan, she took nine payment holidays:
Date / Period of Holiday
July 2017 - one month
September 2017 - one month
July 2018 - one month
September 2018 - one month
July 2019 - one month
September 2019 - one month
May 2020 - one month
June 2020 - one month
July 2020 - one month
Miss B complained. She said the early settlement figure couldnt be right. She said the loan 
contract said she would pay a total of £26,894.88 over 72 months. Of this, the interest was to 
be £11,894.88. She paid the loan early  after 39 months - and paid £14,368.05. So, 
because she had also paid monthly instalments of £10,832.66, she had paid a total of 
£25,200.71. This was almost the same as she wouldve paid if the loan ran to its full term. 
So, the early settlement figure couldnt be correct.
Halifax said this was because of the effect of the payment holidays that Miss B had taken. 
When the loan was set up, the interest amount was anticipated based on the assumption 
that the loan would run to the original term and the monthly payments were made. Each 
month, a monthly payment was taken from the loan, and interest was added to it. But if a 
payment holiday was taken, the balance of the loan didnt reduce  and the amount of 
interest Miss B would pay increased over the loan term, and the length of the loan was also 
be increased. This meant there would be more interest payable than in the original loan 
agreement.
Miss B brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said Halifax had acted fairly. The loan 
agreement said that if payment holidays were taken, interest would still be charged on the 
loan, and this means that the length of the loan would be increased, and so would the 
amount of interest paid. Miss B took nine payment holidays. Each time, Halifax had sent to 
her a letter which showed the effect of the payment holiday  showing the additional interest 
to be paid, and the extension of the loan period. So  Miss B was given the information to 
see what was happening.
Miss B asked that her complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see where Miss B is coming from. She thinks that because she paid off the loan at just 
over half way through its term, she should be able to settle the loan early at that time by 
paying off a proportional amount. But in her case, she was concerned to see that this wasnt 
the case. As she has set out, even though she paid off the loan early, she still ended up 
paying almost the same amount of money to Halifax (£25,200.71) as she wouldve done if 
the loan had run its full term of 72 months (£26,894.88).
Ive looked at Miss Bs complaint closely and weve also asked more questions of Halifax to 
understand what happened. And Im comfortable that Halifax acted fairly. I will explain.
Firstly  the original loan agreement estimated that interest payable would be £11,894.88. 
This assumed that the loan would run for 72 months, and all monthly payments would be 
made. But  they werent, because Miss B took nine payment holidays  where she didnt 
make the monthly payment. The effect of this was to extend the loan term and mean that 
more interest was payable.
I will try to explain this. The loan interest was being charged daily  based on the loan 
amount outstanding. So, each month, a payment of £373.54 was made, and interest of 
about £260 to £270 was charged. So  the loan would reduce by around £100 a month. But 
 if a payment holiday was taken, the loan balance wouldnt reduce  so in nine of the 
months, that was the case. And in fact, Miss B had only made 29 monthly payments, not the 
38 scheduled payments  by the time she paid off the loan.
Miss B had asked us to check Halifaxs calculations. This service cant do that. Halifax have 
said the early payment figure was calculated in line with the Consumer Credit (Early 
Settlement) Regulations 2004, and we must accept that.
But Ive tried to sense check the early payment amount. Miss B made 29 payments of 
£373.54  totalling £10,832.66. And monthly interest debited to the loan account was 
£10,200.71  these figures agree with what Miss B has told us. So  after 29 payments (but 
39 months of the loan), she had only reduced the loan by the difference between the two - 
£631.95. So  when she came to pay the loan off then, the amount of the loan was still not 
much reduced from its original amount - of £15,000. The early payment settlement figure 
was £14,368.05  so this was close to the original loan of £15000 less the amount paid off - £631.95. If Miss B hadnt taken the payment holidays, then a further £3361.86 would have 
been taken off the loan - nine payments of £373.54. And - the interest wouldve been lower  
because the balance of the loan wouldve been lower without the missed payments.
I can see that Miss B has been concerned about the effect of the payment holiday on the 
overall cost of the loan  but in fact, this is of less significance than it might have been  as 
she paid off the loan early. The effect of the nine payment holidays was to extend the life of 
the loan from 72 months to 91 months. And, the additional interest that wouldve been paid 
was £7,358. These figures  which were provided by Halifax to Miss B - assumed that the 
loan would actually run for 91 months  which it didnt. I can see that the letters sent to Miss 
B at each payment holiday set out the effect of the holiday - on the term of the loan and 
additional interest. They also said that Miss B could reduce the total interest payable by 
increasing her monthly payments. I can also see that in the contract, it said you can take 
a payment holidayyou need not make your normal payments during the holiday, but we 
will continue to charge interest on your balance. So you will pay more interest overall; the 
length of your loan will increase and so may the number of repayments.
But  as Ive said, the full effect of the payment holidays wasnt as much as it wouldve been 
because Miss B paid off the loan after 39 months  rather then the loan running for the 
extended term of 91 months. In Miss Bs case, the effect of the payment holidays was for her 
to pay some additional interest between July 2017 (the first holiday) and July 2020 (the last 
holiday). I cant say exactly how much this was  but to show the effect of this  for the 
holiday in July 2017, interest of £263.70 was applied to the loan, but no repayment was 
made. So, the loan balance went up. As a result, the interest in the next month was higher 
than the previous month  and this effect wouldve continued until the loan was paid off in 
August 2020. There wouldve been similar effects for the other eight holidays  through to 
when the loan was paid off.
Miss B had said she thinks that Halifaxs early payment figure should be explained. We 
asked them about this. It was the balance of the loan on the statement - £13,904.50, plus 
interest accrued but not passed of £213.55, plus an early payment fee of £250 - £14,368.05. 
Mis B will be able to see this on her loan statements.
So  I hope Miss B can see that weve investigated her complaint thoroughly. I appreciate 
she feels strongly about what happened, but I wont be asking Halifax to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 October 2021.
