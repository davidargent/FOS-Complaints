The complaint
Ms D and Mr S complain that when they made an overpayment in July 2021, Skipton 
Building Society didnt apportion the monthly payment that they made at the beginning of the 
month between capital and interest
What happened
Ms D and Mr S took out an interest only mortgage in June 2021 with Skipton for £300,000. 
The first interest payment was made at the beginning of July for £497.01. Ms D and Mr S 
then made an overpayment of £200,000 on 8 July 2021 and Skipton then reduced the 
monthly payments going forward. Ms D and Mr S complained that they paid the full interest 
for the month of July on the opening balance but that Skipton hasnt adjusted the payment to 
reflect the fact that the outstanding balance was significantly reduced during the month and 
that the initial payment of £497.01 should be apportioned between capital and interest.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld as he felt that under 
section 8 of the mortgage offer that Skipton could charge interest in full in the month of an 
early redemption. Ms D and Mr S disagreed saying in summary that interest should only be 
charged on the outstanding balance at any one time.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My reading of this file is that Skipton in fact has done what Ms D  and Mr S expected it to do 
and that seems to be reflected  both in the final response from Skipton and in the annual 
mortgage statement for 2021. Ms D and Mr S completed towards the end of June. Skipton 
says that a small amount of interest would have been due for June and not collected and this 
was added to capital. Then in July Ms D and Mr S made their overpayment and Skipton says 
that this reduced the interest charged for the month by £269.86 which was credited to the 
capital on the account and used to reduce the outstanding balance. The net effect of the 
additions and reductions was a reduction of the capital owed by Ms D and Mr S of £223.81. 
This can be seen in the annual mortgage statement for 2021 being the difference between 
the payments credited in 2021 of £1,340.76 and the interest charged to the account of 
£1,116.95. This had the effect of reducing the outstanding balance at the end of the year 
which would have been £102,751 had the capital payment not been credited to the account 
but was in fact £102,526.19.  So, Im clear that Skipton did what Ms D and Mr S expected it 
to do, namely reduce the interest on the account from when the overpayment was made and 
used part of the interest that was collected for July 2021 to benefit Ms D and Mr S by 
reducing the outstanding balance on the account. 
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms D and Mr S to 
accept or reject my decision before 19 July 2022.
