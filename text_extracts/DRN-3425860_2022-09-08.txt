The complaint
Mr P complains LeasePlan UK Limited unfairly charged him for a relief vehicle.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr P had a hire agreement with LeasePlan. This included a maintenance contract. The 
maintenance contract allowed for a relief vehicle while repairs/maintenance is being 
undertaken. But there are limitations to this allowance. Ill include the relevant part of the 
contract below:
A relief vehicle must be returned or (if [LeasePlan] choose) made available for collection 
when the first of the following happens:
28 days from the date when the relief vehicle was first made available; or
the date when [Mr P is] told that the original Vehicle is ready for collection
If a relief vehicle is not returned or (if [LeasePlan] choose) made available for collection, 
[Mr P] must pay all hire charges for the relief vehicle after the due date for return or 
collection straight away.
In late 2020 Mr P booked the vehicle into a garage of his choice and took possession of a 
relief vehicle on 8 December 2020. It took this garage a long time to do the required works 
and ultimately the works werent fully completed. Thats unfortunate, and I accept the impact 
of the Covid-19 pandemic may have had a part to play. But Im not persuaded LeasePlan 
was at fault. 
On 9 February 2021, Mr P contacted LeasePlan and explained the situation. LeasePlan 
arranged for the vehicle to be collected and transferred to a garage of its choice. The second 
garage completed the required works fully and returned the vehicle to Mr P on 
18 February 2021. Mr P suggests LeasePlan should have stepped in sooner than it did, but I 
consider it was reasonable for LeasePlan to leave the car with Mr Ps garage of choice until 
it became clear said garage couldnt complete the required works fully.
The overall length of the works meant Mr P had the relief vehicle more than 28 days. 
LeasePlan invoiced Mr P for the excess days  this came to about Â£980. Mr P doesnt 
consider this fair. I can understand his frustration. But he did have the relief vehicle for 
longer than the contract allowed for, through no fault of LeasePlans  and at a direct cost to 
LeasePlan. I cant fairly conclude its unreasonable for LeasePlan to charge him for the 
excess days in line with the contract.
 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 October 2022.
