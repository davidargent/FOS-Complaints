The complaint
Mr P complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) didnt replace his credit card.
What happened
Mr P had a credit card from HSBC. The limit was £3,200. Between August 2021 and May 
2022, Mr P was struggling with his finances and there were several late, missed payments 
and overlimit situations on the card. On 12 November 2021, HSBC sent Mr P a default 
notice. This asked for payment of £434.96 by 3 December 2021. He paid in £450 on 29 
November 2021. On 23 March 2022, HSBC sent him another default notice. That asked for 
payment of £297.98 by 14 April 2022. Mr P paid in £400 on 31 March 2022. HSBC decided 
to block Mr Ps card and not send him a renewal card  it had expired.
Mr P complained. He said he paid in the amounts that were due and therefore the card 
shouldnt have been stopped. He had been struggling because of the pandemic and HSBC 
shouldve been more lenient as a result. He said he was supporting members of his family 
during the pandemic and that had led to pressure on his finances. He said he hadnt been 
advised the card was to be withdrawn.
HSBC sent two final responses. In June  2022, they said they couldnt understand why Mr 
Ps card had been blocked and ordered a replacement. In October 2022, after Mr P 
contacted HSBC again, they sent a second response. This said the replacement card had 
been stopped because of how Mr P had used the account. They said theyd sent letters to 
Mr P about missed payments on 12 August 2021, 7 September 2021,12 December 2021, 
and 12 January 2022. A default notice was sent to him on 12 November 2021 and on 23 
March 2022. They said that Mr P hadnt been meeting the terms and conditions of the credit 
card  because of the missed payments. Therefore, they took the decision to stop the card 
when it expired in February 2022. 
Mr P brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said HSBC acted reasonably. Mr P had 
been regularly over his credit limit or had missed payments between August 2021 and April 
2022. This was a breach of the cards terms and conditions, and HSBC could therefore stop 
the card  as there was a risk of non-payment. However, she said HSBC had made an error 
in their first response in June 2022 -which said they couldnt say why the card had been 
stopped and told Mr P a new one had been ordered. For that, she said HSBC should pay 
compensation of £75.
Mr P didnt agree. He said he hadnt been offered an affordability assessment by HSBC and 
shouldve been - he had been struggling due to the pandemic. And he repeated that he had 
paid in the amount needed in response to HSBCs letters. He said HSBC should have been 
aware of the effect of the pandemic on customers and taken a different course of action.
Mr P asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint. So  it has come to me to make a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at what happened here. Its fair to say that Mr P frequently missed making the 
minimum monthly contractual payments to his credit card and went over the limit several 
times. Our investigator set that out  and Ive checked that her analysis was correct:
Statement 13 July 2021  min. payment of £80.99 due by 9 August 2021 (not paid) and over
limit by £19.38
Statement 12 August 2021  min. payment of £112.20 due by 6 September 2021 (not paid)
and over limit by £222.38
Statement 10 September 2021  min. payment of £113.49 due by 5 October 2021 (not paid)
and over limit by £113.49
Statement 12 October 2021  min. payment of £114.99 due by 8 November 2021 (not paid)
and over limit by £114.49
Statement 11 November 2021  min. payment of £90.87 due by 6 December 2021 (paid)
and over limit by £434.96
Statement 13 December 2021  min. payment of £86.44 due by 7 January 2021 (not paid)
and over limit by £53.53
Statement 12 January 2022  min. payment of £105.14 due by 7 February 2022 (not paid)
and over limit by £126.13
Statement 10 February 2022  min. payment of £104.91 due by 7 March 2022 (not paid) and
over limit by £202.87
Statement 14 March 2022  min payment of £111.32 due by 8 April 2022 (paid) and over
limit by £307.78
Statement 12 April 2022  min. payment of £89.37 due by 9 May 2022 (not paid) and within
credit limit
Statement 11 May 2022  min. payment of £87.79 due by 6 June 2022 (paid) and over limit
by £74.37
I can see that HSBC were concerned that Mr P wasnt managing his credit card very well 
and wrote to him a number of times about missed payment and the overlimit positions. I 
couldnt see that Mr P contacted HSBC because of those letters  sent on 12 August 2021, 7 
September 2021,10 September 2021, 12 December 2021, and 12 January 2022. In those 
circumstances, because of the general way in which Mr P ran his account, I think it was 
reasonable for HSBC to consider he was becoming a higher risk - and he had broken the 
terms and conditions of the card.
I looked those and they say: There are times when we might refuse to authorise a 
transaction, cancel or suspend use of the account or refuse to replace or reissue a card. 
This could be where we reasonably consider it's necessary for any of the reasons set out 
below.We believe there's a significantly increased risk that you won't be able to repay any 
money you owe us. So  HSBC could cancel the card. I say that because from the way in which Mr P had run his account  HSBC were concerned that they werent going to get 
repaid.
Mr P has argued that he paid in what was asked for by the two default notices sent to him in 
November 2021 and March 2022. The first default notice dated 12 November 2021 asked for 
payment of £434.96 by 3 December 2021. He paid in £450 on 29 November 2021. On 23 
March 2022, HSBC sent him another default notice -  that asked for payment of £297.98 by 
14 April 2022. Mr P paid in £400 on 31 March 2022.
So  I can see what Mr P is saying  that he paid in what was needed in each case. But 
what that did  was to avoid HSBC taking any further action. If Mr P hadnt paid the money 
in, HSBC would likely have defaulted the account and placed a default marker on his credit 
file  which wouldve been in place for six years. That wouldve meant Mr P would have 
difficulty getting credit. But they didnt  as Mr P paid in the amount asked for. HSBC 
confirmed to us that no default was registered. 
But  having paid in the amount needed to avoid the default, Mr P continued to again make 
late payments and go over his limit. In December 2021, January 2022 and February 2022, 
Mr P missed making the minimum payments again. And the April 2022 payment wasnt 
made either  after the default had been avoided in the previous month.
In short, while Mr P managed to avoid the worse consequence of a default, the general 
running of his account caused HSBC to take the action they did - which was to stop the card. 
Which, in the circumstances, was a reasonable thing to do.
Mr P has said he wasnt offered a financial affordability assessment  to see if HSBC could 
help him. But I could see that HSBC wrote to him on 21 March 2022 and offered that. The 
letter said We're sorry you're having trouble keeping up with your monthly payments and 
theres still an overdue amount on your account It's important that you make contact with 
us, so we can understand your current financial situation and work with you to find an 
appropriate solution based on your circumstances. When you call, well complete an 
affordability assessment over the phone, if you havent already done this.. 
I also listened to the call Mr P made to HSBC on 12 May 2022  and HSBCs call handler 
offered an assessment then, but Mr P didnt want to do one. So - HSBC did try to help, as 
we would expect them to. I think its reasonable for me to say that if Mr P had responded to 
HSBCs letters, its likely they couldve completed an assessment and considered a payment 
plan with Mr P.
Ive gone on to consider whether HSBC shouldve advised Mr P that his card was cancelled. 
Ideally, they wouldve written to him to say that. But on balance, because of the number of 
letters, plus the default notices that were sent to Mr P, I dont think HSBC needed to. I also 
noted that HSBCs terms and conditions dont say they need to do that. 
HSBC made an error when they sent their first response to Mr P - as they said they couldnt 
see why the card had been cancelled. And they then put things straight in their second 
response. But I agree HSBC should pay compensation of £75 for that error.
But other than that, I think HSBC acted reasonably in the circumstances of Mr Ps complaint 
 and therefore, my decision is that HSBC should just pay compensation of £75.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint.  HSBC UK Bank Plc must:Pay compensation of £75 for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 March 2023.
