The complaint
Mr Y complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA gave him wrong information and poor
customer service.  
What happened
Mr Y bought an item online and paid through PayPal. When he received the item, Mr Y said
it wasnt as it was described, so he opened a claim and then a dispute. The cost of the item
was £362.57. Mr Y felt PayPals dispute process was misleading as he raised a dispute for
£100 but he said he had added a note to say if the seller didnt respond he wanted his full
money back. He contacted PayPal to explain he wanted the full amount reimbursed and not
the partial amount. Mr Y asked for a manager to call him back. He also asked for a copy of
the phone call to be emailed to him which the call handler agreed to.
Mr Y received a call back from PayPal. This was followed up via an email to Mr Y on 21
October 2020 which explained the dispute had been worked in line with PayPals buyer
protection policy, but to resolve the matter for him, PayPal decided to reimburse Mr Y the full
value of the claim for £362.57. PayPal explained this wasnt a refund of the disputed amount
and shouldnt be viewed as such. PayPal said that upon receipt of Mr Ys acceptance email
a credit would be applied to his account in 1-3 business days.
Mr Y received a £100 refund from the seller on 22 October 2020. He informed PayPal of this
in an email dated 26 October 2020 and said as the goodwill gesture wasnt linked to a
refund, he would accept the £362.57 offered.
Mr Y emailed PayPal on 29 October and said he had called PayPal to chase up the
payment, but the line was disconnected. PayPal emailed Mr Y and said they hadnt received
a response to their email from 21 October 2020. They also said that as Mr Y had received
£100 from the seller then they would credit £262.57 into his account and not £362.57.
PayPal did credit £362.57 into Mr Ys PayPal account.
Mr Y emailed PayPal several times and asked for a call back. In an email on 29 October
2020 he explained the poor customer service he had. Mr Y said he made numerous calls as
the money had not been sent over as agreed, hed spent over two hours on calls to various
PayPal call handlers and had requested to speak to the escalations staff member who
agreed his £362.57 goodwill gesture. Mr Y says he was also told that if he wanted call
recordings then he would need to submit a subpoena to PayPals offices in Luxembourg, he
was given two telephone numbers to speak to PayPal but one of these telephone numbers
didnt work at all and when he dialled the other number the agent couldnt connect Mr Y to
the person who he wished to speak to. He also asked again for a phone call.
Mr Y says he hadnt received responses to his emails, so he emailed PayPal again. PayPal
sent Mr Y a message on 19 November 2020 to inform him that he received and accepted the
credit of £362.57 as full and final settlement of his complaint. They also said that a full review
would be conducted by PayPal and relevant action may be taken by PayPal internally and
they sincerely regret any inconvenience this may have caused him. Mr Y responded to
PayPal that they hadnt answered or addressed any of his points he had raised. He also said
he had to chase up PayPal several times and he had asked several times for a call back. On
24 November 2020 Mr Y asked for a call back again but he says he didnt receive a
response.
Mr Y brought his complaint to our service. He provided a summary of his issues with PayPal
which included no response to several emails, failure to pay the agreed amount when
PayPal originally promised - which led to numerous calls, emails and excessive time chasing
PayPal. He said that PayPal were incorrect for saying his complaint was resolved, he
received no call backs when requested, he had no working telephone number to contact
them and received incorrect information about getting his call recordings.
Our investigator did not uphold Mr Ys complaint. She said that PayPal told Mr Y that they
passed on his comments and feedback, so she thought they had acted appropriately. Our
investigator also said that PayPal wasnt obliged to refund Mr Y the £362.57. They did this
as a gesture of goodwill and its meant that more has been paid than was initially due. Our
investigator also said that she considered that because of the refund from the seller, Mr Y
had received an extra £100 and she thought this was fair compensation for any issues he
experienced with PayPals overall customer service.
Mr Y did not agree with the view of our investigator and asked for this to be reviewed by an
Ombudsman. He said the £100 extra he had was a refund from the seller and shouldnt be
used to compensate him for the service issues hes had from PayPal.  
As my findings differed in some respects from our investigators, I issued a provisional
decision to give both parties the opportunity to consider things further. This is set out below:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Y has made a number of points to both PayPal and this service and Ive listened to,
considered and read everything hes said and sent us. But, in line with this services role as
a quick and informal body, Ill be focusing on the crux of his complaint in deciding whats fair
and reasonable here.
Im satisfied that PayPal worked Mr Ys dispute in line with their buyer protection policy and
werent required to pay Mr Y a goodwill gesture of £362.57. But they chose to do so. And
even though they sent him an email to say they would only be sending him £262.57, he did
receive the full £362.57 after speaking with PayPal. Mr Y did receive £100 refund from the
seller. But as this related to the item he purchased and not the service Mr Y received from
PayPal after he raised the dispute, then I wont be considering that Mr Y has had more
money than he possibly should have done. I say this as that was PayPals decision to pay
him that in relation to his item which he received, which he says wasnt as described.
So Ive looked at the issues Mr Y has said hes had with PayPal. Im persuaded that he has
had poor customer service of a number of occasions. Ill explain why below.
One of the areas hes received poor service from is relating to call recordings. I say this as
when Mr Y speaks with a call handler on 19 October 2020 he asks if he can have a copy of
the call recording. The call handler agrees. Mr Y asks for this to be emailed to him and the
call handler agrees. But he never received a copy of this call. Mr Y has another conversation
on 29 October 2020. When the handler informs Mr Y that the call is being recorded, Mr Y
also asks for a copy of the call. The call handler tells Mr Y that you can get one if you
actually file a subpoena directly to our legal office. Mr Y queries this under his data
protection rights, calling from the United Kingdom. But the call handler maintains Mr Y needs
to submit a subpoena to their Luxembourg office.I checked with PayPal regarding their process for sending Mr Y his call recordings. PayPal
confirmed that Mr Y would need to submit a DSAR (Data Subject Access Request) to access
his call recordings. So because the call handler on 19 October said she would email the call
to Mr Y and didnt and the call handler on 29 October gave Mr Y incorrect information about
how to obtain his call recordings then this will have been incredibly frustrating for Mr Y,
especially as he informed the call handler he didnt have to do this.
Ive considered what Mr Y has said about not receiving responses to his emails. As our
investigator explained to Mr Y, some of the emails that Mr Y had sent to PayPal werent from
his registered PayPal email address and this is why they werent assigned to his case.
PayPal have explained to me that their call handlers would not be able to view these emails
from unregistered email addresses and I think that is where Mr Y was frustrated with the call
handler on the call on 29 October as he had sent four emails (he said he sent them at 13:41,
13:58, 14:04 and 14:18) but the call handler couldnt see them.
While Im persuaded that PayPal followed their own procedures here and didnt respond to
Mr Ys emails as they would view replying to an unregistered email address as a security
risk, Im persuaded that they should have done more here. I say this as although PayPal
may not have realised that the emails were from Mr Y initially, as the email address was
different, I think it is clear from the emails sent that it is from the same person. So while I
understand there may be a delay in processing emails from a unregistered email address, I
wouldnt expect these to be left unanswered, especially when they had the original message
from PayPal contained in the email. And when Mr Y explained to the call handler on 29
October 2020 that he had sent four emails and the times he sent them, the call handler
should have probed where he sent them from. Mr Y offered to forward the call handler these
emails. Had the call handler agreed to receive these emails then Im persuaded the issue
would have came to light very quickly and then Mr Y would know that he would only receive
a response from his registered email address.
Mr Y has said that PayPal failed to pay the amount when it was originally promised. But as
PayPal said they would credit his PayPal account 1-3 business days from the acceptance of
their offer, then they did make the payment within this timeframe. Mr Y emailed PayPal on
26 October and the goodwill gesture was paid on 29 October. So this was three business
days from Mr Ys email. I know Mr Y feels he was only paid the funds on this date as he had
spent a long time on the phone and sent multiple emails to PayPal and that may have
ensured he was paid in the three working days. But Im satisfied that PayPal did make the
payment around the time they said they would.
Ive considered what Mr Y has said about how PayPal kept saying his complaint was closed
when it wasnt. As complaint handling is not a regulated activity, it falls outside of my powers
to rule on how a business deems its complaints to be closed.
Mr Y had asked for a call back from a manager on emails he sent PayPal. While PayPal
cant address a complaint directly from an unregistered email address, I would still expect
that PayPal would realise that these had genuinely come from Mr Y based on him replying to
messages from PayPal. And PayPal had sent us the email where Mr Y accepted the
goodwill gesture, so they have been able to link this to his account, even if it has came from
a different email address to his registered email address.
Mr Y says that he was given an incorrect telephone number to speak to PayPal and his calls
where disconnected from PayPal on a couple of occasions. He has also commented that he
was unable to find a telephone number to contact them on their website. As our investigator
has explained to Mr Y, our service has no power to instruct a business to include certain
details on their website.In summary Im persuaded that Mr Y did receive poor customer service for the reasons Ive
previously given. This is also acknowledged by PayPal specifically regarding his phone calls
on 19 October 2020, when it was agreed that he would be emailed a copy of his call and on
29 October 2020 where he was told incorrect information about how to obtain his call
recordings. PayPal also told Mr Y they sincerely regret the poor customer service may have
caused in their message to him on 19 November 2020.
Im persuaded that PayPal should realise the impact that the poor customer service and
incorrect information has had on Mr Y and compensate him for the inconvenience they
acknowledged this wouldve had on him. Im persuaded these issues have distressed Mr Y,
especially since he was waiting on his call recordings which never arrived and was given
wrong information about how to request his calls. Im satisfied that £150 would recognise the
impact the errors had on Mr Y for the reasons Ive already mentioned.
I invited both parties to let me have any further submissions before I reached a final
decision. PayPal accepted my provisional decision. Mr Y did not respond to my provisional 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has presented me with any further information to consider, then my final 
decision and reasoning remains the same as in my provisional decision.
 
Putting things right
In my provisional decision I said I intended to ask PayPal to pay Mr Y £150 for distress and 
inconvenience. Im still satisfied this is a fair outcome for the reasons given previously.  
My final decision
I uphold the complaint. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should pay Mr Y £150 for distress 
and inconvenience.    
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 October 2021.
