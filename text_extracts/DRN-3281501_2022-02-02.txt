The complaint
Mr T complains about two loans provided to him by Madison CF UK Limited, (trading as 
118 118 Money) which he says were unaffordable.
What happened
118 118 Money provided Mr T with two loans the details of which are given in the table 
below:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment
1 26/04/2014 £1500 24 months £120.88
2 12/04/2016 £1000 24 months £77.27
Mr T says the loans were unaffordable and shouldnt have been given to him.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in December 2021. Both parties have 
received a copy of that provisional decision, but for completeness I include an extract from 
the decision below. I said;
118 118 Money gathered some information from Mr T about his income and expenses 
before it agreed to the two loans.  
As Ive already mentioned, Ive seen how 118 118 Money carried out its checks. But Im 
not satisfied that these checks went far enough for either loan. I say that because:
Both loans were over a term of 24 months and 118 118 Money needed to 
ensure the repayments were sustainable over that relatively long period of 
time on each occasion;
118 118 Moneys analysis showed discrepancies between its checks and Mr Ts 
declared expenditure. For loan 1 it altered Mr Ts expenditure from £1055 to £1850 
and for loan 2 from £1194 to £1572;
The discrepancy between Mr Ts declared expenditure and what it had verified it to 
be on both occasions was wide.
I think when I consider the discrepancies between what 118 118 Money had in front of it 
and what Mr T declared, I think it ought to have had enough concerns to ask for more on 
both occasions. I consider 118 118 Moneys checks should have included a full review of 
Mr Ts financial circumstances, including further verification of his expenditure so it could 
ensure that the loan repayments were affordable over the term of the loans.
I need to think about what 118 118 Money would have seen if it had carried out 
proportionate checks for loans 1 and 2. Our investigator asked Mr T to provide his bank 
statements from around the time he applied for the loans. Im not suggesting here that this 
is the check that 118 118 Money should have done on either occasion. But I think looking 
at his bank statements would give me the best picture of what the lender should have 
seen.
Mr T has not been able to provide our service with bank statements from before and around 
when he took out either loan though. He says he is no longer with the bank that he held his 
account with so cannot provide statements. So, I havent been able to see what 118 118 
Money would have most likely seen if it had carried out further checks when it agreed to loan 
1 or loan 2. So, because of this, I am unable to safely conclude that Mr T was given loans 
that were unaffordable for him. 
In conclusion, I do think the discrepancy between the information Mr T provided and what 
118 118 Money saw in its credit checks ought to have suggested better checks. And Ive 
not been able to see what better checks would have shown 118 118 Money, so on this 
occasion I havent been able to draw any conclusions about this, other than I cant say that 
either loan was unaffordable for Mr T.
So, for the reasons set out above, Im not currently upholding Mr Ts complaint.
I asked both parties to let me have any comments, or additional evidence, in response to 
my provisional decision. 118 118 Money responded and said it accepted my provisional 
decision. Mr T did not respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
118 118 Money has not made any further comments and Mr T did not respond. So, as 
neither party has anything further to add, I dont see any reason to depart from my findings 
within my provisional decision. With that being the case, I do not uphold Mr Ts complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I am not upholding Mr Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2022.
