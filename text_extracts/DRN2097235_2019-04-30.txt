An adjudicator considered  Mr Ds complaint and recommended it be upheld  in part. She 
didnt think QuickQuid shouldve approved  loans  4-10. QuickQuid didnt agree, although it 
did make  an offer in relation to loans 8-10.  Mr D didnt accept the offer and so the complaint 
was passed to me to decide.
Before I set out my findings, Ive noted  QuickQuid, in response to the adjudicator, made 
some comments about the loans  Mr D took out more than six years before he complained. 
I wont set out what QuickQuid said in detail; instead Ill remind  it that it provided  its consent 
for this service to consider  all of Mr Ds loans in its email of 1 March 2019. As per 
DISP 2.8.2AR, QuickQuid  may not withdraw its consent once given.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Ds case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Ds complaint  in part and have explained why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr D 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ds income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN20972352But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers  income is low or the amount to be repaid  takes up a substantial  portion of 
their income 
the amount, or amounts, due to be repaid  are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Ds complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable and proportionate checks  to 
satisfy itself that Mr D would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those 
checks have shown  that Mr D would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account  the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ds indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably in some  other  way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Ds complaint.
Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr D would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr D would have been  able to do so?
Theres been no ongoing dispute  about  loans 1-3 since  the adjudication. Mr D hasnt 
contested the adjudicators findings  and I am in agreement with her view. So Im not 
upholding the complaint  about loans 1-3.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 4 to 10 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ds indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending.  Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which QuickQuid should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ds case,  I think  that this point 
was reached by loan 4. I say this because:
the amounts Mr D was borrowing were  generally increasing, and QuickQuid ought to 
have realised  it was likely his indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably  hed 
borrowed consistently  (without any significant  breaks between loans) for eight months  
and his fourth  loan was for double the amount of the first loan
Ref: DRN20972353Mr D wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed QuickQuid. There  were  
only very short gaps  between the loans.  And so Mr D was in effect  paying  large  
amounts of interest  to service his debt over an extended period
Mr D was also demonstrating  repayment difficulties from loan 6 onwards
I think that Mr D lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from loan 4 
onwards because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer  number of loans (loans  and deferrals)  was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ds ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost  loans
So Im upholding  Mr Ds complaint about  loans  4 to 10 because  the overall  pattern of lending 
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  and he lost 
out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr D in some 
other way.  
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr D paid on loans 4 to 10;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number of loans  taken from loan 4 means any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about loans 4 to 10 should  be removed from Mr Ds credit  file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Mr D a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Ds 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC must  put things right by taking the steps set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 May 2019.
