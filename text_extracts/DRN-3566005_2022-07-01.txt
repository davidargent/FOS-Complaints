The complaint
Miss M complains that NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibly when it approved two credit cards in 
her name and went on to increase the credit limit.
 
What happened
In August 2016 Miss M applied for an Aqua credit card with NewDay. Miss M said she was a 
tenant, single and a part time contractor. Miss M said she was earning £28,700 and had 
unsecured borrowing of around £3,000. NewDay carried out a credit search and found Miss 
M had a default that was around three years old. NewDay approved Miss Ms credit card 
with a limit of £300. In April 2018 NewDay increased the Aqua credit limit to £850. 
In August 2017 Miss M applied for a Marbles credit card with NewDay. In this application, 
Miss M confirmed she was still a tenant and working part time with an income of £28,000. An 
unsecured credit figure of £6,500 was recorded. NewDay carried out a credit search and 
found two defaults, totalling £1,100, in Miss Ms name. NewDay also found Miss M had an 
account that was in arrears. 
Miss M fell into difficulties and stopped making payments to her credit cards in mid 2018. 
The cards were closed and defaults recorded on Miss Ms credit file a short time later. 
Last year, Miss M complained that NewDay had lent irresponsibly but it didnt agree. An 
investigator at this service looked at Miss Ms complaint and upheld it. They thought NewDay 
had lent responsibly when it approved the Aqua application in August 2016. But the 
investigator thought NewDay had failed to carry out proportionate checks before taking the 
decision to increase the Aqua credit limit then approve Miss Ms Marbles credit card. 
NewDay asked to appeal, so Miss Ms complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say NewDay had to complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Miss M could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable way. 
These affordability checks needed to be focused on the borrowers circumstances. The 
nature of whats considered reasonable and proportionate will vary depending on various 
factors like: 
- The amount of credit;
- The total sum repayable and the size of regular repayments;
- The duration of the agreement;
- The costs of the credit; and 
- The consumers individual circumstances. 
That means theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. But lenders are required to 
consider the above points when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate. 
When Miss M first applied for the Aqua credit card in August 2016 NewDay collected 
information about her living situation and income. NewDay also carried out a credit search. I 
note NewDay found a default, but its lending criteria factors in some adverse credit and Im 
satisfied that was taken into account. NewDay says it looked at how much Miss M owed 
other lenders and found around £3,000 at the time of application. Taking the information 
provided in the application into account, Im satisfied the checks NewDay completed were 
proportionate to the £300 limit it approved. I havent found NewDay lent irresponsibly when it 
approved the Aqua credit card. 
In April 2017 NewDay increased the Aqua credit limit from £300 to £850. Miss M had held 
the Aqua card for around eight months at this stage and her outstanding unsecured credit 
figure had increased from £3,000 to around £4,500 in that time. In addition, Newday was 
more than doubling the Aqua credit limit based on application information. In my view, the 
information available to NewDay shouldve led it to complete more comprehensive checks to 
ensure Miss M could afford to repay the balance in a sustainable way. 
In August 2017 NewDay assessed Miss Ms Marbles credit card application. At this stage, 
Miss M owed nearly £6,000 to other lenders. I note Miss M missed a payment on her Aqua 
credit card in February and April 2017. And NewDay found two defaults on Miss Ms credit 
file in the Marbles application, an increase from the Aqua application. Given the increase in 
borrowing generally, the increase in Miss Ms Aqua balance and credit limit, missed 
payments and additional debt by way of a new Marbles credit card, I think NewDay 
shouldve carried out better checks. 
As noted above, theres no set list of checks NewDay had to complete. Miss M has sent us 
her bank statements for the period in question. That wouldve been an option for NewDay to 
verify Miss Ms circumstances. Ive looked at the statements and Im satisfied they show 
Miss M wasnt in a position to support further borrowing when NewDay increased the credit 
limit of her Aqua credit card in April 2017 then approved the Marbles credit card in August 
2017. In my view, NewDay lent irresponsibly on both those occasions. As a result, Im going 
to uphold Miss Ms complaint and direct NewDay to refund all internet, fees and charges 
applied to the NewDay credit card on balances over £300 from April 2017 onwards. And Im 
going to tell NewDay to refund all interest, fees and charges applied to Miss Ms Marbles 
credit card from inception onwards. 
I also intend to tell NewDay to ensure an affordable repayment plan is discussed with Miss 
M. Once the balance of each credit card has been repaid, NewDay should remove the 
corresponding default its reported from Miss Ms credit file. 
Putting things right
To resolve this complaint NewDay should settle as follows: 
Rework Miss Ms current Marbles credit card balance so that all the interest, fees and 
charges applied to it from inception onwards are removed;
Rework Miss Ms Aqua credit card to ensure that from the date of the credit limit 
increase to £850 onwards so interest is only charged on the first £300 outstanding - 
to reflect the fact that no further credit limit increases should have been provided;
If an outstanding balance remains once these adjustments have been made NewDay 
should contact Miss M to arrange a suitable repayment plan for this;
If no outstanding balance remains, any adverse information should be removed from 
the credit file; AND 
If the refund brings means theres no remaining balance, any extra should be treated 
as overpayments and returned to Miss M; 
AND
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any overpayments from the date they were made 
(if they were) to the date of settlement.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to take off tax from this interest. NewDay must 
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss Ms complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to settle in line with 
the above guidance. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 July 2022.
