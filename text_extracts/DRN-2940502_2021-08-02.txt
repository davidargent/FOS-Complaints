The complaint
 Miss F complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (Aqua) lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
 In November 2014, Miss F applied for a credit card from Aqua. She was given a limit of 
£250. The limits were then increased as follows:
Date Limit
November 2014 £250
March 2015 £1250
July 2015 £2450
November 2015 £3700
August 2016 £4700
 
Miss F repaid and closed the account in November 2016 with a payment of £4896.13.
Miss F complained that Aqua shouldnt have increased her limits. He was only 19 when she 
applied for the card and didnt have any credit history. She only earnt £800 per month. Her 
outgoings were £500 a month. By 2015, she was on maternity leave and earning £600 a 
month. She couldnt make the minimum payments. She relied on taking out payday loans to 
make ends meet.
Aqua said Miss F passed their credit checks. She told Aqua she was earning £13000 a year 
with other unsecured debts of only £300, she was living with her parents. She had no 
defaults or payday loans showing, or any adverse information on her credit file. She had the 
chance to opt out of the offered increases but didnt. There werent any signs of difficulties at 
each increase  such as late or missed payments, instances of exceeding the credit limit, 
proportion of credit limit used and evidence of other debts. So  they said theyd acted 
responsibly.
Miss F brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said we couldnt look at the first issue of 
the card as it was more than six years before Miss Fs complaint. She considered the 
increases in limits up to and including the increase to £3700 in November 2015 to be OK. 
There wasnt any significant borrowing with other lenders, payments to Aqua were being 
made, and there wasnt any evidence of late payments or over limit situations. But  looking 
at the increase to £4700 in August 2016, she could see there had been excesses over the 
previous limit. Overall debts had increased to over £13000 and there were payday loans in 
evidence. So, she considered the last increase to be irresponsible. She said Aqua should 
refund interest and charges from August 2016 and pay 8% simple interest on the fees and 
charges from the date they were paid to the date of settlement.
Aqua didnt respond - and so Miss Fs complaint came to me to look at. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Miss F says she shouldnt have been given the first increases as she was young and had no 
track record. I can see where shes coming from but equally of course  everyone must start 
somewhere to build their credit history. So  thats not really a reason for Aqua to have 
declined to lend to her.
I can see that she told Aqua that she earnt £13000 a year  and lived at home with her 
parents. Her other debts were only £300. She says her outgoings were about £500 a month. 
In 2015, she went on maternity leave which reduced her income to £600 a month. So, I can 
see things must have been tight.
All lenders have an obligation to lend money responsibly. We must check whether Aqua 
acted in line within the Financial Conducts (FCA) rules on creditworthiness assessment as 
set out in its handbook, (CONC) section 5.2. These say that a firm must undertake a 
reasonable assessment of creditworthiness, considering both the risk to it of the customer 
not making the repayments, as well as the risk to the customer of not being able to make 
repayments.
So, Ive looked at how Aqua assessed her account at the time of the increases. I agree with 
our investigator that we cant look at the first issue of the card in 2014  as this is more than 
six years before Miss Fs complaint. But we will look at the limit increases. 
I can see that up until the last increase in August 2016, Miss F managed her Aqua account 
well. There were no signs of difficulty  there werent any late or missed payments; nor were 
there any over limit situations. She didnt withdraw cash on the card. And Aqua couldnt see 
there were any payday loans, or other debts. I agree that Miss F did borrow up to her limits  
but not beyond them. So, all looked OK. And I cant say that Aqua were wrong to offer the 
increases then. And  as Aqua have said, Miss F couldve said she didnt want to borrow 
more money but didnt. 
Things changed in 2016 though. I can see there two over limit fees (in April and May 2016)  
but Miss F was still paying to Aqua on time. But  Aqua could then also have seen she had 
other debts mounting up  these were £3780 in March 2016 and increased to over £13000 
by May 2016. There were 13 payday loans, of which three had been taken out in the last 
three months. By then, it looked like Miss F was in difficulty and so  at that time, Aqua 
shouldve asked more questions of Miss Fs circumstances - before offering the increase in 
limit to £4700.
So  my decision is that Aqua shouldnt have increased Miss Fs limit to £4700 in August 
2016.
Putting things right My decision is that Aqua shouldnt have increased Miss Fs limit to £4700 in August 2016, 
and so they should refund interest and any fees charged from that time to the date of when 
the account was repaid. This should be on any borrowing over £3700, as I decided that the 
increases up to £3700 were OK. And  because Miss F has repaid the debt and had 
therefore paid the interest and charges, they should pay interest of 8% per annum simple on 
those amounts from the time they were paid (November 2016) to the date of the refunds 
following this decision.
My final decision
 I uphold this complaint.  NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (Aqua) must:
Refund to Miss F all interest and charges on borrowing over £3700 from August 2016 
to November 2016, when the account was repaid.
Pay 8% per annum simple interest on the amounts refunded from November 2016 
(when they were paid by Miss F) to the date of the refunds following this decision.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss F to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 August 2021.
