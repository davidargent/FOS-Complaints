K821x#15complaint
Mr M says Elevate Credit  International Limited trading as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly.  
Mr M says that the loans  werent affordable and so they were  mis-sold. 
background
This complaint is about 19 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr M between  August 2015 
and April 2018. Ive attached a table to the end of this decision which contains some of the 
details Sunny has provided  about the lending. 
Sunny has looked  at Mr Ms complaint  and said that it shouldnt be upheld. It said that it did 
appropriate checks for all of loans. And these checks showed that the lending was 
affordable. Based on the checks it did it thought that it was responsible  to advance credit to 
Mr M. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought Mr M should be paid 
compensation in respect of loans 5 to 19 as Sunny shouldve seen that he couldnt 
sustainably repay  the lending.  
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It provided some information  about its 
lending processes. It also said that the adjudicator hadnt considered  the gap of round  nine 
months between loans 8 and 9. So as no agreements been  reached the complaints been 
passed to me to issue a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Ms case. Ive decided to uphold  Mr Ms 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay his loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ms income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  indicate  that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done  more 
to establish that any lending  was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number or higher  frequency  of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer and business have a lending  relationship  
is long.
Ref: DRN85611222There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Ms complaint.  These questions are:
1.Did Sunny, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr M would be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would those  
checks have shown  that Mr M would have been  able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Ms indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did Sunny act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Ms complaint.
Did Sunny, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that Mr M would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have  
shown that Mr M would have been able to do so?
Our adjudicator said that Sunny had made proportionate checks  for loans  1 to 4. Mr M didnt 
disagree with our adjudicators opinion about these loans. Because  of this I dont think there  
is any ongoing disagreement about  them. So I wont be making a decision about loans 1 to 
4. But they were part of the borrowing relationship  Mr M had with Sunny. So they are 
something I will take into account when considering the other  loans he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 5 to 19 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ms indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise 
harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further lending.  Given the particular circumstances  of Mr Ms case, I think that this point was 
reached by loan 5. I say this because:
the amounts Mr M had outstanding were generally increasing. When Mr M took loan, 
5 loans 2 and 4 were still outstanding. So three of the first five loans Mr M had taken 
were running at the same  time and his monthly payments were  increasing despite 
some of the loan amounts being  lower. So Sunny ought to have realised Mr M was 
unlikely to be able to make these repayments  sustainably
Mr M wasnt really  reducing the amount he owed Sunny. He continued to take a 
number of loans  at the same time and this continued for the remainder of the lending. 
He was in effect paying large amounts of interest to service  this debt over an 
extended period
Sunny continued  to approve loans from loan 5 onwards. I think Mr M has lost out because  of 
this for the following  reasons:
Ref: DRN85611223these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time. Mr M had a lending 
relationship with Sunny for over two and a half years
the sheer number  of loans, 19 in total, was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Ms ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
Sunny has said there was a break  in the lending of around 9 months  between  loans 8 and 9. 
But loan 8 ran for 6 months and loan 9 was started  about 3 months after loan 8 ended.  So 
the break in the lending relationship is nearer 3 months. And given this took place over a 
year after Mr M took his first loan it doesnt  affect my findings above. 
So Im upholding  Mr Ms complaint about loans 5 to 19 because  the overall pattern of lending 
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  and hes 
lost out as a result.
Did Sunny act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude Sunny acted unfairly  or unreasonably towards  Mr M in some other 
way.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  5 to 19;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 means  any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 5 to 19 should be removed from Mr Ms credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ms complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2019.
