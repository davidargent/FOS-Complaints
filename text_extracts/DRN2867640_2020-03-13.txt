Miss H says Herts  Cash  Limited  (Herts) irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about seven payday  loans Herts  provided to Miss H between  September 2011 
and March 2012 . Miss Hs borrowing history  is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Repayment
1 14/09/2011 24/10/2011 2 £300.00 £390.00
2 14/11/2011 18/11/2011 2 £80.00 £104.00
3 28/11/2011 16/12/2011 2 £100.00 £130.00
4 17/12/2011 18/01/2012 2 £200.00 £260.00
5 16/01/2012 15/02/2012 2 £250.00 £325.00
6 10/02/2012 14/03/2012 2 £250.00 £325.00
7 12/03/2012 21/09/2012 2 £350.00 £455.00
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Hs complaint  and thought  the loans from loan 4 
onwards shouldnt have been  given because they felt if Herts had done proportionate  checks 
it would  have shown  Miss H wasnt managing her finances. Herts didnt respond  to the view, 
so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Herts needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss H could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Herts  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period during which  a 
customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may signal 
that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
Ref: DRN28676402There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Herts was required to establish 
whether Miss H could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Hs complaint. Having  done this, Ive decided to partially 
uphold the complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Herts  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 3. Miss H 
didnt disagree  with the adjudicators findings about  these loans. As there is no dispute about 
these loans, I wont be making any findings  on them. But Ive kept them in mind when 
thinking about the context  of the overall lending relationship. 
Herts says it carried out checks  before it lent loan 4 to Miss H and the results of these 
checks didnt raise  any concerns. But as this was Miss Hs fourth loan in three  months and 
she had struggled  to repay her previous loans, I think Herts  should have been looking to 
build a clearer picture than it did about Miss Hs finances before lending  her this loan. 
Miss H had been in debt with Herts  almost  continuingly during that period. Each time Miss H 
repaid a loan she needed  to borrow again within a matter of days. The behaviour  of Miss Hs 
borrowing with Herts  was an indication she was struggling financially. She had defaulted  in 
paying two of her previous loans  including loan 3. She was then asking to borrow twice as 
much, the day after shed  repaid a loan she had struggled to make repayments on. Given  
the fact Miss H had a history with Herts, it should  have realised it was highly likely she 
wouldnt be able to make  the repayments for this loan sustainably. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Hertss  lending history with Miss H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Herts should reasonably have  seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And Herts  should have realised  that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Hs case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
At this point Herts ought  to have realised Miss H was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Miss H had been indebted  to Herts for six months. So Herts ought  to have 
realised it was more likely than not that Miss Hs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN28676403Miss Hs first loan was for £300  and loan 7 was for £350.   At this point Herts ought  to 
have known  that it was unlikely Miss H was borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall in 
her income but more  to meet an ongoing need. 
Miss H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Herts. As mentioned 
above, Loan 7 was taken out six months after Miss Hs first. And it was for a larger 
amount. Miss H had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect; service a debt to Herts 
over an extended period.
I think that Miss H lost out because Herts continued  to provide borrowing at loan 7 because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Hs indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the number of loans  and the length of time over which Miss H borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Hs ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 to 7 and Herts should put things right.
putting things right  what Herts needs to do
refund all interest  and charges Miss H paid on loans 4 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative  information about  loans 4, 5 and 6 from Miss Hs credit file;
any information  recorded about  loan 7 is adverse. So all entries  about  this loan should 
be removed from Miss Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Herts to take off tax from this interest. Herts must give Miss H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Hs complaint. Herts  Cash Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 April 2020.
