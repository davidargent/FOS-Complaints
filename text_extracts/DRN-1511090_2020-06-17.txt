The complaint
Mr P complains about the level of compensation National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) 
has offered him for his complaint.
What happened
Mr P made a complaint to NatWest in around July 2019 for which it agreed to pay Mr P £20 
compensation. He says that compensation offer didn't go far enough and said he thought 
£50 was fair. The cheque NatWest sent Mr P for the compensation was incorrect and 
returned which Mr P says caused him embarrassment. Mr P says the compensation paid by 
NatWest still doesn't go far enough and it hasn't explained why it took £20 out of one of his 
accounts.
NatWest says it initially agreed to pay Mr P £20 compensation but says it agreed to increase 
that payment by £40 to £60. It apologised for the cheque mistake and for later cancelling it. It 
also says it has explained that it paid £20 into an account before debiting that money and 
sending it by cheque. NatWest says it later increased its compensation offer by a further 
£30.
Mr P had already brought his complaint to us before the issues with the cheque and before 
NatWest's later compensation offers. Our investigator thought the compensation offer was 
fair and reasonable and Mr P agreed but thought he was due to receive a further payment. 
The investigator checked with NatWest and it said it had sent Mr P the money and the three 
cheques were cashed in August 2019 for £20,September 2019 for £40 and October 2019 for 
£30.
Mr P doesn't accept that view and says NatWest should now pay £100 compensation. He 
says the investigator has failed to say which final response letter he has considered, and 
according to his calculations is £20 short. He also says the £20 in the account that was 
debited was nothing to do with the complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I have come to the 
overall view that NatWest has paid a fair and reasonable level of compensation and that all 
of the money has been paid. I realise Mr P will be disappointed and I appreciate how 
strongly he feels about what's taken place.
I have looked carefully at exactly what Mr P was complaining about when he first brought his 
complaint to us on 29 July 2019. I can see that he thought NatWest's compensation offer of 
£20 was not enough, and he wanted £50 compensation. NatWest then reviewed that offer 
DRN-1511090and agreed with Mr P that £20 was not reasonable and agreed to increase it by £30 which is 
the figure I'm satisfied Mr P also wanted, and thought fair and reasonable.
So I'm satisfied NatWest has paid a fair and reasonable level of compensation for what took 
place and that it paid an amount which Mr P wanted and told us was appropriate. So in 
those circumstances I don't require NatWest to increase that compensation amount.
There is no question that there was a further problem caused by the cheque details being 
incorrect and by NatWest cancelling the compensation cheque. I have no doubt that caused 
Mr P frustration and inconvenience but I can see that NatWest has fairly apologised for that 
mistake.
I have looked at all of NatWest's response letters to Mr P and I'm satisfied it's explained the 
position about the account in which the £20 was paid into and taken out of. I can't see any 
evidence that NatWest made a mistake about that payment or has taken money out of the 
account that it wasn't entitled to deduct.
I accept that the position is not clear about the individual payments for compensation and 
that the compensation awards have changed. But having looked at NatWest records I'm 
satisfied the important point is that it's paid Mr P three payments amounting to £90 in 
August, September and October 2019. And I'm satisfied that award is more than Mr P asked 
us to increase the compensation to and, so I can't fairly ask Natwest to do anything further in 
the circumstances of this complaint.
Overall I find NatWest has paid the compensation it said it would, and has explained the 
position with the account in which £20 was paid into. I'm satisfied this brings an end to what 
we in trying to sort out this dispute can do to help Mr P.
My final decision
My final decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 July 2020.
