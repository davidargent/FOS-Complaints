DRN-1628114
The complaint
Mr D complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Specialist Motor Finance Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Specialist Motor Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that 
it was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr D - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr D was more than six years old, had been driven for 
56,550 miles and had a price of £4,989;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mr D says that the timing chain sounded a bit off when he looked at the car and that 
the dealer told him that he couldnt bring the car back because of any issues with the 
timing chain  but he agreed that the car would be supplied to him and he 
electronically signed a hire purchase agreement with Specialist Motor Finance in 
February 2019;
its clear that Mr D has had issues with the car and hes paid to have the cylinders, 
the crankshaft and cam shaft sensors, the fuel pump and the timing chain replaced;
he says that those issues started four or five months after the car was supplied to 
him and the cost of the timing chain replacement in August 2019 was £1,012.22 
which fixed the issues with the car;
he complained to Specialist Motor Finance in August 2019 and he told it that the 
cars mileage at that time was 61,000 miles  so in about five months hed been able 
to drive nearly 4,500 miles in the car;
the car passed an MOT test in June 2019 when its mileage was 60,278 and 
Specialist Motor Finance says that there were no advisories;
it also says that Mr D arranged the work on the car without authorisation from it and 
that it wasnt given an opportunity to inspect the car before the work was completed; 
and 
I sympathise with Mr D for the issues that hes had with the car and for the costs that 
hes incurred in replacing a number of parts, but Im not persuaded that it would be 
fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Specialist Motor Finance 
to allow him to reject the car, to reimburse him for any of the repair costs or to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 October 2020.
