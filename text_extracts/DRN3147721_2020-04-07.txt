Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ss complaint and thought the loans from loan 5 
onwards shouldnt have been  given as they thought  the pattern of borrowing  indicated     
Miss S was reliant on short-term loans. Sunny disagreed but agreed to uphold loan 5 only 
instead. Miss S declined  Sunnys offer so, the complaint  was passed to me.
I issued my provisional decision in February 2020.  Ive attached  a copy  of it to the end of this 
decision. I asked  for any more information  or comments before I issued my final decision.  
Neither party has responded. 
my findings
Ive now reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments  to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
As neither party had anything more for me to consider, my decision remains  the same. Im 
upholding Miss S complaint about  loan 4 and I ask Sunny to put things right as Ive laid out 
below. 
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss S paid on loans 4 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 onwards from Miss Ss credit  file;
Ref: DRN31477212                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited must give Miss S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss S complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 May 2020.

my provisional  findings
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Miss S could repay  the loans  
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  consider  several different things,  such as how much 
was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. In the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
Ref: DRN31477213the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish  whether  Miss 
S could sustainably  repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis  might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and 
the customer  should  be able to make  repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence  and information provided  in this context and 
what this all means for Miss Ss complaint. Having  done so, Im thinking  of partially  upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to more when  it approved loans 1 to 4. Miss S didnt 
respond to the view. 
Having reviewed  the whole lending  chain afresh, I think that Sunny didnt  do enough before it lend 
loan 4 to Miss S and Ill explain why below.  But as there appears to be no dispute  with the 
adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 3, I wont be making further findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before it lent loan 4 to Miss S and the results of these checks  didnt 
raise any concerns. But as this was Miss Ss fourth loan in just over two months, I think  Sunny should 
have been looking  to build a clearer picture about Miss Ss finances before lending her this loan. 
Looking at the information  Sunny has provided, I can see that it had Miss Ss monthly  outgoings  - 
including her other  credit commitments  these were listed  as £957  not including  her commitments 
to repay loan 4. It isnt clear if this amount also includes her repayments for the outstanding  loans she 
had with Sunny. 
Miss Ss listed monthly income  was £1,083. If Miss Ss outgoings included her repayments for her 
other outstanding Sunny loans, this would have left her with £126 of disposable income.  This would 
have reduced  by a further £31 to meet her commitments  for loan 4. Leaving her with around £90 to 
cover any emergencies  and eventualities. I dont think this would have been sufficient  given Miss Ss 
history of having to take out new loans on a regular  basis. 
If the outgoings  amount didnt include Miss Ss commitments for her other Sunny loans, then she 
would have been over committed  and not had any disposable  income.  
Sunny ought to have realised this was the case and the potential  for Miss S to struggle to make  the 
repayments. Its my view there  was a significant chance of Miss S having  to borrow  again to meet her 
Ref: DRN31477214commitment under this loan. So, its my view that Sunny should put things right for this loan as well as 
loans 5 to 7. 
Our adjudicator thought that the overall pattern of Miss Ss lending  history with Sunny was 
unsustainable and that further borrowing  wouldve likely had negative  implications  on 
Miss Ss ability to access mainstream credit and kept her in the market  for these  kinds of high-cost 
loans. But I dont agree.  I dont think Miss S had been a customer of Sunnys for long enough for me 
to reasonably and fairly conclude that Sunny  should have noticed a pattern.
