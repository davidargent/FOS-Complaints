K821x#15complaint
Mr E complains that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited paid fines  without telling 
him first.
 
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint a copy of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I proposed to uphold Mr Es complaint and to 
require VWFS to refund  the administrative charges and pay compensation of £250. I invited 
Mr E and VWFS to let me have any further  evidence or arguments they wanted to make 
before I finally determined the matter.
Mr E responded and queried what my provisional  decision meant  regarding  compensation 
and the removal  of administration charges. He enclosed a copy  of a letter he had received 
from VWFS in which it offered to remove the administration charges but said the fines  
totalling £480 stood. 
VWFS responded and said it agreed  with my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In relation to Mr Es query,  my provisional  decision means that he would be liable to pay the 
fines totalling £480 but not the administrative charges.  It would also mean  that VWFS pay 
£250 compensation to Mr E. Ive taken  account of what Mr E has said but since  he hasnt 
said that he disagrees with my provisional  decision I see no reason  to reach a different 
conclusion.
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is to uphold  this complaint.  Volkswagen  Financial Services (UK) Limited  must:
Refund the administration charges
Pay compensation of £250
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 June  2020.
