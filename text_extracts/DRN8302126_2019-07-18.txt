K820x#14complaint
Mr H says Financial  Insurance  Company Limited (FICL) mis-sold him a payment protection 
insurance (PPI)  policy.  
background
Mr H bought the policy in 2003 at the same  time as taking out a store card.  Over the life of 
the PPI Mr H paid a total of Â£3.59  in premiums. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr H disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Hs case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Hs complaint because:
 Mr H signed on his store card application  form specifically to indicate he wanted PPI  
separately to where he signed for the card. So I think FICL made  Mr H aware that he 
had a choice about buying  the PPI, and that he chose to take it. 
 FICL  didnt recommend the PPI to Mr H so it didnt have to check if it was right for him. 
 Its possible the information FICL gave Mr H about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Mr H doesnt appear  to have been affected by any of the main 
things the policy  didnt cover  and based on what I know about  his circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been  useful to him. He had no sick pay or savings, so the 
PPI wouldve been his only way of keeping  up with his repayments if he was unable  to 
work. So I dont think better  information wouldve stopped him buying it. 
Ive taken into account Mr Hs comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 August 2019.
