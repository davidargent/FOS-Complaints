The complaint 
Mrs A complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) restricted her account and 
didnt let her withdraw £10,000 cash she needed to travel abroad for a family wedding. Mrs A 
also complains NatWests staff member was rude to her. 
To put things right, Mrs A wants NatWest to pay her compensation for missing the family 
wedding, the significant distress and inconvenience caused, an explanation for NatWests 
actions and compensation for penalties incurred for having to change her flights; and 
compensation for having to borrow money from friends and family.  
What happened
In February 2022 NatWest blocked Mrs As account. Mrs A was attempting to organise the 
withdrawal of £10,000 cash from a branch but was unable to do so. Unhappy with its actions 
Mrs A complained. 
NatWest explained the terms of the account allows it to block an account if it has reasonable 
grounds to do so. And it is unable to provide any further information about this. It also 
apologised that she wasnt put through to a manger when speaking to one of its employees 
 and that feedback would be given. 
In a separate response, NatWest offered to credit Mrs As account with £30 compensation 
as an apology for the poor service she received after speaking to one of its employees. 
Unhappy with NatWests response, Mrs A referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our Investigators looked into Mrs As complaint, and they upheld it in part. In 
summary, they found: 
- NatWest were entitled to review and restrict Mrs As account on 1 February 2022, so 
it cant be held responsible for her having to reschedule her flight 
- NatWest correctly applied the terms of the account when closing Mrs As account by 
giving her 60 days notice
- NatWest is under no obligation to explain its reasons for the review and closure of 
the account 
- The closure letter was posted to Mrs As address on 19 May 2022. She says she was 
abroad on 22 May 2022. So its possible Mrs A was abroad when it was received, but 
that is not NatWests fault 
- NatWest hasnt provided enough information to show the restrictions it also applied 
between 6 and 18 May 2022 were fair. Because of this Mrs A should been 
compensated for any stress and anxiety caused, and for being deprived of the funds 
- NatWest are not responsible for any other losses Mrs A has claimed as it was her 
decision to change the flights and it was entitled to review the account 
- As NatWest hasnt shown reason enough for the restriction placed between 6 and 8 
May 2022, it should pay Mrs A 8% simple interest on the funds in the account during 
this period and pay £100 compensation for any trouble and upset caused 
NatWest agreed with what our Investigator said. Mrs A did not. Our Investigator explained 
that Mrs A had the opportunity to fly to her family wedding on or after 17 February 2022 as 
the blocks were lifted, but she opted not to.  
Mrs A argued that the compensation recommended isnt proportionate to the financial 
difficulties and distress she suffered.  Mrs A had also made a complaint point about a joint 
account she has with her daughter. But as our Investigator explained, that will not be 
considered as part of this complaint. 
As Mrs A didnt agree with what our Investigator said, her complaint has now been passed to 
me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
Banks in the UK, like NatWest, are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to 
meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need to 
restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customers accounts. 
From the limited information NatWest have give me, I can see that it restricted Mrs As 
account between (1) 1 February until 10 February 2022; and (2) from 6 May 2022 until 18 
May 2022; and then from (3) July 2022 onwards. 
NatWest hasnt given me all the information Id expect, but having carefully considered the 
information I do have, Im satisfied it had reason enough to restrict Mrs As account in 
February 2022. I also note any restrictions imposed from July 2022 onwards related to the 
account being closed. But I havent been given any information for why NatWest decided to 
restrict the account in May 2022 for 12 days. Because of that I cant say it acted in line with 
its obligations nor acted properly. 
So that means Mrs A was deprived unfairly of access to her funds during May 2022, and 
NatWest should compensate her for this and for any distress and inconvenience she 
suffered as a result. 
A bank is entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with a bank. 
But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which complies with the terms 
and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions of the account, which NatWest and Mrs A had to comply with, say 
that it could close the account by giving them at least two months notice. And in certain 
circumstances it can close an account immediately or with less notice. 
Having looked at the information given to me by NatWest, Im satisfied it was entitled to 
close the account in the way that it has done  that is by giving at least two months notice. 
Ive seen the letter dated 19 May 2022 that NatWest say it sent to Mrs A about the closure of the account. Its possible Mrs A didnt receive this in time before she travelled abroad  but I 
havent seen any compelling reason why she wouldnt have received it at her registered 
address.
Mrs A says that she has suffered significant financial loss and substantive distress and 
inconvenience. But apart from the 12-day block in May 2022, as Ive said, Im persuaded that 
NatWest hasnt done anything wrong. So any compensation I award will only be for this 
period. 
Mrs A has also said that she was unable to travel to a family wedding. But the invitation copy 
she has sent me for this is dated 7 March 2022. So given the dates of the restrictions which 
Ive set out above, I think she could have still travelled to the wedding. So I dont think 
NatWest need to compensate her for any fees related to rearranging her flight.  
I acknowledge that the block in May 2022 would have caused her distress and 
inconvenience and having to borrow from friends and family would cause embarrassment.  
Having given this some thought, Im satisfied that £100 is fair compensation for this. 
Lastly, and for the sake of completeness, I note Mrs A complained about the customer 
service she received from NatWest. Principally, that she was spoken to rudely by one of its 
agents. Ive listened to some of the calls NatWest have given me, and I dont think that this 
happened on those calls. In any event, I note NatWest have offered Mrs A £30 for this  I 
dont think it needs to do anymore. 
Putting things right
To put things right, NatWest should: 
- Pay Mrs A 8% simple interest on her account balance between 6 and 18 May 2022*
- Pay Mrs A £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience she has suffered 
in May 2022 
* If NatWest considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct income tax from that 
interest, it should tell Mrs A how much its taken off. It should also give Mrs A a tax deduction 
certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint in part. National Westminster Bank Plc 
should now put things right as directed above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 September 2023.
