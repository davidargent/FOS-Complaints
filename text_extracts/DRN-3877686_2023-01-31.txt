The complaint
Mr C is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt issue a new debit 
card to his overseas address for several years.
What happened
Mr C lives overseas and has been asking NatWest to issue him a new debit card to his 
overseas address for several years, but without success. Mr C wasnt happy about this, so 
he raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Mr Cs complaint. They acknowledged there had been a period when Mr 
C had been without a debit card when one should potentially reasonably have been posted 
to him. NatWest apologised to Mr C for this and made payments totalling £200 to him as 
compensation for any upset or inconvenience this may have caused. Mr C wasnt happy with 
Nationwides response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they felt the response NatWest had 
issued to Mr Cs complaint, including the apology and the payment of £200 compensation, 
already represented a fair and reasonable resolution to what had happened. Mr C remained 
dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In his correspondence with this service, Mr C has stated that he wants this service to punish 
NatWest for not posting a replacement debit card to him in a timely manner. However, it 
must be noted that this service isnt a regulatory body or a Court of Law and doesnt operate 
as such. This means that it isnt within my remit to punish NatWest as Mr C would like here.
Instead, this service is an informal dispute resolution service with a remit focussed on 
fairness of outcome. And in this instance, having taken all the circumstances of this 
complaint into consideration, Im satisfied that the response that NatWest have already 
issued to Mr Cs complaint does already represent a fair outcome to whats happened here.
In arriving at this position Ive taken into account that NatWest held concerns about the 
overseas address they held on file for Mr C and that they were consequently unwilling to 
send posted correspondence to that address until Mr C was able to update it to an address 
that NatWest could themselves verify to their satisfaction.
While I can appreciate this may have been frustrating for Mr C, NatWests position here 
seems reasonable to me, especially given NatWests obligations and responsibilities to 
ensure the safety of information sent by post. It also must be acknowledged that it isnt within 
the remit of this service to instruct NatWest to change their position or process surrounding 
this matter, for the reasons explained previously above.
Mr C is also unhappy that NatWest wouldnt allow him to update his overseas address to a 
format that would be acceptable to NatWest via email, but instead required him to either use 
telephone banking or send a request in writing. NatWest have explained that this is because 
they have concerns over the security of email correspondence, and again their position here 
seems reasonable to me and isnt one which this service has the remit to instruct against. 
NatWest did accept that there may have been historical instances when replacement debit 
cards should have been posted to Mr C overseas, but that because of the time elapsed 
since those instances they no longer hold records to confirm whether those debit cards 
should or shouldnt have been posted in line with their process. Because NatWest couldnt 
confirm that there hadnt been legitimate reasons that the debit cards hadnt been posted to 
Mr C at those times, they apologised to Mr C for this and made payments totalling £200 to 
him as compensation for any trouble and upset he may have potentially incurred.
NatWests position on this matter again seems reasonable to me, and it must be noted that 
NatWest compensated Mr C here for what may have occurred rather than what did definitely 
occur, given that the records to confirm what definitely occurred were no longer retained by 
them. And, taking this important point into consideration, I feel the £200 compensation paid 
by NatWest to Mr C is a fair amount, given that it may have been the case that NatWest 
didnt send debit cards to Mr C at those times for reasons similar to those explained above.
NatWest ended their response to Mr Cs complaint by explaining that they were waiting for 
him to provide an update of address request in writing, and that once received, they would 
update his address and send a new debit card to him. This was in keeping with NatWests 
previously explained process, and Im aware that Mr C did subsequently receive a 
replacement debit card having provided the update of address letter as requested. 
In his complaint to this service, Mr C has stated that he was without a debit card for several 
years. Its notable that Mr C holds a number of accounts with NatWest, and while it was the 
case that he didnt hold a debit card on one of those accounts from December 2016 
onwards, this account wasnt actively used by Mr C and held a balance close to zero 
throughout that period. As such, it doesnt appear that Mr C was significantly impacted by 
not having a debit card for that account. 
Mr C did have a debit card for an alternative account from December 2016 until the card 
expired in December 2019, at which time Mr C contacted NatWest about it via online chat 
and when NatWests reluctance to post a replacement debit card to the overseas address 
they presently held on file was explained to him. Mr C has stated that NatWest advised him 
at that time to have the debit card sent to a UK based family member, but that this wasnt 
possible for him. However, given that this process was possible for Mr C a few years earlier, 
in 2016, it doesnt seem unreasonable to me that NatWest would initially suggest it again. 
Ultimately, Im satisfied that it was fair for NatWest to have declined to post replacement 
debit cards to the overseas address they held for Mr C until Mr C updated that address via 
an acceptable channel to an address that NatWest could verify to their own satisfaction.    
All of which means that, while I appreciate the frustration Mr C may have incurred here, I 
dont feel that NatWest have acted unfairly or unreasonably towards him in the manner 
which he contends, and as explained, Im satisfied that the response to Mr Cs complaint 
issued by NatWest already represents a fair and reasonable resolution to whats happened.
I realise this wont be the outcome Mr C was wanting, but it follows that I wont be upholding 
this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action. I hope Mr C will understand, 
give all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.  My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 February 2023.
