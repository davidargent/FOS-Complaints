K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains about end of contract  charges  when his agreement with Mercedes-Benz 
Financial Services UK Limited  (MBFS) ended.
background
In May 2015  Mr G was supplied with a car and entered  into a contract purchase agreement  
with MBFS. The contract  reached maturity  on 28 May 2018.
Following inspection and collection of the car, MBFS asked Mr G to pay charges totalling 
£2,688.18. These comprised an additional vehicle usage charge of £896.07,  damage  
charges of £1028.64 and excess mileage charges of £486.88.
Mr G is unhappy about the charges. He says the damage charges should  be less and that 
there were delays in collecting  the car, so he doesnt  think  he should  be responsible for all of 
the usage charges.
Our investigator partially upheld the complaint. He said that some of the damage  charges 
were unfair and that the usage  charges should be reduced.
MBFS didnt agree. It said the car was excessively dirty on collection and that after the failed 
collection on 28 June 2018, all further delays were down to Mr G.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the contract purchase  agreement.  This says that the car should  be returned  in 
good condition.  It also says that damage  which exceeds fair wear  and tear is the customers 
responsibility. 
Fair wear and tear guidelines have been  issued by the BVLRA  and these guidelines are 
often used by finance companies  in determining whether damage exceeds fair wear  and 
tear.
Ive looked at the inspection report. This identifies  damage which  MBFS says is more  than 
fair wear and tear and is therefore chargeable. There are also photos  of the damage.
Based on the photos, there  is visible damage. Im satisfied that most of the damage 
identified in the inspection report exceeds  fair wear  and tear in accordance with the 
guidelines. In respect  of the damage for the excessively soiled exterior, I cant  be certain, 
based on the information provided including the photos, that the car was so dirty as to 
prevent an inspection taking place. The BVLRA guidelines say that the cars exterior  should  
be sufficiently clean  to allow  a detailed inspection. From what I can see, a detailed  
inspection took place. So I dont think the £10 charge is fair. 
In relation to the excess mileage charges, the mileage  limit under  the agreement  is 30,000  
with excess miles  charged at 16p per mile.  The car was returned with 33,043  miles. Given  
that the car had covered excess mileage of 3,043  miles, Im satisfied that the charge of 
£486.88 is fair.
Ref: DRN40792342In relation to the usage charge, I can see that Mr G returned the car after the agreement 
reached maturity. It appears that collections booked on 2 May 2018 and 22 May 2018 were 
cancelled by Mr G, and that collections booked on 13 May 2018 and 21 May 2018 were 
abortive.
The collection booked for 28 June 2018 failed due to an internal booking error by MBFS.
I think Mr G has to bear responsibility for the failed  collections in May 2018,  which  led to a 
delay. But the failed collection on 28 June 2018  was MBFSs fault.  Im satisfied the car would 
otherwise have been collected on this date, so I dont  think  its fair for MBFS to charge Mr G 
for usage beyond  28 June  2018.  Im also persuaded that Mr G was inconvenienced  by the 
failed collection on 28 June 2018.
This means  that Mr G should only pay usage charges of £17.57 per day for 31 days  to cover  
the period 28 May 2018 to 28 June 2018.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint.  Mercedes-Benz Financial Services UK 
Limited should:
Remove the £10 charge for general exterior
Reduce the usage charges to £544.67
Pay compensation of £50 for trouble and upset
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 June  2019.
