Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Rs complaint in part and thought the loans 2a onwards shouldnt 
have been given. QuickQuid disagreed and so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN00235412But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, QuickQuids checks from loan 2a didnt go far enough. 
QuickQuid has said that it checked Mr Rs income  and expenses  before lending and that it 
searched his credit  file and there  were  no adverse  markings contained within them.  
QuickQuid also says that from March 2015, it had fully implemented  enhanced checks  
before lending and worked out the estimated disposable income from loan 8 onwards.
I agree  with the adjudicator that the checks  from loan 2a onwards werent sufficient. Loan 2a 
was for a larger amount that his previous loans and he had borrowed loan 2 within a day or 
repaying loan 1/1a and took out loan 2a 2 days after loan 2, I think  this shouldve  prompted 
QuickQuid to take its checks further. And for similar reasons, it should have taken its checks 
further for the rest of the loans.
Its important to mention  that from the checks QuickQuid carried  out, it shouldve  been aware 
that Mr R wasnt in a position to sustainably repay  the loans. Loan 2as largest  repayment  
was for around £270. Taking  into account  Mr Rs declared income of £543  and his living 
expenses of £325, he wasnt in a position to sustainably repay this loan.
Ref: DRN00235413I think QuickQuids checks from loan 2b to 3a even without it taking its checks  further, 
showed that Mr R couldnt  afford the loan.  The loan repayments took up a significant portion 
of his disposable income which meant that the loans werent sustainably affordable for him.
And had QuickQuid taken  its checks further  and verified some  of the information Mr R 
provided about his income and expenses as I think it should have done - given that Mr R had 
been borrowing  regularly  without any significant breaks and hed also been regularly topping  
up his payments  it wouldve seen that Mr R was gambling significant  amounts monthly  and 
in most months exceeding his income of around  £1,400. Mr R has provided  copies of his 
bank statements and so Ive been able to get a picture of what his actual financial 
circumstances were  at the time. This wasnt a sustainable position  and QuickQuid  shouldnt  
have been lending.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 4. I say this because by loan 4, Mr R had been borrowing from QuickQuid for around 8 
months without any significant  breaks. Hed incurred a late fee payment on loans 2/2a/2b  
and hed topped all his previous loans with further borrowing. 
And from loan 4 onwards Mr R was provided  with a new loan within days of settling a 
previous one. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr R was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Rs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.  I can also see that 
Mr R went into a repayment  plan on at least three  of his loans.
Mr R wasnt making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid. QuickQuid accepts 
that a third party on behalf of Mr R told it in May 2017 that Mr R had a gambling problem and 
it shouldnt continue to lend to him. QuickQuid has said it didnt  place any weight on this 
information as information from third parties had turned out to incorrect in the past.  While  I 
understand why QuickQuid may be hesitant to rely on information  provided by 
representatives of its customers, I think a third party is usually authorised  to deal on behalf of 
the customer and it would  have been reasonable for QuickQuid to take steps to react to that 
information. 
For example, it could have contacted Mr R directly and also taken steps  to verify his income 
and expenses. And had it done  that it would have been able to confirm  that the information  
from the third party was genuine and wouldnt have continued lending  to Mr R. Instead 
QuickQuid continued  to lend to Mr R and gave  him nine further advances when it had 
information that this wasnt sustainable.  The effect was that Mr R paid large  amounts of 
interest to service a debt to QuickQuid over an extended  period. Loan 10b was taken out 
around 32 months after Mr Rs first and it was for a larger amount  more  than six times  his 
first loan.
I think that Mr R lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from loan 2a 
onwards and:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN00235414the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Rs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 2a to 10b and QuickQuid should put things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 2a to 10b;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 2a to 7 from Mr Rs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 8 to 10b should be removed from 
Mr Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
should pay Mr R compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 August 2019.
