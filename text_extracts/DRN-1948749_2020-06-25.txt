The complaint
Mr O complains that Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny lent to him 
irresponsibly.
 
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in May 2020 that I summarise below.
Mr O was given 6 loans by Sunny between March 2018 and September 2018. All the loans 
were short-term instalment loans, to be repaid over 6 months. As the table shows, some of 
these loans ran concurrently. Mr O has repaid all the loans.
A summary of Mr O's borrowing is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount
1 15/03/2018 31/08/2018 6 £350.00
2 23/03/2018 03/07/2018 6 £100.00
3 27/06/2018 03/07/2018 6 £150.00
4 26/07/2018 31/01/2019 6 £250.00
5 28/07/2018 31/01/2019 6 £200.00
6 19/09/2018 29/03/2019 6 £100.00
     
 
I noted that as each of Mr Os loans were repayable over a period of 6 months, the amounts 
that he needed to repay each month were smaller than if hed taken a normal payday loan. 
But he had to make those repayments over a longer period. And at times Mr O had a 
number of loans outstanding together. So I considered the total amount that Mr O needed to 
repay to Sunny every week.
 
In my provisional decision I explained why I thought the complaint should not be upheld. 
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, in particular the checks that 
Sunny needed to do such as the amount being lent, and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, I thought less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate in the early stages of the lending relationship.I thought that the checks that Sunny carried out for the first four loans were proportionate. 
The amounts that Mr O needed to repay in relation to these loans were relatively small 
compared with the disposable income hed declared. Given the amount it was lending to the 
consumer each time, what Mr O had told Sunny about his circumstances and the number of 
loans agreed, I didnt think it wouldve been proportionate for Sunny to ask Mr O for the 
amount of information that would be needed to show the lending was unsustainable before 
agreeing the first four loans. 
So I didnt think there was any reason why the lender should have declined these 
applications.  
 
But I didnt think Sunny should have agreed to loan 5 onwards without doing more a more 
thorough check of Mr Os full financial circumstances. Mr O had repaid two of his loans 
earlier than planned. I thought this should have caused some concerns to Sunny because it 
could have indicated that Mr O was having problems managing his money and needed to 
refinance his loans on a regular basis. 
But without additional information, I couldnt say what better checks by the lender would 
have shown at the time. From the evidence presented, I couldnt fairly say that Sunny 
shouldnt have given loan 5 to Mr O or that it lent to him irresponsibly. So I said I didnt 
intend to uphold the complaint about this loan, as I hadn't seen enough evidence to say that 
better checks in respect of this loan would have led to it being declined.
Our adjudicator had thought that by loan 6, Mr Os overall pattern of borrowing suggested 
hed become persistently reliant on Sunnys lending. And that Sunny shouldnt have given Mr 
O loan 6. But I hadnt seen enough evidence for me to reasonably agree with this. Sunnys 
lending practice was to allow consumers to take up to four loans at a time. I thought Mr O 
would have been aware of this, and it is reasonable to assume that he might have decided to 
take advantage of it by taking several loans with Sunny over a fairly short space of time, 
increasing his borrowing as it was needed.
 
I did think that Sunny should have carried out a more thorough check on Mr Os finances 
before it decided to give him loan 6, to satisfy itself that he could meet his ongoing 
repayments sustainably. But without further information about Mr Os financial circumstances 
at the time, I couldnt reasonably say that the emerging pattern of borrowing alone meant 
that Sunny shouldnt have given Mr O the final loan.
 
In summary, I said the checks that Sunny carried out in respect of loans 1 to 4 
were proportionate. I thought better checks ought to have been carried out before loan 5 
onwards was agreed. But from the evidence presented, I couldn't fairly say that Sunny 
shouldnt have given loans 5 or 6 to Mr O or that it lent to him irresponsibly. And I didnt think 
Mr Os pattern of borrowing alone was enough for me to fairly and reasonably say that loan 6 
should have been declined.
 
I invited both parties to send me any further comments or evidence. Ive not received any 
further information from either Mr O or from Sunny.What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that Ive not received any further evidence or comment from either Mr O or from 
Sunny, I see no reason to depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Os complaint or make any award against Elevate 
Credit International Limited trading as Sunny.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 28th July 2020.
