* Including overlapping loans
Mr J says Sunny would not have lent to him if it had carried out effective checks. He says it 
was irresponsible for Sunny to lend him further money to repay existing loans.
DRN-1796143Sunny says it asked Mr J about his income and expenditure and checked his credit file. It 
says it was satisfied its checks were proportionate and that the loans were affordable based 
upon the available information. 
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld in part. He said that, by loan 
5,  proportionate checks were likely to have shown Mr J was having problems managing his 
money as he already had multiple outstanding short-term loans with other lenders. He added 
that Mr Js pattern of borrowing by loan 8 should also have indicated to Sunny that Mr J was 
unlikely to be able to sustainably repay his loans. Our adjudicator recommended Sunny 
should refund interest and charges on loans 5 to 16 (plus 8% statutory interest) and remove 
any negative information about loans 5 to 7 from his credit file. He added that loans 8 to 16 
should be removed from his credit file entirely.
Sunny responded to say, in summary, that the assessment wasnt clear about what 
proportionate checks it should have carried out by loan 5, but it says it asked Mr J about all 
his expenses, including other short-term loans. It says it cannot agree that by loan 8 the 
lending was unsustainable as there were significant gaps between some of the loans which 
does not support the conclusion that Mr J was reliant on the lending.
Sunny adds that Mr Js contractual repayments were also a small proportion of his income 
and he had a reasonable amount of disposable income remaining after making the 
scheduled repayments. However, it offered to uphold Mr Js complaint from loan 11 onwards 
as it recognised Mr J had been charged daily interest for 18 months by this point and it could 
have asked him further questions about his financial circumstances.
Mr J did not accept Sunnys offer.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr J could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors can 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to 
make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Js complaint.
Loans 1 to 4
Im satisfied Sunny carried out enough checks for these loans as the repayments were a 
small proportion of Mr Js declared income. There were also significant gaps in borrowing 
between loans 2 and 3, and loans 3 and 4. I cant see there is anything in the available 
information that should have suggested to Sunny that the loans were likely to be 
unaffordable to Mr J.
Loans 5 to 7
By the time Mr J applied for loans 5 onwards, I consider a proportionate check should have 
included a full financial review. I say that because this was Mr Js fifth loan in less than ten 
months and the amounts requested weren't decreasing.
I think its likely that if Sunny had carried out a full financial review, it would have found Mr J 
had outstanding short-term loans with at least three other lenders, plus regular loan 
repayments of about £400 per month.
I acknowledge Sunny says it asked Mr J for this information, but at this stage in the lending I 
would have expected it to verify the information he was providing. I can see Mr J had 
declared his monthly credit expenditure to be £73 which did not take into account the 
majority of his credit commitments at this stage.
So Im satisfied that if Sunny had carried out proportionate checks, it would have found that 
Mr J was showing signs he was struggling to manage his finances and was unlikely to be 
able to sustainably repay loans 5 to 7.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr J, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldn't have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Js case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
8. I say this because:Mr J had been borrowing from Sunny for over a year at the time he applied for loan 8;
Loan 7 was still outstanding and Mr Js total debt with Sunny wasnt decreasing;
Although there was a break in borrowing after loan 8, from that point onwards Mr J
was provided with a new loan more and more frequently and there were no breaks
after loan 11. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr J was
having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in
his finances and that Mr Js indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
Mr J wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 16 was
taken out almost two years after Mr Js first. And it was for twice the amount. Mr J
had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an
extended period.
I think that Mr J lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing him
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time;
the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Js
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost
loans.
So Im also upholding the complaint about loans 8 to 16 and Sunny should put things right.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Js complaint in part. Elevate Credit International Limited 
(trading as Sunny) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr J paid on loans 5 to 16;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date
of settlement*;
Write off any unpaid interest and charges for loan 16, apply the refund to reduce any
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr J;
Remove any negative information about loans 5 to 7 from Mr Js credit file;
The number of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information recorded
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 8 to 16 should be removed from Mr
Js credit file (once loan 16 has been repaid).
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If Sunny intends to
apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it must do so after deducting the
tax.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 July 2020.
