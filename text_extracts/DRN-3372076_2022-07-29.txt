The complaint
Mr S has said that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA lent to him irresponsibly. Mr S has said 
he was accepted for credit, when PayPal should have known this wouldnt be affordable for 
him. 
What happened
Mr S has explained that in December 2019 he applied for a PayPal credit account. This is an 
account with a credit limit, with the limit available to use to purchase items online. PayPal 
agreed to provide Mr S with this credit  to the value of £250. So, Mr S was able to use this 
credit to make purchases, should he wish to do so. The level of interest, if any, would be 
dependent on the type of purchase made. 
Mr S has said PayPal did the wrong thing in lending to him. He noted hed applied for credit 
through PayPal before  and been declined. On this occasion, Mr S needed to purchase a 
car part, to repair his vehicle. But Mr S has explained that at the time, he already had a high 
amount of other credit commitments, with various lenders. And these included accounts for 
which hed missed payments. Mr S said that if PayPal had completed reasonable checks 
when deciding whether to lend to him, it would have seen that lending to him was 
irresponsible, because it was unaffordable for him.
Because Mr S felt PayPal did the wrong thing in lending to him, he raised a complaint. 
PayPal responded to Mr S complaint. It said it lent to Mr S responsibly. It explained that it 
had made checks on Mr S eligibility, creditworthiness and affordability. And it had used data 
from a credit reference agency, as well as information provided by Mr S, when making its 
decision. It was satisfied with what it saw on those checks and agreed to lend to Mr S on the 
basis of these checks. So, PayPal doesnt consider that it did anything wrong.
Because Mr S was dissatisfied with PayPals position on the matter, the complaint was 
referred to this service for independent review.
Our investigator considered the complaint and didnt think it should be upheld. They said 
PayPal had completed proportionate checks, and that based on the information PayPal had, 
the lending was shown to be affordable.  
Mr S didnt agree. He said that whilst the amount of credit provided to him was low in this 
instance, PayPal still had an obligation to check it was affordable. And that PayPal should 
bear in mind that low levels of lending, with multiple lenders, could also cause problems for 
consumers, making repayments a problem.
In addition, Mr S said if PayPal had searched his credit file thoroughly, it would have seen a 
mismatch of data between the credit file, and what was on his application. 
Because Mr S didnt agree, this complaint has been referred to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint. Ive explained why below. 
Its important to highlight that when coming to my decision Ive taken into account the 
relevant law, rules and guidance in relation to concerns about irresponsible lending. And, 
Ive needed to consider the below issues:
Did PayPal complete reasonable and proportionate checks, to satisfy itself that Mr S 
would be able to make repayment of the credit in a sustainable way?
If PayPal did complete the above  was a fair decision made, in respect of whether to 
lend to Mr S?
If PayPal didnt complete the above  would reasonable and proportionate checks 
have shown Mr S would have been able to make repayments in a sustainable way?
Did PayPal act unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr S in another way?
So, Ive done this in relation to the lending PayPal provided. 
Reasonable and proportionate checks?
In December 2019, PayPal was required to carry out a reasonable assessment of whether 
Mr S could afford to make the credit repayments in a sustainable way. And when carrying 
out checks to make sure this was the case, the checks had to be borrower focused. So, this 
means PayPal had to consider the impact the lending would have on Mr S  not just how 
likely it was that PayPal would receive its money back.
As above, PayPal had to make sure the checks were proportionate to the circumstances of 
the lending. Whether a check is proportionate will depend on the circumstances of the 
lending. So, checks would include a number of things, including, but not limited to  the 
particular circumstances of the borrower (e.g their financial history, current situation and 
outlook, and any indications of vulnerability of financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of 
credit they were seeking.
So, Ive considered this in relation to the PayPal credit account agreed in December 2019. 
To do this, Ive looked at what checks PayPal completed, and what information it gathered at 
the time of lending, to see whether the checks it made were proportionate enough for PayPal 
to be confident the lending would be sustainable for Mr S. 
And having done this, Im satisfied PayPal did complete proportionate checks, before 
agreeing to lend to Mr S, in this instance.
Ive seen that PayPal gathered information from Mr S in relation to his income and 
expenditure. Mr S told PayPal his income was between £1,501 and £2,000 a month. In 
terms of expenditure, Mr S told PayPal his monthly outgoings were £500, including his 
mortgage repayments. Based on this information, and using the mid-point of Mr S declared 
salary, PayPal calculated that Mr S would still have approximately £1,250 disposable income 
a month  before repaying the £250 credit limit, if this was used. So, it was satisfied Mr S 
had enough income to pay the lending back sustainably. 
Im also aware PayPal completed affordabilty and creditworthiness checks. These checks 
used information from credit reference agencies, to determine whether a consumer had 
overextended themselves in terms of unsecured lending, as well as to score a consumers affordability. The checks showed Mr S hadnt overextended himself, and had a marginal 
score in terms of affordability, at the mid-point of the scoring system  and so wasnt 
suggestive that Mr S would have issues with affordability. 
Thinking about the above, Im satisfied PayPal did complete proportionate checks, to 
understand Mr S income and outgoings and how these might be effected by the loan he was 
applying for.
Mr S has said the details of his outgoings was incorrect. He has highlighted his exisitng 
credit commitments and mortgage, and said his total outgoings were more than £500 a 
month. But it was Mr S that provided these details to PayPal. And Im satisfied PayPal did 
enough by using the above-mentioned industry tools to satisfy itself that the credit applied for 
was affordable, in a sustainable way.
In summary, PayPal needed to complete a reasonable assessment of Mr S affordability, 
doing so in a proportionate way. And I think that given the amount of credit Mr S was 
applying for, the checks were proportionate. So, Im satisfied PayPal acted correctly here. 
Mr S has explained that whilst the lending was for a low amount, the cumulative effect of 
lending in this way, can cause difficulties in affordability. I dont disagree with Mr S. And this 
is why a lender must complete proportionate checks. But as above, Im satisfied this is what 
PayPal did. 
Was a fair decision made, in respect of whether to lend to Mr S?
As Im satisfied proportionate checks were carried out in this case, I need to decide whether, 
in light of the information gathered, a fair decision was made in agreeing to lend to Mr S. Ive 
thought carefully about this. And I think PayPal did make a fair decision, based on what 
those proportionate checks showed.
The checks completed did suggest Mr S would be left with a reasonable level of disposable 
income, after the income and expenditure checks were completed. This meaning that 
PayPal wouldnt be leaving Mr S in a position where he was struggling for funds.
Given that I dont think the checks showed any cause for concern about lending to Mr S, I 
also think it made a fair decision to lend on this occasion.
Did PayPal act unfairy or unreasonable in any other way?
Ive thought about whether PayPal acted unfairly or unreasonably in any other way. And I 
dont think it did. Im satisfied PayPal completed reasonable and proportionate checks. And 
that these checks suggested to PayPal that Mr S would be able to repay the credit, without 
being placed in undue difficulty.
My final decision
Given the above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. So, I dont require 
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to do anything more in relation to this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 August 2022.
