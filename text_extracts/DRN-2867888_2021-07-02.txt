The complaint
 Mrs L, represented by her son, complained because NewDay Ltd:
- debited £250.85 to her account in error;
- sent arrears letters and a default letter, although Mrs L had reported that she hadnt 
made the transaction; and
- didnt resolve the problem quickly or efficiently.
Mrs L was hospitalised with a suspected heart attack shortly after receiving the default letter, 
and caught covid which she believed she caught in hospital. Mrs L wants more 
compensation than NewDay offered. 
 
What happened
 On 24 August 2020, Mrs L rang NewDay with an account query, which was dealt with and 
the call ended. The next customer to speak to the agent wanted a refund of a £250.85 credit 
balance on their account. By mistake, NewDays agent debited Mrs Ls account with 
£250.85, instead of the correct customer. NewDay sent this from Mrs Ls account to the bank 
requested by the other customer.
The debit appeared on Mrs Ls 7 September monthly statement. It was the only debit, and 
her account had a nil balance apart from that. On 2 October, Mrs L rang NewDay. The 
advisor told her that the £250.85 had been sent to her bank. But Mrs L said she hadnt 
provided her bank details. The adviser said he would flag this complaint and it would be 
resolved in 6 to 8 weeks. He said it wouldnt have an impact on Mrs Ls credit file.
Mrs Ls regular monthly statement, dated 5 October, said her account had been suspended 
and requested a payment of £26.12 immediately. And on 8 October, NewDay sent Mrs L an 
arrears letter.
Mrs L rang NewDay again on 20 October. This time the adviser told Mrs L where the money 
had been sent  - it was to a different bank from the one Mrs L had always used. Mrs L 
complained again.
Mrs Ls 5 November monthly statement still showed the disputed £250.85, and asked her to 
pay £33.43.
On 24 November, Mrs L sent a recorded delivery complaint letter. She complained that shed 
been sent letters saying she owed money, and that her credit file could be affected. She said 
shed never had an account with the bank to which the payment had been made. She 
pointed out that shed paid the bill in full in July, as she always did. This was causing her 
sleepless nights, and she was in the middle of selling and buying another property, as well 
as the stress of the worldwide pandemic.  Mrs L said she wanted her NewDay account to be 
closed.
Mrs Ls December monthly statement still showed the disputed £250.85, and asked her to 
pay £52.99.
On 12 December, NewDay sent Mrs L a Default Notice. This said that if she didnt pay 
£33.43 by 2 January 2021, NewDay would close the account and require the full balance to 
be paid immediately. It could sell the account to a third party, and would sent details to credit 
reference agencies. The letter said that if NewDay took Mrs L to court and got a judgement 
against her, she might have to pay both the amount of the judgment and interest.  
Mrs L rang NewDay again on 15 December. She asked to speak to a manager, but this was 
refused. Mrs L told the adviser about the distress NewDay was causing her. She spoke 
about the default letters and pointed out that when shed first complained, shed been told 
that her credit file wouldnt be affected  which wasnt what the default letter said. The 
adviser promised a call back the next day. But it didnt happen, either on 16 December or 
later.
On 20 December, Mrs L was taken to hospital by ambulance with what at the time was 
suspected to be a heart attack. She was kept in hospital for tests at what was a particularly 
difficult time to be in hospital because of covid. Mrs L and then her husband both caught 
covid, which they believe she caught in hospital.
On 29 December, Mrs Ls family took over the complaint to NewDay. Her son wrote a 
detailed complaint setting out what had happened. He told NewDay that Mrs L wasnt to be 
contacted direct because of her health problems resulting from what had happened. 
On 30 December, NewDay sent Mrs L another arrears letter.
On 31 December, NewDay issued a final response letter to Mrs Ls complaint. It upheld the 
complaint and said an agent had made an error on 24 August. It also said this had impacted 
Mrs Ls credit file, because it had reported missed payments to the credit reference 
agencies. NewDay said it had removed the incorrect balance, and late payment fees and 
interest. It had also instructed the credit reference agencies to remove the adverse markers. 
And it said it had credited Mrs Ls account with £130 as an apology.
But on 2 January 2021, NewDay rang Mrs L at around 8.20am chasing for payment, and 
again around 10am. Mrs L told the NewDay callers that a complaint had been made  but 
was told there were no notes on her account about any complaint. NewDay rang again on 6 
January and Mrs L said they should contact her son. There isnt a record of that call, but on 
6 January, NewDay credited Mrs Ls account with a further £50 because of what had 
happened after the final response.
Mrs L wasnt satisfied with NewDays response and, represented by her son, complained to 
this service. He told us that the stress had caused Mrs L to be taken to hospital in an 
ambulance and kept in for tests at a time when it was unsafe to be in hospital because of 
covid. He said that NewDays failing could literally have killed Mrs L and her husband. Both 
had caught covid after Mrs L was admitted to hospital. Mrs Ls son said it was completely 
unacceptable that NewDay had placed a vulnerable person under so much stress that It 
caused a cardiac event to be brought on. And despite having told NewDay what had 
happened, NewDay had continued vigorously to chase Mrs L, a vulnerable person, for 
money she didnt owe. 
Mrs Ls son also provided a letter from Mrs Ls GP. This said that Mrs L had suffered 
significant stress as a result of the letters demanding payment even though shed paid her 
balance in full. The GP went on to say that the significant stress and anxiety is likely to have 
contributed to the significant chest pain that she felt in December which led to an admission 
to A&E Unfortunately following this admission Mrs L tested positive for covid which she 
assumes was contracted while in hospital. The GP also said that he had seen Mrs L in January 2021 when she was waiting for a cardiology appointment, and she was struggling 
with low mood, anxiety and difficulty sleeping. 
So Mrs Ls son asked for compensation for the damage and personal injury NewDay had 
caused her. He also asked for compensation for his own time, when hed otherwise have 
been running his own company. 
Our investigator upheld Mrs Ls complaint. She said NewDays error caused Mrs L 
unnecessary stress. It had sent multiple letters, default notices, texts and calls, which would 
have been stressful. The investigator also recognised that the credit file marker would have 
been stressful, and she said NewDay should ensure any negative information had been 
removed from Mrs Ls credit file. But the investigator said there had been no reason for 
NewDay to have treated Mrs L as a vulnerable customer before the December medical 
problem. She said that the covid situation was stressful for everyone, so she couldnt say for 
certain that the stress caused by NewDay had caused the medical problem, though it would 
have been a contributing factor. 
So the investigator thought that a total of £400 compensation would be fair and reasonable. 
As NewDay had already paid £180, this left £220 still to pay. 
NewDay agreed. But Mrs Ls son didnt agree. He said the investigators outcome was 
disgusting, and he didnt believe she could think £400 was fair and reasonable. He asked 
what the investigator thought had caused the medical attack. He said NewDay needed to be 
severely punished so it changed its processes. He said Mrs L had nearly died and NewDay 
had kept chasing her wrongfully, and would have carried on doing so if he hadnt referred the 
complaint to this service.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 I recognise that Mrs L and her son feel very strongly about what happened. Thats 
understandable, because it would have been distressing to receive monthly statements, 
arrears letters and default notice, all saying Mrs L owed money when she didnt. 
Its not disputed that the original error was made by NewDay, and that this led to the arrears 
correspondence and credit file markers. So my job is to assess how much compensation 
would be fair and reasonable for NewDay to pay Mrs L.
When assessing compensation, the aim is to compensate the consumer for the distress and 
inconvenience suffered. I recognise that Mrs Ls son has said he wants NewDay punished 
severely, so it changes its processes. But its not our role to change an organisations 
systems or process  or punish them when mistakes are made. The regulator, the Financial 
Conduct Authority, would look at wider issues like these. Instead, our role is to look at 
individual disputes impartially and decide whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances 
of a complaint.
So Ive considered the distress and inconvenience which Mrs L suffered. The original 
mistake was made by NewDay, and I consider it could and should have been put right 
relatively quickly and easily. Instead, Mrs L had to complain multiple times. And despite 
having told NewDay about the problem, it continued to send distressing correspondence 
chasing her for the money she didnt owe. I consider the impact of this would have been worse because I can see that Mrs L was someone who normally paid off what shed spent 
straightaway. Apart from the disputed amount, her balance was clear. Both the letters, and 
the impact on her credit file, would have been more distressing in these circumstances.
I find that NewDay took too long to investigate and put things right. Mrs L reported the 
problem on 2 October. Financial organisations do have eight weeks to respond to 
complaints, taking this to late November. But I consider that NewDay could reasonably have 
put a stop to the arrears correspondence while it was investigating the disputed payment. 
And in any case, in early January 2021, well after the eight weeks, and even after the final 
response letter, NewDay staff were still making arrears calls asking Mrs L to pay. This was 
despite having been asked to contact Mrs Ls son instead, because of Mrs Ls health. So I 
find that NewDay provided very poor service and failed Mrs L.
Im sorry to hear of Mrs Ls health problems from December 2020. Ive read her GP letter 
carefully, in which he states that the stress and anxiety from NewDays multiple letters is 
likely to have contributed to her significant chest pain which led to her A&E admission.
Its impossible for me accurately to assess the extent to which NewDays failings contributed 
to Mrs Ls health. But, I have taken account of the GPs letter, and balance this with the other 
factors which Mrs L raised with NewDay  that she was in the middle of selling and buying a 
property, and that the covid pandemic was a very stressful time for many people. So Ive 
taken all this into account when thinking about what fair compensation looks like here.
I note that in her November 2020 letter to NewDay, Mrs L asked to close her account. 
NewDay said in the final response letter that it had removed all charges and interest. I asked 
NewDay what the current situation is. It said the account hasnt yet been closed because 
theres a credit balance on it. Well ask Mrs L where she wants that money to be sent, and 
NewDay says the account will show as settled on Mrs Ls credit score after the balance is nil.  
NewDay confirmed in the final response letter that it had asked for adverse credit information 
to be removed from Mrs Ls name. Her son will want to check this as a precaution. But we 
dont award compensation for the time which a representative spends on a complaint.  I 
appreciate that Mrs Ls son has been distressed and inconvenienced by the upset and time 
hes spent. But we can only award compensation to the account holder  here, Mrs L. 
Taking all these factors into account, I consider that £400 would be fair and reasonable 
compensation for NewDay to pay Mrs L for the distress and inconvenience it caused her. I 
realise that will fall short of what Mrs Ls son feels is fair here, but I think this is a fair amount 
to recognise the impact of NewDays actions on Mrs L here.
   
My final decision
  My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I order NewDay Ltd to:
- pay Mrs L a total of £400 for the distress and inconvenience caused by its August 
2020 error and failures to sort this out. It has paid her £180, leaving £220 to pay; 
- provide Mrs L with evidence that her account has been closed with a nil balance, 
after it has paid her the current credit balance. It should also confirm at that point that 
the account has been marked as settled on her credit file. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 July 2021.
