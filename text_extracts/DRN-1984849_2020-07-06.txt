The complaint
Mrs E complains about how her claim on her appliance insurance was handled by Policy 
Excess Insure Ltd (PEX).
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision. Its not disputed that PEX was 
correct in declining Mrs Es claim. What is in dispute is the level of compensation she is due 
for the poor customer service she received from PEX. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
During the initial call to PEX, Mrs E made it clear that it was a priority to resolve as 
she had a young baby. This was agreed, and she was promised a call back by the 
end of the week and this didnt happen
Mrs E had to call several times in order to get an update to her claim. She was 
promised call-backs on several occasions and these did not happen
She was accused by PEX of calling them relentlessly despite only calling them back 
when they didnt respond as agreed
For the above reasons I am satisfied that £150 compensation is fair and reasonable to 
reflect the distress and inconvenience Mrs E was caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I require Policy Excess Insure Ltd to pay 
Mrs E £150 compensation for the distress and inconvenience they have caused her.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 August 2020.
