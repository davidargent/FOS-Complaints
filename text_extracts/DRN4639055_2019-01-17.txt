K820x#14complaint
Miss W has complained that esure Insurance Limited gave her incorrect  information about a 
claim she made in 2016 under her car insurance  policy. She says this led to her being 
charged a higher premium by her current insurer.  
background
In January 2016 Miss W made a claim to esure under her car insurance policy.  She renewed  
her policy with esure in December 2016.
In November 2017 Miss W decided not to renew her policy  with esure. She bought  a policy  
with another insurer  on 21 November 2017.  The start date was 3 December 2017. 
Miss Ws current insurer said it found  out that the January 2016 claim costs were not £300 
as Miss W had told it, but actually £1,657. So it said it would need  to increase Miss Ws 
premium by £117.30.
This prompted Miss W to contact esure  on 25 November 2017. It told her the claim costs for 
the 2016 claim were  correct at £1,657.32.
Miss W complained to esure as she believed the repair costs werent correct. This is being  
dealt with under a separate complaint. In the meantime she paid an additional £117.30 to 
her current  insurer on 7 December 2017.  
In December 2017 esure told Miss W the cost of the claim wouldnt affect her premium.  
However, this only applied to esures policy. 
In May 2018  Miss W provided esure with a letter from her current  insurer.  They  said that 
they increased Miss Ws premium by £117.30 due to the increase in the claim costs for the 
January 2016  claim from £300 to £1657. Miss W wanted esure to reimburse her for the 
£117.30 shed  had to pay her current insurer.
esure didnt  uphold Miss Ws complaint. It didnt accept that Miss W had to pay a higher 
premium as a result  of incorrect  information  esure  gave her  because it said she knew what 
the correct claim costs were before the policy started in December 2017.  
Miss W asked us to look at things for her. Our investigator didnt feel esure had been 
unreasonable. He said even if esure had provided incorrect  claims costs information before 
25 November 2017  from this date Miss W knew what the correct  claim costs were.  So he 
thought she had the opportunity to decide whether to take up the policy or not with her 
current insurer - as it wasnt  due to start until a week later.  He therefore  didnt think  esure 
was responsible for the increase in premium  Miss Ws current  insurer  charged her. 
Miss W didnt agree.  So the case has been passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I dont intend to uphold 
it. Ill explain why.
Ref: DRN46390552Miss W has made a separate complaint against esure about the repair  costs for this claim. In 
her email  rejecting the investigators  view, Miss W has asked the investigator to look at these 
issues as she believes her complaint has been  side tracked. She remains unhappy that she 
was previously told by esure  in March 2016 that the January  2016  claim costs were £300.
My decision  relates solely to Miss Ws complaint that esure  gave her incorrect  information 
about the 2016 claim which led her to have to pay a higher premium  to her current insurer.  
esure has provided a recording of the call it had with Miss W on 25 November 2017. In this 
call it confirmed the costs  of the January  2016  claim were £1,657.32. So even  if esure told 
Miss W previously that the claim  costs were £300,  I think Miss W was aware of the correct 
claim costs  on 25 November  2017.  As her policy with her new insurer hadnt  yet started, she 
couldve cancelled her policy and looked  for a more competitively priced policy elsewhere. 
So I dont  think esure is responsible for any increase in premium  Miss Ws current insurer 
asked her to pay. 
I appreciate Miss W will be disappointed  with my decision. But based on what  Ive seen, I 
think esure dealt with her complaint reasonably. So Im not asking  it to do any more.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given above,  my final decision is that I dont uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 February  2019.
