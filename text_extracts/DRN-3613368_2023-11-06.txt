The complaint
Mr F complains that Diamond Resorts Financial Services Limited has rejected the claims 
that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. His wife is also involved in his 
complaint and hes being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr F and his wife entered into a purchase agreement in November 2013 to buy 7,000 
holiday club membership points rights from a holiday company. The total price payable for 
the points rights was £8,750, Mr F entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Diamond 
Resorts Financial Services for an interest free loan of £7,000 and the balance of £1,750 was 
paid by other means. Mr F agreed to make 36 monthly repayments of £194.44 to Diamond 
Resorts Financial Services and the loan was repaid in January 2017.
Mr Fs representative, on behalf of Mr F, made claims to Diamond Resorts Financial 
Services in December 2021 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It 
said that the holiday company was in breach of contract, Diamond Resorts Financial 
Services was liable for procuring a breach of fiduciary duty and the purchase agreement and 
the loan agreement are unfair. It also said that the points rights were misrepresented to Mr F 
and his wife, the holiday company was in breach of the EU timeshare directive and Diamond 
Resorts Financial Services failed to carry out a sound and proper credit assessment.
Diamond Resorts Financial Services said that Mr F was statute barred from bringing a claim 
for misrepresentation in respect of the purchase and the limitation period for a complaint to 
this service was six years from the date of entering into the contract. Mr F wasnt satisfied 
with its response so a complaint was made to this service. 
Mr Fs complaint form says that: the holiday company and Diamond Resorts Financial 
Services failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan; Diamond 
Resorts Financial Services paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared 
to him; and the holiday company unduly pressured him and his wife into entering into the 
purchase agreement and him into entering into the loan agreement; all rendering the loan 
agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Fs complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Mr F was outside of the time limits in the Limitation Act 1980 for a misrepresentation claim 
and he didnt think that his breach of contract claim was raised in time. He said that he 
hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr F and Diamond Resorts 
Financial Services was unfair and he wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the 
conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He also said that he hadnt seen anything 
persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr F.
Mr Fs representative, on behalf of Mr F, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has provided a generic submission from a legal counsel about the holiday 
company and the unfair terms that it uses, it has raised concerns about the way that the 
finance was sold to Mr F and says that the holiday company didnt broker proper credit and 
failed to meet the standard of a regulated firm. It has also provided the reasons that it 
considers that theres been a fundamental breach of contract.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Fs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Fs complaint is that Diamond Resorts Financial Services turned down the claims 
that hed made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within 
six years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies 
to his claims;
Mr Fs claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Diamond Resorts Financial Services response to those 
claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Fs claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company and that the points rights were misrepresented to him and his wife and that 
they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Diamond Resorts Financial 
Services would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be 
entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr F could have made a claim to the holiday company or Diamond 
Resorts Financial Services about the misrepresentations that he says induced him 
and his wife into buying the points rights in November 2013 as that was the latest 
time that any misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have 
been incurred as that was when he also entered into the loan agreement with 
Diamond Resorts Financial Services;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Diamond Resorts Financial Services  but a misrepresentation claim 
wasnt made to Diamond Resorts Financial Services until December 2021, more than 
eight years later so was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act and I 
consider that Diamond Resorts Financial Services has a defence to Mr Fs misrepresentation claim and I find that it wasnt unreasonable for it to have rejected 
that claim;
Mr Fs representative has also referred to breaches of contract by the holiday 
company and the time limit for a breach of contract claim in these circumstances is 
also six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued;
I consider that the alleged breaches of contract occurred when Mr F and his wife 
entered into the purchase agreement and other documents in November 2013 so 
Mr F would have had six years from then to bring a breach of contract claim against 
either the holiday company or Diamond Resorts Financial Services  but a breach of 
contract claim wasnt made to Diamond Resorts Financial Services until December 
2021, more than eight years later so was outside of the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act - and I consider that Diamond Resorts Financial Services has a 
defence to Mr Fs breach of contract claim and I find that it wouldnt have been 
unreasonable for it to have rejected that claim;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any other 
breach of contract by the holiday company for which Diamond Resorts Financial 
Services would now be liable under section 75;
Mr Fs complaint form says the holiday company and Diamond Resorts Financial 
Services failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan, 
Diamond Resorts Financial Services paid a commission to the holiday company 
which wasnt declared to him and the holiday company unduly pressured him and his 
wife into entering into the purchase agreement and him into entering into the loan 
agreement, all of which rendered the loan agreement unfair pursuant to section 
140A; 
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Diamond Resorts Financial Services has provided evidence to show that the loan 
was settled in January 2017 and Mr Fs claim under section 140A was made to 
Diamond Resorts Financial Services by his representative in December 2021, less 
than four years after the credit agreement ended, so I dont consider that Mr Fs claim 
under section 140A is time-barred;
Diamond Resorts Financial Services has provided a copy of the loan application that 
was made by Mr F before the loan was made to him in November 2013 which shows 
that he was an employed home-owner with a net monthly income of £5,000 and he 
also provided it with a copy of his invoice for his services in October 2013 for 
£4,954.40  and it also obtained a credit report on Mr F;
it says that income and outgoings were input into an affordability calculator which 
assesses monthly net disposable income and there was nothing in the information 
that it obtained at the time which would have suggested that the loan was unsuitable 
for Mr F;
Mr F was able to make the loan repayments and the loan was repaid on schedule but 
Ive seen no evidence to show that he complained to the holiday company or 
Diamond Resorts Financial Services that a proper assessment of his ability to afford 
the loan hadnt been conducted until his representatives letter to Diamond Resorts Financial Services in December 2021  more than eight years after the loan was 
made to him and nearly five years after it had been repaid;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that a loan of £7,000 with a 
monthly repayment of £194.44 wasnt affordable for Mr F in November 2013 when it 
was made to him, that Diamond Resorts Financial Services failed to carry out a 
sound and proper credit assessment or that it should have done more to assess the 
affordability of the loan for him, that the loan was mis-sold to him or that it has acted 
incorrectly in connection with the loan;
Mr Fs complaint form says that Diamond Resorts Financial Services paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to him but Diamond 
Resorts Financial Services says that both it and the holiday company are part of the 
same group of companies and that no commission was ever paid by it to the holiday 
company;
neither Mr F nor his representative has provided any evidence to show that Diamond 
Resorts Financial Services paid a commission to the holiday company and Ive seen 
no evidence to show that Mr F complained to Diamond Resorts Financial Services 
about any commission until his representatives letter to it in December 2021  more 
than eight years after the loan was made to him - so Im not persuaded that theres 
been a breach of any fiduciary duty;
Mr Fs complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured him and his 
wife into entering into the purchase agreement and him into entering into the loan 
agreement but Mr F and his wife had signed in November 2013 the separate 
standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given to withdraw from the 
purchase agreement with 14 days without giving any reason;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr F and his wife contacted either the holiday 
company or Diamond Resorts Financial Services to withdraw from the purchase 
agreement within the withdrawal period and, if theyd been unreasonably pressured 
into entering into that agreement and didnt want to buy the points rights, I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect them to have exercised their right to withdraw 
from the agreement;
the loan agreement said that Mr F had the right to withdraw from the loan agreement 
within 14 days without having to give any reason but its clear that Mr F didnt 
withdraw from the loan agreement;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr F complained to Diamond Resorts Financial 
Services that he and his wife were unduly pressured into entering into the purchase 
agreement or that he was unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement 
until his representatives letter to it in December 2021  more than eight years after 
the loan was made to him;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr F and his wife were 
unduly pressured into buying the points rights in November 2013, that Mr F was 
unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mr Fs representative has provided a generic submission from a legal counsel about 
the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in the agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr F and his wife and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr F and Diamond 
Resorts Financial Services  and nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that theres been a breach of the EU timeshare directive;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Fs relationship with 
Diamond Resorts Financial Services was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that 
a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr F and 
Diamond Resorts Financial Services in these circumstances;
Diamond Resorts Financial Services said that Mr F was statute barred from bringing 
a claim for misrepresentation in respect of the purchase and the limitation period for 
a claim to this service was six years from the date of entering into the contract - I 
consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it to have said that his claims 
under section 75 were statute barred but I consider that it should have considered his 
claim under section 140A - so I cant say that its response to his claims was fair and 
reasonable but, if it had properly responded to his claim under section 140A, I 
consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it not to have upheld it; and
I sympathise with Mr F for the issues that he and his wife have had with their points 
rights, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require Diamond Resorts Financial Services to refund to Mr F any of the money that 
he paid under the loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 December 2023.
