K822xcomplaint
Mr L complains  that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has sent copies  of his loan agreement to his old address. Hes being helped with 
his complaint by his mother.
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
after his loan agreement had been  repaid in December 2018, Mr L contacted 
Barclays Partner Finance  in March 2019  and asked it for a copy of the agreement  
and updated his address  but it sent the agreement to his old address;
he contacted  it again, by phone  and letter, and the agreement  was resent to him - but 
he didnt receive  it so complained to Barclays Partner Finance;
hes now received  the agreement  and contacted  the occupants  of his old address 
who had received four letters for Mr L and had opened two of them;
Barclays Partner Finance acknowledges  that between March  and May 2019 copies 
of the agreement were sent to Mr L using his old address  when it was aware of his 
new address  it has apologised for that and offered  him £100  as a gesture  of 
goodwill;
Mr Ls mother says that shes deeply  concerned that the letters disclosed Mr Ls 
signature and bank account  details   but theres no evidence to show that those 
details have been fraudulently used or that hes suffered a financial loss as a result of 
those details being sent to his old address;
she says that Mr L will be contacting the Information Commissioners Office about  
this data breach  and that, due to the seriousness of it, Barclays  Partner Finance 
should pay £100 compensation for each time that it sent a letter to his old address  
which would be £500 in total;
these events have  clearly caused  distress  and inconvenience to Mr L but I consider 
that the £150 compensation  that was recommended by the investigator  and which 
has been accepted by Barclays Partner Finance  is fair and reasonable 
compensation for that distress  and inconvenience; and
Im not persuaded that a higher amount  of compensation is justified in these 
circumstances  or that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays  
Partner Finance  to pay to Mr L the £500 compensation that his mother has claimed.
 
my final decision
Ref: DRN50406262For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Ls complaint and I order Clydesdale  
Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner Finance, to pay him £150 to 
compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes been  caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 May 2020.
