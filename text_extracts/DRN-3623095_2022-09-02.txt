The complaint
Ms S complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) compromised her personal 
details.
What happened
Ms S was in contact with PayPal and spoke to one of its advisors. Following this 
conversation, Ms S began to get suspicious, or spam emails, apparently from PayPal.
Ms S thinks PayPal leaked her details. Ms S raised the issue with PayPal as well as 
forwarding the emails to PayPals specific email address for spam emails.
PayPal responded to this service to say Ms S data hadnt been breached, and it had sent 
two of the emails Ms S had received.
An investigator at this service looked into things and didnt think PayPal was responsible for 
the spam messages Ms S received. But the investigator thought PayPal should have been 
clearer about the emails it had sent. And, PayPal hadnt responded to Ms S complaint.
The investigator thought Ms S should be paid £50 for the poor service shed received from 
PayPal. PayPal agreed but Ms S explained how stressful things had been and felt £150 was 
a fairer amount for PayPal to pay.
The investigator didnt change their mind, they still felt £50 was a fair offer and Ms S asked 
for an ombudsman to decide things.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked very carefully at what Ms S has sent this service. Its clear Ms S is receiving a lot 
of emails that appear to be coming from PayPal but arent. Ms S has said she never clicks 
on links in emails and can only think PayPal has compromised her email address.
Ms S says she spoke to someone at PayPal and then received a spam email. Ms S thought 
it was spam because the reference was different to her other emails with PayPal. PayPal 
has confirmed it sent the email and the reference was different.
The shorter reference on the email matches the reference for Ms S subsequent final 
response, so Im satisfied PayPal sent the email to Ms S. This seems to be the email Ms S 
thinks compromised her email address, but I dont think it did.
A further email, about a data request, was also confirmed by PayPal as one it sent. Im 
satisfied PayPal sent both these emails, and Im satisfied Ms S has received other emails 
from other email addresses that werent sent by PayPal.
I dont think PayPal compromised Ms S email address. PayPal says it carried out a review 
and couldnt see any data breaches, and Im inclined to agree. The email Ms S thinks was a 
spam email is from PayPal  so I dont think a breach occurred there.
And as frustrating as spam emails are, lots of people receive them and its often not very 
clear how someone else could have obtained the email address. But, overall, Im satisfied 
PayPal didnt do anything to compromise Ms S email address.
Ms S said it took her a lot of time to find all the spam emails shed been sent, and this was 
very inconvenient. Ms S says shes been very stressed because of the number of spam 
emails shes received.
It must be very frustrating and upsetting to receive these emails. And PayPal could have 
done more to explain which emails it had sent, and this may have taken away some of Ms S 
frustrations. But I cant hold PayPal responsible for the spam emails Ms S has received.
And finding all the spam emails helped PayPal, and Ms S, to know which ones it had sent 
and which ones it hadnt. I dont think Ms S was put to any extra inconvenience as the emails 
were needed to resolve her complaint.
PayPal should have responded to Ms S about the emails. It had considered other things in 
its final response but didnt address that specific point. If it had, I think it would have gone 
some way to reduce Ms S frustrations.
Putting things right
PayPal has already paid Ms S £50 to compensate her for this lack of response, and I think 
this is a fair offer in the circumstances.
My final decision
My final decision is I uphold Ms S complaint. But I think the £50 PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA has already paid is enough to compensate Ms S, so Im not asking it to do more to 
resolve this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 September 2022.
