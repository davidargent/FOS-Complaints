K821x#15complaint
Mr O complains that Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118, refused to accept his 
cancellation of the loan that he took with them. They then charged him interest.  
Mr O would like the interest that he paid refunded.  
background
Mr O approached 118 to take out a loan for £3,500. On 15 March  2018, he electronically 
signed an agreement  online  for the loan. 
118 tried calling Mr O a number of times on 15 March 2018. They also sent an email to him 
asking him to call to finalise the loan. 
On 16 March 2018, Mr O called 118. He was asked further questions. He was told what  
payments he would be expected to make over the course of the loan and asked if he would 
like to continue with it. He was also told that he could cancel the agreement within 14 days, if 
he wanted to. Mr O said he wanted to take the loan. The £3,500 was paid that day. 
On 30 March 2018, Mr O called 118 to say that he wanted to cancel his agreement.  He was 
told that his 14 day cooling  off period had ended the day before. He was charged  interest.  
Mr O complained saying  that he had taken the loan out on 16 March 2018 so the cooling off 
period didnt end until 30 March 2018.  
118 disagreed saying that the loan had been taken out on 15 March 2018 when Mr O had 
signed the agreement.  So, the cooling off period ended on 29 March 2018.  
Mr O came to us. Our investigator found  that the loan had started  on 16 March  2018. So, he 
thought that 118 should refund Mr O the interest  that he had been charged and also pay him 
8% interest on this amount from the date that it had been charged.  
118 wasnt happy  with this decision.  They stated that 
Mr O had signed the agreement on 15 March 2018. 
The call on 16 March 2018  wasnt necessary. It was an extra  step that they took to 
ensure that the customer was happy  with the terms of the agreement.
It was irrelevant that the £3,500  was paid a day after the loan was agreed on 15 
March 2018. Some lenders  took longer to pay monies once a loan was agreed.  
Our investigator found that these points  didnt persuade him to change  his decision. 118 
wasnt happy with this. So, the complaint has now come to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im afraid 118 wont be happy  with my decision. I think  that they should refund to Mr O the 
interest that he has paid plus add 8% interest to this amount. I will explain why. 
Ref: DRN52903152I have looked  at the agreement that Mr O electronically signed.  It clearly  states that the right 
to withdraw starts on the date that the agreement is made and ends 14 days later.  I can see 
why 118 think that the agreement was made when Mr O signed  the agreement. But, I dont 
agree. Like our investigator, I think that the call on 16 March 2018 wouldve led Mr O to 
believe that the agreement started  then. 
The email  that 118 sent to Mr O on 15 March 2018, stated that the loan agreement  was 
almost complete. I think that this does suggest that the agreement  hadnt then been made 
on 15 March 2018. 
Also, during  the telephone call on 16 March 2018,  there are many  things which  suggest that 
the agreement  was being made at that point. For example, Mr O was told that he would have 
a 14 day cooling off period. He wasnt  told that it had started the day before. 
So, I think that it was unclear  to Mr O when the 14 day period started. I think that he 
reasonably concluded that it started on 16 March  2018. I agree  with Mr O. So, when he 
cancelled the agreement on 30 March 2018, I dont think that he shouldve been  charged 
interest as this was within the 14 day cooling off period.  
my final decision
I think that the 14 day cooling off period for the loan that Mr O took out ended  on 30 March 
2018. So, because  he cancelled the loan within this period, I dont think he shouldve been 
charged interest. I think that Madison CF UK Limited should refund Mr O the interest  paid 
amounting to £204.26 plus pay him 8% simple  interest on this amount from the date that 
Mr O paid it up until the date that Madison CF UK Limited make the payment. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 May 2019.
