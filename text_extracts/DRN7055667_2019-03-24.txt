K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains that MMP Financial Limited (trading as Swift  Sterling)  didnt carry out 
enough checks before  approving his loans.
background
Mr W had four loans from Swift  Sterling between February 2017 and September  2017  as 
follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Due Max payment Repaid
1 18 Feb 2017 £250 3m 12 May 2017 £122.10 22 Apr 2017
2 23 Jun 2017 £400 2m 18 Aug 2017 £489.60 21 Jul 2017
3 25 Sep 2017 £225 3m 15 Dec 2017 £151.57 3 Oct 2017
4 25 Sep 2017 £225 3m 15 Dec 2017 £303.14* 3 Oct 2017
* Total payment  due on loans 3 and 4
Mr W says Swift Sterling  should have seen  there  were no gaps in his borrowing and better 
checks would have  shown  multiple loans with other  companies. He says he was using one 
loan to repay another and this would have shown on his credit  report  if Swift Sterling had 
done the correct checks. He says he was trapped in financial difficulty.
Swift Sterling says it asked for information about Mr Ws income and expenditure and 
checked his credit file before approving each loan. It said the credit checks  showed no 
evidence of debt problems and it considered all the loans were affordable. It added that 
there were gaps between  the loans and that all were repaid early. Swift  Sterling says Mr W 
requested the closure of his account on 3 October  2017 and it remained closed despite his 
request to reactivate it two weeks later.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld in part. She was satisfied 
Swift Sterling did enough  checks before approving the first two loans, but considered it 
should have asked Mr W whether he had any other short-term loans before approving loans 
3 and 4. She found that, had it done  so, its likely Swift Sterling would have seen Mr W owed 
over £2,500 to other short-term loan providers  and, therefore, would have found loans 3 and 
4 to be unaffordable. She recommended Swift Sterling should refund interest and charges 
on loans 3 and 4 (plus 8% statutory interest) and remove any associated negative  
information from his credit file.
Swift Sterling responded to say, in summary,  that Mr Ws borrowing pattern did not indicate 
financial difficulty and, as he said he lived at home  with his parents, his monthly expenditure 
seemed reasonable. It added that its credit checks did not reveal such  a high level of 
commitment to other loans.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr W 
and to Swift  Sterling on 26 February 2019.  I summarise my findings:
I was satisfied Swift Sterling did enough  checks for loans 1, 2 and 3 based on Mr Ws 
income, his borrowing  history and the required repayments;
Based  on the information from Swift  Sterlings  checks, I considered it would have 
found loans 1, 2 and 3 to be affordable and did nothing wrong by approving them.
Ref: DRN70556672I did not find the checks carried out for loan 4 went far enough given loan 3 was still 
outstanding and this was Mr Ws fourth loan in quick succession;
I considered a proportionate check should have included asking Mr W whether he 
had any other short-term loans;
Had Swift Sterling carried out such checks, its likely it would have found Mr W 
needed to make  repayments  to three  other short-term lenders in the month following 
loan 4. These payments came to around £700;
As Mr W said his disposable income was just over £1,000, I thought  it likely Swift 
Sterling would have  found loan 4 to be unaffordable had it done  better  checks.
Subject to any further representations by Mr W or Swift Sterling, my provisional decision was 
that Swift  Sterling should refund interest and charges on loan 4 (plus 8% statutory interest) 
and remove any associated negative  information from his credit  file.
Mr W responded to say that he accepted  the provisional decision.
Swift Sterling responded to say, in summary,  that Mr W repaid all his loans early which 
minimised the cost of the loans. It questioned  the discrepancy between the adjudicators  
figure of £2,500 for outstanding short-term loans and the £700 quoted in the provisional 
decision. Swift Sterling  also said only £90 was due to be repaid on loans  3 and 4 in October 
2017.
Swift Sterling further explained that Mr Ws fourth  loan would have been treated as a top-up 
loan and, therefore, uses the results  of any checks carried out for loan 3. It says this would 
be similar to if he had requested a single loan for £450. It adds that the combined payments 
for loans  3 and 4 was less than that required for loan 2, and his disposable income  was 
lower for loan 2.
Finally, Swift Sterling says it specifically  asked Mr W for his other expenditure on loans  and it 
was entitled to rely on the £250  he declared.  It said Mr Ws borrowing pattern did not indicate 
further checks were required and, due to the early repayment, Mr Ws interest payment for 
loans 3 and 4 would not have caused  him an undue financial burden.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I will consider  each  of Swift  Sterlings  further points in turn:
I accept Mr W repaid  all his loans early, but at the point the lending  decision was 
made, Swift Sterling  needed to take into account  the scheduled repayments which 
included the full interest to be charged;
Although the adjudicator quoted a figure of over £2,500 for outstanding short-term  
loans, this did not identify the proportion that was due to be repaid  at the same time 
as the Swift Sterling  loan. The £700 is that figure;
I accept that the first repayment on loans 3 and 4 combined  was £90, but in mid-
November 2017, Mr W was scheduled  to make a total payment of £303.14;
Even though  Swift Sterling explained its policy on top-up loans, I dont agree that no 
further checks should be carried out when  the repayment due doubles. Indeed, had 
Mr W requested  £450 at the time of loan 3, I still consider a proportionate  check  at 
that stage should  have included  asking Mr W about  other  short-term  loans;
Ref: DRN70556673I acknowledge that Mr Ws repayment on loan 2 was higher than loans 3 and 4 
combined, but at that stage hed only had one previous loan from Swift Sterling which 
hed repaid early. I find Swift Sterlings checks were proportionate  at the time;
Im not satisfied that Swift Sterling  specifically mentioned short-term loans when it 
asked for monthly expenditure,  so I cannot  agree  that the figure Mr W declared for 
loans should be considered to include those repayments;
I accept the early repayment of loans 3 and 4 meant the interest  he paid wouldnt 
have caused an undue financial burden, but Swift Sterling would not have known that 
at the time it approved the loans.
In summary,  I have considered all the additional  information provided by Swift Sterling, but I 
see no reason to depart from my provisional  decision.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. MMP Financial Limited (trading as Swift 
Sterling) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr W paid on loan 4;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loan 4 from Mr Ws credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Swift Sterling to take off tax from this interest. Swift 
Sterling must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2019.
