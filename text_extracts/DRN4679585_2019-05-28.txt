Mr M says CashEuroNet UK LLC (CEN), trading as QuickQuid (QQ)  and PoundstoPocket 
(PtP) lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  my provisional  decision on 17 May 2019. A copy of it is attached and it 
forms part of this final decision. I asked Mr M and CEN  to let me know if they had anything  to 
add.
Mr M accepted my provisional decision.  CEN said it didnt agree it had lent irresponsibly  but 
it didnt provide any new information  for me to consider.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mr M accepted my provisional  decision and as CEN didnt provide any new information or 
make any new points,  I see no reason  to depart  from my provisional findings. So my final 
decision is the same as my provisional  decision, for the same reasons.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ms complaint in part. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out in my provisional  decision.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 June  2019.

complaint
Mr M says CashEuroNet UK LLC (CEN), trading as QuickQuid (QQ) and PoundstoPocket (PtP)  
lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr M had ten loans with CEN. Ive set out some  of the information CEN provided about  the loans  in 
the appendix to this decision.
An adjudicator considered Mr Ms complaint and recommended it be upheld in part. She didnt think  
CEN was right to have approved the top-up on loan 4 (loan 4a in my table) or any of the subsequent  
loans. CEN didnt fully agree with the adjudicator. But it did agree to refund the interest and charges  
associated with loans 6 and 7.
Separately, CEN also decided to write off the balance of loan 10. As Mr M had repaid less than he 
borrowed when loan 10 was written off, he hasnt lost out even  if the loan wasnt lent responsibly.  He 
effectively hasnt paid any interest on that loan and so Im not considering  loan 10 in my decision. Ill 
only therefore  be looking at loans 1-9.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
CEN needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice this means 
that it should  have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M could  repay the loans in a 
sustainable manner. These checks could take into account  a number of different things,  such as how 
much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CEN  should fairly  and reasonably  have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include: 
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that CEN was required to establish  whether  Mr M 
could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.  
Ref: DRN46795853Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being  without undue  
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting  
other reasonable  commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. And it 
follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont 
be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments 
without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
From the evidence  Ive seen, I think its unlikely proportionate  checks  wouldve suggested loans 1-5 
were unaffordable. Loans 1-3 and loan 5 were  relatively small when compared to Mr Ms income. And 
so I dont consider the sort of proportionate checks  CEN did or ought to have carried out wouldve  
likely suggested they were unaffordable.
Loan 4 was larger (£400-£450)  than the other loans  provided during this period.  But even  a thorough 
check of Mr Ms expenditure  wouldnt in my view have suggested  the loan was unaffordable. From  
what Ive seen, a great deal of Mr Ms expenditure was by way of cash  and I think its unlikely  that a 
proportionate check, during  this period of the lending, wouldve established how much Mr M spent by 
way of cash  withdrawals.  
Im not therefore planning to uphold  the complaint  about loans 1-5.
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of CENs  lending  history with Mr M, with a view to seeing  if there 
was a point at which  CEN  should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful.  And so CEN should  have  realised  that it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ms case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
up until loan 6 and then onwards Mr M was provided with new loans  only shortly after settling 
previous loans. So CEN  ought to have  realised  it was more  likely  than not Mr M was having to 
borrow further  to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Ms indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed CEN. The amounts hed been 
borrowing increased up until loan 6 and then didnt  clearly  decrease going  forwards. There  
continued to only be short  gaps between the loans. So Mr M had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service  a debt to CEN over an extended  period.
I think  that Mr M lost out because CEN continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time
the number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ms ability  to access  
mainstream credit  and so kept him in the market for these high-cost  loans.
So Im planning to uphold the complaint  about loans 6-9 and CEN should put things right.
In reaching my provisional conclusions,  Ive taken into account the points CEN made in response to 
the adjudicator.  As Ive explained above, I dont think the only question  its appropriate  to ask is 
whether the loans are affordable on the basis of a pounds and pence calculation.  I acknowledge that 
CENs estimate of Mr Ms disposable income was high and suggested the loans were affordable. But 
as the adjudicator pointed out, if Mr Ms disposable income was as high as it was estimating, then it 
Ref: DRN46795854would be very unusual for Mr M to be borrowing as frequently as he was  particularly when looking at 
some of the smaller  loans.  
So I still consider the pattern  of lending  ought to have alerted  CEN to a likely underlying problem  with 
Mr Ms finances. Ive seen proof (in the form of bank statements) of Mr Ms expenditure and have 
seen that he was often withdrawing large amounts of cash each month and appears to have  been 
topping up his income using payday loans from several  lenders.  Its unlikely the sort of checks  CEN 
carried out wouldve identified this  but proportionate checks, such  as asking Mr M for proof of his 
income and expenditure  from loan 6 onwards  likely would have.
putting things  right  what CEN needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  6 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  loans 6 to 9 should  be removed  from Mr Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires CEN to take off tax from this interest. CEN must  give Mr M a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
I plan to uphold this complaint in part and to tell CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.

A number  of Mr Ms loans  were topped up (denoted above where the loan no. also has a letter). This 
means he borrowed  extra  funds during the course of the loan agreement. This sometimes extended 
the length  of the loan agreement,  or meant the loans  were refinanced  into a new agreement.
