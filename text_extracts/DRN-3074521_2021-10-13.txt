The complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) didnt provide its Pay In 3 
payment plan.
What happened
On 25 March 2021, Mr M tried to buy a jumper from an online retailer for £204.95. He was 
offered PayPals Pay in 3 payment plan. A hold for £68.32 was placed on his debit card. On 
26 March 2021, the transaction was voided, and PayPal released the hold on Mr Ms bank 
account.
Mr M complained. He couldnt buy the jumper because the Pay in 3 failed  and he didnt 
have the money available in his bank account either because of the hold on it placed by 
PayPal. Later in our investigation, he said that he didnt believe the Pay in 3 product was 
actually offered by the retailer, and therefore PayPal were at fault in advertising it.
PayPal explained that Pay in 3 works like this. They place a pre-authorisation on the card 
used for one-third of the total purchase amount. This was shown on 25 March 2021 as a 
pending authorisation in PayPals account and at Mr Ms bank  for £68.32. Once the 
purchase had been completed with Pay in 3, the pending authorisation is removed and the 
payment taken from Mr Ms bank card. If the Pay in 3 transaction hasnt been completed, the 
pending authorisation will be voided by PayPal within 72 hours. In Mr Ms case, they said 
that the transaction was voided because Mr M didnt accept the terms and conditions of the 
loan  which must be accepted to go ahead. So  everything was cancelled  on 26 March 
2021. PayPal then advised Mr Ms bank to release the hold on his bank account  but they 
couldnt control how long his bank would take to do that.
Mr M brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said that PayPal had shown that the 
terms and conditions hadnt been accepted. And therefore, the transaction had been 
cancelled. And PayPal did that within 24 hours  ahead of its standard time of 72 hours. So 
 he didnt think that PayPal did anything wrong.
Mr M asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate that this experience must have been frustrating for Mr M  as it meant that 
he couldnt buy the jumper he wanted to from the online retailer.
Ive looked at what happened. And  it does appear that Mr M didnt accept the terms and 
conditions of the Pay In 3 loan he was offered. And so  PayPal cancelled the payment 
process. But before that - on 25 March 2021  there were holds place on his PayPal 
account and on his bank account for £68.32. Thats standard procedure for payments like 
this. But Ive seen that PayPal cancelled the holds the next day  on 26 March 2021 and told 
Mr Ms bank to release also their hold on his account. I dont know how long Mr Ms bank 
took to do that  thats down to them.
But  as far as PayPal were concerned  and they are the subject of Mr Ms complaint  they 
couldnt go ahead with the Pay in 3 loan as Mr M hadnt accepted the terms and conditions. 
Its not clear if Mr M declined to accept them, or if they didnt show up in the Pay in 3 
application process. Mr M argues it was the latter. But in any case, PayPal reversed the 
holds within 24 hours  which I think was reasonable. It did mean that Mr M didnt have the 
money (£68.32) to spend until his bank released their hold. But  how long Mr Ms bank took 
to do that is down to them. I note that Mr M hasnt told us how long his bank took to release 
the money.
During our investigation, Mr M argued that hed spoken to the retailer and they said that the 
Pay In 3 service wasnt offered by them at the time. We asked PayPal about this. They said 
the offer of the product was down to PayPal, not the retailer  as it was offered on a 
customer by customer basis, subject to status. And so  the retailer couldnt be correct in 
what they said. In any case, we cant consider the evidence of the third party retailer as 
theyre not party to Mr Ms complaint.
Mr M was without the money for a short period  depending on how long his bank took to 
release their hold. But  he didnt go ahead with the Pay in 3 loan  because he didnt accept 
the terms and conditions. It follows that I dont think PayPal were at fault here. And so  I 
wont be asking them to do anymore.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 November 2021.
