K820x#14complaint
Mr D complains that NewDay Ltd didnt help him when he told them about his financial 
difficulties. Hes also unhappy  with the charges applied to his credit card account.  
background
Mr D has a credit card issued by NewDay.
Mr D says he got into financial difficulties  when his work contract came to an end. He 
contacted NewDay  online to let them know hed got into difficulties and asked them  to call 
him back.  He says NewDay didnt call back, and that he couldnt call them  as he was having  
problems with his mobile provider. Mr D says NewDay added charges to his account taking 
him over his credit limit leading to further  charges. Mr D complained to NewDay  about this.
NewDay looked into Mr Ds complaint but didnt  uphold it. NewDay said that it had tried to 
contact him on several occasions and had written  to him too, but he hadnt called back  to set 
up a payment plan.  So NewDay said it had got a debt collector involved, and that hed need 
to set up a repayment  plan with them. NewDay also said that it had applied the charges it did 
to Mr Ds account in line with its terms and conditions. So it didnt agree that theyd been 
applied unfairly.  Mr D disagreed and complained  to us.
Our investigator said that she didnt think NewDay acted unfairly as it tried to contact Mr D 
after he told it about his difficulties. She felt that there was more that Mr D could have  done  
to contact NewDay. Our investigator also said that NewDay  applied  all charges and fees in 
line with its terms and conditions. Mr D disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  decision.  
NewDay subsequently told us that even  though  its collections notes mentioned  arranging  to 
call Mr D, it didnt  look like it had called Mr D. Instead NewDay wrote asking him to call.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr D got into financial  difficulties when  his work  contract came to an end. He contacted 
NewDay to let them know about this. Thats exactly what wed expect a consumer who gets 
into financial  difficulties to do. Having done  so, Mr D was entitled to expect NewDay to treat 
him positively and sympathetically. In this case,  I dont  think NewDay did. Ill explain why.
NewDay got his credit card at the end of 2017 and was given a £300  credit.  Hed just started 
a job which  he thought would be a long term one. He spent just over £290 on his card in 
December 2017  meaning he was almost  at his limit. NewDay sent him a statement at the 
beginning of January 2018  asking for a minimum payment of £5. As Mr D had set up a direct 
debit to pay the minimum payment each month, thats what  he paid. Having done so, he 
spent just over £10 more  on his card  taking him within 3p of his limit. That suggests to me 
that Mr D was aware of his limit and was taking  care not to go over it. He appears,  however, 
to have overlooked  the fact that hed have to pay approximately £15 in interest if he didnt 
clear his outstanding  balance.  NewDay applied  this interest to Mr Ds account  at the 
beginning of February 2018  meaning  it went over its limit and a £12 charge was applied. 
NewDay applied a second £12 over limit fee on 19 February 2018 and asked Mr D to make 
a minimum payment of just over £30. His direct  debit  was returned unpaid  and, as a result, 
Ref: DRN95270402NewDay applied two further £12 fees  one for the returned direct debit and one for late 
payment. Mr Ds balance had gone  up from just under £300 to just over £370 at this stage.
Mr D emailed NewDay at the beginning of March 2018 to say that his work contract had 
come to an end far sooner than hed thought  it would  and that he was having problems 
keeping up with his bills. He also apologised for having missed a payment. He asked 
NewDay to call him twice. A week later he emailed NewDay to complain that the charges it 
had applied  had taken him over his limit. I can understand  why Mr D was unhappy.  Hed paid 
the minimum payment  NewDay  had asked him for in January 2018, had been careful not to 
go over his limit and had ended up getting charged. It wasnt  unreasonable of Mr D to expect 
hed not be charged if he made the minimum payment   thats  the point of them, if paid the 
balance should  go down (albeit slowly). NewDay and Mr D should have spoken about  what  
help Mr D needed in light of his difficulties. However,  instead of calling Mr D, as NewDay 
originally told our investigator it had done, NewDay wrote to Mr D asking him to call them.  
He couldnt do so as his mobile provider had blocked him from making calls because  he had 
a problem with them  something Mr D says he let NewDay know about. In short, I agree 
with Mr D that NewDay didnt help when  as wed expect  he let them know  he had got into 
financial difficulties. He ought to have been treated positively and sympathetically.
Instead of calling Mr D to see what it could do to help him, NewDay  applied further charges 
to Mr Ds account  as a result of which the balance  increased to just over £450 by May 
2018. I dont think  this was fair. So Im going to require NewDay to remove  all of the charges 
and interest it applied to Mr Ds account  from February 2018 onwards. Mr D and NewDay  
will have to agree  an affordable  repayment  plan for the outstanding balance.
my final decision
My final decision is that I require NewDay Ltd to remove all of the charges and interest it 
applied to Mr Ds account from February  2018  onwards. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 April 2020.
