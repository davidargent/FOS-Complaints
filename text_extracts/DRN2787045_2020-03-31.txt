K821x#15complaint
Mrs W says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny (Sunny),  irresponsibly 
lent to her. Mrs W says Sunny should  have known  she couldnt afford to repay the loans. 
She had to borrow further to make the repayments which  led her into a cycle  of debt causing 
her financial  hardship.

In response to Mrs Ws complaint Sunny agreed  that loans 11 and 12 shouldnt  have  been  
given and offered  redress  for those two loans.  Mrs W didnt agree with the offer so brought  
her complaint to us. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mrs Ws complaint  and thought the loans  from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed  to me.
Sunny didnt agree and maintained its offer for loans  11 and 12.
Another of our adjudicators reviewed the complaint  and thought that the lending  from loan 
five onwards shouldnt have  been given.
Sunny didnt respond to the second  adjudicator.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
Ref: DRN27870452complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs W could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mrs W didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to four shouldnt  be 
upheld. Because  of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision  about this lending.  But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mrs W had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ws complaint.
Like the second adjudicator, I dont think Sunny should have agreed to give Mrs W any 
further borrowing  at loan five.
Ref: DRN27870453At this point Mrs W had loans three and four still outstanding. Sunny has said its product is 
flexible and allows consumers to manage their finances. But in this case,  I disagree.  When 
she took loan five Mrs W would have to make  monthly repayments on all three loans  and 
this totalled £154.37. Taking into account Mrs Ws monthly income and expenditure which 
Sunny has told was £1,340 and £1,122 respectively, and the loan repayments of £154.37, 
this would only have  left Mrs W with a disposable monthly income  of £63.63.  I dont think this 
was sustainable  for Mrs W. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs W was not managing to repay their 
loans sustainably. Mrs W had taken out six loans within  nine months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mrs W was having to borrow  further  
to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that 
Mrs Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mrs Ws first loan was for £200 and loan six was also for £200.  At this point Sunny 
ought to have known that Mrs W was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in their income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
Several times from loan six onwards Mrs W was provided with a new loan within 
days of settling a previous  one. 
Mrs W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 12 was 
taken out 11 months after Mrs Ws first. Mrs W had paid large amounts of interest  to, 
in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mrs W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ws indebtedness  by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mrs W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mrs Ws ability  to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans five to 12 and Sunny 
should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs W paid on loans five to 12;
Ref: DRN27870454pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan five from Mrs Ws credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  six to 12 should  be removed from 
Mrs Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2020.
