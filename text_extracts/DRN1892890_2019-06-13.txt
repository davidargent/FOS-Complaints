K820x#14complaint
Miss K complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in the provisional decision I issued in 
April 2019. An extract from this is attached and forms  part of this final decision, so I will not 
repeat that information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to uphold most of the complaint.  
I invited both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. Miss K has not 
provided us with anything further. CashEuroNet has provided us with some comments. 
Although I am only summarising here what CashEuroNet has said,  I have considered  its 
entire response carefully before  writing this decision.
CashEuroNet has noted that my decision  did not provide any documents or evidence  to 
show that the lending to Miss K caused detriment to her financial wherewithal. It says that 
Miss K didnt show any of the traits that it would normally  see in a consumer who is suffering 
from financial difficulties. It says these  traits  would  include things such  as taking a new loan 
less than 15 days after a previous one had been  repaid  or incurring repeated  late payment 
fees. It doesnt agree that QuickQuids lending to Miss K was unsustainable.
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so I have reached the 
same conclusions as those I detailed in my provisional decision.
QuickQuids website says that;
Short-term loans are designed  to help you bridge the gap between paydays  so that you can 
take care of any unexpected expenses. If you need  a quick cash  advance to cover 
unexpected expenses, a QuickQuid short-term loan may be an option for you. However,  you 
should not take out a short-term loan if you don't think you can pay it back on time, or if you 
are in need of a long-term financial solution.   [my emphasis]
And;
Short-term loans should be used for short-term financial needs only,  and not as [a] long-
term financial solution. As a responsible lender, we do not encourage the frequent  use of our 
service.
As I said in my provisional decision I think that at some point in their lending relationship 
QuickQuid ought  to have considered that continuing  to lend to Miss K might be irresponsible 
because her level of indebtedness was continuing and not decreasing.  The pattern of 
continuous lending  suggested that Miss K had an ongoing need for a certain  level of credit  
and that she was not managing to repay  this without  borrowing again. And QuickQuids own 
view is that its payday  loans were not a long-term financial solution.
I dont think there are an absolute number  of loans beyond which  further lending  is 
unsustainable. And QuickQuid doesnt define  a point  at which its short-term loans cease to 
Ref: DRN18928902become the solution to a customers  need  for credit. But I would say its reasonable to think  
differently about  lending  to someone  for a period of a few pay cycles and lending to them  for 
almost four years. As I said in my provisional  decision, the potential risk of loans being 
unsustainable for a borrower is likely to increase the higher the loan value relative  to their 
income or the longer  the lending relationship. The point at which I think a lender ought to 
have considered the impact of repeatedly lending to someone will depend on their 
circumstances and on the particulars of the lending relationship. 
I think that point was reached  in Miss Ks relationship when QuickQuid  agreed  to give her 
the third loan. By then Miss K had been borrowing for a lengthy period and was making no 
inroads into the amount she owed QuickQuid.  I think it should have been  clear that it was 
likely that Miss K was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying  her previous loan 
was leaving in her finances.
So I remain  of the opinion that I should  uphold the complaint about loans 3 to 12 and 
QuickQuid should  put things right.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Miss K after, and including, the loan 
that she took on 21 March 2013  (loan  3). So for each of those  loans QuickQuid should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken from loan 3 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  3 to 12 should be removed from Miss Ks 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss K a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold most of Miss Ks complaint and direct CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
to put things right as detailed above.  Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  
Im required  to ask Miss K to accept or reject my decision before 13 July 2019.

Miss K complains  that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) lent to her in an irresponsible 
manner.
background
Miss K was given 12 loans by QuickQuid between August  2012 and June 2016. The first loan was 
repayable the following month but most of the other loans were  repayable  in two or three monthly  
instalments, and two were topped up by taking some additional borrowing  shortly after the original 
loan. Loan 8 was a FlexCredit loan that provided Miss K with a revolving credit facility. All of Miss Ks 
loans have been fully repaid and a summary of her borrowing from QuickQuid is as follows;
Loan

When Miss K first complained  to QuickQuid it agreed that it shouldnt have  given four of the loans to 
her. So it offered to pay her some compensation for those loans.  Miss K declined  that offer and 
brought her complaint to this Service.
Miss Ks complaint  has been assessed  by one of our adjudicators. She didnt think  that QuickQuid 
should have given any of the loans  to Miss K. So she asked QuickQuid to pay Miss K compensation  
for all of the loans. QuickQuid didnt agree with that assessment, but did repeat its earlier offer in 
relation to four of the loans. So, as the complaint  hasnt  been resolved informally, it has been passed 
to me, an ombudsman,  to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
Ref: DRN18928904QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure that Miss K could  repay the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different  things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish whether  
Miss K could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Office  of Fair Trading guidance on Irresponsible Lending,  and later the Consumer Credit  
Sourcebook (CONC),  define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular 
the customer  should  be able to make  repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Miss Ks complaint.
The repayment on Miss Ks first loan was relatively  modest compared to the income that she declared 
to QuickQuid. And although  the amount she borrowed on the second loan had increased, she had 
agreed to repay  that borrowing in two instalments. So given Miss Ks repayment amounts, what was 
apparent about her circumstances at the time, and her history with the lender,  I dont think it wouldve 
been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask her for the amount of information  that would be needed to 
show the lending  was unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything in the information Miss K provided or the information QuickQuid  shouldve 
been aware  of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what she was saying.  So  
I dont think QuickQuid  was wrong to give these two loans to Miss K.
But looking  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids  lending  history with Miss K I think by loan 3 the 
lender should reasonably have  seen  that further lending  was unsustainable,  or otherwise  harmful. 
And so QuickQuid should have  realised that it shouldnt provide any further loans.  
Ref: DRN18928905I say this because:
Although there  had been a gap of just under three months between  Miss K repaying loan 2 
and asking  to borrow again,  I dont think it would have been reasonable for QuickQuid to 
conclude this was an indication that Miss Ks finances had moved  on from whatever  situation 
had required  her previous loans. 
By the time Miss K asked for loan 3 shed been borrowing from QuickQuid for a lengthy 
period and she wasnt making  any inroads to the amount  she owed the lender. By then 
Miss K had paid a considerable amount of interest to QuickQuid to effectively service  a debt 
over an extended period.
From loan 4 onwards  Miss K was provided with a new loan typically within a few days of 
settling a previous one. So QuickQuid ought to have  realised it was more likely than not 
Miss K was having  to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving 
in her finances  and that Miss Ks indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
I think  that Miss K lost out because  QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 3 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Miss Ks indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number of loans  and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications on 
Miss Ks ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market  for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im intending to uphold  the complaint about loans  3 to 12 and QuickQuid should put things right.
