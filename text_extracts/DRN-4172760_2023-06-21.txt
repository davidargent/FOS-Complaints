The complaint
Mr K complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money lent to him 
irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr K applied for the following loans:
Loan 1 July 2016 £1000 over 24 months 
Loan 2 July 2017 £1000 over 24 months
Mr K complained that 118 118 Money had lent to him irresponsibly.
118 118 Money didnt uphold the complaint. It said it had carried out proportionate checks 
before lending to Mr K.
Mr K was unhappy with the response and complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He said 118 118 Money had carried out 
proportionate checks and that the lending decision was fair.
Mr K didnt agree so Ive been asked to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to complaints about irresponsible and unaffordable lending on 
our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering Mr Ks complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, 118 118 Money needed to complete reasonable and proportionate 
checks to ensure that Mr K could sustainably repay what was being lent to him. Theres no 
set list of checks a lender must complete, but lenders are required to take account of things 
like the amount being lent, the total amount repayable, the monthly repayment and the 
consumers individual circumstances. 
When Mr K applied for the loans, he declared monthly income of £4400 and £3400 
respectively. 118 118 Money verified Mr Ks income and took into account his outgoings 
when it carried out an affordability assessment. 118 118 Money also carried out a credit 
search and obtained information about how much Mr K was repaying towards existing debt. 
The credit search showed no adverse information. 
Based on what Ive seen and taking into account the size of the loan and the short term, I 
think the checks carried out were reasonable and proportionate.
Ive gone on to consider whether the lending decision was fair. Theres nothing in the 
information gathered by 118 118 Money to suggest that Mr K was struggling to repay his 
debts or that he was unlikely to be able to sustainably repay the loan. Mr K had sufficient 
monthly disposable income to afford the loan. I think the lending decision was fair.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 July 2023.
