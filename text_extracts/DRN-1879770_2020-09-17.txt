The complaint
Miss H complains that a loan that was included on her hire purchase agreement with 
FirstRand Bank Limited, trading as MotoNovo Finance, was mis-sold to her.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Miss H electronically signed the hire purchase agreement and a pre-contractual 
explanation of the agreement (which included pre-contract credit information) in 
September 2018  immediately above her signature on the agreement it says:
This is a Hire-Purchase and Personal Loan Agreement regulated by the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be legally bound by its 
terms; 
although she signed the agreement electronically the effect of her doing so is the 
same as if shed signed the agreement by hand and its reasonable to expect that 
she would have taken the same care before electronically signing the agreement as 
she would take before she signed it by hand;
I consider that its reasonable to expect a customer to carefully check an agreement 
such as this before signing it to ensure that its terms reflect what has been agreed 
and so that any issues can be dealt with before the agreement becomes effective  
and in this case Miss H was agreeing to pay £23,766.07 over 60 months to 
MotoNovo Finance so I consider that it was reasonable to expect her to have read 
the agreement before signing it electronically;
I consider it to be clear from the agreement and the pre-contract credit information 
(and also from the invoice for the car) that the price of the car was £16,990 but it had 
been increased to £19,990 because of the outstanding amount that she owed under 
an earlier agreement and that the amount of £19,990 was paid by a cash deposit of 
£1,000, a personal loan of £2,752.07 and credit under the hire purchase agreement 
of £16,237.93;
I also consider it to be clear from those documents that the agreement included a 
personal loan for the £2,752.07 - it included detailed information about that loan, 
including the monthly payment of £56.53, and referred in multiple places to the loan  
so if Miss H had read the agreement before signing it she ought reasonably to have 
been aware of the loan;
Miss H clearly feels that the agreement doesnt reflect what was agreed with the 
dealer but the dealer disagrees and says that the information in the agreement is 
what was agreed with her  and in circumstances such as this, where theres 
disagreement about what was agreed before an agreement was entered into, I have 
to place more reliance on the signed documentation; and
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that MotoNovo Finance has 
acted incorrectly in connection with the agreement or that it was mis-sold to Miss H  
so I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
it to waive all or part of the loan, to pay any compensation to Miss H or to take any 
other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 October 2020.
