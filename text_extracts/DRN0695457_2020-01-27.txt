Mr S complains that MYJAR  Limited  was irresponsible to lend to him.
background
Mr S had five 12-month instalment loans from Myjar between May 2017 and April 2018 as 
follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly  
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 8 May 2017 £1,825 357d £270.74 30 Apr 2018 25 Aug 2017
2 7 Sep 2017 £700 358d £104.39 31 Aug 2018 28 Sep 2017
3 29 Sep 2017 £1,400 364d £213.23 28 Sep 2018 7 Mar 2018
4 9 Mar 2018 £650 356d £97.92 28 Feb 2019 6 Apr 2018
5 6 Apr 2018 £1,000 357d £149.74 29 Mar 2019 25 May 2018
Mr S says Myjar  was irresponsible to lend to him as his credit file would have shown multiple 
other short-term loans at the same time. He says he was addicted  to gambling and the high 
interest rates charged on the repayments caused  him additional financial difficulties to the 
extent he could not escape  the loan cycle.
Myjar says it asked  Mr S about  his income  and expenditure and used information from 
external data sources to assess affordability. It says that based on the available  information 
it found all the loans to be affordable.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He said that by loan 3 Myjar 
should have seen Mr S was having  trouble manging his money and shouldnt have approved 
any further loans.  He recommended that interest  and charges  should be refunded on loans 3 
to 5 (plus 8% statutory  interest) and the associated negative information  should be removed 
from his credit file.
Myjar responded to say, in summary,  that due to the lack of detail in the assessment, it 
requested an ombudsmans review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Myjar was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make sure Mr S 
could afford  to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr S was borrowing, and his lending history. But 
there was no set list of checks Myjar had to do.
Loan 1
When Mr S applied  for his first Myjar loan, he was asked for information about his income 
and expenditure  and Myjar checked his credit  file. I cant see that there was anything in the 
available information  to suggest  that the loan was unaffordable, and Im satisfied the checks  
went far enough. So I cant conclude Myjar was wrong to approve  loan 1.
Loan 2
Ref: DRN06954572Mr S repaid  loan 1 early and applied for a second  loan two weeks later. As the loan was for 
a significantly smaller amount, and again Myjars checks indicated  the repayments  were 
affordable, I consider it was reasonable for Myjar to approve the loan.
Loans 3/4/5
Mr S repaid  loan 2 within a month,  but the following  day he applied  for a loan that was twice  
as big. Because  of that, and the fact that this was another  12-month  instalment loan I think 
Myjar should have  considered whether Mr S was using the loans for the purpose  for which  
they were intended.  The term of loan 3 meant that Mr S would have been in debt to Myjar for 
over 16 months had he repaid it according  to the schedule. As the purpose of such  high-cost 
loans is to address  short-term cash flow issues, I consider Myjar should have carried  out a 
full financial review before it approved loan 3 or any subsequent loans.  Had it done so, I 
consider it likely that it would have found the repayments on loans  3, 4 and 5 were  
unsustainable. I say that because a full financial review was likely to have shown the 
following:
Mr S had multiple outstanding short-term loans with other providers at the time of the 
loan applications;
Mr S was already  paying into a debt management plan;
There was a significant issue with gambling  transactions.
So I find it was irresponsible for Myjar to have approved loans 3, 4 and 5.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. MYJAR  Limited should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr S paid on loans 3 to 5;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loans 3 to 5 from Mr Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Myjar to take off tax from this interest. Myjar must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 February  2020.
