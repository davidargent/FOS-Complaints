K820x#14complaint
Mrs J says Financial  Insurance  Company Limited (FICL)  mis-sold her a payment protection 
insurance (PPI)  policy.  
background
Mrs J bought the policy in 2000 at the same time as taking out a store card.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mrs J disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Js case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs Js complaint because:
I think FICL made Mrs J aware that she had a choice  about  buying the PPI, and that she 
chose to take it. This is because she signed specifically  to show she wanted the PPI, 
separately to where she signed  for the credit card.  
FICL didnt recommend the PPI to Mrs J so it didnt have to check if it was right for her. 
Its possible the information FICL gave Mrs J about the PPI wasnt  as clear  as it 
shouldve been.  But Mrs J doesnt  appear to have been affected by any of the main 
things the policy  didnt cover  and based  on what  I know about  her circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been useful to her. So I dont  think  better information 
wouldve stopped  her buying it. 
Ive taken into account Mrs Js comments,  including what  shes  said about  her sick pay. But 
these points dont  change my conclusion. Although she wouldve been  entitled to between  
six and twelve months  sick pay, the PPI wouldve paid out on top of this for twelve months, 
leaving her sick pay available for other things. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Js complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 February  2019.
