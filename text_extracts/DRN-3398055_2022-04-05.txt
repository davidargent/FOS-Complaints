The complaint
Miss M complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA have failed to remove a limitation placed
on her account.
What happened
Miss M has a PayPal account, and in June 2020 a limitation was placed on it so that her
identity could be verified. To do this, PayPal asked Miss M to send them proof of her identity
and proof of her address. Miss M told PayPal she didnt have any photo I.D, and they
explained she could be verified if she sent them a copy of her birth certificate and a valid
bank statement.
Over the coming weeks and months, Miss M provided the information PayPal had
requested. On occasions, PayPal explained the bank statements provided werent in the
correct format. So, Miss M provided alternative copies  and even did so while on the phone
with them to try and ensure she was sending the information they needed. However, despite
her efforts, the limitation on her account wasnt removed.
Miss M complained to PayPal about the time it was taking to remove the limitation on her
account. They looked into her concerns and issued their final response. In this, they
explained they needed to verify her identity for their due diligence obligations, and that they
needed her to provide photo I.D. This letter didnt comment on what Miss M had told them
about not having photo I.D. Miss M remained unhappy, so she brought her complaint to our
service.
Our investigator felt Miss Ms complaint should be upheld. She felt PayPals communication
with Miss M should have been clearer. She asked them to pay £100 in recognition of the
inconvenience their mistakes caused. PayPal didnt respond to our investigators view, and
Miss M still wanted access to the funds held in her PayPal account. Our investigator didnt
change her opinion, so the case was passed to me for a decision.
I issued my provisional decision on 10 March 2022. In this, I came to a different outcome to 
our investigator because I considered her award didnt go far enough to put things right. 
I explained PayPal providing Miss M with inconsistent information caused significant delays 
in their verification process. I also wasnt satisfied it was fair for PayPal to keep hold of 
Miss Ms funds indefinitely. So, I said I was minded to ask them to release Miss Ms funds, 
increase the award for distress and inconvenience to £300, and for them to confirm to 
Miss M if her account needs to be closed given she doesnt have photo I.D.
Both Miss M and PayPal had until 24 March 2022 to provide any further points and/or 
evidence for me to consider. However, I didnt receive a response from either of them. In 
light of no new information, my decision remains the same.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding Miss Ms complaint, but in a different way to our investigator. 
Ill explain my reasoning below.
PayPal said a limitation was placed on Miss Ms account because they needed to verify her
identity. Having looked at the terms and conditions that apply to Miss Ms PayPal account,
I can see this is something they tell their customers they might do. So, Im satisfied Miss M
ought to have been aware this is something that might happen with her account. In addition
to this, its not unusual for a financial business such as PayPal to take steps to verify their
customers. In fact, this is common practice to help protect the interest of their customers and
themselves. Given the purpose of these checks, I couldnt automatically say that preventing
access to an account while checks are carried out is unfair. However, if a consumer is
prevented from accessing their account, I would expect any checks to be carried out 
efficiently to prevent unnecessary inconvenience. In this case, Miss M complains about the
amount of time the limitation has been in place. So, Ive had to decide if PayPal has acted
reasonably by keeping the limitation in place, or whether it should have been removed 
sooner.
The limitation was placed on Miss Ms account in June 2020 and has remained in place ever
since. This means she hasnt had access to her account, or the funds held in it, for nearly
two years, and this is an incredibly long period of time. I could somewhat understand this
happening had Miss M not engaged with PayPal when she was told her account needed to
be verified. However, the information from both parties suggests that wasnt the case. From
what Ive seen, Im persuaded Miss M told PayPal, at the earliest opportunity, that she didnt
have photo I.D.  and that was the right thing to do. It also demonstrates she was willing to
work with them to ensure they had what they needed to carry out their checks. So, when
Miss M was told to provide her birth certificate and bank statement instead, I dont consider it
was unreasonable for her to rely on this information.
When this complaint first came to our service, PayPal told us theyd received Miss Ms birth
certificate. They also explained they only needed a valid bank statement to verify Miss Ms
identity. They clarified that a valid bank statement needed to show the following:
Miss Ms full name;
her address;
her banks logo; and
the date.When we asked PayPal for copies of the bank statements Miss M had sent to them, they
said they couldnt provide us with copies because they hadnt received any photo I.D. When
the case came to me, I had nothing that showed the format of the statements Miss M had
sent PayPal. I needed this information to determine whether the information detailed above
wasnt visible on the statements shed provided  and if that was the case, it would explain
why the limitation hadnt been removed. So, I asked Miss M to send me copies of what shed
previously sent PayPal. I also asked her to send me her most recent bank statement which
showed all the information PayPal had asked for.
When I received the statements from Miss M, they contained all the information PayPal
needed to see to deem them valid. Therefore, I didnt consider it was fair the limitation
hadnt been removed and asked if they were now prepared to remove it. PayPal explained
their position remained the same, and that they had written to Miss M in August 2021
outlining the information they needed to verify her account.
PayPal provided us with the email sent to Miss M in August 2021. This said they needed
her to provide photo I.D. to verify her account. Nowhere in this email did it acknowledge what
Miss M had told them about not having any, or why they now needed this despite what
theyd told her in 2020. I consider this email lacked vital detail needed to clearly explain
things for Miss M, and in turn was poor customer service. I consider this poor service was
exacerbated by the fact Miss Ms complaint was with our investigator in August 2021  and
despite being aware of this, PayPal didnt tell our investigator if/why their position had
changed. Given PayPal were aware Miss M was already unhappy with their service  and
what theyd told us when providing their file, I consider this email was inappropriate and
unreasonable in the circumstances. While they may have felt it supported their position that
Miss M hadnt provided what they needed; all it did was further persuade me they had been
giving Miss M unclear and conflicting information when verifying her account.
After questioning PayPal about what they needed, theyve now confirmed that after speaking
with their compliance department, they need to see photo I.D. from Miss M. Given the
importance of these checks (that PayPal themselves have highlighted on multiple
occasions), I consider a reasonable business should be fully aware of the information they
need at all stages of their verification process. But, in any event, Miss M was in frequent
contact with PayPal, so I dont consider its reasonable they only came to this realisation
after Miss Ms complaint was with our service. Furthermore, they should have picked up on
needing photo I.D. when they initially dealt with Miss Ms complaint and explained that
clearly  not after it was escalated to us. But what I find the most disappointing, is that they
only clarified why their position had changed after I had probed them on several occasions
when trying to build a picture of what had happened and why. This isnt a particularly 
complex case, so I cant agree PayPal have treated Miss M fairly when verifying her identity.
From the information Ive seen, Im persuaded that PayPals mistakes are the main cause of
what I deem to be avoidable delays in the verification of Miss Ms identity. Its for this reason
I consider they need to do something to put things right.
Putting things right
Our investigator felt PayPal should pay Miss M £100 for the inconvenience she experienced
due to the conflicting information they provided. While I agree Miss M has experienced
inconvenience, I dont agree this award went far enough to recognise the back-and-forth
Miss M had with PayPal for over a year when trying to provide the information they had 
asked for. I also cant ignore that Miss M still wouldnt have had access to the funds in her 
PayPal account had she accepted this resolution.PayPal has confirmed they have been carrying out normal checks on Miss Ms account. So, 
I consider its reasonable to conclude they dont have any specific concerns about Miss M or 
the source of her funds. Its for this reason Im not persuaded its reasonable for them to 
keep her funds indefinitely.
While I appreciate theyd like photo I.D., Miss M has made it clear this isnt something she
has. However, she has provided them, with her birth certificate and multiple bank 
statements. So, given PayPal hasnt identified Miss M as a high risk, and she has willingly
co-operated with their information requests, I consider they should release the funds in
Miss Ms PayPal account and send them to her. Im satisfied this is fair and appropriate in 
the circumstances because PayPal hasnt sent me anything that suggests my conclusion on 
this point is incorrect.
I do have to be fair to both parties. So, I cant ignore that PayPal say they normally need
to have sight of photo I.D. from their customers. While I dont think its unusual that some
people may not have this, its for PayPal to determine who they are prepared to provide
services to. And if theyre not happy to open or hold accounts for those without photo I.D.,
I cant force them to. With that in mind, once Miss Ms funds have been returned to her, they 
will need to let her know whether her account will be closed. When making this decision, 
I would expect PayPal to discuss this with all their necessary departments at the earliest 
opportunity to give Miss M an answer on this quickly  and one that is correct and consistent 
with other customers that have circumstances similar to hers.
The final part of my award needs to recognise the inconvenience Miss M has experienced
because of PayPals mistakes. I consider it would have been incredibly stressful and 
frustrating being unable to get clear and consistent answers from PayPal. It also would have
been worrying not having access to the funds held in her account  particularly given Im 
aware there is just over £300 in there and Miss M has a child.
As mentioned above, I consider what Miss M has been through was avoidable. My award
also needs to recognise these issues have persisted for over a year. As such, Im asking 
PayPal to pay Miss M £300 in recognition of the distress and inconvenience shes 
experienced.
Given the reasons above, Im upholding Miss Ms complaint.
My final decision
Im upholding Miss Ms complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA.
To put things right, Im asking PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to:
release the funds in Miss Ms PayPal account and return them to her;
pay Miss M £300 for the confusion and inconvenience caused by their failure 
to provide her with clear and consistent information about the documents they 
needed to verify her account; and
tell Miss M whether she can continue using her PayPal account, or if it will be 
closed unless shes able to provide them with photo I.D.
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA should pay simple interest at 8% a year on the funds held 
in Miss Ms PayPal account, from the date her account was limited until the date of 
settlement.If PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs 
to deduct income tax from that interest, it should tell Miss M how much its taken off. It 
should also give Miss M a tax deduction certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim 
tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 May 2022.
