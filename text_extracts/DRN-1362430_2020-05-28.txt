The complaint
Mr O complains that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Volkswagen 
Financial Services, didn't credit a payment to his account.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car had been supplied to Mr O under a hire purchase agreement with 
Volkswagen Financial Services that he signed in January 2019;
he contacted it in March 2019 and was provided with a partial payment illustration 
which showed the effect of making a £5,000 payment to his account - he then made 
a payment of £5,000;
later that month he made a second payment of £5,000 to Volkswagen Financial 
Services - but he didn't contact it about the payment and wasn't provided with a 
partial payment illustration;
he says that he realised in July 2019 that the payment hadn't been credited to his 
account so he complained to Volkswagen Financial Services - it credited the 
payment to his account but didn't back-date it to the date that he'd made the payment 
so he complained to this service;
I can understand Mr O's frustration that the payment wasn't credited to his account in 
March 2019 - but he didn't contact Volkswagen Financial Services before he made 
that payment and he wasn't provided with a partial payment illustration;
Volkswagen Financial Services has a partial payments procedure which it says that it 
followed and I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that its 
procedure is unfair or unreasonable;
Mr O had made a payment to his account earlier that month and had complied with 
that procedure - but when he made the payment about which he's complained he 
didn't comply with the procedure;
I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that Volkswagen Financial 
Services has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr O about that payment;
Mr O has asked that Volkswagen Financial Services be required to retrospectively 
apply the £5,000 to his loan balance and to change its procedures - but I don't 
consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to apply the payment 
to his loan with effect from March 2019 and I'm unable to require it to change the way 
that it conducts its business; and
I find that it wouldn't be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Volkswagen Financial Services to take any action in response to Mr O's complaint. 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Os complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 June 2020.
