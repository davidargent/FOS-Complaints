The complaint
Mr S complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him in 
an irresponsible manner.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in April 2020 that I summarise below.
Mr S was given 33 loans by Sunny between October 2015 and January 2017. Each of the 
loans was due to be paid in 24 weekly instalments. Mr S repaid many of the loans well 
before they were due, and all of them have been repaid. A summary of the first 12 loans 
Mr S borrowed from Sunny is as follows;

In my provisional decision I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, and 
in particular that the checks Sunny needed to do would need to take into account things 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I thought less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
I thought that the checks Sunny did before agreeing the first three loans were proportionate. 
So I didn't think it had been wrong for Sunny to agree to give these loans to Mr S.
DRN-1894437I thought that Sunny should have done more checks before agreeing loans 4 to 7. But Mr S 
hadn't given us enough information for me to determine what better checks would have 
shown to the lender. So I wasn't able to say that Sunny had been wrong to agree these 
loans.
But I thought that, by the time of loan 8, Sunny should have realised that the overall pattern 
of Mr S's borrowing should have suggested that any further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldn't provide further loans. 
I asked Sunny to pay Mr S some compensation in relation to loans 8 to 33.
Mr S hasn't responded to my provisional decision. Sunny has provided us with some 
additional comments. Although I am only summarising here what Sunny has said, I have 
considered its entire response carefully before writing this decision.
Sunny has noted that the way it looks at complaints has changed since it originally assessed 
Mr S's concerns. But it doesn't agree with my provisional decision. It says that;
Mr S's declared income was verified
The average percentage of Mr S's income that was used to repay the loans was 
3.64% which reduced the potential for any harm
Mr S did not at any stage contact Sunny to inform it of the now alleged financial 
difficulty and had he done so the firm would have exercised forbearance in 
accordance with its regulatory obligations.
Sunny has however concluded that it might have done more in the later stages of its 
relationship with Mr S. In response to our adjudicator's assessment Sunny offered to refund 
the interest and charges Mr S had paid from loan 25 onwards. It has now increased that 
offer to refund the interest and charges Mr S had paid from loan 16 onwards.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so I remain happy with 
the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.
The additional information Sunny has provided to us fails to address the underlying reasons 
that I think part of Mr S's complaint should be upheld. By loan 8 I don't think the only 
consideration was whether the loans were affordable for Mr S based on a strict pounds and 
pence calculation. But even so, taking account of the fact that Mr S had to make repayments 
on multiple loans at the same time, at one point his monthly repayments took up 20% of his 
declared income. And Mr S regularly made repayments of more than 10% of his monthly 
income. I think repetitive and prolonged repayments at that level are likely to have been 
harmful to his finances.
I think by loan 8 it was the overall pattern of Mr S's borrowing relationship that should have 
led Sunny to conclude he was dependent on its lending. That is not a sustainable basis on 
which to lend to a consumer, and so I still think Sunny should have stopped lending to Mr S 
at that point. Under the relevant regulations it was Sunny's responsibility to identify Mr S's 
dependence - it wasn't for him to make that judgement on behalf of the lender.
So I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr S from loan 8 onwards. Sunny 
needs to pay him some compensation. 
 
 Putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr S after, and including, the loan that he 
took on 28 November 2015 (loan 8). So Sunny should; 
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr S on the loans.
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the
date they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans taken from loans 8 onwards means any information recorded
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 8 to 33 should be removed from
Mr Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ss complaint and direct Elevate Credit International 
Limited to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 July 2020.
