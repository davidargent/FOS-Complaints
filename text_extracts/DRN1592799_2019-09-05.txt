K820x#14Complaint
Mr Q complains about the way Lloyds  Bank  plc dealt  with him after a relative made an 
unauthorised withdrawal from his account.
Background
One of Mr Qs relatives was able to withdraw £80 from his Lloyds account. It seems that the 
bank did not check  the relatives signature  against  his own. Mr Q identified  fairly quickly what  
had happened. The bank  agreed it had made an error and credited Mr Qs account with the 
£80, backdated  to the date of the withdrawal. It also paid him an additional  £150  and £13.50  
to cover his costs. 
Mr Q didnt think that went far enough and referred the case to us. Our investigator 
concluded, however,  that Lloyds had done  enough  to resolve things and didnt think  the 
bank needed to do more. Mr Q didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman review the 
matter.       
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, however, I agree with 
the investigator. 
By refunding the £80 and backdating the refund, Lloyds has put Mr Q in the position he 
would have been in if the withdrawal hadnt  happened. And I agree with the investigator too 
that the additional payments the banks made adequately compensate  Mr Q for any costs 
hes incurred and for any inconvenience  hes been put to and distress he may have suffered 
as a result  of the banks actions. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont require Lloyds Bank plc to do any more  to resolve Mr Qs 
complaint. Under  the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr Q to 
accept or reject my decision  before  5 October  2019..
