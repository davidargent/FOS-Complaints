The complaint
Ms M complained that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA had only refunded her part of a 
transaction she made, then claimed for under PayPals buyer protection. And when she 
complained, PayPal said shed agreed to this, though she hadnt.  
What happened
Ms M paid using PayPal for a course, including six separate lessons. She said that after two 
lessons, she realised it really wasnt as described. She wanted her money back. She said 
the seller delayed a refund, so she spoke to PayPal, and asked to make a claim, as the 
course was significantly not as described. 
Ms M paid £2,746 for all six lessons. 
PayPal offered Ms M a partial refund of £1,302, and she said no. She said that after that, 
PayPal sent her this amount. And it just kept telling her that she had agreed to accept this 
partial refund, although it was much less than the full amount shed paid. So she couldnt 
have the rest. But she showed us that she hadnt agreed. 
Ms M has provided us with a considerable amount of evidence to support what she says.
Ms M said she wasnt asking for all the money shed paid to be refunded to her. She was 
happy to use a £300 payment that the course provider had made to her for delays in 
providing the course, towards her refund. And she was happy to waive the refund for the two 
lessons she took, although she said those werent as described. But she did want the rest of 
the money back, including for materials which she said shed returned by recorded delivery 
to the course provider. She said she was still owed £745, and she wanted us to help.
PayPal said it had worked this case correctly. Although our investigator asked some further 
questions, PayPal has simply repeated this assertion, and provided evidence of the refund of 
£1,302.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. He said that Ms M had asked for a 
refund of £2,446 and she did reject the settlement offer of £1,302. He could see that she had 
repeatedly told PayPal that she hadnt agreed to a lower settlement, and showed it evidence 
of this, but PayPal kept telling her she had. 
Our investigator said that Ms Ms claim did come within the terms of PayPals significantly 
not described protection. The terms provide this -
Significantly Not as Described claims
An item can be considered Significantly Not as Described if:
-You purchased a certain number of items but didn't receive them all.
So our investigator thought PayPal should refund Ms M the rest of her money. He set out 
how much this would be. 
Ms M had an invoice which confirms the total price for the six courses was £2,746. The two 
courses that Ms M completed were for the value of £249 and £150 respectively. The 
merchant had also previously refunded £300 to Ms M for the delay in delivering the course.
The total refund that Ms M should get was therefore - 
£2746 - £300 - £249 - £150 - £1302 = £745.
Our investigator said PayPal should refund a further £745 and pay Ms M £200 for her 
trouble.
Ms M accepted this. But despite repeated correspondence sent by our investigator, PayPal 
simply never replied.
Because PayPal didnt respond to our service, this case was passed to me to finalise, and 
provide a decision which can be binding on both parties.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion in this case as our investigator.
I think Ms M has been quite fair in her request for a refund. She has given the course 
provider credit for courses which she says werent really as described, and for a refund given 
for a different reason. Shes also told us she returned course materials that she couldnt use, 
by recorded delivery. 
I think Ms Ms request for a refund for the remaining amount she paid is a request for a 
reasonable amount of her initial transaction. 
Having considered the terms of PayPals user agreement, I also agree with our investigator 
that Ms Ms claim falls within PayPals significantly not as described buyer protection. 
Ms M has shown us that she didnt agree to a partial refund. And that she repeatedly said 
this to PayPal. 
PayPal said to Ms M that Ms M opened this dispute for a lower amount, and then accepted 
it. That doesnt fit with what Ms M has said, and the evidence she has shown us. PayPal 
then said to us that it worked this case correctly. But it offered no evidence of this. On the 
basis of what I have seen, Im not able to agree that whats gone wrong here is solely Ms 
Ms fault, or indeed that PayPal has worked this case correctly. It seems more likely that 
what has gone wrong here is PayPals responsibility. So I think it should pay Ms M the rest 
of the refund that she is asking for.
I have reviewed the calculation that our investigator has provided, as set out above, and I 
adopt that. I think PayPal should refund a further £745 to Ms M. 
I can also see that Ms M made considerable efforts to resolve this problem herself, and this 
has put her to quite a lot of trouble, as well as being a deeply frustrating experience for her. 
So I also think that its fair to ask PayPal to pay Ms M £200 in compensation.  
My final decisionMy final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must refund a further £745 to Ms M, 
and it must pay Ms M £200 in compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 August 2021.
