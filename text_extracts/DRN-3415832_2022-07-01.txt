The complaint
Ms L complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) made errors on her loan 
account.
What happened
Ms S had a loan from NatWest. In December 2019, the balance was £14,649 and the 
repayments were £225.18 per month. She ran into financial and personal difficulties. 
NatWest agreed a payment holiday between May 2020 and July 2020 under the pandemic 
support scheme. After the end of the payment holiday, NatWest sent a refinance agreement 
to Ms L  extending the loan by the period of the payment holiday. No payments were then 
made to the loan between August 2020 and May 2021. A pre-Default Notice was issued on 
28 October 2020 followed by a Default Notice on 4 November 2020.
In May 2021, NatWest agreed to refinance Ms Ls loan with a longer term and lower 
repayments  this was to be a loan of £13,750 at £173.02 per month for 90 months. It was 
agreed there would be six qualifying payments of £173.02, and these were made between 
June 2021 and November 2021. But the wrong information was then sent to Ms L in 
February 2022  it said payments would be £90 per month for 173 months. A new facility 
letter was sent in February 2022 with the corrected figures. Ms L didnt sign this, nor were 
any payments made. In March 2022, NatWest sent Ms L an arrears notice which said the 
arrears were £2,541.37. Ms Ls credit file had been marked as in arrangement.
Ms L complained about several things, and these were added to during our investigation. 
She said she called NatWest at the end of the payment holiday to ask for an extension, but 
this hadnt been actioned. She said the delays in getting the refinanced loan agreed and set 
up were unacceptable. She said that NatWest should honour the loan document sent to her 
in February 2022  with the lower repayments and longer term. Ms L said she had been 
offered an interest free loan when she called NatWest, and this hadnt been put in place. 
She said that the loan arrears notice also wasnt fair.
NatWest said they had no record of Ms L contacting them about an extension to the 
payment holiday. When the first payment holiday was agreed, it was left to Ms L to contact 
NatWest again at its end, but she hadnt. She had agreed to extend the loan term by three 
months in August 2020, (because of the first payment holiday) and that had been actioned. 
But  that wasnt the same as a further payment holiday. They said theyd tried to contact Ms 
L many times about the arrears on the loan, but no contact had been made. And a pre-
default notice was issued on 28 October 2020, followed by a default notice on 4 November 
2020. Separately (and not related to the complaint that Ms L brought to this service), 
NatWest paid compensation of £75 for an error in sending a default notice to Ms L in 
connection with her current account.
NatWest sent a second final response in March 2022.  They apologised that Ms L was sent 
the wrong paperwork in February 2022 for the refinanced loan and sent to her the corrected 
document. For this, they paid compensation of £175 and waived one months interest on the 
loan - £78.33. They said that the loan agreed was for repayments of £173.02 over 90 
months. 
Ms L brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said NatWest acted reasonably. She 
couldnt see anything in NatWests records that Ms L had asked for an extension to the 
payment holiday. They had agreed to extend the loan in respect of the first payment holiday 
 but that was all. She had seen various letters sent to Ms L between August 2020 and 
November 2020  chasing Ms L for loan payments. This led to the Default Notice in 
November 2020. 
She said NatWest had agreed to refinance Ms Ls loan in May 2021, and after the six 
qualifying payments had been made, sent her the formal facility letter  but an error was 
made in the first version. NatWest had apologised for that and sent to Ms L the correct 
version. And their apology, plus compensation of £175 and interest refund of £78.33 was 
fair. But the refinance proposal as set out in the amended paperwork was right. Referring to 
Ms Ls argument that she was offered an interest free loan, she hadnt been able to listen to 
the call as it wasnt available.
On the arrears notice, our investigator said the missed payments added up to the amount 
quoted on the arrears notice  and it was also reasonable for NatWest to send this to Ms L.
Ms L didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There are several aspects to Ms Ls complaint  some of which have been brought to us 
during our investigation. Ms L complains:
she asked for a further payment holiday in July/August 2020.
there were unacceptable delays in agreeing to refinance her loan, and this led to the 
arrears and default notice.
NatWest should honour the loan agreement sent to her in February 2022  which 
said payments would be £90 a month for 173 months. She said that NatWest offered 
her an interest free loan and this wasnt actioned.
the arrears notice in March 2020 was unreasonable.
Payment holiday: I can see that Ms L had a payment holiday between May 2020 and July 
2020.  I looked at NatWests notes of calls and records and could find no indication that Ms L 
asked for a further payment holiday. I can see that NatWest sent to Ms L a refinance 
agreement in August 2020  to extend the loan by three months in respect of the first 
payment holiday, and Ms L accepted that  with the same repayments of £225.18. And so  
the evidence suggests that Ms L didnt ask for a further payment holiday.
Loan refinance: I can see that Ms L was in financial difficulty. In June 2020, NatWest 
declined to refinance the loan because Ms Ls income and expenditure at the time showed 
she couldnt afford the payments. I can then see  that NatWest tried many times to ask Ms 
L to get in touch with them about her loan. But there arent any records which said she did. 
NatWest showed us the letters that Ms L was sent between August 2020 and November 
2020 asking her to get in touch and showing concern about the missed loan payments. I 
couldnt see any records that Ms L called Nat West during that period until 9 November 2020 
 when she raised a complaint. And so  the records dont suggest that NatWest delayed the agreement to a new loan, rather that Ms L didnt contact them.
No loan payments were made between August 2020 and November 2020  and so NatWest 
sent to Ms L the Pre-Default Notice on 28 October 2020 followed by a Default Notice on 4
November 2020. I think that was reasonable in the circumstances. 
New loan  February 2022: I can see in NatWests records that they assessed Ms Ls 
income and expenditure in May 2021 and agreed to refinance her loan based on what they 
then learnt. The loan term was 90 months at £173.02 a month  the loan amount was 
£13,750. They asked for six qualifying payments to be made, to show affordability. I can see 
these were made between June 2021 and November 2021. And then NatWest issued the 
formal loan document  in February 2022. But they made an error and reversed the term 
and monthly payment amount. They apologised for that and sent Ms L a revised, correct 
version. Ms L said they should honour the first, wrong version, but Im afraid I dont agree  
its NatWests commercial decision regarding the amount and term of the loan and in this 
case I dont think they are bound by it. And  Ms L had made the first six qualifying 
payments for the new loan  and didnt raise any objection to the payments at that time. 
NatWest apologised for their mistake and paid compensation of £175 plus an interest refund 
of £78.33  and that was the right thing to do.
Ms L had said that she was offered an interest free loan also on a call. We asked NatWest 
for the call but they couldnt locate it. There arent any written records of it either. So here, I 
must decide on the balance of probabilities what might have happened. I think that if 
NatWest were to have offered such an interest free loan  they would only do so if Ms L was 
in extreme financial difficulty and couldnt afford the repayments. And NatWests records in 
May 2021 - show they assessed that Ms L could afford the payments. Also, I think its likely 
that such an agreement wouldve required a detailed income and expenditure analysis, and 
wouldve been set out in writing to Ms L. And I couldnt see that such a thing had been done. 
And so  Im not persuaded that NatWest offered Ms L an interest free loan.
Arrears notice: in March 2022, Ms L received an arrears notice for £2,541.37. We asked 
NatWest about that as I wanted to ensure it was correct. NatWest showed us how the 
arrears had been worked out. I can see that Ms L didnt make any payments to the loan 
between August 2020 and May 2021 (£225.18 was due monthly); and then missed 
payments of £173.02 between December 2021 and March 2022. And therefore, the arrears 
notice looks to be of the right amount and was reasonable.
And so, in the circumstances of Ms Ls complaint, I think NatWest acted reasonably. I think 
its now down to Ms L to contact NatWest again to set up the loan refinance. We asked 
NatWest if they would agree to do that  but with the passage of time they want to go 
through Ms Ls income and expenditure again and understand her circumstances, I think 
thats also a reasonable thing to do here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 July 2022.
