The complaint
Mr M complains that HomeServe Membership Limited (HomeServe) wont refund a payment 
it took from his account after he decided not to renew his policy.
What happened
Mr M had plumbing and drainage home emergency cover with HomeServe. He thought the 
renewal price was too high and called to cancel the renewal. After some discussion about a 
reduced price, Mr M said hed think about it. He didnt get back to HomeServe.
 
Mr M found that HomeServe had renewed his policy at the original renewal price when it 
took a payment from his account. He called to complain. HomeServe cancelled the policy 
from the date of his complaint but refused to refund the payment. It explained that because 
he didnt get back to it about the reduced price, it renewed the policy. Mr M didnt agree. He 
said that his silence couldnt be interpreted as an acceptance of the policy renewal.
Then, I issued a provisional decision in October 2020 explaining that I was intending to 
uphold Mr Ms complaint. Heres what I said in my provisional decision:
Ive considered all the evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. 
Ive provisionally decided to uphold Mr Ms complaint and Ill explain why.
The facts are not disputed here. The disagreement is about whether HomeServe shouldve 
renewed the policy when Mr M didnt get back to it following its revised price offer.
The terms and conditions of the policy state:
How do I renew?
HomeServe will contact you in writing before your policy expires to arrange the 
renewal of your policyIf you do not wish to renew your policy please give us a call 
on the customer services number shown on your policy schedule before the policy 
start date.
Mr M called HomeServe and Ive listened to the call recording which starts off as follows:
Mr M  Youve sent me a renewal quote, I received it this morning and I dont wish to 
renew
HomeServe  I can arrange for it to be cancelled, Im sorry to hear that youre 
looking to leave
Im satisfied that Mr M clearly stated he didnt wish to renew in line with the terms of the 
policy.
From here, a conversation followed between Mr M and HomeServe about his use of the 
policy and the cover it provided. HomeServe asked Mr M whether hed like to reconsider, 
and he asked for its best quote so he could think about it. HomeServe provides a new quote 
and the conversation continues as follows:
Mr M  Its a bit much still, let me think about it over the next Ive got a month, 
havent I?
HomeServe  Did you want to think about it and get back to us?
Mr M  Yeah I can come back to you before 10th September
HomeServe  Yeah let us know before the 9th September if you can
Mr M  So you want me to get back to you before 9th September?
HomeServe  Before the 9th, please, yeah
I think this conversation clearly demonstrates that Mr M was going to think about 
HomeServes revised policy renewal price and get back to it if he decided to accept. I dont 
think its fair or reasonable to interpret this conversation as Mr M saying if he didnt contact 
HomeServe again he would go ahead with the original, higher renewal price. As Ive said 
above, he clearly stated he didnt want to renew at that price and that was the purpose of his 
call.
In (simple) law terms, if an offer is rejected and replaced with another offer, then the original 
offer is no longer available to accept. That is what happened here  Mr M rejected the first 
offer, HomeServe made another offer at a reduced price, so it cant then renew at the 
original price because its no longer a valid offer.
At best, HomeServe mightve renewed at the reduced price, but I still dont think that 
wouldve been fair. Again, in simple law terms, if an offer is made but neither accepted nor 
rejected (silence), then there isnt a contract. An offer must be accepted to form the contract 
and all Mr M said was hed think about it. He didnt get back to HomeServe so his silence on 
the matter cant be taken as acceptance of the reduced price offer, and it wasnt fair for 
HomeServe to take Mr Ms silence, or failure to get back to it about the renewal, as a change 
of heart in his decision to cancel the renewal.
In summary, Im satisfied that Mr M clearly declined the policy renewal and he didnt accept 
a reduced price renewal. 
HomeServe took the first payment of £39 from Mr Ms account. As Ive explained, I dont 
think it was fair to renew the policy so HomeServe should return his payment. I also think 
HomeServe should pay Mr M £30 by way of apology for its failure to cancel the renewal, its 
failure to refund his payment sooner, and for the upset and frustration this matter has caused 
him.
I said I was intending to, uphold Mr Ms complaint and I am minded to require HomeServe 
Membership Limited to:
refund the policy payment of £39 to Mr M, and
pay a further £30 compensation, by way of apology, for the failure to cancel the 
renewal, the failure to refund the payment sooner, and for the upset and frustration 
caused. 
I asked both parties to send me any further comments and information they might want me 
to consider before I reached a final decision.
HomeServe responded to say it had nothing further to add.Mr M responded to say he had no further submissions and expressed thanks for the careful 
consideration of this matter.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Mr M nor HomeServe had anything further to add, and having considered the 
evidence again, I see no reason to change my provisional decision.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, and in my provisional decision, I uphold Mr Ms 
complaint.
HomeServe Membership Limited must:
refund the policy payment of £39 to Mr M, and
pay a further £30 compensation, by way of apology, for the failure to cancel the 
renewal, the failure to refund the payment sooner, and for the upset and frustration 
caused. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 November 2020.
