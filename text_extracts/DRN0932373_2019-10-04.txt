K821x#15complaint
Mr M says Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr M had 25 loans  with Sunny  Ive included some  information about these loans as an 
appendix to this decision.
Sunny offered to refund the interest and charges Mr M paid on loans 1 and 2 in its final 
response letter. Our adjudicator considered the complaint and recommended  Sunny  also 
refund the interest and charges on the other  23 loans.
Sunny didnt accept  the adjudicators view but offered instead to refund the interest  and 
charges from loan 11 onwards. It also confirmed it would honour its offer on loans 1 and 2. 
Mr M didnt  accept this revised  offer and so the complaint was passed  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mr Ms case. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay his loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ms income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny has already made a fair offer in respect  of loans 1, 2 and 11 onwards so I dont 
consider it necessary to address these loans in my decision. Instead, Ill focus on the loans 
still in dispute.  
Sunny didnt think it had acted unfairly by approving loans 3 to 10. It accepted that it would 
have been prudent for us to contact [Mr M] at some point to discuss his financial 
Ref: DRN09323732circumstances because  there had been no significant breaks in lending to him throughout 
the lending relationship. But it didnt think this applied as soon as the adjudicator  did.
Sunny hasnt however provided  me with any persuasive reasons why the pattern of lending,  
or other signs Mr M might  have been  struggling  to manage his money,  only became 
problematic by the time of loan 11, rather than by loan 3 as suggested by the adjudicator.
By the time of loan 3, Mr M had already been  borrowing  for about a year. When  he had his 
running account facility  (loan 1) he made 44 drawdowns, an average of about one per week, 
and he borrowed an average of about £1,100 per month.  He then took out an instalment 
loan (loan 2) for £1,000 after a break of just ten days and although it had a term of seven 
months he repaid  it in 27 days. Loan 3 was then approved  after just one week and Mr M 
borrowed more  although it was an amount more or less in line with the monthly average 
Mr M had borrowed in the year before.
Looking at how Mr M was borrowing from Sunny, I think  it ought to have realised by loan 3 
that Mr M was unlikely to be able to continue borrowing in way which  was sustainable.  
Although Mr M had declared a high monthly income (between £3,660 per month at this time 
according to Sunny) hed been  borrowing frequently without any clear sign of being able to 
bring his indebtedness to Sunny to an end. In Mr Ms case  I dont think  his high income  is a 
sign the loans  were likely to be sustainably affordable, particularly  given the very short gaps 
between the loans  which I think signify that Mr M was short of money soon after repaying 
what hed borrowed.  Its unlikely this situation arose  simply because Mr M had a short-term 
cash flow problem and its more likely that there was instead a systemic underlying  financial  
issue.
Ive taken into account that the loans from loan 3 onwards were instalment loans and that 
the contractual repayments may have been low as a percentage of Mr Ms income. But Mr M 
wasnt repaying his loans in accordance with the contractual terms  he was repaying them 
early. Mr M essentially used loan 1 as a series of payday loans and did the same with loan 
2. And so I think it wouldve been reasonable for Sunny  to assume hed keep doing  this 
when he asked for loan 3 and assess his application  on this basis. With this in mind,  the 
loans were large in relation to Mr Ms income.
But in any event, regardless  of the outcome of a pounds  pence affordability assessment, 
I think Sunny  ought to have realised by loan 3 that Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to 
the amount he owed  Sunny. He was in effect paying  expensive  rates  of interest  to service 
what shouldve been a short-term debt to it over a long period of time. And this had the effect 
of prolonging his indebtedness in a way which wasnt fair.
So Im upholding  Mr Ms complaint about loans 3 to 10, in addition to the loans Sunny has 
already agreed  to uphold. 
Ref: DRN09323733putting things right
Sunny should  refund  all the interest and charges Mr M paid on all of his loans, adding 8% 
simple interest per year from when he paid them (if he did) until the date of settlement. 
Sunny should  also remove  any adverse information  it has recorded about loans 1 to 5 from 
Mr Ms credit history. Sunny should  remove all information about loans 6 onwards from 
Mr Ms credit history as the number of loans taken  from this point  is in itself adverse.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny  to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr M a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited must put things right by 
taking the steps  set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 November 2019.

Ref: DRN09323734Appendix  loan table  and notes
The table below  summarises some of the information Sunny provided  about the loans. 
The first loan was a running account  credit agreement;  this was a facility which  allowed  Mr M 
to draw down up to a credit limit (in his case £750) and make repayments  of the principal he 
borrowed in no more  than five months.  From the information Sunny has provided it seems 
Mr M made 44 drawdowns totalling £9,985  in the nine months he had access to the facility.
The other loans  were all instalment  loans with repayments due over a number of months  in 
Mr Ms case it seems  the loans typically had a contractual term of 14 months (I have noted  
some loans had shorter  terms).
