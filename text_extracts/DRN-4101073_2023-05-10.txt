DRN-4101073
The complaint
Mr D complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) provided poor customer service 
when dealing with his banking issue over the telephone. 
What happened
Mr D says he telephoned NatWest in mid-March 2023 to discuss a dispute regarding a 
holiday payment. Mr D says he was not only put on hold several times, but his calls were 
also continually cut off which caused him considerable stress and inconvenience. 
Mr D doesnt feel the offer of £20 NatWest have paid him goes far enough to cover the 
trouble and upset this has caused him. 
NatWest says it has apologised to Mr D for the fact he experienced poor customer service 
and paid him £20 by way of apology. NatWest says in addition it has also paid £16.74 to 
cover the cost of the calls Mr D made that day, which it believes is fair and reasonable. 
Mr D wasnt happy with NatWests response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator felt NatWest acted fairly when it apologised for the issues Mr D experienced 
when he called them in March 2023 and had adequately compensated him for that. 
Mr D didnt agree with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I wont be upholding this complaint and I will explain how I have come to my 
decision. 
I can understand it would have been frustrating for Mr D, who has explained he suffers from 
mental health issues which must be difficult for him, to have been kept waiting on the phone 
and have calls cut off when trying to deal with a holiday payment dispute with NatWest.
When looking at this complaint I will consider if NatWest acted reasonably when it offered 
the compensation it did to Mr D here.
The first thing to say here is NatWest have apologised for the wait times Mr D experienced 
and for any calls cutting out which may have added to the stress Mr D suffers from. I can 
also see NatWest have paid Mr D £20 by way of an apology and covered the cost of his 
telephone calls, that day in March 2023. 
Its worth saying its not my role to penalise businesses when service issues like this arise, 
but to ensure it apologises when these occur and pay a proportionate level of redress  and 
from the information I have seen, I am satisfied NatWest did that here. 
So, without trying to minimise the frustration this matter would have caused Mr D, its fair to 
say we all face frustrations like this from time to time, but that doesnt mean a significant 
level of compensation is always warranted and I am satisfied that is the case here. Afterall 
NatWest have apologised for the delays Mr D encountered and put him back into the 
financial position he was before the event occurred along with a goodwill payment of £20  It 
would be unreasonable of me to ask any more of NatWest than that given the 
circumstances. 
While Mr D will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking anymore of NatWest.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 June 2023.
