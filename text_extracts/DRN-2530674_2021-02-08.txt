The complaint
Mr A isnt happy at that Advanced Payment Solutions Limited, trading as Cashplus, were 
unable to process requests he made to them over the telephone and how they have handled 
his personal information.
What happened
In February 2020 Mr A applied for a business account with CashPlus. Mr A subsequently 
received an email from CashPlus advising that some of the information that Mr A had 
supplied in his application was incorrect. 
Mr A contacted CashPlus by telephone, but because he was unable to correctly answer the 
security questions that CashPlus asked him to enable them to verify that it was Mr A they 
were speaking to, CashPlus were unable to proceed with the call. Mr A asked CashPlus to 
cancel his application, but the advisor refused to do so. Mr A asked to speak with a 
manager, but none were available at that time.
Mr A wasnt happy and so he made a complaint to CashPlus. In his complaint, Mr A advised 
that not only was he unhappy with how CashPlus had handled the telephone call, but also 
that he wanted his account application to be cancelled and for CashPlus to immediately 
delete all of his personal information supplied during the application process.
CashPlus looked at Mr As complaint. They explained that they had been unable to proceed 
with the call because Mr A had been unable to pass the identity verification checks, so they 
didnt uphold Mr As complaint. CashPlus also advised that until such time as they were able 
to positively identify Mr A - which Mr As complaint to them did not achieve - they would be 
unable to take any action to affect the status of the ongoing account application.
Mr A wasnt satisfied with CashPluss response and so he referred his complaint to this 
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but they didnt feel that CashPlus 
had acted unreasonably in this instance and noted that it had been appropriate that 
CashPlus hadnt proceeded with Mr As call when he hadnt been able to pass the identity 
verification checks. 
Our advisor also noted that Mr As account application had been cancelled by CashPlus 
subsequent to Mr As complaint because they hadnt been supplied with the necessary 
verification documents to enable it to continue. Lastly, our advisor acknowledged that 
CashPluss actions with regard to Mr As personal information was appropriate, including 
retaining certain data for money laundering regulations obligations and taking steps to 
ensure that Mr As data held with them was not processed in any way that exceeded this 
requirement. So, our investigator didnt uphold Mr As complaint.
Mr A remained dissatisfied, and so his complaint was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear that Mr A feels strongly about this complaint, but having reviewed all the information 
available to me, including listening to the recording of the telephone call between Mr A and 
CashPlus which initially prompted this complaint, I find that I have arrived at the same 
outcome as our investigator, and for essentially the same reasons.
The provision of business accounts such as the one with CashPlus which Mr A was applying 
for is a regulated activity, and businesses such as CashPlus have an obligation, when 
speaking with a customer on the telephone, to verify that they are in fact speaking to the 
correct person. 
This verification process involves asking questions to the customer about the personal 
information that a business already holds about that customer. I have listened to the 
telephone call and I can confirm that CashPlus advisor was clear that Mr A hadnt been able 
to provide the required answers to those security questions on that occasion. This meant 
that CashPlus had been unable to verify that they were speaking with Mr A, which 
subsequently meant that they werent able to proceed with the call. 
I understand that this must have been frustrating for Mr A, but I cant see what CashPlus 
could have done differently in this instance. The advisor couldnt proceed with the call 
because Mr A hadnt been able to pass the required personal identity verification. 
Additionally, the advisor recommended that Mr A take some time to confirm to himself the 
information that would be needed to pass the verification process, in order that Mr A might 
be able to call CashPlus back and be successfully verified by another agent. CashPlus 
advisor wasnt rude or impatient with Mr A, and so I cant reasonably say that Mr A didnt 
receive an acceptable standard of service from the advisor during the call.
One of Mr As requests on both the telephone call and his subsequent complaint to 
CashPlus was that his application be cancelled, and Mr A was unhappy that CashPlus 
declined to do so. Again, CashPlus did so on the basis that they had been unable to 
sufficiently verify that the request came from Mr A, which meant they were unable to proceed 
with this request. I think that CashPlus acted appropriately in how they handled Mr As 
request here, but I do note that Mr As application has since been cancelled for other 
reasons, and so I will not comment on this aspect of his complaint any further.
Finally, Mr A has expressed his dissatisfaction that CashPlus refused to delete his personal 
information. CashPlus have explained that they have an obligation to retain this information 
for a period of five years in order to comply with money laundering regulations, but that they 
have taken steps to ensure that Mr As personal data is not processed beyond that 
requirement, including retaining the information on a do not promote list. 
I can understand that Mr A may feel that CashPlus should delete his data in accordance with 
his wishes, but Im satisfied that CashPlus explanation and actions in this regard are fair and 
reasonable here, and that they follow Mr As wishes to the maximum extent permitted by 
CashPlus own regulatory obligations.
All of which means that its difficult for me to say that CashPlus acted unreasonably or 
unfairly toward Mr A here. I acknowledge that this wont be the outcome that Mr A was 
hoping for, but I hope he can understand that because CashPlus werent able to verify his 
identity, they werent able to process his requests. I also hope Mr A can understand why this 
means that I wont be upholding his complaint or asking CashPlus to take any further action 
at this time.My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2021.
