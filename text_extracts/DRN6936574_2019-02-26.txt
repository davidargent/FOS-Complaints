K821x#15complaint
Mr D complains that CURO TRANSATLANTIC  LIMITED trading as Wageday  Advance 
(Wageday) lent to him irresponsibly.
Background
Mr D borrowed  15 loans from Wageday  between August 2015 and May 2017. When Mr D 
brought his complaint to us in October  2017 the last loan remained outstanding. That may 
not be the case now as it was some  time ago. 
Several loans were  categorised  as buyback or rollover which  mean that the loan was 
deferred or refinanced in some way. Those  particular details are not set out here.  The 
number of lending  decisions  made  by Wageday exceeds the number of loans. 
The loan table  at the end of this decision is a brief summary of the loans approved by 
Wageday for Mr D. The figures  used  in it may not be exact and this table is not to be used 
for the redress calculations. 
In the final response  letter  to Mr D, Wageday  offered on two loans  but Mr D declined that 
offer and brought his complaint here. 
Our adjudicator thought that Wageday  should  put things right for Mr D in relation to 
Loans 8 to 15 and as she upheld on the basis of unsustainability due to the pattern of 
lending then she recommended  that Mr Ds credit  file be amended by complete removal of 
all reference to Loans 8 to 15 from that file. 
Wageday did not wholly agree. It offered to pay compensation in line with what  our 
adjudicator had recommended. But it offered this from Loan 6 (from the first deferral of Loan  
6 which  Ill refer to as 6A) to Loan 10. Wageday also agreed to remove  these loans from 
Mr Ds credit file. This differs from our adjudicators view in relation to Loans 8 to 15. It did 
not explain why but I accept that Wageday does  not dispute Loans 6A to 10 anymore so I do 
not plan to review  them  in detail  in this decision. 
Mr D has not disagreed with our adjudicators  findings in relation  to the earlier  loans 
(Loans 1 to 7) even though our adjudicator had not been able to properly assess all of them  
as she needed  more information  from Mr D. He said he would send this additional 
information but it has not been received, and so I have nothing new from Mr D. I think that he 
has had many opportunities  to send this to us and so I am proceeding without it. 
The result is that I consider that the first few loans  are undisputed and I do not plan to review 
them in detail, but within the context  of the overall  lending pattern they are highly relevant 
and I take them into account. 
The unresolved ones are Loans  11 to 15 and it is these I plan to review within the context of 
the overall lending. 
Mr D did not agree to Wagedays latest  offer and so the complaint has been  passed to me 
for a decision.
Ref: DRN69365742my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mr Ds case. Ive decided to uphold his complaint in part and have explained  why 
below.
Wageday needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr D 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ds income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate. 
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Ds complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did Wageday, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr D would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr D would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Ds indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did Wageday act unfairly or unreasonably in some  other  way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Ds complaint.
Did Wageday, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks to satisfy  
itself that Mr D would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr D would have been  able to do so?
And as the loans  up to Loan 11 are no longer  in dispute (as I have outlined above) then 
I take this no further.
Ref: DRN69365743Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ds indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which Wageday should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Wageday should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any 
further lending.  Given the particular circumstances  of Mr Ds case, I think that this point  was 
reached by Loan  8 and I say this because:
Wageday ought to have realised  it was likely his indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably as he took more  loans each time
Mr D wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Wageday.  And he was 
in effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended period
Mr D was demonstrating repayment difficulties from an early  stage  there are 
several defaults, deferrals and rollovers  over during  the life of the lending 
relationship. 
I think that Mr D lost out because Wageday  continued to provide borrowing from Loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Ds ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Ds complaint about  Loans  8 to 15 because the overall pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result. And Wageday has conceded in relation  to Loans 6A to 10 
already.
Did Wageday act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude Wageday acted  unfairly  or unreasonably towards  Mr D in some  
other way.  
putting things right  what Wageday  needs  to do
In view of the clear concession from Wageday  in relation to Loans  6A to 10 then I include 
them in this part of the decision for clarity.  Wageday  needs to:
refund  all interest and charges paid on Loans  6A through to 15;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
Wageday has agreed to remove any information  about Loans 6A through to Loan 7 
from Mr Ds credit  file and so I direct it to do that;
and in addition  to the above, the number  of loans taken from Loan 8 to 15 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about Loans 8 to 15 
should be removed  from Mr Ds credit  file.
Ref: DRN69365744* HM Revenue & Customs  requires Wageday to take off tax from this interest.  It must give Mr D a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Ds 
complaint. CURO TRANSATLANTIC LIMITED  trading as Wageday  Advance  should do as 
Ive set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I need to ask Mr D to accept or reject 
my final determination  on or before 26 March 2019.
