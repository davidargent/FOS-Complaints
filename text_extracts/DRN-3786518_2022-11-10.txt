The complaint
Mr K complains that Santander UK Plc (Santander) didnt pay him an incentive.
What happened
Mr K switched his account to Santander and the switch was completed on 18 October 2021. 
Santanders promotion said that if three criteria were met within 60 days,  £130 would be 
paid to the account holder. The conditions were 1) pay in £1,000 2) set up two direct debits 
3) log onto online banking. 
Mr K paid in £963.18 by 16 December 2021  the end of the 60-day period. Santander didnt 
pay him £130.
Mr K complained. He said he should get the incentive of £130. He said he didnt get the 
details of the account until 26 October 2021  so he couldnt start to pay in until then. And 
so, he couldnt pay in a total of £1,000 up to 16 December 2021. He said he met the other 
two criteria.
Santander said Mr K didnt meet the criteria for paying the incentive as he didnt pay in 
£1,000 within 60 days. They declined his complaint.
Mr K brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Santanders terms and conditions 
were clear about the offer. And Mr K didnt pay in £1,000 within 60 days. He said Santander 
were therefore correct to decline to pay the incentive to Mr K.
Mr K asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of this complaint is Santanders terms and conditions for the offer. These say: 
Within 60 days of you instructing us to start the switch to the Qualifying Account, you will 
also need to have:  successfully completed the switch, which includes closing the account 
not held with us; at least two active Direct Debits in place on the Qualifying Account;  funded 
your Qualifying Account with at least £1,000 (either by one or more deposits); and logged 
onto Santander Online or Mobile Banking at least once.
I looked at Mr Ks account  and he paid in £963.18 by 16 December 2021  so that was 
less than the £1,000 needed to qualify for the offer. I can also see he paid in £1,000 on 24 
December 2021  so he was probably hopeful of that being within the 60-day period.
Mr K says he couldnt pay in until after 26 October 2021 because he didnt have the account 
details. But I think its reasonable to say he still had sufficient time to pay the money in 
before the deadline. 
I also noted that the terms and conditions say that the 60-day period ran from when the 
switching process started. Both Santander and Mr K told us the switch was completed on 18 
October 2021  so it is likely that the switching process started about a week before that. So 
actually, the 60-day period could have commenced earlier than 18 October 2021. And that 
wouldve meant it ended earlier than 16 December 2021. Thats not how Santander applied 
their terms in this case, but I think they could have done so if theyd wished.
And so  I am not going to ask Santander to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2022.
