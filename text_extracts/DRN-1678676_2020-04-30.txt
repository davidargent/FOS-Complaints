Mrs G says that adequate checks weren't carried out before the loans were provided and 
that the loans weren't affordable. She says that she was taking on new loans to repay 
existing debt.
Mrs G also says that because the payments were made through a continuous payment 
authority there were times when the loan repayments were prioritised over her priority bills.
Sunny says that before each loan was provided it carried out creditworthiness and 
affordability checks and that Mrs G was required to pay around 5% of her monthly income to 
make the contractual repayments. It says that although Mrs G took out a number of loans 
with it there were significant breaks in the lending.
Our adjudicator upheld this complaint in regard to loan six to 29. She said she hadn't seen 
enough evidence to say that loans one to five shouldn't have been provided. But by loan six, 
she thought that a pattern of borrowing had emerged that suggested Mrs G was persistently 
reliant on short term borrowing. 
Sunny didn't accept our adjudicators view. It said there was a break in lending to Mrs G of 
two months between loans six and seven and four months between loans ten and 11 and 
loans 11 and 12. Sunny made an alternative settlement offer to Mrs G. Mrs G didn't accept 
Sunnys offer.
What I've decided - and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We've set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mrs G 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumer's income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs G could sustainably repay her loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Gs complaint.
Before Mrs G was provided with the loans, Sunny gathered information about her income 
and expenses. I note Mrs Gs comment about the lack of verification but it can be 
reasonable, at least in the early stages of the lending relationship, for the information she 
provided to be relied on unless there were reasons to consider it as not being accurate. In 
this case I find it reasonable that the information provided was relied on at the start of the 
borrowing relationship.
Our adjudicator didn't think there was enough evidence to say that the first five loans 
shouldn't have been provided. Based on the information provided about Mrs G's income and 
expenses and given the size of the repayments (taking into consideration total repayments 
when concurrent loans were taken out), I do not find that I can say that Sunny was wrong to 
consider the first five loans affordable. 
Sunny has noted the breaks in Mrs Gs borrowing but I do not find that these were sufficient 
for Sunny to conclude that Mrs Gs circumstances had changed from what had been the 
situation before the break. Therefore, I have considered all of the loans as part of a single 
lending chain.
I have looked at the overall pattern of Sunny's lending to Mrs G, with a view to seeing if there 
was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldn't 
have provided any further loans.
 
 
 
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Gs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan six. I say this because:
 
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs G was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. She had taken out six loans within six months  at times overlapping with existing loans, and sometimes within days of paying off previous 
loans. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs G was having 
to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Mrs Gs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mrs G's first loan was for £300 and loan six was for £200. However, loan six was 
taken out at while loans four and five were still outstanding showing her indebtedness 
wasn't decreasing and suggesting that she wasn't borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need.
 
From loan six, further loans were provided while previous loans were still 
outstanding or shortly after they were repaid.
 
I think that Mrs G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 
six onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Gs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
 
the number of loans Mrs G borrowed was likely to have had negative implications on 
her ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-
cost loans.
 
Because of this, I uphold this complaint from loan six onwards.
Mrs G also raised concerns about how her payments were taken from her account. While I 
understand the issue she has raised I havent received any evidence regarding the 
continuous payment authority or about any attempts to cancel this. So, I havent considered 
this issue further.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mrs G paid on loans six to 29;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year* on any refunded interest of charges  from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;  
 
the number of loans taken out from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries for loans six to 29 should be removed from 
Mrs Gs credit file. 
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mrs G a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if she asks for one.
 
My final decision
For the reasons above I am partly upholding Mrs G's complaint. Elevate Credit International 
Limited should put things right as set out above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 May 2020.
