 The complaint
 Mr G says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him. 
background
Mr G borrowed 26 loans from Sunny between June 2018 and July 2019. I have set out the 
first 10 loans below: 
Loan number Date taken Date repaid Principal (£)
1 17/06/2018 27/07/2018 150
2 23/06/2018 28/11/2018 50
3 03/07/2018 27/07/2018 150
4 21/07/2018 28/11/2018 50
5 27/07/2018 12/10/2018 250
6 31/07/2018 26/10/2018 150
7 12/10/2018 26/10/2018 50
8 26/10/2018 21/12/2018 250
9 29/11/2018 18/12/2018 200
10 02/12/2018 18/12/2018 150
 
Looking at the information that has been provided to me, it appears there is still an 
outstanding balance on loans 32, 35 and 36. 
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be upheld in respect of loans 8 to 36. Mr G 
didnt dispute what our adjudicator said. Sunny reconsidered its position and offered to settle 
the matter by upholding loans 15 to 36.   Mr G didnt accept that offer and so the matter has 
been passed to me to make a final decision. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
As I said above, Mr G did not dispute what our adjudicator said about loans 1-7. On that 
basis, Ive concluded the parties agree that the complaint shouldn't be upheld in respect of 
that borrowing and so I havent considered these loans further. 
Having considered the evidence in this matter, I agree with our adjudicator and I uphold the 
complaint in respect of loans 8 to 36. Ill explain why below. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. It had to 
find out whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. Im satisfied that by loan 
8, the lending history and pattern of lending clearly demonstrates that the lending was 
unsustainable.
I accept that the loan payments being affordable on a pounds and pence basis might be an 
indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically 
follow this is the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to 
make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint. And Ive also looked at the overall 
pattern of the lending history with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny 
should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. If 
it was, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
As I said above, this point was reached by loan 8. I say this because by then, Sunny ought 
to have realised that Mr G was not repaying his loans sustainably. He had taken out eight 
loans in less than four months. When he applied for loan 8, he had repaid loans 6 and 7 on 
the same day. The amount he applied for was a higher amount than loans 6 and 7 
combined. Sunny ought to have realised it was most likely that Mr G was having to borrow 
further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances. It should 
have been clear that Mr Gs indebtedness was increasing and unsustainable. 
Mr Gs first loan was for £150 and loan 8 was for £250. Sunny should have known that Mr G 
was unlikely to be borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income and that the lending 
was to meet an ongoing need. In addition to that, Mr G wasnt making any real inroads to the 
amount he owed. Loan 36 was taken out 12 months after the first. And it was for a larger 
amount. Mr G had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period.
I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans Mr G borrowed was likely to have had negative implications on 
his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-
cost loans.So Im upholding the complaint about loans 8 to 36. Sunny must take action to put things 
right. 
Putting things right
Sunny should not have given Mr G loans 8 to 36. 
As I said above, there is an outstanding balance on loans 32, 35 and 36. If Sunny has sold 
the outstanding debts, it must buy these back if it is able to do so. It must then take the 
following steps. If it is not able to buy the debts back, it must liaise with the new debt owner 
to achieve the results set out below: 
a. Sunny must add together the total of the repayments made by Mr G towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything it has already refunded; 
b. Sunny must calculate 8% simple interest on the individual payments made by Mr G 
which were considered as part of paragraph (a), calculated from the date Mr G 
originally made the payments to the date the complaint is settled; 
c. Sunny must remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans and treat any repayments made by Mr G as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr G having 
made overpayments, Sunny must refund those overpayments with 8% simple 
interest* calculated on the overpayments. Simple interest must be calculated from 
the date the overpayments would have arisen to the date the complaint is settled. 
Sunny must then refund the amounts calculated at paragraphs (a) and (b) and move 
to step (e). 
d. If there is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts calculated in (a) and (b) 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans (and any 
principal that has already been written off). If this results in a surplus, the surplus 
should be paid to Mr G. However, if there is still an outstanding balance, Sunny must 
try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr G. It shouldnt pursue outstanding 
balance made up of principal it has already written off. 
e. The overall pattern of borrowing for loans 8 to 36 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. Sunny should remove these loans entirely from Mr Gs credit 
file. It does not have to remove the loans from the credit file until they have been 
repaid  but it should still remove any adverse information recorded about them. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr G 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
 My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Gs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited must put things right as I have set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 March 2020.
