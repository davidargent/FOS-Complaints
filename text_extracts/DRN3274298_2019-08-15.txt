K820x#14complaint
Mr O complains about the service he received from LeasePlan  UK Limited.
background
In October  2015 Mr O was supplied  with a car and entered into a conditional sale agreement  
with LeasePlan.  Mr O settled the agreement in full in October 2018.
On 23 October 2018 Mr O received a letter from a third party instructed by LeasePlan 
advising him that he owed £70.81.
Mr O contacted the third party to complain about  the incorrect  demand for payment. He says 
his emails and calls were ignored  and that a representative swore at him. 
In response to Mr Os complaint LeasePlan explained that it had received his payment  of 
£14,536.14 on 5 October  2018  but due to its internal processes  the agreement  hadnt been 
terminated until 16 October 2018  resulting  in a balance  of £70.81.  LeasePlan apologised for 
the error  and offered to pay compensation  of £500.
Mr O wasnt happy with the response  and complained to this service. Hes unhappy that he 
received what he describes as a threatening letter for a sum which wasnt due and about the 
level of customer service  he received.  Hes also unhappy that LeasePlan  processed  
incorrect personal data.
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. She said the offer of compensation made by 
LeasePlan was fair and reasonable. 
Mr O didnt agree. He felt that the compensation didnt reflect  the impact of what had 
happened and felt that LeasePlan  should  be made  accountable for its actions.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Since the investigator issued her view, Mr O has received  a decision form the ICO, who 
determined that LeasePlan failed to keep his personal data up to date and accurate. The 
ICO also said that LeasePlan  had a legitimate right to process  Mr Os data including sharing 
it with service suppliers.
The role of this service is not to determine  whether LeasePlan infringed  data protection  
legislation. Nor is it the role of this service to punish  a business. So for the purposes  of this 
complaint Ive looked at whether LeasePlan made  an error  or acted unfairly  or unreasonably. 
Ive also looked  at what LeasePlan has done to try and put things  right. 
LeasePlan has acknowledged that it made an error  when it instructed a third party  that Mr O 
owed money. It has explained how the error  occurred and has confirmed that Mr Os credit 
file wasnt affected.  It has also apologised.
I appreciate that it would have been  upsetting for Mr O to receive a demand for payment 
when he wasnt expecting  it, and I understand his concerns about the possible impact on his 
Ref: DRN32742982credit rating. That said, Im satisfied that LeasePlan has made an appropriate apology and I 
havent seen any information to suggest  that Mr Os credit file was negatively affected.
LeasePlan has also accepted that the service received by Mr O when  he telephoned wasnt 
acceptable. It says it has addressed the suppliers conduct directly. Im satisfied that 
LeasePlan has responded reasonably to this aspect  of the complaint and I dont think its 
necessary for LeasePlan to tell either Mr O or this service what  action it has taken against its 
supplier.
I appreciate that Mr O has strong views  that LeasePlan should be held accountable for 
passing incorrect data to a third party.  As Ive already said,  its not the role of this service to 
punish a business. LeasePlan has admitted that (amongst other things)  it processed  
incorrect personal data.  In such circumstances I would expect LeasePlan to pay 
compensation for the trouble and upset  caused.
In this case, LeasePlan has offered compensation of £500.  Although  I understand that Mr O 
feels that this amount  isnt enough, Im of the view that £500 is fair and reasonable.
For the reasons  Ive given I dont uphold the complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 September  2019.
