K821x#15complaint
Mr B has complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called  
Provident Personal Credit Limited,  trading at the time as Satsuma. Mr B says he was lent 
to irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Satsuma throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Mr B took out some 17 instalment loans from Satsuma between January 
2015 and September 2018. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Bs borrowing with Satsuma, 
based on the information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this 
decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan number  5 onwards. Satsuma hasnt responded to this, so the 
complaint has come  to me for an ombudsmans final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Bs 
complaint.
Satsuma needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr 
B could  repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These  checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Satsuma should  have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Satsuma was required to establish  
Ref: DRN30394792whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr B could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Satsuma told us it carried out certain  affordability and credit checks before agreeing  to lend 
to Mr B. Ive thought  about this and Ive also looked at the overall pattern of lending history  
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Satsuma  should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  Ive considered  whether, at 
some point, Satsuma should  have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Bearing in mind what Ive said above  about the length of the lending relationship, I think the 
checks which Satsuma most likely  carried out appear to have been proportionate for loans  1 
 4. And I think these  levels of checks,  together with the income and expenditure details  
provided by Mr B, would  have made  those particular  loans appear affordable.  I accept its 
possible that even  at that point Mr B might have  been experiencing financial problems, but 
theres no evidence  that the level or depth of the financial checks would have exposed this. I 
therefore dont  uphold the complaint about  loans 1  4.
However, I think the emerging pattern of repeated lending from the point of loan 5 onwards 
in this case would have looked  different and therefore required a much more  thorough  and 
responsible approach. The overall  pattern of Satsumas lending to Mr B should  have caused 
it to see, in my view,  that it shouldnt have  provided any further loans from this point 
onwards. 
This is because hed been lent to continuously  at this point for 18 months  or so. He was also 
asking to borrow whilst a previous loan was still outstanding and the amount  he was allowed 
to borrow was starting to rise again. So Satsuma  ought to have realised that Mr B wasnt 
merely borrowing to deal with short-term  cash-flow problems; he was borrowing regularly, to 
address shortfalls  in his income  and to meet an ongoing need.  Mr B was having to 
consistently take out high interest, short-term  lending over a sustained period and the 
indebtedness caused by this type of borrowing was harmful, in my view. Satsuma should 
have seen this and ought to have realised Mr B was at risk of not managing  to repay the 
loans sustainably or getting into financial difficulties.  
So Im upholding  this complaint in respect of loans 5 - 17. Satsuma repeatedly  lent to Mr B in 
an unsustainable manner  because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr B borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans
Ref: DRN30394793putting things right  what Satsuma needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 5 - 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 - 17 should be completely 
removed from Mr Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Satsuma to take off tax from this interest.  Satsuma must  give Mr B a 
certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Bs complaint. Provident  Personal Credit Limited 
should put things right for Mr B as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 May 2020.
