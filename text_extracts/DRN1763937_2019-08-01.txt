K821x#15complaint
Mr P says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 7 short term high cost loans QuickQuid provided  to Mr P between 
August 2012 and June 2015.  Loans  1 to 4, 6 and 7 were payday loans and loan 5 was a flex 
credit account. Four of the loans were topped up and two were refinanced. This is a 
summary of Mr Ps lending  history  from QuickQuid.

*Mr Ps credit limit was increased to £1250 in May 2015.
** the adjudicator said this was a new loan but I understand it to be the refinancing of loan 6.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ps complaint in part and thought from the first top up on loan 4 
no further loans  should have been  given. QuickQuid disagreed so the complaint was passed 
to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr P 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
Ref: DRN17639372number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading guidance on Irresponsible Lending, and 
later the Consumer Credit  Sourcebook (CONC)  defines sustainable  as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator that there was nothing to indicate  QuickQuid needed  to do more  
when it approved loan 1. And whilst it should have carried out more checks for loans 2 to 4, I 
havent seen any evidence that better information would have made  a difference  to the 
lending decision.  So I dont think QuickQuid was wrong to give loans 1 to 4 to Mr P.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of QuickQuids  lending history with Mr P, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think  that this point  was reached at the 
time of the first top up on loan 4. I say this because:
Ref: DRN17639373By this stage in the relationship Mr P had borrowed six times in ten months, he had 
needed to top up loan 2 and then refinance  it, deferring the repayment of both the 
initial loan and the top up. Loan 3 was then for significantly more than his first loan 
and taken only 10 days after hed repaid loan 2. 
I accept loan 4 was for a lower amount and taken nearly four months later  which  is 
why I am not upholding the complaint at that point. But Mr P requested the first top 
up to loan 4 around three weeks later. And it was for a significant amount  
increasing the value of loan 4 to ten times  that of his first loan. 
Then from loan 5 onwards Mr P was provided  with a new loan within  days  of settling 
a previous one. And this was after Mr P had needed to defer the repayment date of 
loan 4. So QuickQuid  ought to have  realised it was more  likely than not Mr P was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances and that Mr Ps indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr P was provided with loans  for a largely unbroken period of 34 months.  In this time 
the value he borrowed  increased  significantly from £50 for loan 1 to £1150  for loan 7 
(including top ups). So not only was he not making  any real inroads to the amount he 
owed QuickQuid his indebtedness was increasing. So Mr P was paying rapidly 
growing amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Quick  Quid  over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr P lost out because of the loans QuickQuid provided  from the first top up on 
loan 4 onwards.  I say this because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ps ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  the first top up on loan 4 to loan 7 and QuickQuid 
should put things right. 
I have considered CashEuroNets response to our adjudicators  view,  saying that we havent 
shown the lending was unsustainable;  that there was no distinctive pattern of borrowing in 
Mr Ps lending  history; and that Mr P often didnt borrow the maximum he could. But these 
points dont change  my conclusion. Ill explain why.
I accept that Mr Ps borrowing behaviour fluctuated but that doesnt alter my finding that from 
the first top up of loan 4 to loan 7 the business unfairly extended his use of high cost short 
term credit. There is a clear overall  trend showing Mr P was becoming  increasingly 
dependant on high cost short term credit. I say this as the final value of loan 7 was £1150,  
compared to loan 1 which was for £50. I disagree that Mr P opting to borrow less than the 
maximum available is an indication that the lending  was sustainable.  I think QuickQuid would 
have needed a lot more  information on Mr Ps financial situation  to fairly reach that 
conclusion. And Mr Ps ongoing  use of high cost short  term credit  lasted for over 34 months  - 
a period which cant be described as the short-term  timeframe it is supposed to help people 
out for. 
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
Ref: DRN17639374refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid from the first  top up on loan 4 to loan 7 
including all top ups and refinancing;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
write off any unpaid interest and charges on loan 7, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr P*; 
the number  of loans taken from the first top up on loan 4 means any information 
recorded about loans 4 to 7 is adverse. So all entries about loan 4 to 7 should  be 
removed from Mr Ps credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr P a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one. If QuickQuid  intends to apply 
the refund to reduce  any outstanding capital  balance, it must do so after deducting the tax.
*If after taking  these  steps Mr P still owes money on loan 7, QuickQuid  must treat him fairly  and 
sympathetically when trying to reach any agreement on how to repay the outstanding principal due.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ps complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) should pay Mr P compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 September 2019.
