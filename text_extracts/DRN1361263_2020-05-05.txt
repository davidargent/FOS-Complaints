K821x#15Complaint
Ms Y (by way of a representative) says Elevate  Credit International Limited  (trading as 
Sunny) failed to identify her loans were  unaffordable. Ms Y also says she had to borrow 
additional loans  (often from other payday  lenders)  in order to make  her repayments which 
resulted in her being trapped in a debt spiral.  
Background
Ms Y took out a running credit facility (CRF)  with a £150 credit  limit in September  2013 
followed by 13 instalment loans. A summary  of Ms Ys borrowing based on the information 
Sunny has provided  can be found below;

When Ms Y initially complained to Sunny is didnt uphold her complaint as it didnt think  it had 
done anything  wrong. Unhappy with this response, Ms Y brought  her complaint to our service. 
An adjudicator reviewed the complaint and thought  the complaint should be upheld from 
when Ms Y took her drawdown on the RCF on 28 March 2014. The adjudicator said that 
Sunny had an obligation to monitor the account and at this point he didnt think  further  
lending was sustainable. He also said giving Ms Y further loans after the RCF had the same  
effect as if shed carried on using the facility. 
Sunny didnt agree with the adjudicators  assessment, but they did make an offer to uphold 
the complaint  from the 11th drawdown  under  the RCF which was taken on 31/08/2014 as 
well as instalment loans 2  14.  
Ms Y didnt accept Sunnys offer and because  no agreement  could be reached the complaint 
has been passed to me for a final decision.
Ref: DRN13612632My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ys complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to reasonably 
conclude Ms Y could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ms Y appears to accept the findings  of our adjudicator. And Sunny  has already accepted 
something went wrong when it provided  the 11th RCF drawdown as well all the instalment 
loans. Therefore, I no longer think those loans are in dispute, so I will not be making a 
finding on them. Instead, this decision will focus  on how Ms Y used  her RCF. 
The relevant  regulations  in place at the time Ms Y was given her RCF 
I think it would be helpful for me to start by explaining that Sunny gave Ms Y her RCF when it was 
regulated by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). The OFT had issued guidance  on this type of 
lending and what it says should be expected from lenders when granting these types  of loans.
To be clear, Ms Y wasnt given a payday loan where  she had to repay all of what  she 
borrowed plus the interest due when she next got paid. She was given a facility where there 
was an expectation  that shed repay what she borrowed plus the interest due within  a period 
of five months. Had she wanted  to drawdown  her full credit limit of £150, the highest 
repayment she needed to make was £62.06  per month. So overall, I think  that this means the 
checks Sunny carried out had to provide enough information for it to be able to understand 
whether Ms Y would likely be able to service  this facility within a reasonable period of time.
Ref: DRN13612633In, Section  2.2 of the General Principles of Fair Business Practice section of the OFT 
guidance says:  creditors should monitor the borrowers repayment record during the course of 
the credit  agreement, offering assistance where borrowers appear  to be experiencing financial 
difficulty. So after the facility was approved, Sunny  had an obligation to monitor how Ms Y 
may use the facility and then step in if there  appeared  to be signs  of financial difficulty.
Our adjudicator thought Sunny shouldve seen that there was likely a problem by the time 
Ms Y applied for the 5th drawdown  on 28 March  2014. By this point, our adjudicator  thought 
that Sunny would have seen that Ms Ys borrowing  history showed he was having financial 
difficulties because she was potentially reliant  on the facility.
At the start of the lending relationship, I dont think Sunny had any cause for concern. Ms Y 
initially drew down the full amount permitted under the agreement and started to make 
repayments the following month  (October) and the same in November. In December Ms Y 
took a drawdown  back up to her credit limit. 
Ms Y cleared the balance  on the facility at the end of February 2014 and within two weeks  
borrowed the full amount  available  to her. 10 days later Ms Y then repaid the balance in full 
along with the interest  that was due. Three days later Ms Y returned  for the full amount 
available to her. 
By the time Ms Y returned for her final drawdown  in March 2014,  she had already had the 
facility for just over 6 months  and had spent the whole  time repaying the outstanding 
balance. This was now longer than the credit agreement had expected  repayments  taking  
and at this point, Ms Y owed the full capital balance when Sunny wouldve expected  to have 
made some inroads  in to repaying what she owed. 
Given the obligation on Sunny at the time,  I think it ought to have had real concerns about
Ms Ys ability to manage  the account in the way it expected by March 2014. So as a 
responsible lender it ought to have  realised that Ms Y wouldnt be in a position to sustainably 
manage any repayments moving  forward because she wasnt using the facility  as intended 
by Sunny. So Sunny shouldve stopped Ms Y from taking further drawdowns.
As Ive said above,  Sunny  has already accepted loans  2  14 shouldnt have been given, so 
Im not making any findings about  those  loans. But I have, for clarity included what  it needs 
to do put things right for these loans in the redress below. 
Putting things  right  what  Sunny needs to do
So in addition to what Sunny has agreed to do, it should do the following;
refund all interest  and charges Ms Y paid on drawdowns from 28 March  2014 until her 
facility closed  as well as interest  and charges on loans  2 - 14;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative  information from Ms Ys credit file about her running  credit facility 
from 28 March  2014 and loans 1 and 2; 
Ref: DRN13612634the number of loans  taken from loan 3 onwards means any information recorded about  
them is adverse.  So all entries  about loans  3  14 should be removed from 
Ms Ys credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Ms Y a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Ms Ys complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  pay Ms Y compensation as set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms Y to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 June 2020.
