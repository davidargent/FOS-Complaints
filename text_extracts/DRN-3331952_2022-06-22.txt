The complaint
Ms R, through a representative, says NewDay Ltd irresponsibly lent to her.
What happened
Ms R took out a credit card from NewDay in October 2016, she was given a credit limit of 
£250. In October 2017 NewDay increased this to £500.
Ms R says the lending was never affordable and this would have been clear to NewDay had
it completed adequate checks.
Our investigator said Ms Rs complaint should be upheld in part. She found NewDay wasnt 
wrong to have opened the account initially, but that it should not have increased Ms Rs 
credit limit in July 2017. 
NewDay disagreed, saying it acted fairly  it carried out sufficient checks and saw no 
indicators of financial strain at the time of the limit increase. Ms R had no arrears, no 
overdraft and hadnt incurred any late payment fees.
As an agreement wasnt reached the complaint was passed to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending -
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
NewDay is required to lend responsibly. It needed to conduct checks to make sure that the
credit facilities it was giving to Ms R were affordable and sustainable. Such checks need to
be proportionate to things like the credit limits it offered Ms R, how much she had to repay
(including interest and charges) each month, her borrowing history with it and what it knew
about her circumstances. But there is no set list of checks it had to do.
This means to reach my decision I need to consider if NewDay carried out proportionate
checks at the time of the card application and limit increase; if so, did it make fair lending
decisions based on the results of its checks; and if not, what better checks would most likely
have shown.
The card application and initial credit limit
When Ms R applied for the card I can see NewDay asked about Ms Rs employment and 
residential status and for details of her gross annual income. It completed an external credit 
search to check her credit history and existing credit commitments. It has provided the data it 
collected at the time.
Ive looked at the data and I can see Ms R told NewDay that she was employed with an
annual income of £29,000. The credit check shows that Ms R had three active accounts with 
a total outstanding balance of £1,700. They were all up-to-date. It did show she had some 
historic defaults but the most recent was 31 months prior. Given this application was for a 
relatively low limit, and as her credit check did not return any recent adverse information, I 
dont think there was anything that should have prompted NewDay to think Ms R was in 
financial difficulty or that further checks were needed to verify what Ms R had told it. 
It follows that I dont think NewDay was wrong to give the card, with its £250 credit limit, to 
Ms R.
The credit limit increase
Prior to increasing the credit limit to £500 NewDay reviewed Ms Rs spending and payment 
behaviour on her card, as well as the value and status of her external borrowings. I wont 
comment on whether or not I find these checks to be proportionate, as I dont think NewDay 
made a fair lending decision based on the information it gathered. Ill explain why.
NewDay could see from its internal data that Ms R was either at or close to her limit from 
account opening, exceeding it one month with a cash withdrawal  at times an indicator of 
financial strain. But more critically, from the external credit data it collected it could see Ms R 
had started using payday loans the month after getting her card, and had continued to do so 
each month (except in one out of the nine months). 
So I disagree with NewDays position that there were no signs of financial strain. It cites no 
arrears, overdraft or late fees as evidence of this. But I would argue that such consistent use 
of high-cost short-term loans shows Ms R was most likely having problems managing her 
money and was caught in a cycle of borrowing to repay. Most likely that was how she was 
managing to meet her credit commitment and as NewDay knows the regulator does not 
consider that to be sustainable borrowing. So I cant see it had the reassurances it needed 
that extending Ms Rs available credit would not be financially harmful for her. It follows I 
think NewDay was wrong to increase Ms Rs credit limit. 
In summary, whilst I find NewDay wasnt wrong to approve Ms Rs card application and give 
a £250 opening limit, it should not have increased her limit. And so it follows its only right it 
now puts things right.
Putting things right
NewDay should:
Refund all interest, fees and charges applied to balances over £250 from July 2017 
to the date of settlement.
If the effect of removing these interest, fees and charges results in there no longer
being an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments
and returned to Ms R along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from
the date they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement.
If there remains an outstanding balance NewDay should ensure the current 
repayment plan once adjusted remains suitable for Ms R.
Amend Ms Rs credit file to remove all adverse information recorded from July 2017 
to date.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to take off tax from this interest. NewDay must
give Ms R a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one. My final decision
I am upholding Ms Rs complaint in part. NewDay Ltd must put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms R to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 July 2022.
