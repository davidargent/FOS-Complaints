and March 2016. Mr Ks borrowing history  is as follows:

Our adjudicator partly upheld Mr Ks complaint and thought that loans 6 and 7 shouldnt  have  
been given because the overall pattern of Mr Ks borrowing  indicated  he was reliant  on these 
loans and the borrowing was becoming unsustainable. Mr Lender disagreed saying it had 
questioned Mr K when  he applied  for loan 6 and loan 7 was for a much  smaller amount. Mr 
Lender asked for an ombudsmans review, so the complaint was passed to me.
I issued a provisional decision in January 2020,  explaining that whilst I thought Mr Lender 
should have done more  detailed checks before  it approved  further lending  to Mr K for loans 
6 and 7, I didnt have any evidence of what it would have found doing  those checks. And on 
that basis, I couldnt fairly say Mr Lender had done anything wrong. But I asked everyone to 
provide me anything  further it wanted  me to consider before I issued my final decision.
Mr K responded and sent copies of his bank statements from around the time of loans 6   
and 7 were given. These showed he was borrowing from other short-term lenders.  As this 
was new information,  one of our adjudicators  shared the information with Mr Lender  and 
explained that this now showed  that had Mr Lender done proportionate  checks it would have 
found Mr K was struggling financially and it shouldnt have lent to him. 
Mr Lender disagreed and explained that there were regular gaps in borrowing which it 
considered showed Mr K wasnt reliant on the borrowing and he always  managed to repay 
his borrowing without  any cause for concern. It also said it asked Mr K further  questions  
before it lent him loan 6, and none of the answers he gave prompted  it to look further  into his 
circumstances at the time. As the complaint couldnt  be resolved informally,  its been passed 
back to me to issue my final decision on. 
my findings
Ive now reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments  to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
Ref: DRN89688542complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
As I explained in my provisional decision,  Mr Lender  needed  to take reasonable steps to 
ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In practice  this means that it should have carried  out 
proportionate checks to make sure Mr K could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much  was being lent, the 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr K could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint. Having done this, Im now partially  upholding 
the complaint.  Ill explain  why. 
Neither of our adjudicators thought Mr Lender  needed to do more  when  it approved loans 1 
to 5. Mr K hasnt provided any further evidence or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be 
making any further findings on these loans because these loans no longer appear  to be in 
dispute. This just leaves  loans 6 and 7 for me to consider. 
By the point of loan 6, Mr K had been  borrowing on and off from Mr Lender for just over a 
year and this loan was his largest to date.  So, I think this should have given Mr Lender 
Ref: DRN89688543cause for concern about what Mr K was telling it about his financial position. And although  
Mr Lender said it asked  further questions of Mr Ks circumstances before  it lent him this loan,  
it ought to have taken further steps to verify  the information he was giving it. Such as asking 
to see his bank  statements  or for copies of his payslips and/or bills. 
As both our adjudicators explained, a proportionate  check for loans 6 and 7 would  have 
shown that Mr K was borrowing from other short-term lenders around the same time. The 
repayments of these loans were  increasing his monthly outgoings. Also having reviewed his 
bank statements, Mr K was exceeding his monthly income most months and was clearly 
struggling financially. 
So Im upholding  Mr Ks complaint about  loans 6 and 7. 
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans 6 and 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 6 and 7 from Mr Ks credit  file;
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest.  Mr Lender must  give 
Mr K a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ks complaint. PDL Finance Limited  
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 May 2020.
