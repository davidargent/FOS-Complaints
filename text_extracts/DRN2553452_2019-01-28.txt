K820x#14complaint
This complaint is about a mortgage payment protection  insurance (PPI) policy  taken out in 
1996. Mr and Mrs B say National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-sold them the PPI. 
They applied for the mortgage and PPI policy in a meeting with NatWest and the policy 
provided cover for Mr B only. Mrs B wasnt covered by the policy.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr and Mrs Bs case.
Ive decided the PPI wasnt  mis-sold because:
Mr and Mrs B say it wasnt made  clear  to them that the PPI was optional.  
Mr and Mrs B bought the PPI in a meeting. Mr and Mrs B and NatWest havent  been 
able to provide  much  detail about what was said in this meeting. And there  isnt much 
paperwork from the time of sale either. Thats understandable given the time that has 
passed. But it means I dont know exactly what was discussed.   
So Ive thought carefully  about  what Mr and Mrs B and NatWest  have  said.  And Ive 
also used what I know about  NatWests sales processes to help me make my 
decision. Having  done this, I dont  have enough  to say that its likely NatWest told 
Mr and Mrs B that they needed  to buy a PPI policy. I think its more  likely NatWest 
made it clear that Mr and Mrs B didnt have to take out the PPI and they chose to 
take it out  although  I can understand why they cant remember this.
Mr and Mrs B say they were pressured into buying the PPI by NatWest.  And I dont 
doubt their genuine  feelings  about what happened in the meeting. But other than 
raising this issue they havent provided any detail as to why they felt pressured.  
Again thats  understandable  given the time thats passed.  But this does mean I 
havent seen enough to uphold the complaint only on what  theyve said.
NatWest recommended the PPI to Mr and Mrs B so it had to check that the PPI was 
right for them  and based on what Ive seen of their circumstances  at the time, I 
think that it was. For example Mr B wasnt affected by any of the exclusions to or 
limits on the PPI cover and they seem  to have had a need for the cover.  
Its possible the information NatWest gave Mr and Mrs B about the PPI wasnt  as 
clear as it shouldve  been.  But they chose to take it out - so it looks like they wanted 
this type of cover. And it seems  like it would have been useful for them if something 
went wrong. It also looks like it was affordable. So I dont think  better information 
about the PPI would have put them off taking  out the cover. 
Ive also thought about the commission Mr and Mrs B paid on their PPI  and whether 
NatWest treated them unfairly.  
Ref: DRN25534522NatWest has told us that the commission  for Mr and Mrs Bs PPI was less than half of what  
they paid for each  premium. Weve looked  at how NatWest has been  working  this out and 
based on what weve seen it looks like its right  Mr and Mrs Bs commission  was less than 
half the cost of the PPI. As thats the case,  I dont think it needed to tell them about the 
commission  so I dont  think  NatWest treated them unfairly. This means  it doesnt need  to 
pay Mr and Mrs B back any of the commission they paid for the PPI. 
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision  before  28 February  2019.
