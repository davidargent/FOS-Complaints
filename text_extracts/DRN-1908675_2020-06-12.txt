The complaint
Ms G complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner. 
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in April 2020 that I summarise below.
Ms G was given 10 loans by Sunny between July and November 2017. Each of the loans 
was due to be repaid in six monthly instalments but Ms G repaid many of them far earlier. At 
times Ms G had up to four loans outstanding at the same time. Seven of Ms Gs loans have 
been fully repaid but three remained outstanding when she made her complaint. A summary 
of Ms Gs borrowing from Sunny is shown below;

In my provisional decision I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, and 
in particular that the checks Sunny needed to do would need to take into account things 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I thought less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
I thought that the checks Sunny did before agreeing the first two loans were proportionate. 
So I didn't think it had been wrong for Sunny to agree to give these loans to Ms G.
DRN-1908675I thought that the amounts Ms G needed to repay on loans 3 to 5, when considering the 
combined repayments on the loans she had open at the same time, formed a substantial 
proportion of her declared income. I didn't think it was reasonable for Sunny to have 
concluded these loans were sustainably affordable and so they shouldn't have been agreed.
And I thought that, by the time of loan 6, Sunny should have realised that the overall pattern 
of Ms G's borrowing should have suggested that any further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldn't provide further loans. 
I asked Sunny to pay Ms G some compensation in relation to loans 3 to 10.
Neither Ms G nor Sunny has provided us with any further evidence or information in 
response to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Given that neither party has provided 
me with any new evidence or further comments I see no reason to alter the conclusions 
I reached in my provisional decision.
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to give loans 3 to 10 to Ms G. Sunny needs to pay 
her some compensation.
Putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Ms G after, and including, the loan that she 
took on 4 August 2017 (loan 3). So Sunny should; 
refund all the interest and charges Ms G paid on loans 3 to 5, loan 7, and loan 10
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loans 6, 8, and 9 and treat any
payments Ms G made towards these loans as payments towards the capital
if reworking these loan accounts as Ive directed results in Ms G effectively having
made payments above the original capital borrowed on any individual loan, then
Sunny should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of
settlement.
if reworking these loan accounts leaves an amount of capital still to be paid on any
individual loan, then Sunny can use any refunds due on the other loans (after the
deduction of tax) to offset this. And if there is still an outstanding capital balance on
any loan then I remind Sunny that it should take a sympathetic view when seeking to
agree an affordable repayment plan with Ms G
remove any adverse information recorded on Ms Gs credit file in relation to
loans 3 to 5
remove all information about loans 7 and 10, and about loans 6, 8, and 9 when they
have been fully repaid, from Ms Gs credit file
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Ms G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold most of Ms Gs complaint and direct Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things right as detailed above. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 July 2020.
