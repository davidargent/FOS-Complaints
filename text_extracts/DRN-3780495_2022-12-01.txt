The complaint
Mrs M complains that Abbey Insurance Brokers Ltd (trading as AbbeyAutoline) didnt do 
enough to assist her with her motor insurance claim.
Mrs M has also brought a complaint about the insurer to our service. In this decision, I have 
only considered Mrs Ms complaint against AbbeyAutoline.
What happened
Your text here In March 2022, Mrs Ms car was damaged by an object left lying in the road. 
She arranged for the recovery of the vehicle and advised an agent of the insurer of the 
accident.
Mrs M sent a letter of complaint to AbbeyAutoline where she raised concerns about how her 
claim was being handled. AbbeyAutoline said it had no involvement with her claim so was 
unable to comment on the queries shed raised. However, as her broker it had raised her 
concerns with the insurer directly. 
Mrs M wasnt satisfied with AbbeyAutolines response. She felt that AbbeyAutoline had 
shown a lack of concern towards her as a long-standing customer. She thought 
AbbeyAutoline should have done more to help her. So, she asked our service to consider 
her complaint.
Our investigator looked into Mrs Ms concerns but didnt think her complaint should be 
upheld. She said AbbeyAutoline had no involvement with the logging or management of   
Mrs Ms claim as it was the broker. It had contacted the insurer to raise Mrs Ms concerns on 
her behalf and this is what it would reasonably be expected to do. 
Mrs M disagreed with our investigators outcome. So, her complaint has been passed to me 
to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mrs Ms complaint. Ill explain why.
I understand Mrs M is unhappy with how her motor insurance claim has been handled. 
However, this is the responsibility of the insurer. As a broker, AbbeyAutoline is responsible 
for arranging, selling and administrating insurance policies. 
I appreciate Mrs M feels that AbbeyAutoline should have done more to assist her as a long-
standing customer. However, having checked its terms of business, Im satisfied that 
AbbeyAutoline was not required to handle the claim on behalf of Mrs M. So, I think it was 
right to refer her concerns to the insurer. And Im not persuaded it needed to do anything 
more.
I know my answer will be disappointing for Mrs M, but Im satisfied AbbeyAutoline has acted 
fairly and reasonably.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2022.
