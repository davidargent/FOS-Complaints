The complaint
Mrs D and Mr D complain that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) returned unpaid a 
cheque theyd issued from their joint account.
What happened
On or around 2 June 2021, Mr D issued a cheque from his joint account held with NatWest. 
The cheque related to a property purchase and was issued to Mrs D and Mr Ds solicitor. 
Shortly afterwards, their solicitor contacted them to advise the cheque hadnt been paid. So, 
they visited a local NatWest branch on or around 7 June 2021 to find out what had 
happened.
NatWest told Mrs D and Mr D that the cheque wasnt paid as it hadnt been drawn in 
accordance with the mandate. Mrs D said the account had been opened many years before 
by Mr D with her name being added later.  She said previous cheques issued had all been 
paid without difficulty. Mrs D thought Mr Ds name had been removed from the account in 
error as it was he whod signed the cheque.
NatWest arranged an electronic payment for the cheque amount to Mrs D and Mr Ds 
solicitor. They also refunded the associated electronic payment charge of £23 to Mrs D and 
Mr Ds account. Mrs D says that NatWest offered to pay them £200 to reflect any distress 
and inconvenience caused. But Mr D didnt accept this as he thought NatWest should pay 
more. So, Mrs D and Mr D escalated their concerns in a complaint.
NatWest responded to their complaint in a letter dated 23 June 2021. They said they didnt 
hold a copy of Mr Ds signature on their files. And as the cheque issued was for a large 
amount, extra checks were carried out. Mr D had signed the cheque, but NatWest couldnt 
verify the signature. They said theyd emailed Mr D asking him to contact them about the 
cheque. NatWest said their account terms and conditions entitled them to refuse the 
payment in these circumstances and didnt agree theyd done anything wrong. 
NatWests letter also addressed another complaint point about Mrs D and Mr Ds experience 
when talking to them on the telephone. NatWest paid compensation of £25 to reflect their 
failing in that matter.
Mrs D and Mr D werent happy with NatWests response. So, they referred their complaint to 
this service. To resolve matters, they now wanted NatWest to pay compensation of £200 
they believe had previously been offered.
Having considered all the information and evidence available, our investigator didnt think 
NatWest needed to take any further action. He thought NatWests resolution of their 
complaint was fair and reasonable.
Mrs D and Mr D didnt agree with our investigators findings. They said Mr Ds removal from 
the account was due to a NatWest error, not their own. They thought it was this that had 
caused the problem and stressed they hadnt authorised the removal of Mr Ds signature 
from the account.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Mrs D and Mr Ds complaint has been passed to me 
to consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As part of Mrs D and Mr Ds referral to this service, they raised concerns about the way 
NatWest handled their complaint. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Handbook defines 
the type of complaints that can be considered by this service under the DISP rules. These 
principally relate to regulated financial services. Complaint handling isnt a regulated 
financial service in its own right. So, unfortunately, this service isnt able to consider any 
concerns about how NatWest handled Mrs D and Mr Ds complaint here. So, Im unable to 
consider this aspect any further.
When the cheque issued by Mr D was presented for payment, NatWest identified it as it was 
for a higher amount than normally seen. So, their processes required them to complete extra 
checks to verify the authenticity of the payment instructed. This included verifying the 
signature on the cheque. But NatWest werent able to do that here as they couldnt find a 
sample of Mr Ds signature. 
Signature records can often date back many years. In this case, Mr D says he originally 
opened the bank account with NatWest 40 years ago. And while Im sure NatWest wouldve 
had a copy of Mr Ds signature at that time, system and process changes over time may 
have led to that no longer being available to them. It may simply have been mislaid or lost 
over time. So, I think it was important that NatWest took steps to address that.
Ive seen evidence that NatWest did email Mr D early on the morning the cheque was 
presented for payment, asking him to contact them. Unfortunately, it doesnt appear Mr D 
saw that email in time. So, NatWest returned the cheque unpaid. Given the circumstances, I 
believe NatWests actions were reasonable here. As they couldnt verify the signature on the 
cheque, they wanted to protect Mrs D and Mr Ds money from any potential loss. I think 
NatWests account terms and conditions allow them to do that. And NatWest did try to 
contact Mr D, albeit unsuccessfully.
When Mrs D and Mr D visited the NatWest branch on 7 June 2021, NatWest arranged an 
immediate same day electronic payment to their solicitor and refunded the associated 
charge. I understand Mrs D and Mr D were still able to complete the intended property 
purchase without further problems. So, I havent seen anything to suggest Mrs D and Mr D 
were financially disadvantaged by what happened. I also understand NatWest took the 
opportunity to update the signature records they held. This is what I would expect here. So, I 
think NatWest acted promptly to resolve Mrs D and Mr Ds concerns.
Mrs D and Mr D believe NatWest removed Mr Ds signature from the account without their 
authority. Ive seen no evidence to suggest thats what happened here. And the information 
Ive seen still shows Mr D as a party to the account. Its clearly unfortunate that NatWest 
were unable to verify Mr Ds signature when the cheque was presented. But I think NatWest 
acted appropriately in addressing that as quickly as possible.
Mrs D and Mr D said that staff at the NatWest branch offered a payment of £200 to reflect 
any distress and inconvenience their experience may have caused. Where theres a dispute 
about what happened, I must decide on the balance of probabilities  that is, what I consider 
was most likely to have happened, given the evidence that is available and the wider 
surrounding circumstances. NatWest have no record or evidence to support an offer of £200. 
Particularly as the complaint wasnt upheld by them. Mrs D and Mr D have also not been 
able to provide anything to support their recollection. So, while I appreciate their strength of 
feeling on this point, I cant reasonably support payment of compensation here.
I do appreciate the frustration and concern Mrs D and Mr D experienced as a result of what 
happened here. But having considered all the information and evidence available, I cant reasonably conclude that NatWest did anything wrong. Their actions were underpinned by a 
desire to protect Mrs D and Mr Ds money. When the issue was identified, NatWest acted 
appropriately and quickly to ensure Mrs D and Mr D werent disadvantaged. Their property 
transaction was completed without delay and ultimately, NatWest updated their records to 
ensure there wouldnt be a recurrence. 
I appreciate Mrs D and Mr D will be disappointed. But I wont be upholding their complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mrs D and Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D and Mr D to 
accept or reject my decision before 23 August 2022.
