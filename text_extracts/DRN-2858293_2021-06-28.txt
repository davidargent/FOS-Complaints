DRN-2858293
The complaint
Mr C complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) sent him a text message despite him 
asking it not to do so.
What happened
HSBC issued Mr C with a final response letter (in respect of his complaint) in April 2020.
Under cover of this letter HSBC apologised and confirmed that it had credited Mr Cs 
account with £25 for any trouble and upset its actions had caused.
Mr Cs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that as Mr C no 
longer banked with HSBC and given that HSBC had apologised and paid Mr C £25 in 
compensation, it need do nothing further.
Mr C didnt agree and so his complaint has been passed to me for review and decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I can confirm that Ive come to the same overall conclusion as the 
investigator and for broadly the same reasons. There is also very little I can usefully add to 
what has already been said.
I appreciate that Mr C would have been caused some trouble and upset in receiving the text 
message that he did given he had asked HSBC not to send him any.
But given that:
Mr C hasnt explained the precise impact receiving this text message has caused him 
HSBC has provided an explanation as to why the text message was sent and that it 
was sent in good faith
HSBC has apologised to Mr C
HSBC has paid Mr C £25 for any trouble and upset receipt of the text message might 
have caused him; and
Mr C no longer banks with HSBC
I, like the investigator, am satisfied that what HSBC has done in respect of this complaint is 
appropriate, fair and reasonable.
My final decision
My final decision is that HSBC need do nothing further in respect of this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 August 2021.
