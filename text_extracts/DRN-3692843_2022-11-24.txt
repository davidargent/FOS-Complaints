The complaint
Mr C complains about how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA have handled his account after 
unauthorised transactions were made.
What happened
In September 2020, several payments were made to a fast-food chain based in Australia, 
that Mr C said he never authorised. He said he immediately raised his concerns with PayPal. 
Of the 25 transactions that were made, PayPal said they refunded 12 of the disputed 
transactions totalling £390.59 to Mr Cs bank account. And one disputed transaction for 
£36.49 to his debit card account. But Mr C said the unauthorised transactions still left his 
account. He said that PayPal took back the temporary credit theyd paid from his PayPal 
account. Mr C said this left both his PayPal and bank accounts in a negative balance. And 
meant that other transactions he tried to make were stopped. He said PayPal also blocked 
his account. Mr C complained to PayPal.
PayPal said theyd refunded 13 transactions to Mr C as they couldnt stop the unauthorised 
transactions leaving his account. This meant Mr C wouldnt be financially affected when the 
unauthorised transactions were taken from his account. But Mr C on seeing the transactions 
leave his account reported it to his bank and they made a chargeback request to PayPal.  
This meant PayPal had to reverse the transactions back into Mr Cs bank account. As theyd 
previously refunded these amounts to Mr Cs bank account, the reversing of the payments 
reduced Mr Cs PayPal account by the same amount, which placed the account in a 
negative balance. PayPal expected Mr C on receiving the amounts again would transfer the 
money back to his PayPal account, as hed been refunded twice for the unauthorised 
transactions. But he didnt, so his PayPal account remained in a negative balance. For the 
remaining unauthorised transactions PayPal said Mr C had asked his bank to deal with 
them. 
Mr C wasnt happy with PayPals response. He said his account had been blocked. And hed 
been prevented from accessing other funds available to him. He said PayPals actions had 
meant he was financially out of pocket. He referred his complaint to us. 
Our investigator said PayPal had accepted the transactions were unauthorised and had 
looked to ensure that Mr C wasnt impacted financially by arranging for his account to be 
credited with the funds. But after theyd been asked by Mr Cs bank to reimburse the 
transactions this meant Mr C had been reimbursed twice. She didnt think PayPal had acted 
unfairly or unreasonably in recovering the money theyd paid back from Mr Cs PayPal 
account. 
Mr C didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
This must have been a very upsetting time for Mr C as he could see numerous unauthorised 
transactions happening. Id like to reassure Mr C that I have considered all of his points, 
even if Ive not addressed each of them individually. Ive focused on what I think is most 
relevant to the outcome of his complaint. its not in dispute that the transactions hadnt been 
made by Mr C. So, in reaching my decision Ive determined whether PayPal has acted fairly 
and reasonably in their actions with him.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, or contradictory, I reach my decision on the 
balance of probabilities - in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened or 
not considering the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
In mid September 2020 after Mr C saw unauthorised transactions about to be made, he 
raised a dispute with PayPal.  When Mr C opened his account with PayPal he would have 
agreed to their User Agreement. This says for an unauthorised payment dispute:
.as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after 
you tell us about the problem) we will put your account back to where it would have been 
had the payment never happened. This can include a reimbursement of your payment.
And I can see that the following day PayPal told Mr C theyd accepted he hadnt authorised 
13 transactions and they refunded him for them. The amounts were in Australian dollars 
(AUD), $52.25, $46 89, $89.41,$55.35, $59.4, $68.29, $57.3, $48.17, $41.98, $60.99, 
$42.49, and $89.79 which Paypal said theyd paid into Mr Cs bank account. And $61.19 
which they paid back to Mr Cs debit card.
When Mr C raised his dispute with PayPal about the unauthorised transactions they hadnt 
yet been fully processed by the merchant seeking payment, so the transactions showed as 
pending. Mr C hasnt provided any bank statements for this precise time, but I think 
PayPals refund would most likely have shown in his bank account before the pending 
transactions were taken out of his account by the merchant.
Upon seeing the unauthorised transactions still leaving his bank account despite having 
raised a dispute with PayPal, and been refunded by them, Mr C disputed the same 
transactions with his bank. I can see that on 21 September 2020, PayPal emailed Mr C to 
tell him that theyd received a request from your bank to cancel a payment sent from your 
bank  for the same transactions as outlined above. And went on to say:
We understand that you may not have been expecting this reversal. If this reversal
has made your PayPal account balance negative, please log in to your PayPal
account and add money to your balance.
PayPals user agreement explains that:
A reversal can happen whenWe compensate the payer or the payer's bank or provider 
because we receive a claim from either of them to return the payment under the reversal 
process used by that funding source provider bank or provider. This includes any claims for 
unauthorised or incorrect payments made to your account.
So despite PayPal having already returned the funds to Mr Cs bank account/debit card, the 
bank asking them to cancel the payments, meant PayPal had in effect reimbursed Mr C a second time for the unauthorised transactions. And by reversing the payments back to       
Mr Cs bank account his PayPal account went into a negative balance. 
I can see that a few days later PayPal emailed Mr C to say that theyd been made aware that 
hed disputed further transactions with his bank/card issuer. The amounts were in AUD, 
$116.28, $50.57, $93.37, $69.79, $46.59, $62.30, $196.10, $45, $61.19 (the amount PayPal 
had refunded to Mr Cs debit card), $117.90, $46.39, $49.10, $59.99, $62.41, $117.90 and 
$57.49. And went on to explain that they couldnt investigate his dispute about these 
transactions as this was now being done by his bank/card issuer.
Mr C said hed difficulties accessing his PayPal account. I can see from the User agreement 
that PayPal give several reasons why a PayPal account could be limited, including where 
they have reason to believe that:
Someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, then we'll 
limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.
Someone has used your card or bank account without your permission, for example 
if your debit or credit card issuer or bank alerts us to this.
And this was the case here. Mr C said he was prevented from withdrawing money from his 
PayPal account. PayPals user agreement says:
When you withdraw your money you need to have enough PayPal balance to cover the 
value of any withdrawal at the time of the withdrawal.
It also says:
If we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your 
account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal 
from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the 
limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.
I can see from emails Mr C has sent to us, that PayPal made him aware of what he needed 
to do to ensure he didnt have a negative balance. But I cant see that Mr C paid back the 
monies into his PayPal account, so it remained in a negative balance.
PayPals user agreement says:
If there are insufficient funds in your balance to cover your liability, we reserve the right to 
collect the amount you owe us by deducting the amount (or any part of it) from any 
payments received in or money you add to your PayPal account. Otherwise you agree to 
reimburse us through other means. We may also recover amounts you owe us through legal 
means, including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection agency.
I can understand Mr Cs frustration, and I know he will be disappointed by my decision. But I 
cant say that PayPal has acted unfairly or unreasonably in their actions with him.  PayPal 
acted upon Mr C disputing the transactions directly with them, and they refunded the monies 
into his bank account. They then followed instructions sent by his bank to reverse payments 
from his PayPal account. From what Ive seen, PayPal appears to have processed the 
transactions correctly. The negative balance on Mr Cs PayPal account was a result of the 
disputed transactions raised by his bank. And as his PayPal account had a negative balance 
PayPal looked to recover the amounts owed to them. My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 December 2022.
