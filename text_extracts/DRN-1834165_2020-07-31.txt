MYJAR upheld Miss Js complaint about loans 5 onwards and agreed to compensate her in-
line with our approach. Miss J rejected this offer and brought her complaint to our service. 
Our adjudicator thought about Miss Js complaint and felt that the offer MYJAR put forward 
was fair and that there was no reason to uphold the complaint about loans 1 - 4. Miss J 
disagreed stating that she was in financial difficulty at the time MYJAR agreed to give her 
these loans and she became further in debt because of this. Miss J says had MYJAR 
completed a proper affordability assessment on her for all these loans it wouldve realised 
that she could not afford to pay back any of her loans. 
As Miss J disputed the initial assessment the complaint was passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
MYJAR Limited needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss J 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. But certain 
factors might point to the fact that MYJAR Limited should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR Limited was required to
establish whether Miss J could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all means for Miss Js complaint. MYJAR agreed to uphold Miss Js 
complaint about loans 5  9. So as these loans are no longer in dispute, I havent considered 
them further in my decision. But I have set out what MYJAR should do to put things right in 
relation to these loans below. 
why I think MYJAR Limiteds checks were proportionate for loans 1  4 
Miss Js first loan was for £100.00 and as per the loan agreement her repayment for this 
loan was £117.00. Ive seen a record of the information Miss J provided when this loan 
application was completed. It was recorded that Miss J had a monthly income of £1,500.00 
and monthly expenses of around £1,352.00. So, after deducting her regular monthly 
outgoings it looked like she had enough disposal income to make her repayments under this 
loan agreement.
Ive also looked at the information recorded for loans 2, 3, and 4 and based on what Ive 
seen it looks like her circumstances didnt change much during this time and it seems like 
she had enough disposable income to make these repayments as well. Looking at loans 1- 4 
Miss J paid these off by the arranged repayment date, or before this, and none of these 
loans overlapped. Ive considered what Miss J has said about having debts with other providers and not being 
able to afford her loans with MYJAR. And had MYJAR completed a full review of Miss Js 
financial circumstances, I think ought to have uncovered any financial difficulty Miss J might 
have been experiencing at the time. But, at this point in the lending relationship I think it was 
reasonable for MYJAR to have relied on the evidence it had and what Miss J told it about her 
income and expenditure, and I think it was reasonable of MYJAR not to investigate Miss Js 
circumstances any further when she was applying for loans 1 - 4. And I dont think it had yet 
reached the stage where it needed to carry out further checks, such as verifying this 
information or enquiring into her wider financial circumstances.
I havent seen any evidence or other information that MYJAR collected at the time of the 
loan applications for loans 1  4 that shows its likely it was made aware of any financial 
problems Miss J mightve been having. Or anything that wouldve prompted it to investigate 
Miss Js circumstances further. So, I think it was reasonable for MYJAR to rely on the 
information it obtained.
So overall, in these circumstances, I think the affordability assessment MYJAR carried out 
for loans 1  4 were proportionate. And I think its decision to lend Miss J loans 1- 4 in these 
circumstances was reasonable. But I think the offer put forward for loans 5  9 is fair and 
MYJAR should pay Miss J compensation as set out below. 
what MYJAR should do to put things right for loans 5 - 9
refund all interest and charges Miss J paid on loans 5 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 5, 6 and 7 from Miss Js credit file;
remove all entries about loans 8 and 9 from Miss Js credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must give 
Miss J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont think Miss Js complaint about loans 1  4 should be 
upheld. But I think MYJAR should put things right as set out above and in its final response 
letter. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 August 2020.
