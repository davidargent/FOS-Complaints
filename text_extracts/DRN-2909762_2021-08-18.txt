The complaint
N a limited company complains that National Westminster Bank Plc gave it the wrong advice 
about its account. And that this led to the director, Mr M losing his ability to access Ns bank 
account.
What happened
N has a business account with NatWest. Mr M was unhappy with the way that the company 
secretary was administering Ns account, so he asked NatWest for help.
Mr M says that NatWest told him that if it set up the bank account as two to sign, this would 
mean the company secretary would lose their ability to make payments online and give 
financial control to both the company secretary and Mr M. But this didnt happen.
The investigator explained to Mr M that this service could only consider his complaint about 
the misinformation that NatWest gave. She couldnt look at the alleged misuse of funds by 
the company secretary. This is because NatWest objected as both parties to Ns bank 
account would have to join the complaint.
The investigator didnt recommend upholding Ns complaint. Although NatWest gave Mr M 
the wrong information about what would happen with a two to sign, she couldnt see that 
the mistake had negatively affected N.
Mr M on behalf of N isnt happy with the investigators recommendation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest agrees that it made a mistake when it told Mr M that setting up two to sign on Ns 
account would disable the company secretarys online banking profile. NatWest paid £250 to 
apologise. I need to consider whether NatWest has already done enough to put things right.
Mr M confirmed that prior to asking NatWest for help in early May 2019, he didnt have 
online access to Ns bank account. So, I cant find that setting the account to two to sign 
somehow prevented Mr M from accessing the account online. 
NatWest set Mr M up with online access at the end of June 2019. There was a period of 
under two months when Mr M couldnt access the account online. The investigator asked 
him for evidence of how N had been negatively affected between the time that NatWest gave 
Mr M the wrong information and when he was registered for online banking. Mr M hasnt 
given this service any evidence to consider. 
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest gave Mr M online access as he wanted. And it wasnt 
possible to disable the company secretarys online access without their permission. As I 
cant see that NatWests misinformation had a significant impact on N, I consider NatWests 
payment of £250 was reasonable in the circumstances. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint in the sense that NatWest has already done 
enough to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask N to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 September 2021.
