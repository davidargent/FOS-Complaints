K821x#15Complaint
The director  of Company L  Mr C  complains that National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) delayed a money transfer which led to financial  loss and damage to reputation.
Background
Company L has a business bank account with NatWest. On 11 January 2019,  Mr C went  
into branch to make a transfer from Company Ls account to a suppliers account. The 
transfer was to purchase stock which was due to then be sent to one of Company Ls 
customers.
NatWest made an error and the transfer didnt take place. After Mr C was notified by his 
supplier that the money hadnt  been  transferred he visited  the branch on 14 January 2019. 
Again, NatWest made an error and the transfer didnt take place. Mr C was notified later by 
his supplier, and the stock couldnt  be despatched  until the payment was received. On 
Mr Cs third visit to branch, on 24 January 2019, NatWest spotted the error and made the 
transfer correctly. Mr C explained that this led to a two week  delay in delivering the stock to 
Company Ls customer. And he explained that due to a long standing  agreement between  
the businesses,  the invoice had to be reduced by 10%.
I sent my provisional decision on this complaint  on 8 October  2019   which is attached  and 
forms part of this decision. In summary I explained I intended to uphold Company  Ls 
complaint. I explained  that the financial loss Company L incurred ($3,583.72 US Dollars  -
10% of the invoice  for the late delivery) was directly caused by NatWests errors.  So I felt 
NatWest should  pay this loss to Company  L. I also felt the errors caused  some level of 
reputational damage for Company L. So I suggested NatWest  pays Company L £150  for 
this.
NatWest responded  to my provisional decision but said it had no further comments  to make. 
Mr C further explained  that he managed to avoid additional losses due to NatWests error, 
and explained  he continued to be unhappy  with its actions that caused this loss. As both 
parties have received the provisional  decision and not given any further  evidence  to 
consider, Ive reached my final decision.
My findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
NatWest hasnt provided any additional comments for me to consider. Mr C has explained 
that he continues  to be unhappy  with what happened, but hes not provided any further 
evidence  except  explaining there were other charges he avoided.
As theres  no further evidence to consider, my decision remains  the same as set out in 
provisional decision  a copy of which is attached below and forms part of this decision. 
NatWests error has caused  Company L financial loss and damage to reputation.  So I uphold 
this complaint.
Putting things  right
Ref: DRN66232232To put things right, National  Westminster Bank Plc must:
-Pay Company  L $3,583.72 US Dollars  into its account for the financial loss its error 
caused.
-Pay Company  L an additional  £150  for the damage to its reputation.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I uphold this complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc must 
follow the instructions  Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C, as director 
of Company L to accept or reject my decision before 30 November 2019.

Complaint
The director  of Company  L  Mr C  complains that National Westminster Bank  Plc (NatWest)  
delayed a money transfer which led to financial  loss and damage to reputation.
Background
Company L has a business bank account with NatWest. On 11 January 2019,  Mr C went into branch 
to make a transfer from Company Ls account to a suppliers account.  The transfer was to purchase 
stock which was due to then be sent to one of Company Ls customers.
NatWest made  an error  and the transfer didnt  take place.  After  Mr C was notified by his supplier that 
the money hadnt been  transferred he visited the branch on 14 January  2019.  Again, NatWest made 
an error and the transfer didnt take place. Mr C was notified later by his supplier, and the stock 
couldnt be despatched until the payment  was received. On Mr Cs third visit to branch, on 24 January 
2019, NatWest spotted the error and made the transfer correctly. Mr C explained  that this led to a two 
week delay in delivering  the stock to Company Ls customer. And he explained  that due to a long 
standing agreement between the businesses, the invoice had to be reduced by 10%.
Mr C, on behalf of Company  L, complained  to NatWest. He explained  that NatWest didnt notify him 
on either occasion that the transfer hadnt gone through. So he was delayed in putting  this right.  And 
that as a result of the error, Company L received 10% less for the order than it shouldve,  so it lost 
out. NatWest agreed  that it had made the error, but didnt think it should reimburse Company L for the 
loss, as this was a decision made by Company L and not pre-approved by NatWest. It paid 
compensation of £150 for the inconvenience, and reimbursed Mr Cs travel costs for getting to the 
branch on multiple occasions.
Our investigator felt the compensation was too low. He recommended NatWest  pays  Company L a 
total of £400 for the damage to reputation.  But he didnt  think NatWest should  reimburse Company  L 
for the financial loss. He explained this was because  there was no evidence that Company L had to 
reduce the invoice due to late delivery,  so he wasnt persuaded Company  L wouldve lost business  
had it not reduced the invoice.
Mr C disagreed with the investigators view.  He explained that Company L lost money  only due to 
NatWests errors and so it should be reimbursed for this. So the complaint has been passed to me to 
reach a decision.
My provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Having  done so, my intention is to uphold  this complaint.
Financial Loss
Company L operates a business model that relies on ordering stock from suppliers, and selling it on to 
customers for a profit.  So the business only operates effectively if orders are carried  out on time. In 
this particular case,  Company L received an order; it then purchased the stock to fulfil that order and 
transferred money to its supplier. But because NatWest made errors when Mr C requested the 
transfer of funds to pay the supplier, the stock was delayed in being  sent. NatWest didnt notify Mr C 
that the transfer had failed, and Mr C had to visit branch after being  told by Company Ls supplier  that 
the payment hadnt been received. And despite Mr C visiting branch to transfer the funds  for a second 
time, NatWest  made another error.  So the funds were transferred  two weeks late. This meant the 
stock took two weeks longer to arrive and ship to the customer. Company  L reduced the order price 
by 10% because  of this delay. So I think that reduction is a direct result of the errors  NatWest made.
Ref: DRN66232234NatWest has said that it was Mr Cs choice  to reduce the amount Company L invoiced  its customer 
due to the delay. I agree  that it was, but this doesnt mean that NatWest shouldnt reimburse  
Company L for the financial  loss it suffered as a result of NatWests error. I think its likely Mr C told 
NatWest when he was in branch about the fact hed have to reduce the invoice price. And, as 
Company L relies on bulk orders from customers, I think the decision  to reduce the invoice was one 
that Company L made to ensure  it retained  business. So whilst it made  a decision to reduce  the 
invoice, it wouldnt have had to do this had it not been for NatWests error  at the start  as the order 
wouldve been  fulfilled  on time. So I think it would  be reasonable for NatWest to reimburse  Company 
L the direct financial  loss that it incurred as a result  of NatWests  error. I understand  this to be 
$3,583.72 USD. As Company L holds a US Dollar account with NatWest  that account should be 
reimbursed by this amount.
Damage to Reputation
NatWest paid Company L £150 for the inconvenience  its error caused. Ive considered whether  I think  
this is a reasonable amount. Having done so, I think NatWest should pay more. I say this because 
Company L has delivered its order late to its customer, and its made a payment late to its supplier. 
Company L is a small  business, and relies on fulfilling its orders on time. The error that NatWest made 
wouldve had an impact on Company Ls reputation. If a business cannot pay its suppliers  on time, or 
fulfil orders on time, then its reputation will be damaged.  As this situation has happened because  of 
NatWest making  two consecutive errors, I think it should pay Company L an additional £150 for the 
damage to reputation its caused. 
Putting things right
Its my intention to ask National Westminster Bank Plc to do the following:
Pay Company L $3,583.72 US Dollars into its account
Pay Company L an additional £150 for the damage to reputation.
My provisional decision
For the reasons  Ive explained I intend to uphold  this complaint and ask National Westminster  Bank 
Plc to follow the instructions  Ive set out above.
