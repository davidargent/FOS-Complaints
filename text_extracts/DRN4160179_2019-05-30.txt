K821x#15complaint
Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  my provisional  decision on 14 May 2019. A copy is attached  and it forms 
part of this final decision. I asked Mr H and QuickQuid to let me know  if they had anything  to 
add.
Mr H didnt send me anything else to consider. QuickQuid didnt agree with my provisional 
decision and made a number of points.  It said (in summary):
The pattern of lending in Mr Hs case doesnt show that he suffered detriment. There  
were gaps  between  loans of 44-98 days and the loan amounts fluctuated. This isnt a 
common pattern where a consumer  is reliant  on payday loans. Mr Hs repayment 
history was generally good and he only ever paid two late fees.
It doesnt think its likely it wouldve found out about Mr Hs gambling; Mr H couldve 
had multiple accounts and gambling transactions can be disguised.  It questions 
whether this service  can be certain  the gambling  caused Mr H financial problems.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The new points raised by QuickQuid havent changed my provisional decision to partially 
uphold Mr Hs complaint.  Ill explain why.
I think its worth saying,  before I respond to the points raised by QuickQuid, that when 
looking at the pattern  of lending, Im not just looking at one factor in isolation. As I said in my 
provisional decision, Im taking into account several  factors, such  as the number and 
frequency of loans  and the period of lending.  Other factors include the loan amounts and 
repayment difficulties  (if any). It will be the combination of some or all of these  factors  which  
may in some  circumstances lead me to believe  a pattern of lending can demonstrate 
unsustainable lending.
I appreciate the points  QuickQuid has raised  about  the pattern of lending in Mr Hs case. 
I had taken the gaps between the loans into account when reaching my provisional findings  
and I acknowledge  there are a number of gaps of around three months  between  some of the 
loans from loan 6 onwards.
Ref: DRN41601792Whilst some  of these breaks  could  be considered  significant had they occurred earlier in the 
chain of borrowing, I think the breaks in Mr Hs case  become less significant the longer the 
lending relationship continued. By the time Mr H asked for loan 6, hed already been 
borrowing from QuickQuid for more than a year and in this context I think  its less reasonable 
to say moderate breaks in lending of 44-98 days signify that Mr Hs finances  were improving, 
or that he was less likely  be dependent on short-term credit. 
In saying the above, its important to remember QuickQuid was proving short-term  loans at a 
high cost. They were  not intended for use over the long term (QuickQuids own website  
acknowledges this is an unsuitable use for the loans) but to deal with events like temporary 
cash-flow problems. That Mr H was accessing  this type of credit so frequently  is in itself 
indicative of financial difficulty.
I acknowledge that the amounts Mr H borrowed fluctuated, but I think  its fair to say there 
was a broad  upwards trend; or at the very least, the amounts Mr H was borrowing didnt go 
down. Loans 8 and 10 were cumulatively  the largest  loans  and were  approved  after two or 
three years of lending.  None of Mr Hs loans were for less than the original amount 
borrowed. So although the amounts he borrowed varied, I still think QuickQuid acted unfairly 
by allowing Mr H take expensive credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period 
of time.
I do not consider  that Mr H only paid two late fees to be a significant positive factor. 
Repaying loans on time isnt on its own an indicator of sustainability.  As I said in my 
provisional decision, repayments shouldnt  just be on time but also made while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments.
I concluded that QuickQuid ought  to have  realised it was more likely than not Mr H was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.  So the point QuickQuid 
made about Mr Hs repayments generally not being late is something I already considered 
and it does not change my decision  now.
Finally, Ive considered  the point QuickQuid raised  about Mr Hs bank statements and 
gambling. In Mr Hs case, the nature,  number  and amounts of Mr Hs gambling transactions 
are obvious  from the bank  statements  Ive seen. Its possible  Mr H couldve tried to hide this, 
as QuickQuid has suggested. But the evidence  Ive seen is that Mr H only had one current  
account up until February 2017,  so I think this wouldve been difficult. The account with the 
gambling transactions Ive identified also appears to be the account into which  the 
QuickQuid and other loans were  paid, so it wouldve been reasonably clear to QuickQuid  
whether or not it had a full picture  of Mr Hs income and expenditure.
The gambling transactions are not central to the outcome of the complaint; I mention them 
as they may help explain why Mr H so often had a monthly shortfall and why he borrowed as 
often as he did. But as Ive explained  above  and in my provisional decision, the pattern of 
lending alone  ought to have been  enough  to put QuickQuid on notice that the lending  
eventually became unsustainable for Mr H. So the points QuickQuid raised  about  the 
gambling transactions havent changed  my decision.
Ref: DRN41601793putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
 
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 6-11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6-11 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr H a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Hs complaint  in part. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 June  2019.

complaint
Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC,  trading  as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr H had 11 loans with QuickQuid. Ive set out some of the information QuickQuid provided about the 
loans in the appendix to this decision.
An adjudicator considered Mr Hs complaint and recommended it be upheld in part. He didnt  think 
QuickQuid shouldve  approved loan 2 or loans 7a to 11. 
QuickQuid didnt agree  with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr H could repay the loans  
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish whether  
Mr H could sustainably repay his loans   not just whether  the loan payments were  affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being  without undue  
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting  
other reasonable  commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. And it 
follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont 
be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments 
without borrowing further. 
Ref: DRN41601795Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
For loans 1-5, I think its unlikely proportionate checks wouldve suggested the loans  were 
unaffordable. From what Ive seen Mr H typically  declared  monthly living expenses of less than £300 
and income  of £1,000-£1,100 leaving him with disposable income in the region of £750 a month.  The 
most Mr H had to pay towards a loan in this period was £453. 
There are times when I think QuickQuid  couldve asked Mr H further questions about his short-term  
commitments. But Ive not seen clear  enough evidence  to conclude  that these wouldve led QuickQuid 
to believe loans 1-5 were unaffordable.
Im therefore  not planning to uphold  the complaint  about loans 1-5.
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of QuickQuids lending history with Mr H, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further  loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
Up until loan 6, Mr H had been borrowing  from QuickQuid  for about a year and had been 
taking out new loans without a substantial break after repaying the preceding  loan. This 
pattern continued from loan 6 onwards and QuickQuid  continued to provide  Mr H with new 
loans only shortly  after settling previous loans. QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more 
likely than not Mr H was having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan 
was leaving in his finances and Mr Hs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
The amounts Mr H was borrowing didnt decrease over time and he wasnt making  any real 
inroads clearing his indebtedness to QuickQuid, despite borrowing  over a substantial period.  
Loan 11 was taken out 40 months after Mr Hs first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr H had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to QuickQuid over an extended 
period.
Ive also noted that there are times  when  Mr H spends large sums of money  on gambling  for 
example £1,500 in the month  leading  up to loan 6. There is evidence of a continuing pattern  of 
significant expenditure on gambling  including more than £2,000 in the month leading up to the final 
loan. So although I think  the pattern of lending alone was enough  to indicate Mr H was likely to be in 
financial difficulty and that he wasnt using  the loans to deal with a temporary cash  flow problem, I 
also think QuickQuid couldve likely established Mr Hs expenditure was too high for him to 
sustainably repay loans 6-11 had it carried  out proportionate checks  during this time.  
 
I think  that Mr H lost out because QuickQuid  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Hs ability to access 
mainstream credit  and so kept him in the market for these high-cost  loans.
So Im planning to uphold the complaint  about 6-11.
Ref: DRN41601796putting things  right  what QuickQuid  needs  to do
 
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans  6-11;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  loans 6-11 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr H a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
I plan to uphold Mr Hs complaint in part and to tell CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right by taking 
the steps set out above.
