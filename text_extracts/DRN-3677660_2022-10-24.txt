The complaint
Mr M has complained PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie, SCA is asking him to repay a debt which 
isnt his.
What happened
In 2021 Mr M received letters from a debt recovery agent. They believed Mr M owed 
£3,225.25 from a PayPal debt accrued in 2019. Mr M complained to the ombudsman 
service. He had written to PayPal in December 2019 confirming hed not taken out a credit 
agreement with them so couldnt be responsible for the debt.
PayPal confirmed Mr M had taken out a credit agreement with them on 1 July 2019 for 
£3,000. Hed then used funds from that account for various purchases on an online 
marketplace.
Our investigator felt it was most likely Mr M had taken out the credit agreement. The email 
address used was the same as the one Mr M used in his correspondence with our service.
Mr M continued to disagree with this outcome. Hes asked an ombudsman to make a 
decision on his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusion as our investigator. Ill explain why.
Mr M has told us he closed his PayPal account  opened as far back as 2008  in 2017. 
Hes also told us he changed his broadband supplier in 2019 and at that time changed his 
email address to the one he currently uses. He therefore questions any evidence from 
PayPal which suggests hed been using his current email address in 2017.
Unfortunately this has got unnecessarily confusing. PayPal has confirmed to us the email 
address used when the credit agreement was taken out in July 2019. They have not at any 
stage confirmed what email address Mr M was using for any previous PayPal account.
In fact the existence of Mr Ms former PayPal account is a bit of a red herring. This may well 
have closed in 2017 but what was taken out in July 2019 was a credit account akin to a 
credit card service. Im in no doubt the email attached to that application is the one Mr M 
currently uses (and used at that time). This email address is noted on the credit agreement. 
PayPal has confirmed statements relating to the spend on this account from 1 July to 
10 August 2019 were also sent to that email address. As no payments were ever received, 
PayPal also used that email address to confirm there was a debt outstanding.
I appreciate Mr M is absolutely convinced that he never took out this credit agreement. But 
all information relating to this  and the spend undertaken on the account  is linked to his 
own email address. It would be an unusual fraud that notifications about what was 
happening were always being shared with the victim.
Based on the evidence Ive seen about Mr Ms email address, I believe its most likely that 
he did take out the credit agreement with PayPal. I wont be asking PayPal to revoke the 
debt.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is not to uphold Mr Ms complaint against 
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie, SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 November 2022.
