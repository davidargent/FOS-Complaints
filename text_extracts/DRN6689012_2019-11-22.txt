K821x#15complaint
Ms B complains  that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Ms B was given 14 loans  by Sunny between March 2016 and March 2017.  Each  of the loans 
was due to be repaid  in six monthly  instalments but Ms B often repaid the loans within  a few 
weeks of taking them out. At times  Ms B had up to four loans outstanding at the same time. 
A balance  remains  outstanding  on the last three loans but the earlier  loans have been  fully 
repaid. A summary of Ms Bs borrowing from Sunny is shown below.

When Ms B first brought her complaint to this Service Sunny accepted that it shouldnt have 
given her the last three loans and offered her some compensation. Ms B didnt accept that 
offer so her complaint  has been assessed  by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think  Sunny 
had been wrong  to give loans 1 to 5 to Ms B. But he didnt think  Sunny should have agreed 
to lend the remaining loans. So he asked Sunny to pay Ms B some compensation in relation  
to more loans  than it had offered.
Sunny didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Ms B accepts my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
Ref: DRN66890122my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Ms B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Bs complaint.
Sunny did some checks before it lent to Ms B. It asked her for details of her income, and her 
normal expenditure. And it checked  her credit  file before agreeing  the loans. Ive seen a 
summary of those checks and I dont  think they showed anything  that should  have caused 
additional concerns to Sunny.
Ref: DRN66890123As I mentioned earlier each of Ms Bs loans was repayable  over a six month period. So the 
amounts that Ms B needed to repay each time were smaller than if shed taken a normal  
payday loan. But of course she was committing to making those repayments over a far 
longer period. And at times Ms B had a number of loans outstanding together.  So Ive 
needed to consider the total amount  that Ms B needed to repay  to Sunny each month.
I think the fact that Ms B often repaid  her loans much earlier  than planned should have 
caused some concerns  to Sunny. That might be the sort of behaviour  that would indicate 
that someone was facing  problems managing their money and needing  to refinance loans on 
a regular basis. So Ive also taken that into account  when  looking  at whether Sunny should 
have given the loans to Ms B.
I think that the checks Sunny did before agreeing  the first four loans were proportionate. The 
amounts that Ms B needed to repay were small compared with the disposable income shed 
declared. Given these repayment amounts, what was apparent  about  Ms Bs circumstances 
at the time, and her borrowing history with the lender, I dont think  it wouldve  been  
proportionate for Sunny  to ask her for the amount of information that would be needed to 
show the lending  was unsustainable  before agreeing the first four loans. 
I do think, by the time Ms B asked for loan 5, that Sunny should have realised that it couldnt  
safely rely on the information she was providing  about her finances. I think it should have 
taken steps at that time to independently verify Ms Bs true financial position. We asked 
Ms B for copies of her bank statements so we could see what  better checks  would  have 
shown Sunny. She didnt provide these to us. So Im not able to say that better  checks  would 
have shown Sunny that it shouldnt have given loan 5 to Ms B.
But looking  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Ms B I think  by loan 6 the 
lender should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise  
harmful. And so Sunny  should have realised  that it shouldnt provide further loans. 
This was now Ms Bs sixth loan request in just under seven months. Ms B had already 
experienced a cycle  of borrowing where she had three loans open at the same  time. After 
repaying those loans on the same  day she borrowed again shortly afterwards. Loan 6 was 
the third open  loan in that cycle.  I think that pattern of frequent  borrowing and repaying early 
should have indicated to Sunny that Ms B was most  likely  having  significant problems 
managing her money. 
When Ms B asked for loan 6 she wasnt making  any inroads to the amount she owed the 
lender. The total value  of the loans she had open at that time was the greatest amount to 
date. 
Between loan 6 and loan 14 Ms B had multiple  loans  active at the same time.  So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Ms B was having  to borrow further to cover 
the hole repaying  her previous loans  was leaving in her finances  and that Ms Bs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
I think that Ms B lost out because Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because these loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by 
allowing her to take expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time. And the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative  implications  on Ms Bs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN66890124So I dont  think Sunny should  have  agreed  to lend to Ms B from loan 6 onwards. Sunny 
needs to pay Ms B some  compensation.
putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed lend to Ms B after, and including, the loan that she 
took on 13 October 2016 (loan 6). So for each  of those loans Sunny should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Ms B on the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken from loans 6 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 14 should be removed from Ms Bs credit 
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Ms B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
As I said earlier Ms B still owes  Sunny  some  of the principal she borrowed on the last three 
loans. I think it is reasonable that Sunny deducts  these sums from the compensation that is 
due to her. But, to be clear, those outstanding balances should be recalculated  to remove  
any interest and charges,  but taking account of any repayments Ms B has made  on the 
loans as though they were applied against  the principal sums borrowed
my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Ms Bs complaint and direct Elevate Credit  
International Limited to put things  right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 December  2019.
