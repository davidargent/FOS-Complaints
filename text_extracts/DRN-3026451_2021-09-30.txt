The complaint
Ms M complains that a hire purchase agreement with RCI Financial Services Limited, trading 
as Renault Finance, under which a car was supplied to her, was mis-sold to her.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Ms M under a hire purchase agreement with Renault Finance 
that she signed in August 2018. She contacted Renault Finance in March 2021 about 
voluntarily terminating the agreement due to her financial difficulties and she was told that 
she would be charged for excess mileage if shed exceeded the agreed mileage limit. 
She complained to Renault Finance because she said that the dealer had recorded her 
mileage as 6,000 even though shed said that her mileage would be higher than that and the 
dealer had also said there would be no repercussions from that. She wasnt satisfied with its 
response so she complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld She thought that it 
was fair and reasonable that Renault Finance was able to rely on the terms of the agreement 
and to apply the charges for any applicable excess mileage and she didnt find that Ms M 
was misled about the implications of the annual mileage allowance being set at the level it 
was.
Ms M has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says, in 
summary, that:
the dealer said that it would put down lower mileage than she declared because it 
would keep her payments down and her insurance policy shows that her expected 
mileage for the year was 8,000;
the dealer told her not to worry about it as they dont check and shes very clear 
about what happened; and
shes never believed that if she terminated the agreement early the dealer would 
waive the costs of the excess mileage as that wasnt an eventuality that shed 
considered.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Ms M signed the hire purchase agreement and immediately above her signature it 
says: This is an Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only 
if you want to be legally bound by its terms;
the agreement clearly sets out the annual mileage allowance of 6,000 and the excess 
mileage charge, says: You must not exceed the Annual Mileage Allowance, 
describes the circumstances in which excess mileage charges would be applicable 
and says:  for each mile driven in excess of the Annual Mileage Allowance you will 
be required to pay the Excess Mileage Charge ;
Ms M also signed a summary document in which she confirmed that shed read and 
understood all of the payment information in the agreement and that, if she decided 
to terminate the agreement early, she would have to pay Renault Finance excess 
mileage charges;
there were clearly discussions between Ms M and the dealer about her annual 
mileage  she says that she told the dealer that it would be 8,000, which is confirmed 
by the mileage included on her insurance policy, but the dealer recorded it as 6,000 
to keep her payments down and she says that she wouldnt have been able to afford 
the car if the monthly payments had been higher;
Ms M says that the dealer told her that there would be no repercussions from that 
because any excess mileage isnt checked  but theres no other evidence to show 
that thats what the dealer told her and thats inconsistent with the information 
contained in the hire purchase agreement and summary  both of which she signed;
I consider that Ms M ought reasonably to have been aware that her agreement, 
which was with Renault Finance and not the dealer, contained provisions about 
excess mileage charges and, if those provisions were different to what shed been 
told by the dealer, I consider that it would have been reasonable to expect her to 
have checked those provisions with Renault Finance before signing the agreement;
I sympathise with Ms M for the financial and other difficulties that shes described but 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence in these circumstances to show that 
the hire purchase agreement was mis-sold to Ms M or that Renault Finance has 
acted incorrectly in its dealings with her; 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Renault Finance to allow 
Ms M to voluntarily terminate the agreement without charging her for any excess 
mileage or to take any other action in response to her complaint; and
if she hasnt already done so, I suggest that Ms M contacts Renault Finance about 
her financial difficulties  its required to respond to any financial difficulties that shes 
experiencing positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ms complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2021.
