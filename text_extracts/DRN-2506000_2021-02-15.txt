The complaint
Mr D is unhappy with the amount of compensation offered to him by Barclays Bank UK PLC 
for a mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) policy attached to a current account.  
To be clear, this decision only deals with the PPI policy attached to account ending 7379.
What happened
Mr D complained to Barclays about a PPI policy attached to a current account in the 1990s. 
Unhappy with Barclayss response to his complaint he asked this service to step in. 
Mr D supplied us with a bank statement for account ending 7379 dated 1 June 1993. This 
statement is numbered 87 and shows a PPI premium of £1.38 covering the period 5 April-4 
May 1993.
Mr D also showed us a second bank statement dated 1 August 1994. This statement was 
dated 1 August 1994 and was for account ending 7727. The statement was numbered 129 
and covered the period 18 July 1994  1 August 1994. It didnt show a PPI premium.
This service sent the statements to Barclays.
In July 2019 Barclays offered to uphold the complaint about the PPI applied to account 
ending 7379. But it only offered to refund the one premium of £1.38 showing on statement 
numbered 87 plus interest. The offer totalled £3.75.
Mr D remained unhappy with Barclays offer. Mr D said he recalled that account ending 7379 
was closed and became account ending 7727 when his account moved from one Barclays 
branch to another in 1994. And Mr D supplied us with a further four bank statements he had 
found.
Mr D had found another statement for account ending 7379. This was dated 31 January 
1992 and was numbered 48. This showed a PPI premium of £1.38.
Mr D also showed us three more statements from account ending 7727.   
The first was dated 31 March 1994 and also showed a PPI premium of £1.38. It was 
numbered 118.
Two other statements from account ending 7727 were dated 1 June 1994 and 1 February 
1995. They were numbered 123 and 143. Neither showed a PPI premium being charged.
After being shown these new statements Barclays made a new offer. It offered to refund PPI 
premiums charged to account ending 7379 from 2 January 1992 until 4 May 1993. Barclays 
said the statements showed Mr D had been charged PPI on these dates. But it said there 
was no evidence Mr D had been charged PPI on account ending 7379 either before or after 
these dates.
An adjudicator from this service didnt think Barclays offer was fair. Based on the statement 
numbers, the adjudicator thought Barclays should assume account ending 7379 ran from 
around January 1990 until January 1994 when it was closed and became account ending 
7727. And the adjudicator though Barclays should assume Mr D was charged PPI from the 
time the account was opened until it was closed.
Barclays didnt agree with the adjudicators findings so the complaint has been passed to 
me. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr D has told us that he changed Barclays branches in 1994 and account ending 7379 was 
closed and reopened as account ending 7727.
Barclays has said it has no records of the two accounts being linked.
Ive thought about this and I can see the numbers on the statements run in increasing order 
from 48 on the statement dated 31 January 1992 for account number 7379 through to 
number 143 on the statement dated 1 February 1995 for account ending 7727.
I also note that the statements for the two accounts have two different branches.
And Mr Ds testimony about changing branches and how his account numbers altered at the 
same time is plausible and persuasive. I dont think it is likely Mr D had two current accounts 
at the same time.
From experience I am aware that in the early 1990s account records were more branch 
based than they are today. 
So taking everything into account I think it is likely Mr Ds account ending 7379 became 
account ending 7727 when he changed branches . And from what Ive seen I think its 
reasonable to assume this occurred around January 1994 as we have a statement for 7727 
dated March 1994.
Ive next thought about when it was likely account ending 7379 was opened. Looking at the 
statement numbers it seems to me that two or three statements were issued each month. 
And as the statement for 31 January 1992 is numbered 48 I think its likely to have been 
opened around January 1990.
So I think it is fair to assume account ending 7379 ran from January 1990 to January 1994.
Barclays has offered to refund PPI premiums on this account from January 1992 to May 
1993. Its based this offer on the two statements from 7379 that show PPI. Barclays has said 
it has no evidence Mr D was charged PPI outside of these dates.
I dont think this approach is fair. I dont think its reasonable to only assume PPI was present 
on the account where Mr D is able to produce statements showing PPI.
The events here date back 30 years, and just as I wouldnt expect Barclays to retain detailed 
records for that long, I dont think its reasonable to expect Mr D to have either.
Barclays should be aware that this service expects a business to make reasonable 
assumptions when calculating redress on accounts with missing data. I cant see that it has in this case. So Ive thought about how Barclays should calculate the compensation it owes 
Mr D
Ive already found that Mr D likely opened account ending 7379 in January 1990. From 
experience I think it is most likely he was sold PPI when he opened the account. And, 
bearing in mind PPI was present on account ending 7727 in March 1994 I think its likely it 
was present on account ending 7379 until it closed in January 1994.     
Putting things right
Barclays should put Mr D back in the position hed be in if the PPI wasnt sold. So it needs 
to:
Refund all the premiums paid towards the PPI policy. It should assume the monthly PPI 
premium was £1.38. And it assume the first PPI premium was paid in January 1990 and the 
final PPI premium was paid in January 1994.
Barclays should calculate and pay Mr D 8% simple interest (15% before April 1993) on these 
premiums, calculated from when each payment was made to when it is refunded.
If Mr D made a claim on the policy in the past Barclays can take the value of the claim off the 
compensation- thats because if Mr D had not been sold the policy he wouldnt have been 
able to benefit from the claim.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ds complaint and direct Barclays Bank UK PLC to calculate and pay Mr D 
compensation as set out in this decision.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2021.
