K821x#15complaint
Mr L complains  that a credit check was made  for his second  loan application  when hed 
been told by Improveasy Limiteds appointed representative that another  credit check  
wouldnt be made. Mr Ls wife is also involved with his complaint.
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr L had made  a loan application  which was accepted but he then cancelled  that 
loan within the cancellation period;
he was contacted by Improveasys appointed representative and was offered a loan 
with a lower deposit;
I consider it to be more likely than not that Mr L told the appointed representative that 
he didnt want another credit check to be made  and that he was told that another 
credit check  wasnt  necessary (and thats consistent with the text messages that 
Mr Ls wife exchanged with the appointed  representative) - but a credit  check  was 
made and the application was declined;
Mr L was made aware that a credit  check would be made before his first application 
and Improveasy says that a screenshot would have  been  displayed about a credit 
check before the revised application was made   but I consider that to be 
inconsistent with the information that he was given  by the appointed  representative;
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that Mr L wouldnt have 
applied for the loan with the lower  deposit if hed been told that a credit check  had to 
be made - nor am I persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show that the credit  
difficulties that Mr L has described  have been  caused solely  by the second  credit 
check that was made;
I understand that Mr L has started legal proceedings against the appointed 
representative to recover some  money  that he paid to it  but I dont consider that to 
be something for which Improveasy is responsible so I cant  require it to refund that 
money to him;
I consider that Mr L has been  caused distress  and inconvenience as a result of the 
incorrect information about the second credit check that he was given  by 
Improveasys appointed representative - and I agree  with the investigator that it 
would be fair and reasonable for Improveasy to pay £100 to Mr L to compensate him 
for that distress and inconvenience;  and
Im not persuaded that the distress and inconvenience  that Mr L has been caused 
justifies the £500 compensation that hes claimed.
Ref: DRN31854182my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Ls complaint and I order 
Improveasy Limited to pay him £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience that 
hes been caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 May 2020.
