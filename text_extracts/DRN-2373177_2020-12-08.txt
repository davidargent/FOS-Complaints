The complaint
Mr B complains that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited settled his agreement in 
error and sent him an arrears letter asking him to pay approximately £23,000.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision upholding this complaint. In summary, I concluded that VWFS 
made an error when it closed Mr Bs finance agreement. 
I explained that whilst it was unfortunate that Mr B received a debt collection letter the day 
before he was due to go on holiday, I didnt think it was fair to ask VWFS to reimburse the 
cost of the holiday. 
I invited Mr B and VWFS to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wanted to 
make before I finally determined the matter.
Both Mr B and VWFS said they accepted my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Both parties have accepted my provisional decision. So I see no reason to reach different 
conclusions from the ones I set out in my provisional decision.
Putting things right
VWFS must amend Mr Bs credit file and pay compensation. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited 
must:
Amend Mr Bs credit file to reflect how it looked when he first entered into the 
agreement
Pay total compensation of £500 for trouble and upset
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2021.
