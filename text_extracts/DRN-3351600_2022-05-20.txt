The complaint
Mr P complains about the support he received from National Westminster Bank Plc when he 
was in financial difficulties. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. 
Instead, Ill focus on the reasons for my decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr P has a personal loan with NatWest. In 2020 he was out of work, so he asked NatWest 
for support. NatWest agreed two three-month Covid-related payment deferrals. This was in 
line with Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance which said borrowers impacted by 
the pandemic wouldnt need to make repayments for up to six-months in total. Im satisfied 
NatWest treated Mr P fairly here as it offered appropriate support for what was expected to 
be a temporarily difficult period. 
In March 2021, when Mr Ps second three-month payment deferral was coming to end, he 
asked NatWest for a further one-month payment deferral. He was given conflicting 
information and NatWest were unable to provide an immediate answer. NatWest couldve 
provided clearer information, sooner, but I dont think this had a material impact on Mr Ps 
financial position. I say this because NatWest provided the correct information relatively 
quickly by confirming he wasnt entitled to a further payment deferral - because hed already 
had the maximum number of deferrals - and offered to consider alternative support. 
NatWest needed Mr P to complete an income and expenditure assessment, to see what 
alternative support it could offer. From the contemporaneous notes it seems Mr P declined 
this and suggested he no longer required support as hed borrow money  which it appears 
is what he ultimately did, by borrowing money from family. Im satisfied NatWest did enough 
to support Mr P here.
As set out above, NatWest could have provided better customer service. NatWest 
apologised and paid Mr P Â£100 compensation in recognition of the inconvenience its service 
failings caused him. In the overall circumstances of this complaint I consider that fair and 
reasonable. It follows Im not requiring NatWest to pay Mr P further compensation.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 June 2022.
