The complaint
Miss K complains that MetLife Europe d.a.c. unfairly declined a claim she made on her 
private medical insurance policy.  
What happened
Miss K purchased her private medical policy with MetLife via a broker in 2017.
In 2019 Miss K unfortunately became ill and was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis.After 
looking at MetLife's website and calling to discuss what she'd be covered for with one of its 
advisor on the phone she made a claim to MetLife for the diagnosis and the time she spent 
in hospital. 
MetLife paid Miss K £300 for the time she was in hospital, but it said she wasn't covered for 
the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. It said the policies Miss K saw online were newer 
policies than hers and covered slightly different things. It  apologised for giving Miss K 
incorrect advice about what she was covered for when she called to make her claim.
Miss K wasn't happy with this and complained to MetLife. She said she should've been 
updated to the newer policy automatically, or at least should have been informed about it 
and given the choice to take it out herself. She said because of this, and the fact she was 
told she'd be covered for the diagnosis when she called, MetLife should pay her for this part 
of the claim too.
MetLife didn't agree and so Miss K brought her complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into it and didn't think MetLife had treated Miss K fairly. She thought 
it acted in line with the terms and conditions of Miss K's policy when it declined this part of 
her claim so she didn't think it needed to pay it. But she recommended MetLife pay Miss K 
£150 compensation for the loss of expectation and inconvenience caused by 
MetLife incorrectly saying she'd be covered.
MetLife agreed with our investigator. But Miss K wanted an ombudsman's decision, so the 
case has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I'm upholding it, in part. 
I'll explain why.
MetLife didn't sell the policy to Miss K.  It isn't responsible for sending her documentation. 
Nor is it responsible for telling her when a new policy with different terms becomes available. 
I understand Miss K would have liked her policy to have been automatically changed to 
reflect the latest one available, but this isn't something MetLife needs to do.I've seen other policies provided by MetLife, including those Miss K saw online. These do 
provide a benefit for being diagnosed with bacterial meningitis. But what MetLife needs to do 
is fairly assess Miss K's claim in line with the terms and conditions of her policy. I've seen 
the terms of this policy too and I'm satisfied it doesn't include a benefit for the diagnosis of 
bacterial meningitis. As Miss K isn't covered for this, I'm not asking MetLife to pay her any 
benefit for it.
MetLife's website showed the latest policy, and it could have been clearer in telling its 
customers to make sure they check their own policy documents - a change it's now made. 
But this doesn't mean MetLife needs to pay Miss K's claim. Had it been clearer, Miss K 
would have likely checked her documents and seen she wasn't covered.
Equally, MetLife should have advised Miss K she wasn't covered when she made her claim. 
But this too doesn't mean MetLife needs to pay this part of her claim.
This advice, and the information on MetLife's website has led to Miss K suffering a loss of 
expectation. And she's also suffered inconvenience by going through the claim process for 
this part of her claim unnecessarily.
Putting things right
I agree with our investigator that an apology isn't a sufficient acknowledgement of the trouble 
and upset caused. I'm satisfied £150 compensation is a much fairer reflection in the 
circumstances.  
My final decision
Based on the above, my final decision is that I uphold Miss K's complaint. I require 
MetLife Europe d.a.c. to pay Miss K £150 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 April 2020.
