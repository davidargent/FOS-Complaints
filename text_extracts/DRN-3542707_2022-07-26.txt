The complaint
Mr and Mrs T complain that National Westminster Bank Plcs service was poor and it unfairly 
declined to port their mortgage. They ask that NatWest refunds the early repayment charge 
(ERC) they paid and pays compensation for fees paid to their new lender and adviser. They 
also ask for an apology, that staff are reprimanded, and confirmation NatWest has put better 
processes in place.
What happened
Mr and Mrs T had a mortgage with NatWest. They had a preferential interest product which 
included an ERC. Mr and Mrs T wanted to move home and applied to port their mortgage in 
August 2021. A valuation of the property was carried out on behalf of NatWest. The valuer 
said the property wasnt suitable security due to its condition. Mr and Mrs T say the valuation 
was wrong and unfair for a number of reasons.
Mr and Mrs T also complained that the mortgage adviser didnt do enough to chase up their 
application. And they werent happy with how NatWest dealt with their complaint. NatWest 
agreed it hadnt dealt properly with Mr and Mrs Ts complaint and offered compensation.
Our investigator said NatWest appointed a suitably qualified valuer  a member of the Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors. It raised Mr and Mrs Ts concerns with the valuer. Our 
investigator said NatWest was entitled to rely on the surveyors expert opinion. Once the 
application was declined, NatWest moved the matter to its complaints team and there was 
nothing further the mortgage adviser could do. 
Mr and Mrs T didnt agree. Mr T said:
another high street lender said the property was suitable security several weeks later. 
NatWest didnt have a documented process to follow when theres a failed valuation or a 
mortgage is declined. NatWest hadnt provided recordings of all their phone calls, which 
contain crucial information. He says this breaches regulations. 
NatWest admitted several points of fault.
He was prepared to take the matter to court. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I should first explain that this service isnt a regulator and we dont have the powers of a 
regulator, such as to fine businesses or tell them to change their internal processes. If Mr T 
remains concerned that NatWest breached rules set out by the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) he can consider contacting the FCA.
Our role is to settle disputes quickly and with minimal formality. I decide a complaint by 
reference to what is, in my opinion, fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the case. In 
doing so, I take relevant law, regulation and guidance issued by the regulator into account. 
Mr T made detailed comments about why he disagreed with NatWests decision to decline 
their porting application and about its business practices. I dont intend to set out matters in 
the same level of detail, or respond to each point made by Mr T. Im not required to do so, 
and I dont need to do so in order to reach a fair outcome, or explain why Ive reached my 
decision. Mr T says there were many phone calls for which NatWest didnt provide 
recordings. While I understand his frustration, Im satisfied I have enough evidence to reach 
a fair decision. 
I should also say that where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I 
reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most 
likely to have happened in light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances. 
NatWest declined Mr and Mrs Ts porting application because the valuer it instructed said 
the property wasnt suitable security. NatWest instructed a suitably qualified valuer. It 
followed its usual process when doing so. It didnt have to instruct the valuer to discuss any 
works being done to the property with the vendors or Mr and Mrs T. It didnt have to give the 
valuers contact details to Mr T so that he could tell the valuer when to visit the property.
The surveyor inspected the property on 23 August 2021. He said the property wasnt 
suitable security because it requires a full refurbishment program and in its current state 
isnt readily saleable.
Mr T says NatWest didnt provide them with a documented process to follow when theres a 
problem with a valuation. NatWest doesnt have to provide copies of its policies or processes 
to Mr T. I think NatWest responded fairly when Mr and Mrs T raised concerns about the 
valuation. It raised their concerns with the surveyor. It explained it followed its usual process 
when instructing the valuation and explained why the property wasnt suitable security.
I dont think there was an obvious error with the valuation that meant it was unreasonable for 
NatWest to rely on it. 
Mr T says the surveyor visited when the roof was being replaced and would have given a 
successful valuation on any day after this. He says he asked for an immediate re-valuation 
during one of the calls that wasnt recorded, and this wasnt actioned by NatWest. 
NatWest accepts it told Mr T he could pay for another valuation. However, it also told Mr T it 
wouldnt instruct a new valuation until the property was habitable and not being refurbished 
in any way. NatWest pointed out that the surveyor had said the roof wasnt the only problem 
with the property. 
Mr and Mrs T repaid their mortgage on 26 November 2021. If the property was in a suitable 
condition soon after the valuation in late August 2021, as Mr T says, they had time to contact 
NatWest to confirm this and pay for a new valuation. NatWest says they didnt do so. As 
Mr T sent considerable correspondence to NatWest at that time, I think its unlikely there 
wouldnt be some record if he had done so. 
Mr T says NatWest was, or should have been aware, of the condition of the property when 
they made the application. I dont think, based on the available evidence, thats reasonable. 
If fact, NatWest says Mr T confirmed that the property was habitable. But if NatWest had 
known earlier that the property wasnt suitable security the outcome would have been the 
same  it would have declined the application.NatWest says, once Mr and Mrs Ts application had been declined, there was no reason for 
the mortgage adviser to continue to be involved. I think thats reasonable. 
Mr and Mrs T took out a mortgage with another lender. That doesnt mean NatWest made an 
error. Each lender has its own lending criteria.
When Mr and Mrs T repaid their mortgage they paid an ERC. Theyd taken out an interest 
rate product in 2020 which included the ERC. The ERC was clearly set out in the product 
offer in the form of a table. Mr and Mrs T agreed to this when they took out the product. Mr 
and Mrs T repaid the mortgage while the ERC applied, and I think NatWest was entitled to 
apply the ERC.
I dont think NatWest made an error or treated Mr and Mrs T unfairly. It told Mr and Mrs T it 
wouldnt port the mortgage product to the property they wanted to buy until it was habitable 
and not being re-furbished. It was Mr and Mrs Ts decision to go ahead with a different 
lender. In the circumstances, I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to 
refund the ERC, pay compensation or take any further steps in relation to Mr and Mrs Ts 
complaint. 
Complaint handling isnt itself a regulated activity. That means we cant usually look into 
complaints about how a complaint was handled. I could do so if the way the complaint was 
dealt with impacted a problem being sorted out. I dont think that was the case here. 
NatWest offered Â£350 for poor service when responding to Mr and Mrs Ts complaint. It says 
the offer remains open and I leave it to Mr and Mrs T whether to accept it.
Mr T says hed win his case if he takes the matter to court. If Mr and Mrs T dont accept my 
decision theyll be free to take the matter to court, if they wish to do so.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T and Mrs T to 
accept or reject my decision before 23 August 2022.
