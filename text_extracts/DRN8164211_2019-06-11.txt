Mr W says that the loans were lent irresponsibly and trapped him in a spiral  of debt.
QuickQuid says that before the loans  were provided  adequate  affordability  checks  were 
carried out. It says the loans were proportionate  to Mr Ws declared  income  and there were 
significant breaks in his borrowing history. It says Mr W didnt contact it at any time to say he 
was in financial difficulty and that he only incurred two late payment fees and repaid  his 
loans as scheduled. It did offer to refund the interest and charges on one loan.
Our adjudicator partially upheld this complaint. She didnt think shed seen enough to say it 
was unfair  that loans  one and two were  lent. However she thought that loans  three onwards 
shouldnt have been provided.
QuickQuid didnt accept  that it had lent irresponsibly. It said adequate checks  were carried 
out and the loans appeared affordable.  It noted Mr W had borrowed on several  occasions  
but said that he had a good repayment  history  and that there were gaps in his borrowing. 
QuickQuid did however accept our adjudicators  recommendations  in regard to loans three 
to five, eight to eleven and loan thirteen. 
Mr W didnt accept QuickQuids offer.

my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr W could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account  
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and 
the consumer's  income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans - not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Most of the loans  in this case were provided before CONC. At that time the relevant 
guidance was provided by the Office of Fair trading  (OFT) and this also set out the need  to 
make a reasonable assessment of whether a borrower can afford  to meet  repayments  in a 
sustainable manner.  This refers to issues such as being able to the make  the repayments  
without undue difficulties  throughout the life of the agreement and without having to realise 
Ref: DRN81642113security or assets. It then further sets out that without  undue difficulty  means without having 
to borrow further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
Mr W took out his first loan with QuickQuid in March 2013 and this was for £300. He then 
took out a second loan for £100  less than a month  after repaying  the first. Given these  were  
the first two loans in the lending chain  and given the size of the repayments compared  to 
Mr Ws income, I agree with our adjudicator  that there isnt enough to say these loans  
shouldnt have been provided.
Loan three was for a larger amount, £500.  The required repayment  was substantial 
compared to Mr Ws income.  Given this I think more should have been  done to ensure the 
loan was affordable.  Had this happened QuickQuid would have realised that this loan wasnt 
sustainably affordable for Mr W. This loan was topped up within a couple of weeks  further 
increasing the required repayment  amount.
QuickQuid accepted the uphold recommendations in regard to loans three to five and given 
the information I have seen I find this reasonable. 
Mr W took out a sixth loan in October  2013.  This loan was for £300.  By the time this loan 
was provided Mr Ws overall pattern of borrowing suggested he had become persistently 
reliant on short-term loans. Mr W had taken six loans in seven months,  and the amounts he 
was borrowing didnt  significantly  decrease  over this period and were  generally increasing 
for the rest of the borrowing  relationship  with QuickQuid. In my view,  the pattern of lending 
itself shows that the loans  from here were unsustainable  so I dont think  Mr W should have 
been given any of loans from loan six onwards.
I note the comments about  gaps between  some of the loans but I dont think it would have 
been reasonable for QuickQuid to conclude these were any indication that Mr Ws finances 
had moved on from whatever situation  had required his previous loans.
I also note one of the loans  was a flexible credit  agreement. However this doesnt change  
my view that by loan six QuickQuid should have been concerned about Mr Ws pattern of 
borrowing and that this showed  a reliance on short term lending.
I think that Mr W lost out because QuickQuid continued to lend to him which had the effect  of 
unfairly prolonging his indebtedness  by allowing him to take expensive  credit intended for 
short term use over an extended  period  of time.  The sheer number  of loans was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr W's ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
Overall, due to the reasons set out above, I think that loans three onwards shouldnt have 
been provided.
Ref: DRN81642114my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans  three onwards. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mr W paid on loan three onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans three to five from Mr W's credit file. The 
number of loans  taken from this point means any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loan six onwards should be removed  from Mr W's credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 July 2019.
