The complaint
Mr and Mrs W complain about errors made by National Westminster Bank Plc when they 
ported their mortgage. They ask that it waives the early repayment charge.
What happened
Mr and Mrs W ported their mortgage with NatWest to a new property. Shortly before 
completion, NatWest told Mr and Mrs Ws solicitor no ERC was payable. After completion it 
said part of the ERC, about £5,000, was due. This was because Mr and Mrs Ws new loan 
was for a smaller amount than their previous loan, and an ERC applied to the difference. 
Mr and Mrs W say NatWest should honour its statement that no ERC was due. They say its 
error caused financial and emotional distress. They say they transferred the money to a 
savings account and would be charged a fee for withdrawing it. Mr and Mrs W also complain 
about NatWests poor service, its complaint handling and the time theyve spent trying to sort 
the matter out.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He said while 
NatWest made an error, it took fair and reasonable steps to correct its error quickly. It wasnt 
fair to ask it to write off the ERC, which was owed. He said the £500 compensation paid by 
NatWest for the trouble and upset caused was fair.
Mr and Mrs W didnt agree. They said they didnt dispute the ERC, it was NatWests process 
and communication that caused problems. Mr W said their solicitor had to contact NatWest 
to sort matters out.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest made errors here. First, it sent a redemption statement on 16 July 2019 saying, 
incorrectly, that an ERC of nearly £10,000 was payable. Mr and Mrs Ws solicitor called 
NatWest on 25 July 2019 and was told, also incorrectly, that no ERC was payable. NatWest 
noticed the error shortly after the sale and purchase completed, when the funds sent by the 
solicitor didnt include the partial ERC.
NatWest offered £500 compensation for the upset and trouble this caused. I need to decide 
if thats fair and reasonable. In doing so, Ive taken the following into account.
The ERC is set out in the mortgage offer, which Mr and Mrs W accepted. This says a 
partial ERC is payable if less than the full balance is ported. Mr and Mrs W say they dont 
dispute the ERC. 
NatWest sent an email to Mr and Mrs Ws solicitor about the partial ERC on 31 July 
2019. It also spoke to her by phone on 1 and 2 August 2019. NatWests notes of the call 
on 2 August 2019 say the solicitor said shed contact Mr and Mrs W about paying the 
shortfall and would be in contact if there were any issues. The solicitors notes say 
NatWest would contact Mr and Mrs W.
NatWests notes say it tried to call Mr and Mrs Ws solicitor on 21 August. The solicitor 
contacted NatWest on 22 August, saying Mr W had been trying to contact NatWest and 
was waiting to hear from NatWest. 
It seems there was a misunderstanding between Mr and Mrs Ws solicitor and NatWest 
on 2 August about who would contact Mr and Mrs W. I can see this could have meant Mr 
and Mrs W werent told about the error immediately. And Mr W says the mortgage 
account was shown as redeemed on his mobile banking app and online banking. But the 
solicitor said on 22 August that Mr W had been trying to contact NatWest about the ERC, 
so I think he was aware of the problem by then. And he made a complaint at the end of 
August.
NatWest said it wouldnt remove its charge until the payment was made. This caused 
difficulties for Mr and Mrs W and their solicitor. In late 2019 NatWest arranged for the 
charge to be released, which took effect in early January 2020. Theres nothing to 
suggest it wouldnt have removed the charge earlier if it had received the partial ERC.
Mr and Mrs W havent said they have financial difficulties, and I havent seen anything to 
suggest this is the case. Theyve been aware for more than a year that the partial ERC is 
owed. I think theyve had a reasonable amount of time to consider how to pay it and 
make arrangements to do so. 
Having taken all this into account, I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to 
waive the partial ERC. The partial ERC was due when the mortgage was repaid, and I think 
Mr and Mrs W were aware of this  even if they didnt know the exact amount. 
NatWest took steps to inform Mr and Mrs W promptly of its error. I think it was reasonable for 
it to do this initially by contacting the solicitor dealing with the property sale and redemption 
of the mortgage for Mr and Mrs W. Its unfortunate that there was a misunderstanding about 
who would then contact Mr and Mrs W. But I dont think this changed the outcome. When 
they were made aware of the amount of the partial ERC due (some time later in August 
2019) Mr and Mrs W didnt pay it.
Mr and Mrs W said this matter caused them financial distress. They havent provided 
evidence of this. Mr and Mrs W also say they were caused emotional distress and complain 
about the time theyve spent on this matter. I cant see that this matter will be resolved until 
the partial ERC is paid or waived. I can understand that Mr and Mrs W would prefer not to 
pay the partial ERC. But I think the reason this matter has gone on for so long is because 
they were hoping not to have to pay it. 
I dont doubt though that NatWests error did cause some upset and inconvenience to Mr 
and Mrs W. I think the £500 compensation it paid for this is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances.
Mr W says NatWest didnt deal properly with his complaint. Complaint handling isnt a 
regulated activity, and so I cant look into those concerns here.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. This is because I think the compensation 
paid by National Westminster Bank Plc is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W and Mr W 
to accept or reject my decision before 14 October 2020.
