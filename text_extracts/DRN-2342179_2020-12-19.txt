The complaint
Miss X complains that PayPal Europe S.A.R.L & Cie, S.C.A unfairly refused to refund her for 
an item she bought using PayPal which she said was faulty.
What happened
In May 2019 Miss X bought shoes online, paying through PayPal. On 26 November 2019 
she opened a dispute with PayPal under its Buyer Protection policy on the basis the shoes 
were Significantly Not As Described (SNAD) she said the shoes were faulty. She was 
informed by PayPal that unless she escalated it to a claim before 16 December 2019 the 
dispute would be automatically closed. Miss X says she was in hospital until that day so was 
unable to respond by the deadline, so PayPal closed the dispute. When she called PayPal 
she says a manager was very rude to her and hung up on the call. 
Miss X brought her complaint to our service. She wanted an apology, a refund of the 
purchase price, and compensation. Our investigator didnt uphold her complaint. Hed 
investigated her complaint with PayPal and received some information from it. He said shed 
logged into her account three times before 16 December and couldve escalated the dispute 
to a claim at those times, so he didnt think it was unfair it had been closed. PayPal did 
attempt to escalate her claim after hearing of her circumstances which is what he wouldve 
expected. He added that PayPal had said that faulty items were a warranty issue which 
werent covered by its Buyer Protection policy so even if it had been escalated by 16 
December its likely it wouldve been declined for that reason. There wasnt a call recording 
of the call where Miss X says a PayPal representative was rude to her. 
Miss X wasnt happy with our investigators view. She said that under PayPal rules she had 
20 calendar days, not 480 hours, to escalate the claim and this ended on 16 December. But 
PayPal closed the case that day so werent following their terms and conditions. She 
contacted it on 16 December, and the case was re-opened and then closed again on 23 
December without a proper reason. PayPal shouldve allowed her to return the goods to the 
seller and obtain a refund. Miss X later added that the reason she didnt escalate the dispute 
to a claim was that before shed gone to hospital, shed agreed with the seller that she could 
return the goods and obtain a refund, so there was no need. But she didnt have enough 
time to do this before she went to hospital which was why she needed to escalate the 
dispute. 
After asking for more information from PayPal, our investigator issued a second view, 
responding to Miss Xs comments. He still didnt uphold her complaint. He thought PayPal 
had acted in line with its User Agreement. 
So Miss X asked for a decision from an ombudsman. She still thought shed acted within the 
20-day window, and PayPal should open a window to allow her to return the goods and get a 
refund. Since it wont do that, it should refund her. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that Miss X feels very strongly that shes followed PayPals processes and it 
should refund her for her purchase. Thats understandable. But Im afraid Im going to have 
to disappoint her, as Im not upholding her complaint.
 
The essence of Miss Xs complaint is that she wasnt given the full 20 days to escalate the 
dispute to a claim. I think she was. Including 26 November, which is the day she raised the 
dispute, the 20-day period ended on 15 December. And the communications from PayPal 
were clear that she had to escalate the dispute to a claim before 16 December, otherwise it 
would be closed. 
I understand Miss X says she was in hospital, but Ive seen information showing she logged 
into her PayPal account 3 times between 26 November and before 16 December, and Ive 
no reason to think she couldnt escalate the dispute then. Shes told us shed reached an 
agreement with the seller that she could return the goods and get a refund but wasnt able to 
do so before she went to hospital, which is the reason she hadnt escalated the dispute 
sooner - she didnt need to. Im sorry to hear shes been in hospital, but I do think she knew 
she hadnt been able to return the goods as agreed, so it wasnt clear the seller would refund 
her. So I think it was reasonably clear to her before 16 December 2019 that she needed to 
take the precaution of escalating the dispute to a claim because she hadnt been able to 
return the goods. 
PayPal did re-open her case after 16 December. So I think it did give some consideration to 
her circumstances. It responded on 22 December saying that it had reviewed the transaction 
and was denying her claim because the purchase was ineligible for Purchase Protection 
according to PayPals User Agreement. PayPal has explained this is because Miss X had 
said the shoes were faulty, but as she raised this four months after purchase (ombudsman 
note  it was in fact raised nearly six months after purchase) this was a warranty issue, 
which wasnt covered by its Buyer Protection policy. Ive looked at the User Agreement, and 
it does say at 13.1 that PayPal Buyer Protection is not a product warranty. Product warranty 
isnt defined in the User Agreement. In my view a product warranty generally refers to an 
assurance concerning quality and durability with a promise to replace or repair. The 
relevance of time passing wasnt a reference to disputes having to be raised within 180 
days, but to what PayPal saw as a claim based on quality or durability (lifespan, wear and 
tear) which wasnt covered by the Buyer Protection policy, rather than on SNAD, which was 
covered. 
Miss X thinks PayPal should open a window so she can return the goods to the seller and 
get a refund. But I dont think it would be fair for me to tell PayPal to do so. In my view it has 
complied with its terms and conditions concerning time frames and Im not persuaded that 
the issue Miss X has with the shoes falls within the Buyer Protection policy for goods SNAD. 
So I wont be asking PayPal to do anything further. Im sorry to disappoint Miss X. 
Finally, although I dont doubt Miss Xs perception that she had an unpleasant telephone call 
with a PayPal representative, as theres no recording of the call Im unable to make any 
finding about that. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss X to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 January 2021.
