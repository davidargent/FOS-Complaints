The complaint
Mrs S complains that PrePay Technologies Limited (PrePay) didnt do enough to prevent 
her losing money sent to two of its customers as a result of a scam. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat everything 
here. In brief summary, in December 2020 Mrs S sent payments totalling £3,760 from her 
accounts (not held with PrePay) to two accounts held with PrePay. 
Mrs S then realised shed been scammed. Ultimately, remaining unhappy when she didnt 
recover her lost funds, she referred a complaint about PrePay to us. Investigators here 
looked into things, but Mrs S remained unhappy with PrePay and asked for an 
Ombudsmans decision. This complaint has therefore been passed to me to decide. 
I sent Mrs S and PrePay my provisional decision on 4 August 2023, and now that both 
parties have had an opportunity to reply, Im ready to explain my final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusions as explained in my provisional decision, 
and for the same reasons. I dont uphold this complaint in the main, although Im satisfied 
PrePay should pay Mrs S £200 for distress and inconvenience. So I uphold this complaint in 
part. Ive explained the reasons for my decision again below.
Let me say, first of all, Im sorry to hear Mrs S has been the victim of a scam. I sympathise 
with the situation she has found herself in, and I understand why she thinks its unfair she 
should bear the loss. Ultimately Mrs S has suffered her loss because of fraudsters. I cant 
reasonably ask PrePay to reimburse losses that resulted from the criminal actions of third 
parties unless its acts or omissions unfairly resulted in Mrs Ss loss. So what I have to decide 
is whether or not PrePay reasonably did enough to prevent, or respond to, the alleged 
authorised push payment (APP) fraud. 
PrePay has shared relevant information with this service in confidence to allow us to 
discharge our investigatory functions and has provided that which is necessary for the 
determination of this complaint. But Im also limited to how much of this I can share for the 
same reasons as PrePay. But Id like to assure Mrs S Ive carefully reviewed everything 
before reaching my decision. 
I appreciate Mrs S feels PrePay should refund her loss as it allowed fraudsters to open and 
operate accounts. But an account later found to have been utilised to misappropriate funds 
doesnt automatically entitle the payer (victim) to a refund nor does it mean that the recipient 
bank unreasonably failed to prevent the loss. What I need to consider is whether at the time 
of opening the accounts PrePay ought reasonably to have known that the accounts being 
opened would later be used fraudulently. And in the circumstances of this complaint, Im 
satisfied in terms of account opening procedures, checks and due diligence, PrePays acts 
or omissions were not the cause of Mrs Ss loss. 
 
Ive also considered whether there was anything prior to Mrs Ss notification of fraud that 
ought to have alerted PrePay to the possibility of fraud. Im satisfied none of the account 
activity ought to have stood out to PrePay as unusual or suspicious. So I cant fairly say 
PrePay missed an opportunity to prevent Mrs Ss loss here either.
Im also satisfied that PrePay has ultimately now returned the funds that were left in the 
recipients accounts and available for recovery at the time it was notified of the alleged APP 
fraud. For the sake of clarity, that was £26.59 (which Mrs S has confirmed receiving), and 
£76.81 which I understand was returned via Lloyds. 
However, when PrePay was alerted to the APP fraud, it ought to have acted quickly and 
appropriately. Im satisfied for the same reasons as explained by our Investigator that 
PrePay failed to do so. In short, PrePay acted very slowly and gave inaccurate and 
contradictory information, leading, in my view, to unnecessary distress and inconvenience. 
Im satisfied, for the same reasons as our Investigator, that PrePay should pay Mrs S £200 
to compensate her for this. 
I understand Mrs S will be disappointed by this, as she feels additional compensation is 
warranted, and shes reiterated this in her response to my provisional decision. However, for 
the reasons Ive explained, I dont think PrePay missed an opportunity to prevent the fraud. 
And fraud of this type can be deeply upsetting, so I think this was always, once it had 
happened, going to be a distressing period for Mrs S. For the reasons explained, I cant 
reasonably hold PrePay responsible for the distress caused by the fraud. Im also satisfied it 
has returned the funds from the accounts that were available for recovery at the time it was 
notified of the fraud. But I am satisfied compensation of £200 should be paid to reflect its 
mistakes in progressing things as quickly and accurately as it should have.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold this complaint in part, and I direct PrePay 
Technologies Limited to pay Mrs S £200.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 September 2023.
