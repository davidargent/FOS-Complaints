The complaint
Mr S complains about the amount that hes been charged by Close Brothers Limited, trading 
as Close Brothers Motor Finance, for damage to a car that he returned when he terminated 
the conditional sale agreement under which the car had been supplied to him
.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr S under a conditional sale agreement with Close 
Brothers that he electronically signed in November 2016;
the car was about five and a half years old, had been driven for 56,000 miles and had 
a price of £6,524;
Mr S terminated the agreement early and it was inspected by a third party on behalf 
of Close Brothers in July 2019  the inspection report recorded the cars mileage as 
93,089, identified damage to the car with an estimated cost of £824 and included 
photos of the damage;
Close Brothers charged him for that damage so he complained to it and then to this 
service  our investigator recommended that the charges should be removed other 
than the charges for the damage to the nearside wing, rear bumper and offside front 
seat;
neither Close Brothers nor Mr S accepted the investigators recommendations but I 
consider that those recommendations were fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
the agreement said: You must maintain the Goods in good and reasonable order 
and condition at your expense. You are responsible for all loss of or damage to, the 
Goods, except for any due to fair wear and tear;
when the car was inspected in July 2019 it was eight years old and had been driven 
for 93,089 miles and Close Brothers hasnt provided any detailed evidence to show 
the condition of the car when it was supplied to Mr S;
the inspection report shows that there was damage to the car when it was returned 
and I consider that they do show a scratched nearside wing and damage to the rear 
bumper and the offside front seat - Im not persuaded that that damage would 
reasonably be considered to be fair wear and tear;
I dont consider that any of the other damage shown on the photos would reasonably 
be considered to be more than fair wear and tear on a car that was eight years old 
and that had been driven for 93,089 miles  so I dont consider that its fair or 
reasonable for Close Brothers to charge Mr S for that damage;
the inspection report recommended charges of £114.80 for the scratched wing, 
£67.50 for the damage to the bumper and £200 for the damage to the seat  which is 
a total of £382.30;
I consider that Mr S knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that hed be charged 
for any damage to the car which was more than fair wear and tear and he had the 
opportunity to have the damage repaired before he returned the car  but didnt do 
so;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the charges 
recommended in the inspection report are excessive or that its unfair or 
unreasonable for Close Brothers to charge those amounts to Mr S; and
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Close Brothers 
to reduce the total charge for the damage to the car that was returned by Mr S to 
£382.30.
Putting things right
I find that Close Brothers should reduce the total charge for the damage to £382.30. I also 
find that, if it has recorded any adverse information about the charges for the damage on 
Mr Ss credit file, it should remove that information. But Im not persuaded that it would be 
fair or reasonable for me to require it to take any other action in response to Mr Ss 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ss complaint in part and I order Close Brothers Limited, 
trading as Close Brothers Motor Finance, to:
1. Reduce the total charge for the damage to the car that was returned by Mr S to 
£382.30.
2. Remove any adverse information about the charges that its recorded on Mr Ss 
credit file.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 December 2020.
