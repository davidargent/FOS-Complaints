K821x#15Complaint
Mrs C complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc lent irresponsibly when it approved 
loans in 2015 and 2016. 
Background
The background to this complaint, and my initial conclusions, were set out in my provisional 
decision dated 30 August 2019  a copy of which is attached and forms part of this final 
decision. 
In my provisional decision I explained  why I thought this complaint should be upheld  and 
what NatWest should  do to put things  right. I invited both parties to send me any additional  
information or comments they wished to make. 
Mrs Cs representative responded to confirm  she accepted and didnt provide any additional  
comments or information for me to consider.  
NatWest didnt accept  my provisional decision.  NatWest said the crux of my decision was 
that Mrs C had a higher  than usual level of outgoings before her second loan was approved 
and that it didnt take her deteriorating  circumstances  into account. NatWest has gone onto 
explain that the second loan was approved on the basis  of refinancing  existing debt which is 
why the low surplus income  figure  was accepted. NatWest says it determined  both loans 
were affordable but that this would  be temporary. 
My findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments as well as NatWests response  to 
my provisional decision to decide  whats  fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint.
I have reconsidered  the information  NatWest has already provided showing how the loan 
applications were  handled in light of its more recent  comments. Having done so, I havent  
been persuaded to change my decision. I note NatWest hasnt responded to any of the 
points I made in my provisional decision concerning the first loan it approved. As NatWest 
hasnt provided  any additional comments in relation to the first loan I see no reason to 
change the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. 
NatWest says the second loan was approved to reduce Mrs Cs outgoings  but that its 
lending checks had confirmed both loans were affordable  at the same time. Whilst the basis 
of the application for the second loan may have been to consolidate  debts, NatWest  still had 
to ensure the borrowing  was sustainable.  It says it completed checks  to ensure both loans 
(and Mrs Cs existing  outgoings) were  affordable.  But for the reasons Ive set out in detail in 
my provisional decision, I didnt find checks it completed before  approving  either loan were 
proportionate. And I still think  that if NatWest had completed proportionate checks it would 
have declined both of Mrs Cs loan applications as it would have found neither loan was 
affordable. 
I note everything that NatWest has said in its original file submission as well as its comments 
following my provisional decision dated  30 August 2019. But I remain  of the view that 
NatWest lent irresponsibly when it approved both Mrs Cs loans so Im going to proceed in 
line with my provisional decision and uphold this complaint. 
Ref: DRN18322262My final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and direct  National Westminster Bank Plc to:
-Refund all interest  and charges applied to both loans.  NatWest should use the refund 
to reduce the outstanding  balances  
-Stop charging interest  on the outstanding loan balances and recalculate Mrs Cs 
monthly payments  accordingly
-Remove any adverse  information in relation to the loans from Mrs Cs credit file 
-Pay Mrs C £250 for the distress  and inconvenience caused
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 November 2019.

Complaint
Mrs C complains that National Westminster  Bank Plc lent irresponsibly when it approved loans  in 
2015 and 2016. 
Background
Mrs C had a loan and her current account with NatWest.  In May 2015 she applied for a loan of 
£10,200 over 60 months to repay her existing loan,  refinance some other debts  and provide some 
cash (Loan  1). NatWest looked at the loan application and recorded Mrs C earned £960 a month and 
had a mortgage  payment of £266. NatWest used  a figure of £381 for living costs and £58 for credit 
card repayments. NatWest said Mrs C had £251 available and approved the loan with a monthly 
payment of £191.
In May 2016  Mrs C applied for another loan. This loan was £7,450 over 60 months (Loan 2). This time 
NatWest recorded her income as £1,156. NatWest again said she had a mortgage payment of £266 
and living costs of £381 a month. NatWest added  the existing £191  loan payment Mrs C was making 
to a £154  credit card payment. NatWest  said Mrs C had £160  left after making her payments and 
approved the loan with monthly payments of £146 per month.  
In 2018 a third party mental health support charity  complained  to NatWest on Mrs Cs behalf.  It said 
NatWest had lent irresponsibly to a vulnerable consumer. But NatWest didnt agree.  NatWest said it 
wasnt aware Mrs C had mental  health concerns when it agreed  to lend.  NatWest said the loans  were 
approved in line with its lending criteria. There were  some delays in providing information about Mrs 
Cs loans and NatWest sent her £50 worth of vouchers to apologise. 
The complaint was referred to our service and an investigator  looked  at it. He didnt  uphold the 
complaint and didnt agree  NatWest had lent irresponsibly. On Mrs Cs behalf,  the charity asked to 
appeal so her complaints  been passed to me to make  a decision. 
My provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Having  done so, Ive reached a different decision to the investigator.  I 
intend to uphold this complaint. 
Ill start by talking about the mental  health issues the charity has told us about. I can see things have 
been very difficult for Mrs C and I dont doubt the loans have  contributed to that. Since its been told, 
NatWest has agreed for Mrs Cs loans  to be dealt with by its Vulnerable Consumer  Team and I think 
thats reasonable. But I havent found it was aware  of the mental  health concerns Mrs C has raised 
when it agreed  to lend. 
Ive looked at both loan applications and have concerns  about  NatWests decisions to lend. I 
appreciate the applications met NatWests normal  lending criteria, but I think there were  some clear 
warning signs  that should have made it think carefully  before deciding whether  to proceed. 
Using NatWests figures for Loan 1, Mrs C had £251 left after paying her mortgage and outgoings 
each month.  It approved  a loan with monthly payments of £191  which would have left Mrs C with £60 
a month. For Loan 2 the figure was considerably less at £14 left after making her loan payment. I 
think both figures are very close to the limit of what someone can get by on and left nothing  for Mrs C 
in case  of emergencies. But I dont think the figures NatWest used were reasonable or accurate and 
the information in Mrs Cs applications should have caused it to ask more questions. 
Mrs C applied for both loans with a view to consolidate other  debts. She told NatWest she was single,  
a homeowner and earned under £1,000 per month. Given the amount Mrs C was applying to borrow 
Ref: DRN18322264and the amount she already  owed, I think NatWests should have thought  about the applications and 
completed better checks to ensure the loans were  sustainable.
Loan 1 was for a large amount, £10,200 plus interest, and it had a long term of five years.  Mrs C was 
using the funds, in part, to repay existing borrowing she had with NatWest and other lenders. Mrs Cs 
income was around £960 a month  so, with interest, the total loan she was approved was broadly in 
line with her annual income. Taking all of these  points into account Id have expected NatWest to 
think carefully about whether go ahead. Given the nature of Mrs Cs application,  I dont think it was 
reasonable to rely on the standard information NatWest used. I think it should  have asked more  
questions. 
One of the things NatWest  could have done is to obtain a more detailed picture  of Mrs Cs income 
and outgoings. I note Mrs C banks with NatWest and it had access  to her current  account. So it could 
have used that information  when deciding whether to proceed.  
Ive looked at the bank statements and can see that in the months before NatWest approved Loan 1, 
Mrs Cs direct debit payments totalled between £876 and £1,160 a month. That doesnt take into 
account any spending on essentials like food, transport or general  living costs.  Those figures either  
approach Mrs Cs monthly income  figure or exceed  it. Im satisfied NatWest had information available 
that showed Loan 1 was unlikely to be sustainable and that if it had completed proportionate checks  it 
would have found that. 
Loan 2 was for £7,450 plus interest over five years. And Loan 2 was in addition to Loan 1. At this 
point, Mrs C had applied to borrow £17,650 plus interest in around a year. Given her income  and what 
NatWest already knew about Mrs C, Id have expected it to look at Loan 2 in greater detail before 
deciding whether  to proceed.  
Again, NatWest could have  asked Mrs C more  questions  about her income and outgoings  and could 
have used the bank statements it had available. Ive looked at March  and 
April 2016 to see what Mrs Cs rough levels of income  and outgoings  were. In March  2016 Mrs C had 
direct debits totalling £967  and was paid £990. In April 2016 Mrs C had £1,006 in direct debit 
payments and was paid £1,066. Again, neither of those figures  includes any spending on essentials  
like food or transport. In addition, I havent  included  overdraft charges Mrs C was paying. Given the 
lack of disposable income when looking  at Mrs Cs true position, I think  its unlikely NatWest would  
have agreed  to lend if it had completed proportionate checks. 
From what Ive seen, Im not persuaded NatWest completed proportionate checks  in order to assess 
whether Mrs Cs loans were  affordable and sustainable. And I think if it had completed proportionate 
checks its highly unlikely NatWest would have agreed to approve either  loan.
I cant  tell NatWest what checks it has to complete. Ive used statements  NatWest had available 
during Mrs Cs application as an example of the type of information  it could  have used.  Having done 
some basic checks on Mrs Cs income and outgoings,  I dont think  NatWest would have approved 
these loans if it had completed proportionate checks. As a result, I agree NatWest  lent irresponsibly 
on both occasions when it decided to proceed. 
For the reasons  Ive given above, I intend to uphold  Mrs Cs complaint and tell NatWest to refund all 
the interest and charges its applied to Loan 1 and Loan 2. NatWest can use the refund  to reduce the 
outstanding balance of both loans. I also intend to tell NatWest to stop charging interest on the 
remaining balances.  In addition,  NatWest should remove any adverse information its reported about  
the loans to the credit  reference agencies.  
Ive thought about the information the charity has supplied explaining how the loans have  affected Mrs 
C. Having done so, Im satisfied Mrs C has been suffered  a considerable amount  of distress and 
worry caused by NatWests decisions to approve her loans so I also intend to award £250 to reflect  
that.

Mrs C and NatWest have  until 13 September 2019 to send me any additional  information or 
comments they would like me to consider  before I make my final decision.
