K820x#14complaint
Mr T complains that he held a joint business  account with his partner  and National 
Westminster Bank Plc allowed his partner to remove him from the account.  
background
Mr T says he opened a business  account with his business partner in 1995.  In early 2017, 
he was taken seriously ill and took time off work.  Although  not actively  involved in the 
business, Mr T wanted to retain his shareholding and in December 2017, he requested bank 
statements. At this point he found out he was removed from the account  by his business  
partner.
Mr T complained to NatWest about his removal from the business account; saying it was 
done fraudulently  and NatWest had facilitated  this. NatWest apologised but explained  they 
received the correct mandates  for Mr Ts removal  from the business account and it was 
correctly processed.
Mr T referred his complaint to our service.  One of our investigators said that Mr Ts business 
account signature instructions were set to one to sign. This meant  his agreement wasnt 
required to remove his name from the account. He didnt find that NatWest  made a mistake.
Mr T said he didnt  change  the account signing rules  and he understood the instruction was 
two to sign but couldnt provide any evidence of this. Our investigator confirmed that 
NatWest didnt have  the original account opening information as it was opened so long ago. 
Mr T recalled countersigning for cheques until he received a debit card. Mr T asked for some  
evidence of copies  of cheques between 1995  2009. NatWest werent able to provide this 
information.
Mr T asked  for the complaint to be passed  to an ombudsman for review. He emphasised  that 
he didnt think that NatWest had made a mistake, rather his business  partner had committed  
fraud. As a result hes experienced financial difficulties. Mr T expected NatWest to provide 
evidence to show the account  was two to sign when it was opened. NatWest werent able to 
provide any further  evidence  but did confirm that if Mr T held a debit card,  the account would 
have been set as one to sign,  not two to sign. This is because NatWest  could  not allow debit 
cards for accounts set up as two to sign.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with what our 
investigator has said for much of the same  reasons.
NatWest werent able to provide details of the original account  application  and the signatory 
instructions at the time.  This is because of the length of time that has passed. There  isnt a 
requirement for NatWest  to keep information  for long periods of time and I dont think its 
unreasonable that it hasnt kept records from 1995  as this is over 20 years  ago.
While NatWest werent able to provide any further evidence around the account opening, 
Ive not seen any evidence that would suggest the account was set as two to sign.  The fact 
Mr T had a debit card shows the account  was set as one to sign and NatWest  also has 
confirmed the most  recent instruction has the account set up in this way. 
Ref: DRN80062542I completely appreciate Mr Ts position  here and that his concerns are largely with his 
business partner.  I also appreciate that taking this matter  to the courts  may be costly. But 
I have to consider  whether or not NatWest  have made a mistake and Im not persuaded they 
have. Ive looked at the instructions NatWest received for Mr Ts removal and I think  his 
removal from the account was done in accordance with the terms and conditions  required. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 March  2019.
