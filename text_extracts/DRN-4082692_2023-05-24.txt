The complaint
Mr C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and closed his bank accounts.
What happened
Mr C had three bank accounts with NatWest.  In January 2023, NatWest blocked the 
accounts. It removed the block two weeks later. Then in February 2023 NatWest wrote to Mr 
C and said that it had decided to cease its banking relationship with him. It said Mr C needed 
to make other banking arrangements outside the banking group  and that his accounts 
would be closed two months later.
Dissatisfied, Mr C complained to NatWest, and referred the complaint to us.
An investigator looked at the complaint, and wasnt satisfied NatWest had treated Mr C fairly. 
The investigator recommended that NatWest pay Mr C £150 to compensate him for the 
trouble and upset it caused. The investigator also said NatWest should also pay Mr C simple 
interest on the balance of his account for the period it was blocked.
NatWest agreed with the investigators recommendation. Mr C didnt agree  he thinks he 
should get more, and wants to know more about why NatWest acted as it did.
As the investigator couldnt resolve things informally, the complaint has been referred to me 
to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest, like all financial businesses, is subject to legal and regulatory requirements. These 
means it needs to monitor its customers accounts and may need to carry out a review at 
any time. While it does this, it may need to block access to the account.
This is reflected in the terms and conditions that applied to Mr Cs accounts which allow 
NatWest to restrict or suspend use of the account in certain circumstances. The terms and 
conditions that applied to Mr Cs account also allowed NatWest to close the account by 
giving 60 days notice.
I note Mr C wants NatWest to give him reasons for what happened. But where NatWest 
restricts or closes accounts, it doesnt need to give him reasons, and nor would it be 
appropriate for me to tell NatWest to share those reasons with Mr C.
With all this in mind, the main question I need to decide is whether NatWest treated Mr C 
fairly when it blocked and then closed Mr Cs account..
But although the investigator asked NatWest for further information about this, NatWest 
hasnt provided this information. Ive thought about what NatWest has said about this. Im 
satisfied that our rules give us the power to request this information. I dont accept that the 
reasons NatWest has given prevent it complying with our rules. Ive therefore reached this 
decision on the basis of what has been supplied taking account of the failure of NatWest to 
provide information requested.
Ive first thought about NatWests decision to restrict the account. Given the limited 
information available, Im not satisfied that NatWest acted fairly in doing so.
Ive also considered NatWests decision to close the account. The terms and conditions 
allow NatWest to do this if it gives Mr C 60 days notice  which NatWest has done. But 
NatWest hasnt shared its reasons for doing this, and so I cant safely conclude that NatWest 
had a rational basis for its actions or that that it treated Mr C fairly in doing this.
It follows that I uphold this complaint.
Ive thought about what NatWest needs to do to put things right. Mr C was denied access to 
the funds in his account. I can also see that losing access to the account caused 
inconvenience to Mr C. He didnt have access to his salary to pay for bills and essential 
everyday spending. He also says he had to borrow money from his family, which caused 
embarrassment. I have every sympathy for Mr C and dont doubt hes had a difficult time. 
Equally, it appears he was able to open a basic account with another business, which would 
have mitigated the impact NatWests actions had on him. Thinking about all of this, I think 
the £150 recommended by the investigator is fair.
Mr C didnt agree with this. He felt that the amount was an insult given NatWest wouldnt 
share its reasons with us. But where I award compensation, this isnt to punish the business 
but to reflect the impact its actions had on Mr C. Im not persuaded to award more. And for 
the reasons Ive already explained, NatWest doesnt need to share its reasons with Mr C. As 
such, Im satisfied that the compensation the investigator recommended is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of Mr Cs complaint.
Putting things right
NatWest should pay simple interest (the rate is 8% a year)  on the balance on his accounts 
from 26 January 2023 until 7 February 2023.
If HMRC requires NatWest to deduct income tax from that interest it should send Mr C a 
certificate setting this out should he want one.
I also award £150 to reflect the trouble and upset NatWests actions caused.My final decision
I uphold the complaint. National Westminster Bank plc should put things right by doing what 
Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 June 2023.
