K821x#15complaint
Ms B says CashEuroNet  UK LLC (CEN), trading as Pounds to Pocket and QuickQuid, lent 
to her irresponsibly.
background
CEN approved 8 loans for Ms B between December 2010 and November 2017. Ive included  
some of the information  CEN provided about  the loans in the appendix to this decision.
An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld  in part. She didnt 
think CEN shouldve  approved  loan 3 or any of the subsequent loans. This was because  in 
her opinion the pattern of borrowing alone suggested that further  lending  would likely be 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful for Ms B.
CEN didnt  agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed  to me to decide. Ill only 
be looking  at the loans still in dispute in my decision;  thats  loans 3-8a.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Ms Bs case.
Ive decided to uphold Ms Bs complaint about loans 3-8a and have explained why below.
CEN needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms B could 
repay her loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Ms Bs income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN93464642Bearing all of this in mind   and taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans 
provided  Ive considered whether the overall pattern of lending increased Ms Bs 
indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
Ive not considered whether CEN carried out proportionate checks  for loans 1 and 2 as those 
loans are no longer  in dispute. And I havent  recreated individual,  proportionate affordability 
checks for loans 3 to 8a because I dont think that it is necessary to do so  for the reasons 
below.
As explained above, Ive looked at the overall  pattern of lending  in Ms Bs case. Ive looked 
to see if there was a point  at which CEN  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so CEN should have realised that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Ms Bs case, I think  
that this point was reached by loan 3. I say this because:
the amounts  Ms B was borrowing were generally increasing, and CEN ought to have 
realised it was likely her indebtedness was increasing unsustainably
loan 2 followed loan 1 by just a few days and loan 3 was taken out on the same day 
loan 2 was repaid.  So it appears  Ms B was struggling to settle her debts  sustainably
Ms B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed CEN. And was in 
effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended  period
In total, Ms B borrowed  from CEN  without  a real break for about seven years.  The largest 
gap between the loans approved after loan 2 were  only a matter of days. The amounts Ms B 
borrowed increased for almost every  loan, suggesting repaying the preceding  loan was 
leaving her with a gap in her finances. Loan 5 was approved while  loan 4 was still running 
and after it had been topped-up (or refinanced) twice. Frequently  asking  for top-ups is also a 
sign of potential financial difficulty; as is frequently extending the length  of the loan 
agreement. All these  factors  are present in Ms Bs case.
I think that Ms B lost out because CEN  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 3 onwards  
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Bs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time. As I said above, CEN lent 
to Ms B without a break for seven years  ( it wouldve  been eight years had the last 
loan ran to term)  during which time she paid over £10,000 in interest
the sheer number  of loans (loans  and deferrals/extensions) was likely to have had 
negative implications on Ms Bs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  Ms Bs complaint about  loans 3 to 8a because the overall pattern of lending 
increased her indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  and she 
lost out as a result.
I should add Ive considered the points CEN  made in response to the adjudicator. CEN says 
it carried out proportionate checks for all loans.  And that Ms B repaid some loans early, 
which she wouldnt have done if in financial difficulty. It also said that the regulators rulebook 
(known as CONC) contains provisions for responsible lending and that it isnt possible to say 
whether the lending was irresponsible without looking at the individual affordability of each 
loan.
Ref: DRN93464643Ill explain  why these  points havent  changed  my decision.
I think CEN will (or ought to) know from previous decisions that this service considers there 
will be times when the pattern of lending alone is enough to indicate  that a consumer is likely 
be in financial difficulty  or would otherwise be harmed should  relending  continue. So it 
follows that successful repayment of a loan doesnt automatically mean it was repaid 
sustainably  particularly  where the consumer borrows  again without little break between the 
loans.
Its worth  pointing  out that the version  of CONC to which CEN is referring wasnt  in force  until 
1 April 2014  so not until CEN approved loan 6. CONC isnt relevant to the whole history  of 
lending and isnt relevant  at the time Ive identified CEN ought to have stopped  lending  to 
Ms B. I have taken  CONC into account  when it is relevant.
At the time loan 3 was approved, relevant guidance included  the Office  of Fair Tradings 
Irresponsible Lending Guidance (ILG). The ILG stated at paragraph 6.25 that deceptive  
and/or unfair practices included, Repeatedly refinancing (or rolling over) a borrowers 
existing credit commitment for a short-term  credit product in a way that is unsustainable 
or otherwise harmful and that this  would include a creditor allowing a borrower  to 
sequentially enter into a number of separate  agreements for short-term loan products,  
one after another, where the overall  effect is to increase the borrowers indebtedness in 
an unsustainable manner.
I appreciate that all bar one of Ms Bs loan were instalment  loans. But given the pattern of 
borrowing clearly reflects the situation quoted above, I think  this paragraph of the ILG is still 
relevant. I note that when CONC did become relevant, it referred back  to this particular 
paragraph (see CONC  6.7.21-22G). I also note that the regulator, in a recent  open  letter,  
noted there were  two key ways in which consumers in the high-cost short-term credit  
market could be harmed   the first of which was a high volume of relending, which  may be 
symptomatic of unsustainable lending patterns.1
So I think the relevant  rules, regulations  and guidance at the time the loans were  approved  
mean it is perfectly fair for me to consider whether the pattern of lending in itself ought to 
have alerted CEN to the likelihood  further  lending wouldnt be sustainable for Ms B. And for 
the reasons Ive explained above, I think this point arose in Ms Bs case when  she applied 
for loan 3. Im therefore upholding her complaint about loan 3 and all subsequent  loans.

Ref: DRN93464644putting things right
CEN should:
refund  the interest and charges Ms B paid on loans 3-7a
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Ms B paid them  until the 
date of settlement
remove all information about loans 3-8a from Ms Bs credit history
For loan 8/8a CEN has provided  information showing Ms B has already repaid more than the 
£2,150 she borrowed. So CEN should  refund any amount Ms B paid above £2,150 and add 
8% simple  interest to that refund as above.
HM Revenue & Customs requires CEN  to take off tax from this interest. CEN must give Ms B a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Ms Bs complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things  right by taking the steps  
set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 May 2019.

Notes and loan table.
All loans except loan 5 are instalment loans with Pounds to Pocket, repayable in roughly equal 
monthly payments. Loan 5 is a QuickQuid payday loan with a balloon payment  repayable  in 3 
months. The first two payments for loan 5 were interest only and the third interest and capital. 
Some of the loans were  topped-up or refinanced. These are denoted  below with a letter  
following the loan number. A top-up is where extra funds are borrowed  without significantly 
altering the term of the loan. Refinancing  refers to where extra funds were borrowed and the term 
of the loan changed or was reset  when the extra funds  were approved. For example, loan 7 was 
originally scheduled to end in November  2016. When Ms B borrowed  an extra £1,050  in 
September 2016 the loan was rolled into a new loan due to end in August 2017.
Ive set out a summary  of the loans in the table below.  Some amounts have been rounded to the 
nearest whole pound.
