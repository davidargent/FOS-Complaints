The complaint
Ms B complains that U K Insurance Limited trading as Green Flag mishandled her 
breakdown insurance policy.
Where I refer to Green Flag, I include employees and others insofar as I hold Green Flag  
responsible for their acts or omissions. 
What happened
For the year from July 2019, Ms B had a Green Flag breakdown policy. 
In July 2020, Green Flag wrote to her to say that it would automatically renew the policy and 
that it would collect £88.48 from the card it had on file. On about 3 August 2020, Green Flag 
collected £88.48 from a card with a number ending in 7602. 
About a year later, in July 2021, Green Flag wrote to Ms B to say that it would automatically 
renew the policy. On about 27 July 2021, Green Flag collected £89.60 from a card ending in 
7404.
On 8 October 2021, the bank sent Green Flag a chargeback notification for £89.60. So 
Green Flag refunded £89.60 to the bank. Ms B paid that amount to Green Flag on about 15 
October 2021 on a card ending in 5358.
On about 7 December 2021, the bank sent Green Flag a chargeback notification for £88.48. 
So Green Flag refunded £88.48 to the bank. 
In early January 2022, Green Flag asked Ms B to pay the balance of £88.48. Ms B 
complained to Green Flag and to the bank. 
In  a final response dated 17 January 2022, the bank said the following:
Our fraud monitoring tools identified that your debit card details ending in 7206 may 
have become compromised so we issued you a new card on 7 July 2021 to protect 
your account and cancelled the old card on 17 July 2021.
I can confirm that no payment debited your account in 2020 for Green Flag, we are 
unable to reject a payment 16 months later. Once a payment has been remitted, the 
only way we would get a card payment back is though the unauthorised transaction 
process- for example through a chargeback.
The only payment for Green Flag in 2021 was the payment you made on 15 October 
2021 on card ending in 5358.
Please note that your account has never had a debit card ending in 7602 or 7404. I 
would recommend speaking to Green Flag about this to ensure your details have not 
been mixed up. I am unable to confirm whose card details they are.
In a final response dated 21 January 2021 , Green Flag said the following:
a refund was requested through the bank on the premium of £88.48 from policy 
year 2020- 2021. As a result, this premium is now outstanding because the service 
has been used but payment has not been made
Unhappy with that response, Ms B brought her complaint about Green Flag to us without 
delay.
Our investigator didnt initially recommend that the complaint should be upheld.
In late April 2022, UKI offered to waive the £88.48 outstanding balance for the policy year 
2020 2021. Our investigator recommended that UKIs offer was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances.
Ms B disagreed with the investigators opinion. She asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. She says, in summary, that: 
For the whole of that year 2020 to 2021, she was not actually covered.
Green Flag expected her to pay for something she never received, threatening her 
with constant letters. 
When you are offered auto renewal all you check is the card is correct. 
There was never anything to write off as she was not covered.
Green Flag tried to get the money from some other customers card.
She wants compensation. She wants a full free year with Green Flag from 20 July 
2022 to 20 July 2023. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Green Flag received payment in August 2020 of £88.48 for the policy year from July 2020. 
From what the bank has said, Green Flag received that payment from a card that wasnt Ms 
Bs. I havent seen enough evidence to say why.
The issue with that card payment didnt come to light until well after the next renewal in July 
2021. The chargeback didnt happen until December 2021. So theres no reason to think that 
Ms B didnt have the benefit of the policy for the year from July 2020. I consider that Green 
Flag wouldve responded if her car had suffered a breakdown during that policy year. So I 
dont accept Ms Bs view that she wasnt covered for that year.
The bank has said that Ms B didnt make any payment to Green Flag for the year from July 
2020. And  after the card payment was reversed in December 2021- no one had made any 
payment to Green Flag for her policy that year. So I dont find that Green Flag treated Ms B 
unfairly by asking her to make payment of £88.48. 
Nevertheless, Green Flag has offered to waive that payment. I consider that the effect of that 
is to give Ms B a free year of cover for the year from July 2020. Putting things right
I accept that Ms B has been upset by what has happened. But overall I dont find it fair and 
reasonable to direct Green Flag to pay compensation or to do any more than to waive the 
payment of £88.48. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I  
direct U K Insurance Limited trading as Green Flag to waive the payment of £88.48 for the 
policy year from July 2020. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 July 2022.
