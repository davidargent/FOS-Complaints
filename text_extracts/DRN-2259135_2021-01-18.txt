The complaint
Mr B complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire agreement with Lex 
Autolease Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mr B under a hire agreement with Lex Autolease that he 
signed in November 2018  the hire agreement was for two years and Mr B agreed 
to pay an initial rental of £2,479.36 and then 23 monthly rentals of £275.48;
Lex Autolease, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory quality will 
depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the car and the 
price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr B was a new car and I consider that it was 
reasonable for him to expect that it would be free from even minor defects;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors; 
Mr B had some issues with the car so he complained to Lex Autolease and it 
arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert in December 2019;
the experts report recorded the cars mileage as being 13,387 and concluded that 
there was an intermittent fault with the car as there was a delay on it taking up drive 
when pulling away so it wasnt of satisfactory quality;
Lex Autolease offered to pay Mr B £100 for the inconvenience caused but he 
complained to this service and Lex Autolease then said that it would accept Mr Bs 
rejection of the car and it would pay him £200 for the inconvenience hed been 
caused, refund two monthly rentals for the time that he wasnt able to use the car; 
and pay him £500 for the impact of the issues on his enjoyment of the car  but it 
said that any excess mileage and damages charges would still apply and that the 
payments would be applied to the debt that Mr B owes to it;
our investigator said that Lex Autoleases offer was a fair and reasonable outcome to 
Mr Bs complaint but Mr B doesnt think that its fair that he needs to pay the 
outstanding balance because the cars faulty, hes only been using it because he had 
no choice to get another car and he says that he asked Lex Autolease to take the car 
back a long time ago  he also questions the amount of the outstanding balance on 
his account;
Lex Autolease has accepted that the cars faulty and that Mr B can reject it  I 
consider that to be fair and reasonable  but I also consider it to be fair and 
reasonable for Mr B to pay for the use that hes had from the car;
the annual mileage allowance in the agreement was 5,000 but when the car was 
inspected in December 2019, just over a year after it was supplied to Mr B, its 
mileage was 13,387 so Mr B had significantly exceeded the annual mileage limit and 
I understand that hes continued to use the car  so I consider that its fair and 
reasonable for Lex Autolease to apply the excess mileage charges set out in the 
agreement and to charge Mr B for any damage on the car thats more than fair wear 
and tear;
Lex Autolease has provided information about the arrears on Mr Bs account and in 
June 2020 it said that £281.10 was outstanding from the first rental, ten other 
monthly rentals hadnt been paid and seven invoices relating to fines were 
outstanding  since then I understand that Mr B has made no further rental payments 
for the car but has continued to use and it and that his use of the car has incurred 
further fines which have been charged to his account - so I consider that its fair and 
reasonable for Lex Autolease to use the payments to be made to Mr B to reduce the 
outstanding balance of his account;
those payments are £200 for the inconvenience that hes been caused, a refund of 
two monthly rentals for the time that he wasnt able to use the car; and £500 for the 
impact of the issues on his enjoyment of the car  and I consider those payments to 
be fair and reasonable in these circumstances; and
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Lex Autolease 
to pay a higher amount of compensation to Mr B than its already offered to him, to 
reduce or waive the outstanding balance of his account or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Lex Autolease to allow 
Mr B to reject the car and to pay him the amounts that it has offered to him, as described 
above. Those payments should be used to reduce the outstanding balance of Mr Bs 
account, with only any excess over the outstanding balance being actually paid to Mr B. I 
consider that its fair and reasonable for Mr B to remain liable for any outstanding balance of 
his account.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint in part and I order Lex Autolease Limited to:
1. End the hire agreement and arrange for the car to be collected from Mr B  both at 
no cost to him other than any excess mileage charges or charges for damage that is 
more than fair wear and tear.
2. Refund to Mr B two monthly rentals under the agreement.
3. Pay £500 to Mr B to compensate him for the impact of the issues with the car on his 
enjoyment of it.4. Pay £200 to Mr B to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes 
been caused.
The payments at 2, 3 and 4 above should be used to reduce the outstanding balance of 
Mr Bs account, with only any excess over the outstanding balance being actually paid to 
him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 February 2021.
