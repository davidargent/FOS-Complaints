K820x#14complaint
Mrs M has complained that AvantCredit  of UK LLC lent to her irresponsibly.
background
I issued a provisional decision about this complaint  in November 2020 that I summarise 
below.
Mrs M was given  a loan of £2,945 by AvantCredit  in May 2017. The loan was due to be
repaid in 36 monthly instalments of about  £144.  If the loan ran to term, the total amount
repayable including interest  was just over £5,200. I understand  the loan remains
outstanding.
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, in particular the checks  that 
AvantCredit needed to do such as the amount being lent, and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, I thought less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate in the early stages of the lending relationship.
I said that AvantCredit needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didn't lend to Mrs M
irresponsibly. And that AvantCredit had to carry out proportionate checks  to satisfy itself that 
she could repay the loan in a sustainable  way. There was no set list of checks that 
AvantCredit had to do, but it could take into account  a number of different things such  as the 
loan amount, the length of the loan term, the repayment amounts, and the borrowers  overall
financial circumstances.
I carefully considered  all the evidence, arguments and information Id seen about  this
matter and what it means for Mrs M.
AvantCredit asked  Mrs M for information about  her income and expenditure and it acquired a
credit report.  AvantCredit says the checks it carried out before it agreed to lend to Mrs M
were reasonable and proportionate, and that the loan was affordable for her.
AvantCredit provided a summary of the information  it had gathered in its checks. But its 
Affordability Report indicated that Mrs M had acquired a number of new creditors and 
increased levels of debt in the previous few months.  Mrs M was applying to AvantCredit for a 
costly loan, repayable  over an extended  period. I thought in the circumstances, AvantCredit 
ought reasonably  to have realised that for its checks for this particular customer to be 
reasonable and proportionate, it needed a better  understanding  of her current  financial 
situation - to ensure that she could  sustainably repay her loan over the whole loan term.
I thought AvantCredit should have gone  further on this occasion and carried  out more  in-
depth checks to establish Mrs Ms true financial position  for example by asking to see her
bank statements.
But even though I thought  that AvantCredit  shouldve carried  out better checks  before it lent 
to Mrs M, from the evidence Id seen,  it wasnt clear to me whether better  checks by
lender would have shown  that Mrs M might have  difficulty  repaying her loan sustainably.  
Mrs M told us that she was struggling financially and taking payday loans. We asked if she 
could provide her bank  statements from around  the time she applied for her loan, so I could 
determine what better checks might have  shown AvantCredit at the time.  But Mrs M hasnt 
Ref: DRN81786332been able to do so. This is entirely  understandable, given that some time has passed since  
she applied  for the loan.   But without  additional information, I couldnt fairly  say that better  
checks ought reasonably to have led AvantCredit  to conclude that it shouldnt lend to Mrs M. 
And on the basis of the limited evidence available, I couldnt fairly say that AvantCredit  lent 
to Mrs M irresponsibly.
Mrs M also complained about a top up that she took with AvantCredit at a later date.
AvantCredit says that Mrs M didnt  take a top up associated with this loan and that any
further lending  would  have been treated  as a new loan. Mrs M hasnt provided any further
information about what she thinks was a top up loan with AvantCredit,  so I am not currently
able to make  any findings  about this.
Overall, Id not seen  anything which  makes  me think that AvantCredit treated Mrs M unfairly
in any other  way. And Id not seen  enough  evidence for me to say that I think its likely that,
if AvantCredit had carried out better checks when Mrs M applied for the loan, it ought
reasonably to have  come  to the conclusion  that it was inappropriate to lend to her.
So, I said I wasnt intending  to uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
I invited both parties to send me any further comments or evidence. 
I havent seen  any response from AvantCredit. Mrs M has told us she is disheartened  by my 
provisional decision. In summary, she thinks her credit report  shows  that she was already in 
debt and she was just trying to find way out. Mrs M also thinks  that AvantCredit would have 
been aware that her credit score  was very poor which  should  have highlighted that it was 
highly risky to lend to her.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to thank both parties for all the information  that has been provided about  this matter 
and Mrs M for responding to my provisional decision. I have taken these further comments  
and all the other information that Ive seen  into account  when coming to my final decision.
Ive carefully considered  Mrs Ms additional comments, but they havent changed my view of 
her complaint.
I appreciate that Mrs M was already in debt when she applied for the loan with AvantCredit.  
From what  Ive seen, I think AvantCredit  should  have done  more to check  her true financial 
position to ensure that she would be able to repay  her loan sustainably. But as Ive 
explained, without  additional information, I cant fairly say what AvantCredit  is likely to have 
discovered about Mrs Ms financial position, if it had carried out more  in-depth checks. So, I 
cant say that better checks ought reasonably to have led AvantCredit  to conclude that it 
shouldnt lend to Mrs M.  I cannot  fairly uphold Mrs Ms complaint based  on the limited 
information that Ive seen  about her circumstances  at the time. 
Ref: DRN81786333I understand that Mrs M feels strongly  about  her complaint and I am sorry that she is 
disappointed with my decision. Id like to reassure Mrs M that I have carefully  considered 
everything that both she and AvantCredit  have told us and all the information that has been 
provided. But having done so, I confirm the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. 
Taking everything into account,  I cant fairly  say that AvantCredit ought reasonably to have 
concluded that it was inappropriate to lend to Mrs M. Nor do I think that AvantCredit has 
acted unfairly or unreasonably towards  her in some  other way. So, I do not uphold  Mrs Ms 
complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I dont uphold the complaint or make  any award against 
AvantCredit of UK LLC.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2021.
