The complaint
Mr S complains that TSB Bank plc incorrectly took a minimum payment for his credit card 
account, instead of the full payment he instructed the bank to take.  
What happened
Mr S has a TSB credit card. He routinely makes payment in full each month by telephone. 
Mr Ss statement dated 3 June 2021 showed a balance of £203.16. He was to make a 
minimum payment of £5.00 by 28 June 2021. The estimated interest for the following month 
was £4.74.
The following months statement showed a balance of £460.70 and that Mr S had paid £5.00 
on 25 June 2021. Interest of £7.20 was included in the balance. Mr S says, and TSB 
accepts, that the payment of £5.00 was taken in error. TSB should have taken a payment of 
£203.16  the amount shown on the statement of 3 June 2021. 
When Mr S noticed the error, he contacted TSB. His statement dated 3 August 2021 shows 
that he then made a payment of £502.71 and that his account was credited with £7.20 
interest. The payment of £502.71 was the outstanding balance on the date of payment, 
made up of £460.70 from the previous statement and some later transactions. 
TSB said that the interest refund meant that Mr S had not lost out because of its error. It 
acknowledged however that its actions had put Mr S to some inconvenience and caused 
some distress, so it offered £50 by way of compensation. It later increased that to £100. Mr 
S did not consider that was sufficient or that TSB had fully rectified the problem and he 
referred the matter to this service. 
One of our investigators considered what had happened but thought that TSB had put things 
right and that its offer of £100 was sufficient in the circumstances. Mr S did not agree and 
asked that an ombudsman review the case.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
TSB accepted almost immediately that it had made an error and it offered to correct that 
error. It did so by accepting Mr Ss payment to clear the balance on the account and by 
crediting the account with the interest that would not have been charged if no error had been 
made. 
I am satisfied that, by refunding the interest of £7.20, TSB has put Mr S in the financial 
position in which he would have been had no error been made. I note that no further interest 
was added to the account as a result of only a minimum payment being made in June 2021. 
I must therefore consider whether the offer of £100 in additional compensation is sufficient. 
In my view it is. It is broadly in line with our published guidelines and with awards made in 
similar circumstances. In saying that, I note that TSB was quick both to acknowledge its 
mistake and to correct it.  
Putting things right
TSB has already made a fair offer to resolve Mr Ss complaint. I will however make a formal 
award, so that Mr S can enforce it, should he need to do so.   
My final decision
My final decision is that, to resolve Mr Ss complaint in full, TSB Bank plc should pay him 
£100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 July 2022.
