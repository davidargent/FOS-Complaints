The complaint
Mr F complains that Elderbridge Limited (Elderbridge) would not agree to a payment 
deferral, and he wants to understand the interest and charges on his loan. 
What happened
Mr F took out a secured loan of £70,000 in September 2006. It is secured on his property 
and was originally provided by a lender which was eventually acquired by Elderbridge. The 
amount originally lent was £83,951 but that included a Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) 
premium of £13,951  which was cancelled and refunded almost immediately, reducing the 
balance of the loan to £70,000. Interest was 7.7% APR but this was variable  and in April 
2020 it was 7.082%. The monthly repayment was £596.34.
Over the years, many payments were missed and by November 2020, the balance owed 
was £29,396, with arrears of £29,203. Interest was stopped with effect from March 2008, 
although Elderbridge noted there was unpaid interest of £60,288. Various payment 
arrangements were agreed over the years. In September 2020, it was agreed that Mr F 
would pay £600 a month for three months. In March 2020 and November 2020  Mr F called 
Elderbridge to ask for a payment deferral under the COVID-19 support scheme  
Elderbridge declined to agree to this because of the arrears. Instead, in November 2020, 
Elderbridge agreed a short-term arrangement of one payment of £100, followed by another 
payment of £400. After that, payments were to return to £596.34 a month. He was to call 
Elderbridge after that to discuss the way forward.
Mr F complained that he asked for a payment deferral as hed not been working due to 
COVID-19. He was a self-employed taxi driver, and his work had dried up due to the 
pandemic. Elderbridge had turned him down. He said he offered to pay £522, but they asked 
for £600 per month  which he couldnt afford. He also couldnt understand how the interest 
was so high and asked that his account be checked.
Elderbridge said there was a history of arrears on Mr Fs account. Interest was suspended in 
March 2008 and so any payments hed made since then meant the capital was reduced 
more quickly than if interest was being charged. They said that once Mr F repaid the capital 
amount, the interest would also become payable. The amount owing, including interest on 
Mr Fs loan was correct and reflected the number of missed payments. 
Mr F brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said she thought that Elderbridge acted 
unreasonably and they shouldve agreed a payment deferral under the arrangements 
brought in to support customers who were affected by the pandemic. She considered that 
the interest on the loan looked reasonable. She said Elderbridge should re-work Mr Fs loan 
as if he was given a payment deferral for six months from March 2020 to May 2020 and then 
from November 2020 to January 2021. And she said his credit file should be changed to 
show that. She said Elderbridge should pay Mr F £150 compensation for distress and 
inconvenience.
Elderbridge didnt agree. They said the COVID-19 scheme guidance stated that a payment 
deferral wasnt appropriate where there were arrears before the scheme came into effect - in 
March 2020. They asked that an ombudsman look at Mr Fs complaint.
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Looking at Mr Fs request for a payment deferral. In March 2020, The Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) announced guidance to lenders in response to the effects on customers of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. All lenders, including Elderbridge, had to put in place payment 
holidays on many credit agreements, including secured loans  to help customers who were 
affected. Customers could ask for a total of two payment holidays, each of three months  
whereby payments could be suspended. Missed payments would not be reported to credit 
reference agencies, although interest would still be debited to the accounts. This support 
was provided by firms up to the end of October 2020. 
In September 2020, the FCA announced that the support scheme would change from the 
end of October 2020. From then, firms could continue to support customers in difficulty  but 
it was down to their discretion and customers circumstances. And  reporting to credit 
reference agencies was reintroduced for people that had already had the maximum six 
months of payment deferrals.
Elderbridge said that Mr F didnt qualify for a payment deferral as he was already in arrears. 
But I dont agree with that. The FCAs guidance said that where a customer was 
experiencing payment difficulties because of the pandemic, then a payment deferral should 
be granted. And in Mr Fs case  he was a taxi driver and his worked had been badly 
affected. And so  Mr F qualified for a payment deferral.
The FCAs guidance also said that if a customer is already in a payment shortfall, they 
shouldnt be treated any less favourably than other customers. So  - even though Mr F was 
in arrears, he still qualified for a payment deferral.
Therefore, Mr F shouldve been given a payment deferral for three months in March 2020 
and again on November 2020. And I agree with our investigator that this should be put right 
 so that Mr F should be put in the position he wouldve been in had the payment deferral 
been agreed.
But  aside from considering the COVID-19 scheme, its clear to me that Mr F is in 
considerable financial difficulty. Elderbridge had obligations to help him. So, Ive then gone 
on to consider this. 
Businesses have an obligation to treat customers in financial difficulty sympathetically and 
the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says that businesses like Elderbridge should treat 
customers in difficulties with forbearance and due consideration. For example, a business 
might suspend or waive interest, accept lower payments, or defer them, and allow customers 
more time to repay their debt. And so  Ive looked at Mr Fs complaint to see if Elderbridge 
treated him reasonably, in line with this.
I can see that over the years, Mr F has struggled to make the payments to his loan. For 
example, there werent any payments made between September 2009 and April 2012, and 
then again from April 2014 to December 2016. And by August 2020, Mr F was still in 
substantial arrears. So, Ive looked to see what support Elderbridge gave him.I can see from Elderbridges records that they spoke to Mr F on many occasions  to try to 
establish a realistic payment programme with him. Each time, I could see that they tried to 
work out his income and expenditure  to see how much he could afford to pay. These 
conversations took place in December 2018, March 2019, April 2019, October 2019, 
December 2019, March 2020, May 2020, June 2020, July 2020, August 2020, and 
September 2020. I can see that reduced payments of £600 per month were agreed in 
September 2020 for three months. Ive listened to the call in November 2020. In it  
Elderbridges call handler goes though Mr Fs income and expenditure and established that 
he could afford to pay them just over £500 a month. Mr F said he couldnt afford that, so they 
settled on one payment of £100 and then another of £400  so they were trying to help. This 
was then confirmed to Mr F in a letter dated 30 November 2020. 
And  I can see that Elderbridge havent charged any interest since March 2008. But theyve 
been setting it to one side  theyve said that they will charge it if Mr F does repay the 
outstanding capital balance. But  Elderbridge have tried to help by stopping interest. This 
has led to the capital amount of the loan reducing more than it would have if interest been 
charged. Im therefore satisfied that Elderbridge have done what they could to help Mr F. 
Ive looked at the interest on Mr Fs loan. We do not provide an audit service and therefore I 
cant state that the interest thats been set aside is accurate. But we asked Elderbridge to 
show us the calculations of interest  they look reasonable, and we cant see anything that is 
obviously incorrect. 
Mr F told us that hes intending to sell his house shortly. We asked Elderbridge what Mr Fs 
current situation with them is. Hes paid £200 each month between January 2021 and 
August 2021, and then £300 each month between September 2021 and December 2021. 
The balance shown on his statement up to 25 January 2022 is £26,096.86, plus interest of 
£60,756.71. But its a matter for Elderbridge to tell Mr F how much he owes  and he must 
therefore get a redemption figure from Elderbridge  as this might be different from the 
figures Ive quoted here. 
But having looked at his complaint, my decision is that Elderbridge should have agreed to 
his request for a payment deferral under the COVID-19 scheme. And therefore, they should 
change his credit file to delete the late payment markers for the months between March 
2020 to May 2020 and then from November 2020 to January 2021. Interest wasnt being 
charged to the loan account but was being noted  so in line with the payment deferral 
scheme, this can continue to be the case for the periods of the payment deferral.  So  Mr F 
will eventually be liable to pay it. And because Elderbridge made an error in declining a 
payment deferral, they should pay compensation of £150.
Looking at Mr Fs long-term financial difficulties  I consider that Elderbridge have tried to 
support Mr F over a long period of time and have fulfilled their obligations under the FCAs 
guidance.

My final decision
I uphold this complaint. Elderbridge Limited must:
Remove the late payment markers from Mr Fs credit file for the months between 
March 2020 and May 2020 inclusive; and between November 2020 and January 
2021 inclusive.Pay Mr F compensation of £150 for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2022.
