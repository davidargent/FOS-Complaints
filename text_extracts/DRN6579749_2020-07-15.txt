K822xcomplaint
Mr W complains that a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement  with 
Close Brothers Limited, trading as Close Brothers  Motor Finance, wasnt of satisfactory 
quality.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Close Brothers, as the supplier  of the car, was responsible  for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr W - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend  on a number of factors, including  the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr W was about  eleven years old, had been driven for 
119,000 miles and had a price  of £3,500; 
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within  
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly  how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car was supplied  to Mr W in December 2018 but he had issues  with it so he 
returned it to the dealer and he then complained  to Close  Brothers;
it arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert in March  2019 when 
its mileage was recorded as 123,526  and the inspection report  concluded that there  
were faults with the car that were present when the car was supplied to Mr W;
Mr W says that he was told that he would be able to reject the car so he left the car 
with the dealer and entered into a finance  agreement for another  car - but Close 
Brothers said that it would pay for the repairs and refund two monthly payments 
under the agreement  to Mr W  so he complained to this service;
the investigator recommended that Close Brothers should: end the agreement  and 
collect the car; refund the monthly payments for when Mr W hadnt  used  the car and 
his deposit (with interest); pay him £200  for the distress and inconvenience he was 
caused; and update  his credit file to show the finance had been settled;
Close Brothers said that, prior to acceptance of the investigators recommendations, 
it would  like to question whether Mr W should  be required to pay the storage costs for 
the car after it had been left with the dealer  but the investigator didnt believe that 
Mr W should be liable for those costs;
Ref: DRN65797492I consider it to be clear from the independent  report that there were faults with the car 
that were present  when it was supplied to Mr W  so it wasnt of satisfactory quality 
at that time - and that those faults  havent  been properly repaired;
I agree  with the investigators recommendation that Close Brothers  should  end the 
agreement, collect  the car and update Mr Ws credit file to show the agreement  as 
settled  but Ive seen  no evidence  to show that Mr W paid a deposit  for the car;
I consider that it would be fair and reasonable for Close Brothers to refund to Mr W 
the monthly payments that hes made for the car since  he stopped  using it and left it 
at the dealers (with interest)  but I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable 
for Mr W to be required to pay any storage  costs  for the car  thats  because  I 
consider that the car wasnt  of satisfactory  quality when it was supplied  to Mr W, the 
dealer hadnt properly  repaired  the faults when  it was given the opportunity  to do so 
and it was reasonable for Mr W to understand that he would be able to reject the car; 
and
these events will have caused  Mr W some distress and inconvenience  and I find that 
it would  be fair and reasonable for it to also pay him £200 to compensate  him for that 
distress and inconvenience. 
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Ws complaint and I order Close  Brothers 
Limited ,trading  as Close Brothers Motor Finance,  to:
1.End the conditional  sale agreement  and arrange  for the car to be collected   both at 
no cost to Mr W.
2.Refund to Mr W the monthly  payments that hes made under the agreement  since he 
left the car at the dealers.
3.Pay interest on those  amounts  at an annual rate of 8% simple  from the date of each  
payment to the date of settlement.
4.Update Mr Ws credit file to show the conditional  sale agreement  as settled.
5.Pay £200 to Mr W to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that hes 
been caused.
HM Revenue & Customs  requires Close Brothers to deduct tax from the interest  payment 
referred to above.  Close Brothers must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its 
deducted if he asks it for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 August 2020.
