K821x#15complaint
Mr G has complained about short-term loans granted to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid. Mr G says he couldnt  afford  these loans and that QuickQuid didnt 
take appropriate steps to check whether he could afford them when he took them out. 
background
QuickQuid agreed 13 short-term loans for Mr G between April 2015  and February 2018. 
Each loan was repayable over between one and two months.
Loans 9, 10, 11 and 13 were topped-up on a number of occasions. This is where Mr G took 
out further borrowing under the same  agreement,  before  paying  back  the initial  amount  
borrowed. Mr G also re-financed loan 10, this is where he borrowed further funds, extending  
the term of the original  agreement, agreeing a new repayment schedule.  Ive set out a 
summary of the lending  below.

One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Gs complaint already and recommended  the 
complaint be upheld in part. He felt the checks QuickQuid carried  out on loans  1 to 5 were 
proportionate, but that the checks carried out from loan 6 onwards werent. 
He thought that had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks on loans 6 to 13 (including 
the top-ups and refinances of those  loans), it wouldve likely concluded that these  loans 
wouldve been unaffordable for Mr G, and would  therefore not have agreed to them.  
QuickQuid disagreed with the findings. So as no agreements been reached at this stage, 
the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision. Mr G raised no new 
arguments in response  to the adjudicators assessment. So it would seem that loans 1  5 
Ref: DRN77044652no longer appear  in dispute. Therefore, my decision will focus on QuickQuids decision to 
lend from loan 6 onwards.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and   
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time.  
Our adjudicator, having looked  at everything, found  that QuickQuid didnt carry out 
proportionate checks from loan 6 onwards. And based on his review, he thought  that 
QuickQuid should  refund the interest  and charges Mr G paid from this point on, as 
proportionate checks wouldve  shown these loans to have been unaffordable for him. These  
findings were set out in some detail in a view letter  to the lender.
QuickQuid initially said that it did conduct  appropriate and proportionate affordability
assessments, including validation of Mr Gs income  and expenses  before funding all these  
loans. It said that when Mr G borrowed his loans, it had in place an affordability review that 
was consistent  with the FCA Handbook  and was in place at the time it received authorisation 
by the FCA. It says this confirms its assessment was conducted  properly and individually  for 
each of Mr Gs loan applications.
QuickQuid raised this argument and a similar argument in both its initial  submissions, and in 
response to the adjudicators assessment. But I can see that the adjudicator has since 
addressed this point.  He said:   I note what you've said about the loans Mr G borrowed from 
2015 onwards,  however our job is to look not only into the rules and regulations set by the 
regulator at the time of borrowing but also the law, good industry  practice and all the 
available evidence and arguments to help us decide whether we think what the business has 
done is right or not. In this case  I dont think you were right to provide Mr G with some of the 
loans he borrowed from 2015  onwards.
I fully agree with this point. This service has responded to QuickQuid on the above generic 
argument directly and through earlier final decisions.  So Im not going  to expand on this point 
any further here, though I have considered it alongside everything else in making my 
decision. 
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the FCA guidance in how complaints are to be 
dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] 
which says that businesses procedures for complaint handling should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
Ref: DRN77044653So my decision will focus on the specifics of Mr Gs complaint and what both parties have 
said about this.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr G 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Gs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Gs complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr G would be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr G would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Gs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
1. Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks to satisfy  
itself that Mr G would  be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr G would have been  able to do so?
Ref: DRN77044654As loans  1 - 5 are no longer in dispute, I havent  considered the proportionality of the checks  
QuickQuid carried out on these loans as part of my assessment. And Ive carried out my 
review from loan 6 onwards.
When Mr G took out loan 6, hed been borrowing from QuickQuid for over a year.  So by this 
point, I think QuickQuid shouldve been concerned about whether Mr G could afford to meet 
his repayments  on this loan sustainably, and as a result, shouldve built a full picture  of his 
financial circumstances, verifying  the information  it was given, before agreeing to lend any 
further.
Had it done so, it wouldve  seen that Mr G was regularly earning around £1,400 a month at 
the time he applied for loan 6. It wouldve also seen  that his monthly living  costs were  in the 
region of £420 a month; that he had regular credit  commitments totalling  £413 a month, and 
that he owed £483 to another short-term lender. This meant his total outgoings  were  over 
£1,300 a month. 
So had QuickQuid  carried out proportionate checks at the time Mr G applied  for loan 6, it 
wouldve seen that after deducting his monthly outgoings from his income, he was left with 
less than £100; which was insufficient  to meet the repayments on loan 6 sustainably.  So I 
dont think QuickQuid wouldve approved this loan,  knowing this.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 7 to 13b, because 
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why.
2. Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mr Gs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history  with Mr G, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid shouldve realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
From  loan 7, Mr G was provided  with a new loan within two weeks  of settling a 
previous one. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr G  
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole that repaying  his previous loan had left 
in his finances. And that Mr Gs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr G wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid. Loan  13 and 
the top-up  on this loan (loan  13b) were taken  out 15 months after Mr Gs second  
loan. And it was for a larger amount. Mr G had paid large amounts of interest  to, in 
effect, service a debt to QuickQuid  over an extended period.
I think that Mr G lost out because QuickQuid  continued to provide borrowing  from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN77044655the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Gs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im also upholding  Mr Gs complaint about loans  7 to 13b. 
what QuickQuid  needs to do to put things right
refund  the interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 7 to 13b;
pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple  a year from the date they were paid to the 
date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan 6 from Mr Gs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 13b should be removed from 
Mr Gs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Mr Gs complaint in part. 
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 June 2019.
