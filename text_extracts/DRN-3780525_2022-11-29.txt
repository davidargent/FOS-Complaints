The complaint
Miss C has complained that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) havent properly 
processed a payment to her relatives account.
What happened
Towards the end of 2021, Miss C received a payment of Â£411.94 into her PayPal account 
from her relative.  Shortly after receipt, Miss C returned the payment.  But her relative didnt 
receive it.  So Miss C complained to PayPal and requested them to make payment to her 
relatives account.
PayPals investigations showed the money had been received by Miss C and returned within 
30 minutes of receipt.  They suggested that Miss Cs relative contact their bank to find out 
what had happened.
Miss C wasnt satisfied with PayPals response and brought her complaint to us.  Our 
investigator reviewed it and concluded PayPal didnt need to do anything more to resolve 
matters.  She was satisfied that PayPal had completed the refund to Miss Cs relative.  She 
said that data protection legislation prevented PayPal pursuing this further with the relatives 
bank/card provider and Miss Cs relative would need to do that themselves.  
Miss C didnt agree with the investigators view.  So Ive been asked to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Im not upholding Miss Cs complaint.  Ill explain why.
I appreciate Miss C is concerned.  But I can only say PayPal should do more to resolve her 
complaint if Im satisfied they made a mistake in the way they dealt with her account.
Having reviewed the evidence, I dont think thats the case here.  PayPal have provided 
notes from their system, showing Miss C received a payment from her relative.  And that she 
returned this later the same day.  So Im satisfied they actioned Miss Cs instructions 
properly.
And, while I understand Miss C wants to help her relative trace the refund she sent them, its 
not PayPals responsibility to do that.  Her relative will need to make their own enquiries of 
the bank/card provider to which the payment was sent. 
Id only expect PayPal to do more than theyve already done, if Miss Cs relatives enquiries 
identify evidence which shows the refunded money was returned to them.  Ive not seen 
anything to show that.  And for that reason, I dont think PayPal need to do any more in 
respect of Miss Cs complaint.  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Miss Cs complaint about PayPal (Europe) 
Sarl et Cie SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 January 2023.
