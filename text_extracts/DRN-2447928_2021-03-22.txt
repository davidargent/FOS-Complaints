DRN-2447928
The complaint
Mrs H complains she overpaid her Next Retail Limit (Next) account, but the balance was still 
showing that the account was in debit.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Both parties confirm that the £50 overpayment was refunded by Next. Mrs H says 
she wasnt notified of the refund by Next. As the error was made by a third-party 
payment provider I dont think the responsibility was on Next to notify Mrs H of the 
refund.
I appreciate Mrs Hs concerns over the next day delivery service she paid for. Next 
refunded the charge paid by Mrs H for ultimate next day delivery as an apology.
Next refunded this twice by mistake but they didnt ask for the return of the 
overpayment and let Mrs H keep it as a gesture of goodwill, due to the errors.
I understand Mrs Hs frustration with the situation and this was compounded by the 
fact there were errors with the delivery of various orders.
Im not going to tell Next to do any more as theyve apologised for the mistakes, Mrs 
Hs account balance is now correct, and theyve paid her £40 in total compensation. I 
think this is a fair resolution considering the errors were largely due to third party 
providers impacted by the current pandemic - therefore out of their control.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about Next Retail Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 April 2021.
