The complaint
Mrs U complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) reversed a charge back request she 
made in relation to faulty goods. She would like the cost of the goods refunded.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusion reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons: -
Barclays did all that we would have expected it to do with regards to the chargeback 
request. It provided a temporary credit for the goods and contacted the merchant for 
more information. It received comprehensive information from the merchant including 
evidence the goods werent damaged when sent which it sent to Mrs U for comment. 
Mrs U didnt respond to this letter. Unfortunately, there are specific timescales for 
chargeback requests, so the dispute was then closed in the merchants favour.
I appreciate Mrs U  told us she didnt get the letter from Barclays asking for more 
information. I have seen a copy of this letter which was correctly addressed.so I dont 
know why Mrs U didnt it , but I am persuaded Barclays sent it, so I dont think 
Barclays is at fault here.
Having not found any evidence that Barclays has done anything wrong I dont feel I 
can reasonably ask it to refund the cost of the goods Mrs U bought as she would like.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs U to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 October 2021.
