The complaint
Mr M is unhappy as he feels NewDay Ltd provided credit to him which he couldnt afford and 
that this should have been evident to NewDay, had they undertaken checks into his financial 
position before providing that credit.
What happened
In January 2020, Mr M applied to NewDay for a new credit account. His application was 
successful and NewDay issued Mr M with a credit card with an initial credit limit of £1,200. 
During the following twelve months, NewDay increased the credit limit on this account three 
times  to £1,700 in May 2020, to £2,450 in August 2020, and to £3,450 in December 2020.
In July 2020, Mr M applied to NewDay for a second new credit account. This application was 
also successful, and NewDay issued a second credit card to Mr M with an initial credit limit 
of £700. No subsequent credit limit increases were implemented on this second account.
In Many 2022, Mr M raised a complaint with NewDay because he felt that he hadnt been 
able to afford any of the new or further credit that NewDay had provided to him, and that this 
should have been evident to NewDay, had they undertaken checks into his financial position 
at those times.
NewDay responded to Mr M and confirmed that they had undertaken checks into his 
financial position on all occasions before providing credit to him. NewDay also explained that 
they didnt feel there had been anything resulting from those checks that should reasonably 
have given them any cause to suspect Mr M couldnt afford the credit he was then provided 
with, and that because of this they werent upholding his complaint. Mr M wasnt satisfied 
with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel that NewDay had 
provided credit to Mr M irresponsibly, and so they didnt uphold the complaint. Mr M 
remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Id like to begin by confirming that this service isnt a regulatory body or a 
Court of Law and doesnt operate as such. This means that it isnt within my remit here to 
declare that NewDay have acted in a non-regulatory or unlawful way. Such declarations 
would be for a regulatory body or a Court of Law to potentially make. 
Instead, this service is an informal, impartial dispute resolution service. And while we do take 
relevant law and regulation into account when arriving at our decisions, our remit is focussed 
on determining whether we feel a fair or unfair outcome has occurred  from an impartial 
perspective, after taking all the circumstances and factors of a complaint into consideration. 
I also note that Mr M has provided several detailed submissions to this service regarding his 
complaint. Id like to thank Mr M for these submissions, and I hope he doesnt consider it a 
discourtesy that I wont be responding in similar detail here. Instead, Ive focussed on what I 
consider to be the key aspects of this complaint, in-line with this services role as an informal 
dispute resolution service. 
 
This means that if Mr M notes that I havent addressed a specific point that hes raised, it 
shouldnt be taken from this that I havent considered that point  I can confirm that Ive read 
and considered all the submissions provided by both Mr M and NewDay. Rather, it should be 
taken that I have considered that point but that I dont feel it necessary to address it directly 
in this letter to arrive at what I consider to be a fair resolution to this complaint.
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how much 
and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before approving a 
customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of credit available to a 
customer on an existing line of credit, the business would undertake reasonable and 
proportionate borrower focussed checks to ensure that any credit being offered to a 
customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
 
NewDay believe that they did that here and note that when Mr M made new credit account 
applications, they took information from him about his employment status and annual 
income, as well as obtained information from a credit reference agency to get a better 
understanding of his wider financial position. 
NewDay also confirm that before credit limit increases were applied to Mr Ms accounts, they 
obtained new information from credit reference agencies to refresh their understand of Mr 
Ms financial position. And NewDay contend that there was nothing resulting from that 
information that they feel should have given them any reasonable cause to believe that Mr M 
might not be able to afford the credit he was subsequently approved for.
In this instance, Mr M successfully applied for two new credit accounts and received three 
credit limit increases on the first of those accounts. I will consider each of these provisions of 
credit in turn.
January 2020  First New Credit Account Application
When Mr M applied to NewDay for a new credit account in January 2020, he told NewDay 
that he was employed with gross annual income of £27,000. Before approving Mr Ms 
application, NewDay reviewed his credit file, which indicated that Mr M had a low amount of 
existing unsecured credit  at around approximately £100  and had no existing credit 
accounts that were in a position of arrears. And, while Mr Ms credit file did show adverse 
reporting in the form of public records against him, these were from over three years prior to 
Mr M making his application to NewDay.
NewDay therefore made the decision to approve Mr Ms application and issue him with a 
credit card with an initial limit of £1,200. And this doesnt seem unreasonable to me.
The reasons I say this include that Mr Ms declared annual income appears high enough to 
have left him with enough disposable income to have made any repayments that may have 
become due if Mr M used the full amount of new credit that NewDay provided to him. And 
this is also in consideration of the low amount of other existing credit  and therefore 
potential other existing credit repayments  that Mr M had at that time. 
Additionally, while Mr Ms credit file did show a history of adverse reporting, none of the 
adverse reporting was recent, with Mr Ms more recent credit history being unproblematic. And I dont feel that it was unreasonable for NewDay to have given more weight to Mr Ms 
more recent credit history than to the struggles hed had several years prior. 
And so, given that Mr M appeared able to afford the credit he was applying for, and that his 
recent credit history didnt include any adverse reporting, I dont feel there was anything 
within the checks that NewDay undertook before approving Mr Ms new application for credit 
that should have reasonably given them any cause to suspect that Mr M might not be able to 
afford the new line of credit he was applying for. And it follows from this that Im satisfied that 
NewDay didnt provide this new line of credit to Mr M irresponsibly.
May 2020  First Account Credit Limit Increase
Four months after Mr M opened his credit account, NewDay applied a credit limit increase to 
that account. This increased the credit limit available to Mr M from £1,200 to £1,700.
At this time, NewDay had the benefit of seeing how Mr M had managed his NewDay account 
up to that time. And its evident from information NewDay have provided to this service that 
Mr Ms account management didnt indicate that he may have been in any financial difficulty 
during that time. 
I say this because Mr M had maintained the balance of his account well within the available 
credit limit and had made monthly payments towards the account that were significantly 
higher than the minimum monthly payments that were required. Additionally, Mr M hadnt 
incurred late payment or over-limit fees on his NewDay account.
Furthermore, the credit file information that NewDay reviewed before increasing the credit 
limit on Mr Ms account continued to show that Mr M wasnt in arrears on any of his other 
existing credit accounts and only had a low amount of other existing credit. And so, Im 
satisfied that by providing this further line of credit to Mr M  which Mr M was free to decline 
had he wanted to do so  that NewDay werent acting irresponsibly or unfairly towards him.
July 2020  Second New Credit Account Application
When Mr M applied to NewDay for a second new credit account in July 2020, he confirmed 
to NewDay that he was employed but stated that his gross annual income had now 
increased to £35,000. 
Before approving Mr Ms second application, NewDay reviewed his credit file, which again 
showed that Mr M had a low amount of non-NewDay existing unsecured credit and had no 
existing credit accounts that were in a position of arrears. And again, while Mr Ms credit file 
did show adverse reporting in the form of public records against him, these were now even 
further in the past than at the time of the first credit account application.
Accordingly, while Mr M already held an existing line of credit with NewDay at this time, Im 
satisfied that his increased annual income and relatively low amount of existing credit, as 
well as that his management of his first NewDay account, continued to not provide any 
possible causes for concern to NewDay and meant that it was reasonable for NewDay to 
approve Mr Ms new credit account application and provide the second line of credit with an 
credit limit of £700 to him that they did.
August 2020  First Account Credit Limit Increase
In August 2020, NewDay implemented a further credit limit increase on Mr Ms first credit 
account. This increased the credit limit on the account from £1,700 to 2,450.Before doing so, NewDay again reviewed how Mr M had managed his NewDay account up 
to that time, and this continued to show that Mr M wasnt incurring any fees on the account 
and was maintaining the balance of his account well within the available credit limit while 
making large monthly payments towards it. And, as explained previously, I dont feel that this 
type of account management did or should have reasonably suggested to NewDay that Mr 
M might have been struggling financially at that time.
Furthermore, the credit file information at that time didnt show any adverse changes in Mr 
Ms financial position, such as Mr Ms existing credit accounts falling into a position of 
arrears, which may have given NewDay cause to suspect that Mr M might not be able to 
afford the credit limit increase they subsequently provided. 
Indeed, my only minor cause for concern here is that fact that by providing this credit limit 
increase, NewDay were increasing the total amount of potential credit that Mr M held with 
them to £3,150. However, given Mr Ms declared annual income of £35,000 and his relatively 
low amount of other existing credit, as well as his unblemished recent credit record and 
seemingly unproblematic account management, Im satisfied that it was reasonable for 
NewDay to conclude that Mr M would most likely be able to afford this increase to the 
account credit limit and that therefore NewDay didnt act unfairly by providing it to him.
December 2020  First Account Credit Limit Increase
When NewDay increased the credit limit on Mr Ms first account in December 2020, from 
£2,450 to £3,450, Mr Ms account management remained much the same as previously 
described. This included that Mr M continued to maintain the balance of the credit account 
well below the credit limit, wasnt incurring any account fees of any kind, and continued to 
make large monthly payments towards the account.  Additionally, Mr Ms credit file continued 
to show that Mr M didnt have a large amount of other existing credit and wasnt in arrears on 
any of this other existing credit accounts. 
Additionally, while this increase to Mr Ms credit limit increased the total amount of potential 
credit Mr M held with NewDay to over £4,000, I dont feel that this was an unreasonably 
large credit amount. And this is both because of Mr Ms declared annual income  and 
therefore his potential ability to make any monthly payments that may have become due had 
Mr M utilising the full amount of credit available to him  as well as that Mr Ms NewDay 
account management and credit file didnt provide any indication that Mr M might have been 
struggling financially and so potentially unable to afford any further credit at that time.
And so, in consideration of the above, I dont feel that NewDay did provide this final credit 
limit increase  or any of the prior provisions of credit  to Mr M irresponsibly.
Other considerations
Mr M has explained that during 2020, he was only able to make the credit account payments 
that he did because of financial assistance provided to him by his family. But it doesnt 
appear that Mr M ever made NewDay aware that he was in financial difficulty and that his 
family were helping him to make the monthly payments that he did. 
Given the impartial nature of this service, I wouldnt consider holding NewDay  or any 
provider of credit  accountable for not acting on information they were never provided. And 
Im satisfied that from NewDays perspective  given the management of Mr Ms account as 
Ive previously explained it  there wasnt anything that should have given them any cause to 
suspect that Mr M might have been in the financial difficulty that hes described.
Finally, in his correspondence with this service, Mr M has detailed the issues hes faced 
regarding his physical and mental health. I can appreciate the impact that these issues will have had on Mr M, but again, from an impartial perspective, it doesnt appear that Mr M 
made NewDay aware of these issues before the he applied for the credit accounts or 
received the provisions of further credit. And so, similar to how Ive explained things above, I 
wouldnt expect NewDay to be able to take into account any issues that Mr M may have 
been facing at that time, but which NewDay werent made aware of.
However, given the NewDay are now aware of the continuing issues that Mr M faces, it 
would be expected that they would provide reasonable assistance to Mr M to help him repay 
the outstanding credit account balances that he owes. I can only encourage Mr M to liaise 
with NewDay, or any appointed third-party agencies they may have engaged, in this regard.
Summary
In consideration of all the above, Im satisfied that NewDay did undertake reasonable and 
proportionate checks into Mr Ms financial position before providing him with any new or 
further lines of credit. And Im also satisfied that there wasnt anything arising from any of 
those checks, or from any of the information that Mr M provided to NewDay himself, that 
should have reasonably given NewDay any cause to suspect that Mr M might not have been 
able to afford any of the credit they subsequently provided to him.
All of which means that I dont feel that NewDay have acted unfairly towards Mr M in the 
manner that he contends here, and it follows from this that I wont be upholding this 
complaint or instructing NewDay to take any further action.
I realise this wont be the outcome Mr M was wanting, but I hope hell understand, given all 
that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 May 2023.
