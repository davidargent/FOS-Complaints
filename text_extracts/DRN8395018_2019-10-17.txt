enough checks before  lending  to her.

* Total borrowed  whilst  the account was running
** Monthly scheduled repayment if Miss V had borrowed the full £300 limit on 26 Jul 2014  
Miss V says she couldnt  afford to repay  the loans so had to continue  to borrow,  often from 
multiple lenders.  She says she was stuck  in a cycle  of borrowing and eventually sought help 
from a credit union to repay what she owed.
Sunny says it conducted creditworthiness  checks and assessed the affordability of the loans. 
It says it considered its lending decisions were responsible at the time.  However,  on review, 
it acknowledges that some of the products may not have been suitable  for Miss Vs needs. It 
offered to refund interest and charges (plus 8% statutory interest) on loan 1.
Miss V did not accept  this offer.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He acknowledged that 
Sunny had already upheld the complaint  about  loan 1, but considered  loans 2 to 11 should  
also be refunded. He found  Sunny  had allowed  Miss V to have a succession of instalment 
loans after drawing  down  multiple times on her running account. He explained this had the 
same effect as unfairly allowing  her to continue to draw down on her running account credit  
in a way that was unsuitable. He said Sunny should  have seen it was unlikely Miss V would 
have been able to sustainably repay these and any subsequent loans. Indeed,  our 
adjudicator added that by loan 6, Miss Vs pattern of borrowing suggested shed become 
reliant on short-term lending. He recommended interest and charges should be refunded on 
loans 2 to 11 (plus 8% statutory interest) and adverse information about  loans 2 to 5 should 
be removed from Miss Vs credit  file, along  with loans  6 to 11 in their entirety.
Sunny responded to say, in summary,  that having  multiple loans outstanding is not an 
indication the lending is unsustainable. It said the repayments were  a small percentage of 
Miss Vs income and that the break  in lending between loans 8 and 9 shows  she was not 
reliant on the loans.  It adds that all the loans  were repaid early.
Ref: DRN83950182my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss V could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss V could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Vs complaint.
Loan 1
Sunnys offered to uphold Miss Vs complaint about  loan 1, so I wont consider it further here.
Ref: DRN83950183Loans 2 to 5
Miss V was given running account credit  for her first loan. Miss Vs credit  agreement 
explained that this type of credit was unsuitable  for borrowing over long periods but I can see 
that Miss V was allowed  to make nine drawdowns on the running account  facility and it 
wasnt repaid for over six months. Although Miss V stopped using this facility,  she was 
approved for loans  2 to 5 shortly afterwards. I think that this had the same  effect  as unfairly  
allowing Miss V to continue to draw down on the running account credit in a way that was 
unsuitable. So, I consider Sunny should have seen that it was unlikely Miss V would  have 
been able to sustainably repay loans 2 to 5.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss V, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Vs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
Loan 6 was Miss Vs 14th loan, or drawdown, from Sunny in less than a year and the 
loan amount was increasing;
From  loan 6 onwards  Miss V was provided with a new loan within  days/weeks  of a 
previous one. I acknowledge that Sunny says there was a three-month  break 
between loans 8 and 9, but Im not satisfied that this was long enough for Sunny to 
be confident Miss V was no longer reliant on short-term lending. Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Miss V was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Vs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss V wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan 11 was 
taken out ten months after loan 2, and it was for the same amount. Miss V had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Miss V lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 2 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Vs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Vs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 2 to 11 (in addition to the offer Sunny made on 
loan 1) and Sunny should put things right.
Ref: DRN83950184my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. As well as honouring the offer it made on loan 1, 
Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as sunny.co.uk) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Miss V paid on loans 2 to 11;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loans 2 to 5 from Miss Vs credit file.
The number of loans  taken from 6 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 11 should be removed from Miss Vs 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss V a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss V to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 November 2019.
