K820x#14complaint
Ms W complains that damage was caused to her property when an item shed ordered from 
Caversham Finance Limited  (trading as BrightHouse) was delivered.
background
In April 2018 Ms W placed an order for a wardrobe and entered  into an agreement  with 
BrightHouse. The wardrobe was delivered  in May 2018.
Ms W says that damage was caused  to her window sill during the delivery. She complained 
to BrightHouse and sent it some  pictures  of the damage. 
BrightHouse felt that the pictures werent  clear enough and arranged for a representative  to 
visit Ms W to look at the damaged window sill. Ms W wasnt at home when the 
representative called and subsequent attempts to contact her were  unsuccessful.
BrightHouse wasnt able to obtain  the information  it needed so it rejected Ms Ws complaint. 
Ms W wasnt happy so she complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. She said the photos  provided by Ms W didnt 
show the damage clearly  and she couldnt  see that Ms W had contacted BrightHouse to 
rearrange an inspection.
Ms W didnt  agree. She said the BrightHouse representative had visited  on a day when her 
child was unwell and she wasnt  at home.  She said the representative had only tried to visit 
once, not three times.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the photos provided by Ms W. These arent clear  and Im unable  to say that 
they show damage to the window sill.
BrightHouse has said it arranged for a representative to visit Ms W to look at the damage. 
Because the photos were  unclear, I dont  think it was unreasonable  for BrightHouse  to do 
this.
I appreciate that Ms W has said that BrightHouse only attempted one visit. BrightHouse has 
said it attempted three visits  and tried to contact Ms W by telephone on three  subsequent 
occasions but didnt receive  a response. On balance, and whether it was one or three  
attempts at a visit, I think  BrightHouse made  reasonable efforts to try and arrange to inspect 
the alleged damage. Ms W was aware that BrightHouse wanted  to look at the window  sill so 
I think she could have  contacted BrightHouse to arrange a mutually convenient  time for the 
representative to visit.
Taking everything into account  Im unable to uphold  the complaint.
