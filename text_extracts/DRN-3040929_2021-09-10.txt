The complaint
Mr K complains that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118118 Money Limited) was 
irresponsible to lend to him.
What happened
Mr K had three loans from 118118 Money between October 2017 and November 2018 
as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 25 Oct 2017 £1,000 24m £80.23 1 Nov 2019 24 Aug 2018
With Loan 2
2 24 Aug 2018 £1,366.52 24m £106.43 14 Aug 2020 2 Nov 2018
3 22 Nov 2018 £1,000 24m £78.22 17 No 2020 Outstanding
Mr K says that he had become dependent on loans and was unable to afford repayments 
without further borrowing. He says the loans have badly affected his financial situation 
and mental health and it has led to him having to seek debt management advice.
118118 Money says it asked Mr K about his income and expenditure, the reason for the 
loan and his employment details. It says it used industry standard verification checks and 
that Mr K was asked to confirm that he felt the repayments were affordable. 118118 Money 
says its satisfied that the loan applications were correctly approved, although loan 3 has 
now been sold to a third-party debt collection agency.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He was satisfied 
that 118118 Money carried out proportionate checks and that there was nothing to 
indicate the loan repayments were unsustainable.
Mr Ks representative responded to request a referral to an ombudsman.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mr K and to 118118 Money on 9 August 2021. The relevant 
guidelines were outlined in the provisional decision, so I wont repeat them here.
I summarise my findings:
I was satisfied that 118118 Money carried out proportionate checks for both loans 1 
and 2;
I couldnt see there was anything in the information 118118 Money collected that 
indicated it should have carried out further checks or that the repayments were 
unaffordable to Mr K;
So I didnt conclude 118118 Money was wrong to have approved Mr Ks first two 
loans;
I found 118118 Moneys checks indicated that Mr K might be struggling to manage 
his money by loan 3 so I considered it would have been proportionate to carry out 
further checks;
As I didnt have any further evidence of Mr Ks financial circumstances in 2018, I 
needed to make my decision based on the balance of probability  that is what I 
considered to be the most likely situation at the time:
I found it more likely than not that Mr Ks disposable income was less than the £970 
per month hed declared because:
oIt was unlikely Mr K would have required a £1,000 high-cost loan when he 
had the same amount of disposable income each month;
oHis credit file showed his monthly commitment to credit was around £400, 
rather than the £50 hed declared;
oMr K had taken out another loan the week before loan 2 which was not 
apparent to 118118 Money during its affordability checks for loan 2;
oIt seemed likely that Mr K used another loan to repay loan 2, rather than his 
own money;
So I found it was more likely than not that further checks would have shown the 
repayments on loan 3 were unaffordable to Mr K and, indeed, I noted that he failed to 
make a single repayment on time for the loan;
That said, based on the information it had already, I considered 118118 Money was 
unfair to agree further credit for Mr K -  it knew, or ought reasonably to have seen 
indications, that he was having problems managing his money and should have 
realised it was more likely than not that he wasnt going to able to repay further credit 
sustainably.
So I found that 118118 Money did not carry out proportionate checks for loan 3 and, had it 
done so, I considered it unlikely the checks would have provided any reassurance of 
affordability given the information it already had.
Mr Ks representative responded to say it had no further information.
118118 Money did not respond to the provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party provided any additional information, I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional decision.
My final decisionMy decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 
118118 Money Limited) should:
A. Buy back loan 3 from the debt collection agency if possible and then take the 
following steps. If it is not possible to buy the debt back then 118118 Money 
should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below;
B. Remove all interest and fees from the balance on loan 3, and treat repayments 
made by Mr K as repayments of the principal on the loan;
C. If reworking Mr Ks loan 3 account as Ive directed results in Mr K effectively 
having made payments above the original capital borrowed, then 118118 Money 
should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date 
of settlement*;
D. If reworking Mr Ks loan 3 account leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, 
then I remind 118118 Money that it should take a sympathetic view when 
seeking to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr K;
E.Remove any negative information recorded on Mr Ks credit file regarding loan 3, 
up to this point.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118118 
Money must give Mr K a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 October 2021.
