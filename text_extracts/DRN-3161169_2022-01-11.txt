The complaint
Mrs H complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) gave her poor customer 
service in relation to accessing the money in her PayPal account.
What happened
Mrs H says she tried contacting PayPal in 2019 about updating her account details, but 
couldnt get through. And that she then wrote to PayPal instead but didnt get a response. 
In November 2020 Mrs H contacted our service as she couldnt access the funds in her 
PayPal account or access the help section of PayPals website - shed forgotten her 
account password and no longer used the phone number recorded on her account. She said 
PayPal didnt respond to her 2019 letters. And shed called PayPal several times but got an 
automated response directing her to its website.
 
Our service raised this with PayPal. In December 2020 it sent Mrs H its final response to her 
complaint. It said it called Mrs H that day but couldnt reach her on the number it held, which 
it understood to be incorrect. It said Mrs H could access her account by resetting her 
password. So it could help with this, PayPal asked Mrs H to contact it with her new number 
using the email address or phone number it gave in the letter. PayPal said it had followed its 
processes.
In January 2021 Mrs H contacted us again as shed not heard from PayPal. We passed its 
final response to her. Mrs H said shed received a notification PayPal had emailed her but 
couldnt access the email and was concerned PayPal called her old number. Mrs H said 
shed wait until PayPal called her new number. Soon after, Mrs H told us PayPal hadnt been 
in touch. 
Our investigator communicated with PayPal and Mrs H over the following months. Mrs H 
said she couldnt reply to PayPals email notifications, as they were from a no reply email 
address. She provided a March 2020 email from PayPal suggesting it had added her new 
phone number to her account, but Mrs H said she still couldnt access her account. She said 
PayPal hadnt called her, and shed not been able to use the contact details it had provided  
her emails bounced back and her calls to the two PayPal numbers either didnt connect or 
were answered by an automated system rather than a person. 
PayPal said it tried calling Mrs H in March 2021 using both her old and new numbers, but 
there was no answer. It said Mrs H just needed to contact it. And in this case, it had decided 
to go beyond its usual process and update Mrs Hs account with her new phone number, as 
given by our service. So Mrs H should now be able to access her PayPal account. 
Our investigator thought PayPal had made reasonable attempts to contact Mrs H as it used 
the details it held for her and tried calling both her old and new number in March 2021. She 
noted PayPal had updated Mrs Hs phone number so she should now be able to access her 
account. But that Mrs H should contact PayPal if she had further problems. 
Mrs H disagreed, saying she still couldnt access her PayPal account. She accepted PayPal 
called her in March 2021 but said she didnt answer unknown numbers and no voicemail 
message was left. She explained shed now found the copy of PayPals final response letter 
our service emailed her in January 2021, as shed initially overlooked the attached letter. 
She said PayPal had posted its final response letter to her old address. Shed tried both 
phone numbers for PayPal, but one was answered by the same automated system and the 
other didnt connect. And the email address PayPal gave her didnt work. 
PayPal confirmed the automated answer was the start of its call handling process which 
Mrs H could use to reach a person, and the other number was a freephone number only 
available through a landline. PayPal provided evidence both these numbers were available 
on its website. And said it had now spoken to Mrs H and assisted her. 
Mrs H could now access her PayPal account, but she thought PayPal should compensate 
her for the delays and inconvenience. She said there wasnt a way of contacting a person at 
PayPal and suggested PayPal was causing accessibility issues for its customers. Mrs H said 
our investigator hadnt considered PayPal might have made an error regarding her 2019 
letters and updating her account details. 
Our investigator didnt change her view. Ultimately, she said PayPal had explained what 
Mrs H needed to do in its final response letter. That the automated response was only the 
start of PayPals call handling process, and shed tested the email address PayPal provided 
and found it worked. And the evidence suggested PayPal hadnt received Mrs Hs 2019 
letters.
As agreement couldnt be reached, this complaint was passed to me for consideration.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs H says she wrote to PayPal in 2019 to update her details, as shed not been able to 
contact it any other way. PayPal has provided its contact notes, and these show it didnt 
receive any written communication from Mrs H in 2019 regarding this account. So while I 
cant be certain what happened to the letters Mrs H says she sent, I dont have enough 
evidence to fairly say PayPal received them or that it failed to act on them. 
Mrs H brought this matter to our service in November 2020. We raised it with PayPal and 
passed on Mrs Hs new number. But I dont think it would be reasonable to expect PayPal to 
have called Mrs H on her new number at that time, because it wasnt the number PayPal 
held for Mrs H then and it hadnt yet investigated her complaint.
PayPals December 2020 final response letter explained Mrs Hs password just needed to be 
reset, that she should contact PayPal with her new number, and it set out how she could 
contact it. Based on this and PayPals systems records, Im satisfied PayPal was contacting 
Mrs H using the details it held for her at that time. And that PayPal advised Mrs H about 
what she needed to do in order to access her account. 
I understand Mrs H didnt receive this final response from PayPal. But our service emailed a 
copy of it to Mrs H in January 2021. Mrs H acknowledged receipt of this email and said shed 
wait for PayPal to contact her. However, in August 2021 Mrs H told our service shed 
overlooked the final response letter. Thats unfortunate, but its not something I can hold 
PayPal responsible for. PayPals contact notes show it called Mrs H in March 2021 on both her old and new number. 
I can appreciate why Mrs H doesnt answer calls from unknown numbers, but unfortunately 
in this case it meant she missed a call that would have helped her access her PayPal 
account. I also acknowledge her point that PayPal didnt leave a voicemail message, but 
while thats again unfortunate, its not something PayPal is obliged to do. 
Mrs H has provided us with an email suggesting PayPal added her new phone number to a 
PayPal account in March 2020. But this email doesnt specify which account the number was 
added to. And PayPal has provided system records to show Mrs Hs phone number wasnt 
updated in 2019 or 2020. So I dont have enough evidence to fairly say PayPal made an 
error here.
PayPal called Mrs H in September 2021 and as a result, Mrs H was able to access her 
PayPal account. Given this, it seems Mrs Hs account access issue was able to be resolved 
relatively simply once Mrs H spoke to PayPal, as it had asked her to do in its final response 
letter of December 2020 and which our service passed to Mrs H the next month. 
I acknowledge Mrs H says that for one reason or another, none of the contact methods 
PayPal gave her worked. However, I can see the email address PayPal asked Mrs H to 
contact it on in its final response letter is a valid email address, and Mrs H hasnt provided 
copies of any bounce back or error emails she received from this address. 
There were also two phone numbers Mrs H could have called PayPal on. Based on 
communication between Mrs H and our service, Mrs H had both of these numbers from at 
least February or March 2021. I can see that PayPals website and the website screenshot 
PayPal provided show these two numbers were also available on PayPals website without 
Mrs H needing to first enter any of the details of her PayPal account. Ive called PayPal on 
these two numbers and was able to get through. And while my calls were initially answered 
by an automated response, I was put through to a person without significant trouble after I 
followed the option to say I had no account information and had an account access issue. So 
Im satisfied PayPal took reasonable steps to make contact methods available to Mrs H. 
Taking everything into account, Im satisfied PayPal hasnt made any errors here or caused 
Mrs H any delay in accessing her PayPal accounts. Therefore, Im not asking it to do 
anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 February 2022.
