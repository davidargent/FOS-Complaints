K822xcomplaint
Mr R complains that for ten years Amber Homeloans Limited added an additional  1.5% 
interest to his mortgage on account  of alleged unauthorised letting when he hadnt let the 
property.
It had been a very stressful time struggling  to find the extra money for the mortgage  every 
month. Amber had called  at least once a month for many years telling him that he had 
breached a court order and that he had to pay arrears or risk losing his home.  The stress 
had put a lot of strain on his marriage  and family life.
To resolve  his complaint  he wants Amber  to reimburse the 1.5%  interest and any charges, 
penalties and fees associated with this over the ten year period. He also wants  
compensation for the distress  the situation caused  him and his family over the ten years.
He is represented  in this complaint by his wife Mrs H.
background 
Mr R took a mortgage with Amber  on 19 March 2008. On 5 December 2018 Amber  wrote to 
him. It said:
I am writing in relation  to your property, which is currently being  let out on an unauthorised 
basis in breach of your mortgage terms and conditions. We have reviewed our unauthorised 
lettings policy and due to the need  lo preserve our security from the additional risk of 
unauthorised letting, we can only consider lettings on an authorised basis going forwards.
We cannot agree to any continued unauthorised letting of the properly and our only option to 
preserve our security is the recovery and possession of the properly due to the breach of 
terms and conditions. As a result, we will no longer be charging an interest rate increase 
should a property be let on an unauthorised basis and we have therefore ceased  the 1.5% 
additional interest being charged to your account.
Amber went on to set out the new interest rate and contractual  monthly  payment (CMP) and 
continued:
As we can only consider lettings on an authorised basis, I have enclosed  an application 
form for you to complete  and return to request our consent for your continued letting of the 
property.
it is a breach of your terms and conditions should  you continue  lo let your property on an 
unauthorised basis  and  should the property still be let without our consent, we will review 
the options available to us. This may result in us instructing our solicitors to take possession  
action
Mr R says he looked through his paperwork but was unable to locate  any information about 
the 1.5% additional  interest. He says he (or it may have been  Mrs H) contacted Amber to 
query this on 29 January  2019. It said a field agent had attended the property in June 2008 
and had spoken to a tenant who said Mr R lived at the property but was away. Amber said it 
had sent two letters, and then the additional interest  was applied on 1 November 2008.
Ref: DRN90847512Mr R says Mrs H told Amber that there  was no tenant and that the property had always been 
their family home. Amber said it didnt have the name of the tenant  and would  send a written 
response after investigation. 
On 25 February 2019 Amber sent its final response. It said it had instructed a field agent 
owing to payment  arrears.  The agent  had reported  that he met with a person who advised  he 
was a tenant in the property and that his name was Mr W. The agent noted that whilst Mr R 
resided in the property, he was currently abroad.
Amber said its records showed letters had been  sent to Mr R on 2 June 2008 and 
16 August 2008  asking  that he contact it to confirm the occupancy  of the property, and if he 
were not letting the property it required evidence of this by way of his council tax bill. No 
response had been  received and Amber  had applied a 1.5% interest lettings loading to the 
account on 15 October 2008 as confirmed by its letter  of that date, a copy of which  was 
enclosed. That letter said:
Further to our previous  letters  to which we have received no response. We have reason lo 
believe that you are letting the above  property.
As you are aware it is a breach of the mortgage  terms  and conditions  to let out the property 
without Amber's  consent. Therefore, we have  increased the interest rate on your mortgage  
account by 1.50% as previously notified. This will take effect from 1 November.
However Amber said it didnt have copies  of the letters of 2 June 2008 and 16 August 2008  
and couldnt evidence these letters having  been  sent. It was therefore upholding Mr Rs 
complaint.
Amber offered Mr R £100.00 compensation in settlement of his complaint. It said that if he 
could provide, as evidence  of his residence  in the property, the council tax bill in Mrs Hs 
name and a bank  statement or utility bill in his name for the period from 1 November 2008  
when the interest  rate loading had been  applied, Amber could consider refunding the 
additional interest debited to the account.
Mr R wasnt happy and contacted this service  through Mrs H on 5 March 2019. She said the 
interest loading  had cost them about £30,000. This had been a stressful 10 years and the 
stress had been  never ending  theyd  been in arrears and had been  to court several  times  
to resolve this. It had been a complete waste of time since  Amber had made an error and 
had never  reviewed the 1.5% loading. The property had never  been  let and had always  been  
occupied by them. They  didnt know of any Mr W and had only had one lodger,  a relation 
Mr M, for three months. They had received no such letters as stated by Amber.
Mr R submitted his complaint form dated  8 March  2019 and on 13 March  2019 we wrote  to 
Amber notifying it that Mr R had asked  us to look into his complaint and inviting it to state its 
case. On 15 March 2019 Amber wrote to Mr R:
We are pleased to confirm that the interest  loading on your account has now been removed.
The removal  of the interest rate has been backdated lo 1 November 2008. Your account  has 
therefore been credited by the sum of £52,118.91.
Ref: DRN90847513Following the backdating  of the removal of the interest rate, your account arrears amount 
has been credited  by the sum of £46,653.76. Your credit rating has also been amended  and 
any fees that had been  applied to your account  have been  refunded.
On 1 April 2019  Mrs H confirmed to this service  that Mr R wished to proceed  with his 
complaint, and our adjudicator made his recommendations on 18 April 2019. He said that 
despite Ambers inability to evidence the sending of the letters  of 2 June 2008 and 
16 August 2008,  he was confident Mr R would have received annual mortgage  statements 
which would have confirmed his interest  rate and CMP. He thought Mr R had enough cause 
to realise something  had changed on his mortgage and could have raised this sooner so it 
could have been resolved  at the time.
Therefore it wasnt fair to say that either  Mr R or Amber was fully to blame for the situation. 
However, he could  see Mr R had provided  evidence to Amber and it had acted fairly and 
reasonably by removing the additional  interest charge of 1.5%  and backdating this to 
November 2008  which is the date it went active.  This had led to a credit of £52,118.91  to 
Mr R's account. Amber had also offered £100 in its final response letter for not being able to 
prove sending  Mr R the letters in 2008.
In these circumstances the adjudicator was satisfied Amber had done enough to fairly  
resolve the complaint.
Mr R asked for the case to be reviewed  by an ombudsman. He said that at no time during 
the ten year period did Amber  mention  the loading of the interest rate, although it had had 
ample opportunity  to say what it had done  through annual  mortgage statements, monthly 
telephone conversations,  weekly  letters of correspondence  and court hearings for eviction. 
He even wondered if anybody  had attended at the property at all in June 2008. There had 
been no mention  of compensation for the ten years  of distress Amber had caused Mr R.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ambers notes for 29 May 2008  say:
Mr Wstated that he is living in the property at present,  but that Mr R also lives there, but 
he is away abroad at present, due to return in June  2008.
This was the following  month, and anyway Mr W stated Mr R also lived there.  The notes for 
15 February 2019 say:
I have investigated the account and there are numerous documents  which confirm Mr's 
occupancy: The field agent report from 2008  confirmed  that the customer  resided there  as 
well as the occupant which [sic] spoke with the field agent. 
There is a letter on 01/04/2011 which confirms evidence the customer  is residing at the 
property in the form of a payslip. There are field agent reports  dated 17/12/12 and 
16/05/2014 confirming the customer is residing in the property. 
Ref: DRN90847514Due to the amount of evidence already on the file, we will only require an up to date council 
tax bill in Mrs name if this is all they have and also 1 form of address  ID for Mr to show  up to 
date residency.
Once we have this information we will back date the loadings to 2008 and rework the 
account. 
Amber has reversed the interest loading and fees so the remaining question  is what is the 
appropriate level of compensation  for the trouble and upset  caused  to Mr R and his family.
Theres no evidence that any letters were actually sent in 2008 except the 15 October letter.  
However, Mr R denies receiving any of the 2008  letters. It is most unfortunate if all three 
letters were lost in the post.
I can see from the annual  statements  that with effect from 4 November 2008  the CMP 
suddenly increased  from £1,805.85 to £2,158.00.  But Mr R didnt query this with Amber. Had 
he done so, it would  have transpired that he hadnt  received the letters.  It was obvious  from 
the statement  for the period ending  31 March 2009  that there had been some significant  
change. Mr R never questioned it.
The statement  for the period ending 31 March 2008 showed a balance of £241,817.47.  With 
an interest-only mortgage this should  stay broadly the same,  but by 31 March 2009  it had 
risen to £249,946.14,  an increase of £8,128.67. Only £1,760.75 of this can be attributed  to 
the additional CMP of £352.15  from November 2008. 
And the 2009  statement  shows  there were missed  payments in April 2008,  June 2008,  
August 2008,  October 2008,  November  2008  and December 2008. 
The notes show that Amber had instructed solicitors some months  before the CMP increase. 
A court pack was prepared and sent to solicitors on 11 July 2008. A court hearing was listed  
for 19 September 2008 which Amber subsequently  agreed to postpone. There was a debit 
for solicitors costs on 18 September 2008.
For these reasons Im not persuaded that the November 2008 CMP increase was the cause 
of the ten years of stress arising from arrears and the several court hearings. Nor that the 
court action was a complete waste of time caused  by Amber failing to review the 1.5%  
loading. The arrears  and the litigation both commenced well before the CMP increase.
In these circumstances I agree with the adjudicator that Amber doesnt need  to do anything  
further to fairly resolve the complaint.
Ref: DRN90847515my final decision
Amber Homeloans Limited  has already made an offer to pay £100 to settle the complaint 
and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
So my decision is that Amber Homeloans  Limited  should pay Mr R £100.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 December  2019.
