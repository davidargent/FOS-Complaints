The complaint
Miss R says PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA dismissed her requests to write-off the debt 
on her account despite being aware of her vulnerabilities. 
What happened
Miss R opened a PayPal credit account in November 2020. She was given a £2,000 credit 
limit.  She contacted PayPal on 5 April 2022 to say she was unemployed and her mental 
health was poor. PayPal suspended interest and charges and all collections activity. It gave 
Miss R 30 days breathing space and asked her to complete an income and expenditure 
form. On 5 May 2022 PayPal agreed a £1 per month repayment plan for three months. It 
emailed Miss R explaining how this would impact her credit file. 
Miss R made the £1 repayment in May, August and October 2022  the latter was her last 
repayment. The account had defaulted in July 2022. In December 2022 Miss R contacted 
PayPal giving more details about her difficult circumstances and asking for the balance to be 
written-off. PayPal did not agree to this but agreed to extend the £1 monthly repayment and 
retain the suspension of all collections activity. It offered to refund all interest and fees 
charged to her account since it opened (£375.21) as a gesture of goodwill.
Our investigator did not uphold Miss Rs complaint. He found PayPal had responded fairly to 
Miss Rs difficulties. Miss R disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans review. She said it 
must be remembered PayPal had acted unlawfully, closed her account without warning and 
she had also needed to complain to the ICO about PayPal. Our investigator explained that 
this complaint was about PayPals refusal to write-off her debt and could not consider the 
issue Miss R had taken to the ICO, or the account closure as this was not part of Miss Rs 
complaint to PayPal - or something she had asked us to investigate previously.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I want to start by saying that I am sorry Miss R has experienced such challenging personal 
circumstances over recent years. I hope she now has the support she needs. StepChange 
(tel: 0330 055 2198) and MIND (tel: 0300 123 3393) are organisations that provide free 
assistance if not.
Miss R has said that she believes PayPals general practices to be unlawful, but I can only 
look here at what it did in the individual circumstances of her case. And I note whilst she 
challenged the initial lending decision with PayPal, she has asked us to review its refusal to 
write-off her outstanding balance.
I can see that when Miss R applied she declared she was self-employed. But by April 2022 
she was unemployed and struggling to make her repayments. When she contacted PayPal 
about this it immediately froze interest, charges and all attempts to recover the arrears. 30 
days later it agreed a reduced payment plan. It then emailed Miss R clearly setting out the 
implications of this arrangement. I find this response to be reasonable. 
Equally, when Miss R later requested that her balance be written-off in full I think PayPals 
response was fair. It ensured Miss R was not being chased for payment of her arrears and 
agreed to an ongoing reduced repayment of £1 a month. 
I have considered PayPals obligations and Miss Rs vulnerabilities and I find that PayPal 
responded appropriately as soon as it was made aware of Miss Rs situation. I say this as 
the evidence shows she received fair treatment, in so much as she experienced an outcome 
that would be in line with the outcomes received by other customers in similar situations who 
may not be vulnerable. PayPals actions were also in line with the industry rules and 
standards that apply to customers in financial difficulties.  
PayPal has offered to refund all interest and charges Miss R has paid since the inception of 
the account to recognise she has had a difficult experience. This means it is in essence 
offering to write-off part of her debt. In the circumstances I find this offer to be fair and 
PayPal should action this if it hasnt already. 
I would add that whilst Miss R has not complained to this service about PayPals initial 
lending decision  had she done so and had we found it to be irresponsible, we would most 
likely have instructed it to refund all interest and charges as it has offered to do so here  not 
to write-off the balance in full.  
My final decision
I am not upholding Miss Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 4 October 2023.
