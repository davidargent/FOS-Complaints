The complaint
Miss B complains that Family Equity Plan Limited (trading as OneFamily) paid the proceeds 
of her child trust fund to the wrong bank account. This means shes lost out on this money.
What happened
On 14 March 2022 Miss B submitted withdrawal instructions for the maturity proceeds of a 
child trust fund for which she was the beneficiary. 
The instructions she provided contained an account number and sort code, and she 
provided her name as the account holder. On the same day, shortly after submitting her 
instructions, she received a secure message from OneFamily confirming the instructions and 
the account details which Miss B had provided. Two days later she received a further 
message confirming that the money was on its way to her and she would receive it within 4 
to 5 working days. 
On 6 April 2022 Miss B called OneFamily and said that she hadnt received the funds, and 
said that the details on the instructions form werent correct. OneFamily attempted to trace 
the funds  there was a slight delay in doing this initially, but eventually OneFamily was told 
by the receiving bank that the money had been received in an account in the same name as 
Miss B and could no longer be returned. OneFamily offered Miss B Â£150 as a gesture of 
goodwill to compensate for the slight delay in tracing her funds initially, but Miss B declined 
and complained. 
One of our investigators looked into Miss Bs complaint, but didnt think it should be upheld. 
In short, she said she couldnt hold OneFamily responsible for what Miss B said were the 
incorrect details on the instruction form, as those were the details Miss B provided. 
Miss B didnt agree. She said she didnt provide those details, and now shes missed out on 
money that had been put away for her since she was born. She did not accept OneFamilys 
offer of compensation and maintained that they have paid the money to the wrong account, 
and they are the ones in the wrong. 
As agreement couldnt be reached, the case was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the investigators conclusions and for broadly the same 
reasons. 
I understand Miss Bs strength of feeling, and I acknowledge she believes OneFamily is in 
the wrong. However, the evidence Ive seen shows that OneFamily did not make any 
mistakes and paid the money in line with the instructions it received. 
Miss B says she didnt provide the bank details which OneFamily used to send the proceeds 
of her child trust fund. But the form Ive seen and which she completed has those details on 
there. So the only evidence I have shows that the withdrawal form she filled in has bank 
details that OneFamily then used to pay the proceeds. Furthermore, OneFamily has said 
that the bank details which Miss B disputes she provided were matched to an account in her 
name  so there was no opportunity for OneFamily to discover there was any problem with 
the payment until Miss B raised it some weeks after the payment was made. 
Miss B, on the other hand, had two opportunities to query the payment. The first was the 
same day she provided her instructions, when OneFamily messaged her to confirm the 
details where the money would be sent to. I know she received this message because she 
supplied us with a copy of it. This was an important confirmation, as the payment had not yet 
been made and couldve been stopped. Ive seen no evidence that Miss B contacted 
OneFamily or took any action following that message. 
And then Miss B had a further opportunity when she was told, on 16 March, that the 
payment would be made to her within 5 working days. When Miss B didnt receive the 
money by 23 March 2022, she couldve raised her concerns at that point. Had she done this, 
its possible that OneFamilys trace and request for return of the funds may have had more 
chances of success. Instead Miss B didnt contact OneFamily until two weeks after she 
shouldve received the money. I can see that once she did this, OneFamily did what it could 
to try and trace the money for Miss B. Whilst I can see there was a minor delay between 26 
May 2022 and 1 June 2022 when OneFamily needed to resubmit the trace, Im not 
persuaded this delay had any impact on Miss Bs case. And so, to be clear, Im not awarding 
any compensation for that.  
Given these circumstances, Im not persuaded it would be fair and reasonable to hold 
OneFamily responsible for whats happened. Im satisfied it acted on Miss Bs instructions, 
and remitted the payment to the account details it was given. It followed its process by 
confirming Miss Bs instructions, including the account details that were to be used, and Im 
satisfied Miss B received this communication. Once Miss B made it aware that she had not 
received the money, Im satisfied it took appropriate actions to try and recover it for her, but 
to no avail. 
I acknowledge my decision will be disappointing for Miss B, but I hope she can understand 
the reasons Ive given for making it. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 August 2023.
