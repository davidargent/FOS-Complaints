The complaint
Miss S has complained that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) suspended her 
account without providing any reasons. 
What happened
Ms S told us that she had been using PayPal for many years and had opened a number of 
cases with them, providing full evidence for each of her claims. In each case the evidence 
was reviewed, and the case was closed in her favour. Miss S noticed on one case that she 
had her account limited for the return of a mattress and raised a complaint with PayPal who 
re-opened her claim and found in her favour. 
On 4 June 2021, PayPal suspended Miss S account without giving any reasons, other than 
to say theyd decided to not provide her with a service. Miss S felt that she was being 
discriminated against by PayPal refusing to provide her with a reason for no longer offering 
her an account. 
PayPal provided their final response to Miss S complaint on 7 June 2021. In summary, they 
said they were unable to re-instate Miss S account and explained why they were not able to 
give her the reasons for their decision to cease their business relationship with her. When 
providing their business file to us, PayPal said that the decision to cease offering Miss S an 
account with them had been made correctly and in line with the terms and conditions of the 
PayPal User Agreement. PayPal also explained that Miss S was given a warning on 
12 September 2020 regarding her account. 
On 3 November 2021, PayPal removed the limitation from Miss S account and reinstated 
their business relationship with her.
Our investigator issued her view not upholding the complaint on 4 November 2021. She 
concluded that PayPal was permitted, by its terms and conditions, to limit Miss S account 
without providing reasons. 
Miss S disagreed with the view and asked for an ombudsmans decision on her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have decided not to uphold it. I will explain why.
I understand Miss Ss frustration at having her account closed by PayPal without being told 
what led to PayPals decision to close her account. However, Im not able to share the 
information with Miss S that she wants to know. This is because PayPal shared its evidence 
with our service in confidence, which it is entitled to do under our rules. The rules allow me 
to summarise confidential evidence and I have considered whether I should do that here. But 
I dont think I could do that consistently with respecting the reason why the evidence has to 
remain confidential (which is to avoid disclosing information which might be helpful in 
evading or circumventing PayPals policies).
However, I have considered the evidence and I think that PayPal reached its decision to 
close Miss Ss account reasonably and in good faith. In doing so I also think it has acted in 
accordance with the terms and conditions which permit it to close an account without giving 
reasons. So, it follows that I dont agree PayPal has done anything wrong. 
PayPal had made a commercial decision to stop doing business with Miss S. She may feel; 
thats unjust but we cant interfere with PayPals commercial decision-making process  
thats up to them. Theyd decided to end the business relationship with Miss S and what 
theyd done is in line with the user Agreement and on that basis I cant say theyve done 
anything wrong. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 14 January 2022.
