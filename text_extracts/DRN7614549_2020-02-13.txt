Ms G complained that Uncle  Buck failed to identify that she had become  dependent  on 
payday loans  and was in a cycle of borrowing to repay other loans.
Our adjudicator felt that the complaint should be upheld in part. She didnt  feel that shed seen  
enough to say it was unfair for Uncle Buck to have provided loans 1, 2, 4 and 5 to Ms G. But 
she thought that for loan 3, Uncle Buck shouldve seen that Ms G was having money problems  
- and proportionate  checks  for loan 6 wouldve shown that she had multiple other  outstanding 
short term high cost loans. So Uncle  Buck shouldve realised it was unlikely Ms G would be 
able to repay this loan and any further  borrowing in a sustainable way. 
For these reasons, our adjudicator said Uncle Buck shouldnt have lent Ms G loans 3, 6, 7 
and 8. 
Following further discussion with our adjudicator, Uncle  Buck said it mostly agreed with what 
our adjudicator said and offered to refund loan 3 (including the 2 rollovers)  and also loan 6 
and loan 8. But Uncle Buck disagreed with our adjudicators view about loan 7.
Briefly, it said that when she took out loan 7, Ms G asked to borrow much  less than shed 
taken out previously on loan 6, and there  had been a gap of around 4 months between loans 
6 and 7. It also pointed to the fact that her income  by then had increased (up from just over 
£1000 per month to £1,400). 
And Uncle Buck said its checks showed no defaults or judgments, the total balance of her 
loans had reduced and it only saw evidence  of one other high cost loan on her credit file 
when she applied for loan 7. 
Ms G doesnt feel Uncle Bucks offer goes far enough to settle her complaint. So it comes to 
me to decide. 
Ref: DRN76145492my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms G 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable way. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Uncle Buck  was required to establish whether Ms G could sustainably repay her loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Gs complaint.
Ref: DRN76145493Like the adjudicator,  I think  the gap in lending between loan 3 and loan 4 was long enough 
for Uncle Buck reasonably to think that Ms G had put her finances in order  as it would seem 
that she hadnt been dependent  on high cost short term loans during this period. This meant 
that when Ms G applied  for loan 4 in June 2016, around eight months or so after shed paid 
loan 3, she was effectively starting  over.  So I think it was fair for Uncle Buck  to treat this as a 
new chain of borrowing  and assess  Ms Gs lending requests accordingly.
Ive taken into account what Uncle Buck says about the other gaps in lending. But I dont 
agree with Uncle Buck when it says that the gap between  loans  6 and 7 was sufficient to say 
this broke  the lending  chain again.  
So Im looking at two lending chains with loans  1 - 3 in chain 1 and loan 4 onwards making 
up chain 2.
I agree  with what our adjudicator said about  loans 1, 2, 4 and 5. I agree that there  isnt 
enough to say Uncle Buck shouldnt have provided these loans. And as Ms G hasnt raised  
any objection to the adjudicators recommendation in relation to these loans, I dont think  that 
I need to say more  about them.
Also, as Uncle Buck has agreed  to refund all interest and charges in line with our 
adjudicators recommendation in relation to loans 3, 6 and 8, I havent  considered  these 
further save to include  them  in the redress and as part of Ms Gs overall borrowing. 
So it appears that this just leaves loan 7 in dispute. 
By loan 7, Uncle Buck could see that Ms G had taken out the first loan in this lending  chain  
(loan 4) around  a year earlier.  So I think Uncle Buck shouldve realised that it was no longer 
reasonable to base  its lending decision on the information Ms G was providing.  I think  it 
wouldve been proportionate for Uncle Buck to have taken steps to look more  closely  at why 
she needed to keep on borrowing short term high cost loans that are intended to be a short  
term fix for use in an emergency or to cover  a one off expense. I think Uncle Buck should 
have specifically asked  more searching  questions  about Ms Gs other  short term lending.
If Uncle Buck had asked  more probing  questions about this, it wouldve  realised  that Ms G 
had been borrowing regularly from other  short term loan providers for some  time  and she 
had multiple other short term high cost loans outstanding when she asked  for loan 7 with 
Uncle Buck.  
I agree  with our adjudicator that the extent  of her active debt with other payday lenders when 
she asked Uncle Buck for loan 7 shouldve made Uncle Buck  realise that she was having  
money problems. 
To my mind the information  Uncle Buck had available if it had done proportionate checks  
suggested that Ms G was reliant on taking out expensive credit and it was unlikely  that she 
was going to be able to repay loan 7 in a sustainable way.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 7  in addition to those loans Uncle  Buck has 
already agreed  to uphold.
In coming to my decision, Ive taken into account  everything that Uncle Buck has said,  
including its response  to the adjudicators  view.  I appreciate that it may still disagree with this 
outcome. But I hope that setting things out as Ive done helps to explain my reasons.
Ref: DRN76145494putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
A)add together the total of the repayments  made  by Ms G towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 3, 6, 7 and 8, including payments made  to a third party where  
applicable, but not including anything already refunded 
B)calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by Ms G which  were  
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms G originally  made the payments, 
to the date the complaint  is settled.
C)pay Ms G the total of A plus B.
D)remove any adverse information Uncle Buck recorded on Ms Gs credit  file in relation to 
loans 3, 6, 7 and 8. 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Ms G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Ms Gs complaint about loans 3, 6, 7 and 8. 
Uncle Buck  Finance LLP should take the steps  Ive set out above to put things right.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 March  2020.
