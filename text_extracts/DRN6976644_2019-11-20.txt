Mr L complains  that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent irresponsibly 
to him.
background
Mr L took out a total of 12 loans with Sunny  between  September 2015 and September  2017.

1 19/09/2015 25/01/2016 £400.00
2 09/01/2016 25/01/2016 £250.00

9 21/04/2017 30/08/2017 £100.00
10 17/06/2017 30/06/2017 £100.00
11 21/07/2017 30/08/2017 £150.00
12 17/09/2017 29/09/2017 £300.00
Each of the loans  was due to be repaid in six monthly instalments. Mr L repaid all the loans 
in full. And he repaid most of them early. But Mr L believes that Sunny was irresponsible to 
lend to him. He says Sunny didnt  carry out sufficient affordability checks. And he says that 
he had to take out other short-term loans  in order to make his repayments to Sunny. So he 
got into a spiral of debt.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in part. In summary,  he 
didnt think Sunny had been wrong  to make the first five loans. But he thought that by the 
time Mr L applied for loan 6, Sunny should  have realised that Mr L had become reliant on 
short-term loans. So the adjudicator said Sunny  should refund the interest and charges that 
Mr L paid on loans  6 to 12, with interest on the refund. And he said that Sunny should 
remove all information about those loans from Mr Ls credit file.
Sunny didnt agree with the adjudicators  view,  so the complaints been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Ref: DRN69766442Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr L could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
Sunny did some checks before it lent to Mr L. It asked him for details  of his income, and his 
normal expenditure. And it checked  his credit  file before agreeing  the loans. Ive seen a 
summary of those checks and I dont  think they showed anything  that should  have caused 
additional concerns to Sunny.
As I mentioned earlier each of Mr Ls loans was repayable  over a six month period. So the 
amounts that Mr L needed to repay each time were smaller than if hed taken a normal 
payday loan. But of course he was committing to making those repayments over a 
significantly longer  period.  And at times Mr L had a number  of loans outstanding together. 
So Ive needed  to consider the total amount that Mr L needed to repay  to Sunny each month.
Ref: DRN69766443I think the fact that Mr L typically repaid his loans  much  earlier  than planned should have 
caused some concern  to Sunny. That sort of behaviour might indicate that a borrower was 
having problems  managing their money, and needing to refinance loans on a regular basis. 
So Ive also taken  that into account when  looking  at whether Sunny should  have  given the 
loans to Mr L.
I think that the checks Sunny did before agreeing  the first four loans were proportionate. The 
amounts that Mr L needed to repay were relatively  small  compared with the disposable 
income hed declared.  In view of the repayment  amounts, the information Sunny had about 
Mr Ls circumstances at the time, and his borrowing history with Sunny, I dont think it would 
have been proportionate  for Sunny to ask him for the amount of information that would have 
been needed to show that Mr Ls borrowing was unsustainable before agreeing the first four 
loans.
Ive borne in mind that when Mr L applied  for loan 5, he hadnt had a loan outstanding with 
Sunny for more  than three months. But this was the fifth loan Mr L had applied to Sunny for 
in less than a year. And as Ive commented  above,  the fact that Mr L had repaid his first four 
loans early should have caused  Sunny to consider whether Mr L was having problems 
managing his money. And it should  have realised that it might not be able to rely safely  on 
the information Mr L was providing  about his finances.  So I think  Sunny ought to have taken 
steps to independently  check  the true state  of Mr Ls finances.
We asked Mr L for copies of his bank statements so that we could see what  better steps  
would have shown  Sunny.  But he didnt  provide  these to us. So Im not able to say that 
better checks would  have shown Sunny that it shouldnt have given loan 5 to Mr L.
But Mr L applied for loan 6 less than two weeks after hed repaid loan 5. And hed repaid 
loan 5 less than a month  after hed taken it out. By this time, it was around a year since Mr L 
had taken his first loan with Sunny.  And during that year,  thered only been two breaks  in his 
borrowing. I acknowledge that one of the breaks  was for around 3.5 months. But I dont think  
that was long enough to give Sunny reasonable confidence  that Mr Ls finances  had got onto 
a more stable  footing. Ive also borne in mind that loan 6 was for the same amount as the 
loan Mr L had just repaid.  So there was no indication that Mr L was making any inroads into 
his borrowing.
So taking everything into account, I think Sunny should have realised that further  borrowing  
was likely to be unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful, for Mr L. And it should  have refused to 
lend further to him.
I think that Mr L lost out because Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ls ability  
to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN69766444I acknowledge  that Sunny has said that Mr Ls declared income compared to his monthly 
repayment suggests these loans were  suitable. So it doesnt  accept that the loans provided 
were unaffordable.  But Sunny will know from previous decisions (as well as whats  set out on 
our website) that there are cases where  this service considers  the overall lending pattern 
and not just the affordability of each loan. When a consumer borrows  numerous loans over a 
long period of time,  its most likely that the loans arent being  used  for their intended purpose 
of temporary cash  flow problems. As Sunny will have seen, the FCA made it clear in a recent 
letter to CEOs of high cost lending  firms  that a high volume  of relending..may be 
symptomatic of unsustainable lending patterns. And I think  thats the case  here.
So I dont  think  Sunny  should  have agreed to lend to Mr L from loan 6 onwards. This means  
that Sunny needs to pay Mr L some compensation.
putting things right
I dont think Sunny should  have agreed to lend to Mr L after, and including, the loan he was 
given on 11 September 2016 (loan  6). So for each of those loans Sunny should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr L on the loans.
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each of these amounts from the date 
they were  paid to the date of settlement*.
The number  of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse. So all entries about  loans  6 to 12 should  be removed from Mr Ls credit 
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires  Sunny  to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. I require Elevate Credit  International 
Limited (trading as Sunny) to put things right by doing as Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 December  2019.
