K821x#15complaint
Mr L has complained  that AXA Insurance UK Plc took too long to deal with a theft claim he 
made under his car insurance policy. 
background
Mr Ls house was burgled in November 2017  and one of the items stolen was a safe. Two 
days later his car was stolen. Mr L said that he realised hed kept the spare  key for his car in 
the safe. As he didnt have any need  to use the spare key since he bought his car  and with 
the upset of being burgled  Mr L didnt  recall this at the time of the burglary.
AXA investigated Mr Ls claim. It requested a copy of the police report. Mr Ls car was 
recovered in December 2017 but required repair, so AXA arranged for it to be kept in 
storage. Mr L regularly chased AXA for an update. 
In April 2018 Mr L complained to AXA about  how long it was taking to deal with his claim. 
Mr L said he was paying over £300  a month  for finance for his car and was using his 
daughters car to get around. Mr L said hed paid his daughter £200 a month toward the 
finance and running costs  for her car while he shared the use of it.
AXA acknowledged Mr Ls complaint  but didnt reply to it. So in June  2018  he contacted 
us. 
In August  2018  our adjudicator asked AXA if it was dealing with the repairs  to Mr Ls car as 
priority  but she didnt  receive a reply. 
In August  2018  the adjudicator recommended Mr Ls complaint should be upheld. She said 
the file showed that AXA had received a copy of the police  report on 23 February 2018. So 
she thought AXA was in a position to deal with Mr Ls claim then: either  by arranging repairs  
to his car or dealing with the claim as a total loss settlement if his car wasnt economical to 
repair.
Our adjudicator kept in mind  our approach to loss of use  and thought AXA should pay Mr L 
£200 a month from 23 February 2018 to the date Mr L either  receives his car back  repaired  
or payment for the market value for his car. And she recommended AXA pay interest on this 
amount at 8% simple interest a year. The adjudicator also recommended AXA pay Mr L 
£300 compensation for the distress and inconvenience it caused Mr L. 
Mr L accepted  the adjudicators view. AXA initially accepted  subject to proof  Mr L paid his 
daughter £200  a month. 
Mr L explained that he paid his daughter in cash so he didnt have  any proof.
AXA then changed  its mind and didnt accept  the adjudicators view. It said it received  the 
police report in February 2018  but couldnt open  it, so actually reviewed it in April 2018. 
It decided in July 2018 to accept Mr Ls claim.  But it said the approved  repairer tried to 
contact Mr L but wasnt  able to speak with him. It said without proof Mr L made payments to 
his daughter, it wasnt prepared to cover these costs. 
Ref: DRN86816222In September  2018 Mr L told us he contacted the approved  repairer. It told him it was waiting 
for AXA to authorise  the release of his car from storage. Mr L  and our adjudicator   
contacted AXA in September and October  2018 for an update  on the repairs to Mr Ls car. 
On 25 October 2018 Mr L provided us with a copy of an email from AXA dated  24 October 
2018 authorising the repairs to his car. Mr L said he collected his repaired car on 29 
November 2018.  
Mr L said he wasnt provided with a courtesy car while his car was repaired. He said he 
returned his car to the lease provider  in December 2018. 
So the case has been passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I intend  to uphold it. 
AXA received the police report on 23 February  2018. But it didnt review  it until after 7 April 
2018. AXA seems  to have accepted it was responsible for this delay  as it wrote the following 
in an internal email:
The only part I feel is justifiable on his part is the delay in us reviewing the police 
report. I understand that due to the encryption  and password issue we arent able to 
review it straightaway however as we got the report on the 23/02/2016  (AXAs  typing  
error as should read 2018) and its now the 07/04/2018 and it still hasnt been 
resolved we will have  to put our hands up to this delay. 
Is there  anyway we can get round  this encryption/password issue  any quicker now in 
order to move the claim on at all? I can see that you have attempted to get around 
this on the 26/03/2018  and requested access from the police but as there are no 
further updates on the claim since is it possible to review and chase again please 
and also update the policyholder accordingly.
Over a month after AXA reviewed the police report - on 9 May 2018 - it decided  to contact 
his home  insurance  provider for further information.  However, it didnt receive a reply and on 
7 July 2018 its notes show that AXA accepted  it had- by this stage  taken too long to deal 
with Mr Ls claim. It made the decision to settle Mr Ls claim.
At the same time AXA provided us with its file to look at Mr Ls complaint. 
AXA said the approved repairer tried to contact  Mr L in July 2018  to arrange repairs for his 
car. I havent  seen  any evidence of the repairers attempts to contact Mr L. Mr Ls account is 
different and suggests the repairer  needed  further paperwork from AXA before it could 
arrange collection of Mr Ls car from storage to repair it.
In any event, given  how long AXA had taken to deal with Mr Ls claim, I think it should have 
done more by contacting  Mr L and following up on the repairs to prevent further delay. 
However, AXA told us it closed Mr Ls file in error in July 2018. It didnt reply to our 
adjudicators requests  for an update on the repairs to Mr Ls car in August 2018, September 
and October 2018.  
Ref: DRN86816223Based on what Mr L has told us, his car was repaired and returned  to him on 29 November 
2018. He said the offer of a courtesy car for the duration of repairs  was never discussed with 
him. This means that Mr L was without his car for over a year. AXA chased for the police 
report until it received it on 23 February 2018. So I think AXA was in a position to reach a 
decision to deal with Mr Ls theft claim at this point. According to its notes,  the police report 
supported what Mr L told AXA in November 2017  when  he reported the theft of his car. 
Overall I think  AXAs  handling of Mr Ls claim has been very poor and taken far too long to 
settle. I think Mr L tried to mitigate  his circumstances by using his daughters  car. And as I 
think AXA is responsible  for the delay from 23 February 2018 to 29 November 2018, I think  it 
should cover  the costs  Mr L said he paid to his daughter at £200  a month from this date. 
Mr L said he paid his daughter in cash. Our approach to loss of use  which  applies in this 
case  is that an insurer  should reimburse  a customer  a daily rate of £10 a day. So because 
Mr L used his daughters  car, he mitigated his loss to less than what  we would otherwise 
recommend. For this reason, I think AXA should pay Mr L £200  a month from 23 February 
2018 to 29 November 2018  with interest.  
And I think AXA should pay Mr L £300 compensation for the poor service  and delays  it 
caused in handling Mr Ls claim. Throughout  this claim, Mr L has regularly chased  AXA for 
updates. And even  taking into account the repair time of up to a month, he was without the 
enjoyment and use of his car for eight months  which I think AXA is responsible  for. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given above,  my final decision is that I uphold  this complaint. I require 
AXA Insurance UK Plc to do the following:
Reimburse Mr L £200 a month from 23 February  2018  to 29 November  2018  
inclusive. 
Pay interest on these  amounts  from 23rd of each month from February 2018 until 
the date it pays  Mr L. The interest  rate applied should be 8% simple  interest  a 
year. 
Pay Mr L £300 compensation for the distress and inconvenience its caused  him. 
AXA Insurance UK Plc must pay the compensation within  28 days of the date on which  we 
tell it Mr L accepts my final decision. If it pays later than this it must also pay interest on the 
compensation from the date of my final decision to the date of payment at a simple  rate of 
8% a year.
Ref: DRN86816224If AXA Insurance UK Plc considers that its required by HM Revenue  & Customs to withhold 
income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr L how much its taken off. It should also give 
Mr L a tax deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM 
Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 September 2019.
