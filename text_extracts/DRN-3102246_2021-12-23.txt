The complaint
Mr H complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) closed his credit card account and charged him 
interest during payment holidays.
What happened
Mr H had a marbles loan and credit card from NewDay. The loan was for £2,400 payable 
over 24 months and was repaid. The credit card was opened in July 2016 and in September 
2020 had a limit of £3,700. Mr H told NewDay he was in financial difficulty and they agreed 
to several payment holidays on the credit card:
Date Period of Payment 
Holiday agreedReduced Monthly 
Payment AmountInterest/fees
February 2020 6 months £48 Zero
August 2020 3 months £48 Zero
January 2021 To May 2021 None required Zero
May 2021 To September 2021 None required Zero
 
In January 2021, NewDay refunded interest of £90.80 and paid compensation of £75. In 
October 2021, Mr H told us he was charged £76.59.
Mr H complained to NewDay in July 2020 about the possible irresponsible lending in 
connection with the marbles loan (which had been repaid by then). Mr H told us that he 
accepted the final response from NewDay about that complaint. But - after he complained 
NewDay cancelled his credit card  so he couldnt use it for purchases. He said - that was 
inconvenient and it wasnt fair- it shouldnt be cancelled just because he complained. He said 
he was told he wouldnt have to pay interest during payment holidays, but interest was being 
debited to his account. 
NewDay said they were entitled to cancel Mr Hs credit card  as this was part of their 
commitment to irresponsible lending. Theyd advised him of this in their final responses in 
December 2020, January 2021, and February 2021. In May 2021, they confirmed theyd 
agreed to a final payment holiday which was to expire on 4 September 2021. During the 
payment holiday, interest wouldnt be charged, but it would start again when it ran out. They 
agreed that theyd wrongly charged interest in December 2020  when Mr H was in the 
period of a payment holiday and refunded the interest of £90.80 and paid compensation of 
£75 for that.
Mr H brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Mr H shouldnt have been charged 
interest in December 2020 as he was in an agreed payment holiday. But NewDay had dealt 
with the refund of interest of £90.80 in January 2021  so that was fair. Going forward 
beyond the payment holidays, it was reasonable that NewDay then charge interest and fees 
as they had ended. Therefore, Mr Hs accounts could be run in accordance with the terms 
and conditions  which included the charging of interest. On the account closure, NewDays 
terms and conditions said they could close accounts if they wished, but they had to give two 
months notice  which they hadnt. This had caused some inconvenience to Mr H  as he 
lost a source of credit just before Christmas. She recommended a payment of £100 for that.
NewDay accepted that recommendation, but Mr H didnt. He said he was being charged 
interest - £76.50 was on his statement in October 2021. He asked that an ombudsman look 
at his complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There are two aspects to Mr Hs complaint 1) the charging of interest on his credit card 
account and 2) the cancellation of his credit card after he complained in July 2020. Im not 
looking whether the marbles loan and increases in the credit card limits were irresponsible or 
not  as Mr H told us that he was satisfied with NewDays response on that complaint.
Interest charged on Mr Hs credit card: NewDay agreed four payment holidays between 
February 2020 and May 2021  with the last one expiring in September 2021. As part of 
these, Mr H didnt pay any interest or fees, and had reduced minimum monthly payments, or 
no monthly payments. NewDay agreed to these as Mr H was in financial difficulty  as part 
of their role as responsible lenders. But I can see in their final response in May 2021 that 
they said to Mr H: As an exception, it was agreed that your payment holiday would be 
applied. The payment holiday will expire on 4 September 2021. Interest will not be 
charged for the duration of the payment holiday, and you are not required to make any 
payment. Please be advised, interest will be chargeable thereafter as per the terms and 
conditions of your credit agreement. I think this is clear  NewDay wont agree to a further 
payment holiday after September 2021, and therefore interest and fees will apply after then. 
It looks like thats why interest of £76.50 was applied in October 2021. Given that Mr H has 
had interest-free borrowing for 21 months (since February 2020)  it seems reasonable that 
NewDay should take this view. I think it also means that Mr H will need to recommence his 
contractual monthly payments from then. 
However, NewDay are still obliged to consider whether they wish to agree to another 
payment holiday - if Mr H asks for another one. This will depend on Mr Hs circumstances. 
He will have to discuss this with NewDay  and detail his current circumstances, including 
his income and expenditure. And  it is for NewDay to agree to this if they wish to. 
Cancellation of Mr Hs credit card:  I can see that NewDay said theyd do this when they 
wrote to Mr H in December 2020, again in January 2021 and February 2021. They said 
Please be advised that as part of our responsible lending policy, when a customer raises a 
complaint in relation to affordability to avoid placing them further into financial difficulty, we 
are required to close all other accounts they hold with NewDay. So  they were clear about 
their intentions. And  if a business wishes to take that course of action they can do  its 
their commercial decision. But  I agree that in line with their terms and conditions, they 
should give two months notice of that  and apart from what these say, it seems only 
reasonable and fair that they should. And because they didnt on this occasion, 
NewDay should pay compensation of £100 to Mr H. I note that Mr Hs card remains 
cancelled  and so he is making payments to reduce the balance, without making any 
purchases. NewDay have said to us that Mr Hs card must remained cancelled from now on  and 
again, thats their commercial decision to make  and I cant tell them to change that.
Putting things right
Because NewDay didnt give Mr H two months notice of the cancellation of his card and for 
the inconvenience this caused him  they should pay compensation of £100 to Mr H.  
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. NewDay Ltd must:
Pay compensation of £100 to Mr H for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 January 2022.
