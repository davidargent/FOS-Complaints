The complaint
Miss S complains that Somerset Bridge Insurance Services Limited mishandled her motor
insurance policy.
Where I refer to Somerset Bridge, I include employees and others insofar as I hold Somerset
Bridge responsible for their acts or omissions. 
What happened
Somerset Bridge acted as an intermediary between Miss S and an insurance company. She
wanted to pay for her insurance on credit, so Somerset Bridge also acted as an intermediary
between Miss S and a finance company.
On about 14 November 2020, Miss S took out an insurance policy. On about 16 November
2020, Miss S entered into a loan agreement with the finance company. She agreed to pay
instalments, starting on 30 November 2020 with an instalment of £175.61.
On 27 November 2020, Miss S contacted Somerset Bridge to cancel her insurance. But the
finance company took the first instalment. It didnt receive notification about the cancellation
until 5 December 2020.
Miss S complained to Somerset Bridge about the amount charged. Somerset Bridge passed
that complaint to the finance company, which sent a final response dated 24 February 2021.
Miss S brought to us a complaint against the finance company. Our investigator didnt
recommend that it should be upheld.
We then investigated her complaint against Somerset Bridge.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. She recommended that,
unless Somerset Bridge could provide a statement from the finance company which
supports that Somerset Bridge was not able to instigate the cancelation via its portal or by
contacting them directly, Somerset Bridge should reimburse the interest Miss S accrued for
the 5 days delay it took to tell the finance company to cancel the agreement.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Miss S 
and to Somerset Bridge on 2 March 2022. I summarise my findings:
I hadnt seen enough evidence to show how the finance company calculated its 
figures. So there wasnt enough evidence that the finance company charged interest 
for the period up to 5 December 2020. And there wasnt enough evidence that 
Somerset Bridge caused the interest to be higher than it wouldve been on 27 
November 2020.
Subject to any further information from Miss S or from Somerset Bridge, my provisional 
decision was to not uphold this complaint. I didnt intend to direct Somerset Bridge Insurance 
Services Limited to do any more in response to this complaint.
Miss S hasnt responded to the provisional decision.
Somerset Bridge acknowledged receipt of the provisional decision and said it had no further 
information to provide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
From the finance agreement, I see that the cash price wouldve been £1,819.07, Miss S
had paid an advance payment or deposit of £181.91 and the balance of the loan was
£1,637.16. In addition to the deposit, she agreed to pay eleven instalments of £175.61
(£1,931.71). The total amount payable (deposit plus instalments) was £2,113.62. If I deduct
the cash price of £1,819.07, that suggests that the interest was going to be £294.55.
Somerset Bridge says that the credits and debits were as follows:
Credits Debits
Deposit paid by Miss S £181.91
Instalment paid by Miss S £175.61
Refund of brokers fee £    6.06
Sub-total £363.58
Insurers charge for time on cover £  69.07
Finance company interest £  90.03
Finance fee £    5.00
Cancellation fee £  35.00
Sub-total £199.10
Refunded to Miss S £164.48
The insurers charge for time on cover isnt usually within the control of an intermediary. So I
dont find that Somerset Bridge was responsible for that charge. And in any event, the figure
of £69.07 seems proportionate to 14 days on cover.
The finance company told us it didnt recognise the figure of £90.03. Somerset Bridge hasnt
shown us how it calculated that figure.
The finance company has shown us a screenshot that shows the following:
starting balance £1,931.71
first instalment £   175.61
ROPCB £   204.52
ROP £1,551.58
Closing balance £       0.00
I think the initials ROP mean return of premium. They were credits on cancellation on 5
December 2020 totalling £1,756.10. So - on the face of it - the finance company recovered
the full amount of its loan including interest of £294.55.But in the circumstances, I find it more likely that  of its intended interest of £294.55 - the
finance companys figure of £204.52 was for interest it was no longer going to charge. The
difference is the figure of £90.03.
However, I havent seen enough evidence to show how the finance company calculated its
figures. So there isnt enough evidence that the finance company charged interest for the
period up to 5 December 2020. And there isnt enough evidence that Somerset Bridge
caused the interest to be higher than it wouldve been on 27 November 2020.
I find it likely that the finance fee of £5.00 was non-refundable in line with Somerset Bridges
terms of business.
Miss S didnt complain about the cancellation fee of £35.00. So I find it likely that it was in
line with Somerset Bridges terms of business. In any event I find it proportionate to the work
involved in cancelling the policy.
Overall, I can see why Miss S feels that Somerset Bridge caused delay and increased
charges. But I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Somerset Bridge to make any further 
refund or compensate her for any financial loss.
Ive thought about compensation for distress and inconvenience. But  in answer to our
standard form question about how shed been affected financially or otherwise  Miss S
answered not much. So I wont direct Somerset Bridge to pay compensation for distress 
and inconvenience.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Somerset Bridge Insurance Services Limited to do any more in response to this 
complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 May 2022.
