K821x#15complaint
Miss W complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) gave her loans that she 
couldnt afford to repay.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in the provisional decision I issued in 
December 2018.  An extract  from this is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I will 
not repeat  that information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to uphold some of the complaint. 
I invited both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. Both Miss W and 
QuickQuid have responded to me. Although I am only summarising  here what they have 
said, I have considered their entire responses  carefully before writing this decision.
Miss W has noted my provisional  decision.  She has expressed concern that the initial  letter 
that QuickQuid sent to her in response  to her complaint  said her income was far higher than 
what shed declared  to the lender.  And she noted  that she had by now repaid a large  
proportion of the outstanding balance on her final loan. So she asked that this was taken into 
consideration when assessing the compensation that was due to her.
QuickQuid has said that it remains unable to accept my findings relating to loans that were 
funded after March 2015 when it changed  its lending practices. It has provided me with 
some additional  information showing that it compared the credit  commitments that Miss W 
declared with those reported by a credit reference agency (CRA). And it says it then used 
the higher of those figures when  calculating how much disposable income  Miss W had. It 
says that it had no reason to think Miss W wouldnt be able to repay  the loans or to have  
known about her gambling  expenditure.
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly I want to reassure Miss W that in reaching my decision I have used what  she 
considers to be her correct income  at the time. I can see that QuickQuid did quote a much  
higher amount in its initial letter to her. But the incorrect amount wasnt  reflected in the 
information it sent to us, or in the information  QuickQuid appears to have held about Miss W. 
I can only assume that it made a typographical error when issuing  its response  to Miss Ws 
complaint. And I will also slightly amend the redress that I am telling QuickQuid to pay to 
reflect the additional repayments  that Miss W says she has made on the final loan.
I have thought about the additional  information  QuickQuid has sent to us. In my provisional 
decision I said that I thought QuickQuid should have decided, by loan 4, that it was no longer 
reasonable to rely on the information Miss W was providing about her finances. And I think 
what QuickQuid has sent us only reinforces that point. QuickQuid has said that at the time of 
loan 4 Miss W said she was spending £50 each  month on other credit  commitments,  
whereas the information it received from the CRA suggested she was spending over £300. 
I think that difference alone might have  suggested to QuickQuid that the information Miss W 
was providing about  her other expenditure might  have been unreliable.
Ref: DRN97711682I think it would also be reasonable to note that this matter has been covered by the 
Financial Conduct  Authority which was the regulator at the time Miss W borrowed from 
QuickQuid. Its regulations for lenders are set out in its consumer  credit  sourcebook  
(generally referred to as CONC) and say in relation to this;
A firm must not accept an application for credit under  a regulated  credit  agreement 
where the firm knows or has reasonable cause  to suspect that the customer has not 
been truthful in completing the application in relation to information relevant to the 
creditworthiness assessment.
An example  of when a firm has reasonable cause to suspect that the customer has 
not been truthful may be where information  supplied by the customer concerning 
income or employment  status is clearly  inconsistent with other information of which 
the firm is aware
So, at the very least, I think QuickQuid needed  to do better  checks before loans 4 and 5. 
And better checks would  have shown Miss W couldnt afford the repayments in a sustainable 
manner. So I dont  think QuickQuid should have given these two loans to Miss W. QuickQuid 
needs to pay her some compensation.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to give Miss W loans 4 and 5. So for each of 
those loans QuickQuid  should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Miss W on the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Ws credit file in relation to the loans.
Miss W may still owe Quick Quid some of the principal balance  she borrowed on her final 
loan. If that is the case Quick Quid may use the compensation that is due to her to reduce or 
clear that balance. But, to be clear,  that outstanding balance  should be recalculated to 
remove any interest and charges, but taking account  of any repayments  Miss W has made  
on that loan as though  they were  applied against the principal sums borrowed. 
If an outstanding  balance remains, QuickQuid should endeavour to agree a repayment 
schedule with Miss W that is affordable for her bearing in mind the need to continue  to treat 
her positively and sympathetically  in those discussions. Or otherwise QuickQuid should 
refund any excess compensation to Miss W directly.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Ws complaint and direct CashEuroNet  UK LLC to put 
things right as detailed above.  Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im 
required to ask Miss W to accept or reject my decision before 4 February 2019.

complaint
Miss W complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid)  gave her loans that she couldnt  
afford to repay.
background
Miss W was given five loans  by QuickQuid between May 2016 and May 2017. Miss W also topped up 
her final loan by taking  some  additional borrowing around a week later. Each of the loans was 
repayable in two or more  instalments, with the initial repayments  consisting of interest only,  before the 
principal borrowed and further  interest was repaid on the final repayment. So the final repayment of 
the loan was usually much  larger than those earlier  on. 
Miss W repaid her first four loans as planned but at the time of making her complaint she had only 
repaid part of her final loan leaving a balance outstanding.  A summary of Miss Ws borrowing from 
QuickQuid is as follows;
Loan 
NumberBorrowing Date Repayment  DateLoan  Amount 
(inc Top-Up)  
1 07/05/2016 28/07/2016 £ 300
2 27/10/2016 23/12/2016 £ 150
3 13/02/2017 28/03/2017 £ 100
4 01/04/2017 01/05/2017 £ 300
5 21/05/2017 - £ 550
Miss Ws complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think  that the checks  
QuickQuid had done  before any of the loans had been sufficient.  And he thought  that better  checks  
would have shown QuickQuid that Miss W couldnt afford to repay the loans.  So he asked QuickQuid  
to pay Miss W some  compensation.
QuickQuid didnt agree  with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved informally,  it 
has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and 
good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
QuickQuid was required to lend responsibly.  It needed to make checks  to see whether Miss W could 
afford to pay back each  loan before it lent to her. Those checks needed  to be proportionate to things 
such as the amount Miss W was borrowing,  and her lending history, but there was no set list of 
checks QuickQuid had to do.
The Financial Conduct  Authority was the regulator at the time Miss W borrowed from QuickQuid.  Its 
regulations for lenders  are set out in its consumer credit sourcebook (generally referred  to as 
CONC). These  regulations  require lenders to take reasonable steps to assess  the customer's  ability  
to meet repayments under  a regulated credit  agreement in a sustainable manner without  the 
customer incurring financial difficulties  or experiencing significant adverse consequences.   They  
define sustainable as being  able to make repayments without undue difficulty.  And explain that this 
Ref: DRN97711685means borrowers should be able to make their repayments on time and out of their income and 
savings without  having  to borrow to meet  these  repayments. 
So, the fact that the amounts  borrowed and the interest paid might have been low in comparison with 
Miss Ws income,  or that she managed to repay most of the loans in full and on time,  doesnt 
necessarily mean the loans  were affordable for her and that she managed to repay them in a 
sustainable manner. In other words I cant assume that because Miss W managed to repay most of 
her loans that she was able to do so out of her normal means without having to borrow further.  
QuickQuid has told us about  the checks it did before lending to Miss W. Before  each loan it asked her 
for details of her income and normal  expenditure. It then validated this information against her credit 
file and other  data sources, amending the information Miss W provided where  it appeared  to be an 
underestimate. And it did further checks on Miss Ws credit file before each of the loans.  QuickQuid 
hasnt been able to give us all the results of those checks but Im not aware  of anything  on her credit 
file that is likely to have  caused additional concerns to the lender.  I am aware there was some 
negative information on Miss Ws credit  file relating to things that happened in 2012, but I think 
sufficient time had passed  for these  defaults  to not worry QuickQuid.
I think  that the checks QuickQuid  did before agreeing the first loan were sufficient. This was the first 
time Miss W had borrowed from the lender. And as Ive said earlier its credit checks are unlikely to 
have shown any recent  issues of concern. But I have thought carefully about  the size of the final 
repayment that Miss W needed to make on this loan, just less than three months after shed taken  it.
When responding  to this complaint QuickQuid has said it considered the total amount Miss W needed 
to repay over the entire length of the loan, and compared this to her total disposable  income for that 
period. So in effect it is saying  that Miss W could  have saved  some disposable  income in the first 
two months to put towards her final repayment.
The largest  repayment that Miss W needed to make on her first loan was more  than the disposable  
income that QuickQuid had estimated based on the information shed provided. But this was the first 
loan that shed taken  from QuickQuid and it had explained to her that she might need to use some  of 
her excess disposable income  in the first two months to help meet her final repayment.  In the specific 
circumstances here I think that was reasonable. QuickQuid didnt have any reason  to think Miss Ws 
finances were  under  significant pressure  it was entirely reasonable that she might be facing  an 
unexpected expense, hence the reason for her loan request. And the additional  amount she needed  
to save in order to make  the final repayment  affordable  was relatively  modest.
So I dont think QuickQuid was wrong to give the first loan to Miss W.
Miss W repaid her first loan as planned. There was then a gap of almost three months before  Miss W 
asked to borrow again.  And the amount  she asked  to borrow was much smaller than before. So once 
again I think  that the checks QuickQuid did here were proportionate.  And the information  that Miss W 
provided suggested that even the larger final repayment was affordable for her. I dont think 
QuickQuid was wrong to give this loan to her either.
There was then another gap of almost two months between  Miss W repaying  her second loan and 
asking for a third. Although I think that by now QuickQuid should have started  to become concerned 
at the regular  nature of Miss Ws borrowing  requests, I dont think  there was enough  to make me think 
it wasnt reasonable  for the lender to continue to rely on the information Miss W had provided.
Once again  that information suggested that each  of the repayments Miss W needed to make on the 
loan were affordable.  I think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid  to provide  this loan to Miss W too.
Ref: DRN97711686But within a couple of days of repaying  her third loan,  Miss W asked to borrow  again. And the amount 
she asked to borrow was significantly larger. I think by now QuickQuid should  have realised there was 
a real possibility that Miss W was relying on its lending  to make ends meet. I think  it should have  
decided that it was no longer  reasonable  to rely on the information  Miss W was providing  about her 
finances. By now it would have been proportionate for QuickQuid  to independently verify the true 
state of Miss Ws finances.
And I think the same applies to the final loan Miss W took. She repaid  her fourth  loan much earlier 
than planned. And just three weeks later she asked to borrow again. The amount Miss W asked  to 
borrow was much larger again and she topped up that loan just a week later.  I think  this behaviour  
should have indicated to QuickQuid that Miss Ws finances were  most likely  under  significant  
pressure.
But although  I dont  think the checks QuickQuid did before agreeing loans 4 and 5 were  sufficient, that 
in itself doesnt mean that Miss Ws complaint should succeed. Id also need to be persuaded  that 
what I consider  to be proportionate checks would  have  shown QuickQuid that Miss W couldnt 
sustainably afford those  loans. So Ive looked at Miss Ws bank statements,  and what shes told us 
about her financial situation, to see what better checks would have shown QuickQuid.
From looking  at Miss Ws bank statements  it is clear  that she was unable to sustainably afford  any 
additional lending. She was already borrowing  heavily  from a number of other short term lenders. And 
she was using  that money  to spend ever increasing  amounts on what  appear to be online  gambling 
transactions. So I think better checks would  have  shown  QuickQuid that Miss W couldnt afford  loans 
4 or 5 and it shouldnt  have lent to her.
I have considered what QuickQuid says about its checks being improved  after it became regulated by 
the FCA. But here I dont think proportionate  checks  for loans 4 and 5 could reasonably  rely on 
information provided  by Miss W. I think the information  about  Miss Ws finances, given the length and 
increasing nature of her borrowing  needed  to be independently verified.
And similarly whilst I accept  that Miss Ws financial position was much the same for loans 1 to 3 as it 
was for loans 4 and 5 I dont  think that was something that QuickQuid  would have known about from 
proportionate checks. At that time I think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to rely on the information 
Miss W had provided  and she didnt  tell QuickQuid about either her gambling expenditure  or 
reliance on other  short term lending.
In summary, I think the checks QuickQuid did before agreeing loans 1 to 3 were sufficient and 
suggested that Miss W could afford to repay them. But I think QuickQuid needed  to do better  checks 
before loans  4 and 5 and they would have suggested Miss W couldnt afford the repayments in a 
sustainable manner. So I dont think QuickQuid should have given  these  loans to Miss W. QuickQuid  
needs to pay her some  compensation .
