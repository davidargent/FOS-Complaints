K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid)  lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mr G was given 22 loans  by QuickQuid between December 2011 and January 2014. Two of 
the loans were topped up by taking some  additional  borrowing shortly after the original loan. 
The final loan was a FlexCredit loan that provided Mr G with a revolving credit  facility. All of 
Mr Gs loans have been fully repaid and a summary  of his borrowing from QuickQuid is 
shown as an appendix to this decision.
QuickQuid has said that it thinks Mr Gs complaint about the first two loans has been  made  
too late. So Mr G has agreed that those loans shouldnt form part of his complaint. So I wont 
make any findings in relation to the first two loans  in this decision,  though  I will take account 
of them  when considering the extent of Mr Gs relationship with QuickQuid.
When Mr G first complained to QuickQuid it offered to refund the late fees he had paid on 
two of the loans.  But it didnt agree that it shouldnt have given any of the loans to him. Mr G 
didnt accept that offer so he brought his complaint to the Service.  Before we started  to 
consider the complaint QuickQuid made a further  offer to Mr G  it offered  to refund the 
interest and charges that hed paid on five of the loans. Mr G also declined  that offer.
So Mr Gs complaint has been assessed  by one of our adjudicators. She didnt  think that 
QuickQuid should  have agreed  to lend to Mr G after, and including, his fifth loan. So she 
asked QuickQuid to pay some compensation to Mr G.
QuickQuid didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mr G accepts  my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr G could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN23668092But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading guidance on Irresponsible Lending 
defines sustainable as being  without undue difficulties and in particular the customer  should  
be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well 
as without having to borrow to meet the repayments.  And it follows  that a lender should 
realise, or it ought  fairly  and reasonably  to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make 
their repayments sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
The repayments that Mr G needed to make  on loans 3 and 4 were relatively modest  
compared to the income that he declared  to QuickQuid. So given Mr Gs repayment 
amounts, what was apparent about his circumstances at the time, and his history with the 
lender, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask him for the amount 
of information  that would be needed  to show the lending  was unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr G provided or the information  QuickQuid 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying.  So I dont  think QuickQuid was wrong to give these  two loans to Mr G.
But only two days passed between Mr G repaying  loan 4 and him asking to borrow  again. 
The amount  that he asked  to borrow was significantly higher than his previous  loans and by 
that time he was borrowing over half his declared  income from QuickQuid.
Ref: DRN23668093I think by that stage QuickQuid should  have realised that it was likely  Mr Gs finances  were 
under strain, and that he was most  likely borrowing to support his day to day living  costs  and 
debt repayments  rather than for a one-off emergency. I dont think  it was reasonable for 
QuickQuid to conclude  here that Mr G would be able to repay his loan in a sustainable 
manner. 
And I think the same thing  applies to the next loan. I accept there  was a gap of just over 
three months before Mr G asked to borrow again. But this was now his sixth loan request in 
as many months. And the amount he asked to borrow meant that his repayment would be 
more than half his declared income. I dont think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to 
conclude that Mr G would be able to repay this loan in a sustainable manner either. 
Ive also considered the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr G. I think by 
loan 7 the lender should reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  provide any 
further loans.  
I say this because:
Although there had been a gap of just under two months between Mr G repaying 
loan 6 and asking to borrow again, I dont think it would have been  reasonable for 
QuickQuid to conclude  this was an indication that Mr Gs finances had moved on 
from whatever situation had required  his previous loans.  
By the time Mr G asked for loan 7 hed been borrowing from QuickQuid for a lengthy 
period and he wasnt making  many inroads to the amount he owed the lender.  By 
then Mr G had paid a considerable  amount of interest to QuickQuid to effectively 
service a debt over an extended period.
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr G borrowed regularly  and consistently from QuickQuid. So 
the lender ought  to have  realised it was more likely than not Mr G was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loans was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Gs indebtedness was continuing unsustainably.
I think that Mr G lost out because QuickQuid  continued to provide borrowing  from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Gs ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 22 and QuickQuid should  put things right.
Ref: DRN23668094putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Mr G after,  and including,  the loan that 
he took on 7 March 2012 (loan 5). So for each of those  loans  QuickQuid should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information in relation to loans 5 and 6 that has been recorded  on 
Mr Gs credit file.
The number of loans  taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  7 to 22 should be removed from Mr Gs credit 
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I largely uphold  Mr Gs complaint and direct CashEuroNet UK LLC to 
put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 June  2019.
