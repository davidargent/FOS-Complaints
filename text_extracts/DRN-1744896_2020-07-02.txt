The complaint
Mr C has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called APFIN 
Limited, trading at the time as cashasap.co.uk. Mr C says he was lent to irresponsibly and 
the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep things simple, Ill refer mainly to cashasap throughout this decision.
Background
We now know that Mr C took out some 9 instalment loans from cashasap between June 
2017 and November 2018. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Cs borrowing with cashasap, 
based on the information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this 
decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint and said they thought it should be upheld 
from the point of loan number 5 onwards. Cashasap made an offer to otherwise settle the 
complaint but Mr C doesnt agree to this. So the complaint has come to me for an 
ombudsmans final decision.
My Findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this 
approach when thinking about Mr Cs complaint.
Cashasap needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr 
C could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. However, certain factors might point to the fact that 
cashasap should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, cashasap was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr C could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Cashasap told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend 
to Mr C. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked at the overall pattern of lending history 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which cashasap should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at 
some point, cashasap should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Bearing in mind what Ive said above, about the length of the lending relationship, I think the 
checks which cashasap most likely carried out would have been quite basic ones. But I also 
think these would have probably been proportionate for loans 1  4. I think these levels of 
checks, together with the income and expenditure details provided by Mr C, would have 
made those particular early loans appear affordable. I therefore dont uphold the complaint in 
respect of loans 1  4.
However, I think the emerging pattern of repeated lending from the point of loan 5 onwards 
in this case would have looked different and therefore required a more responsible 
approach. The overall pattern of cashasaps lending to Mr C at the point of loan 5 should 
have caused it to see, in my view, that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
This is because this was Mr Cs fifth short-term loan application with cashasap in 7 months 
or so. Ive taken into account that the amounts being borrowed were relatively small, but the 
interest rates werent. Cashasap ought to have realised that Mr C wasnt merely borrowing to 
deal with short-term cash-flow problems; he was borrowing regularly, to address shortfalls in 
his income and to meet an ongoing need. He was having to consistently take out high 
interest, short-term lending over a sustained period and the indebtedness caused by this 
type of borrowing was harmful, in my view. Cashasap should have realised Mr C was at risk 
of not managing to repay the loans sustainably or getting into financial difficulties. 
So Im upholding this complaint in respect of loans 5 - 9. Cashasap repeatedly lent to Mr C in 
an unsustainable manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost loansPutting things right  what LS needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 5 - 9;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
the number of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 5  9 should be completely 
removed from Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires cashasap to take off tax from this interest. Cashasap must give Mr C a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given, I partly uphold Mr Cs complaint. APFIN Limited should put things 
right for Mr C as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 July 2020.Appendix
