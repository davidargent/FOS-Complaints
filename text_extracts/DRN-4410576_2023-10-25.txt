The complaint
Mr and Mrs F complain about delays when they applied to re-mortgage with National 
Westminster Bank Plc. They ended up staying with their existing lender, but by the time they 
took out a new product interest rates had increased. Mr and Mrs F say their mortgage will 
cost about £5,000 more over five years. They ask for compensation, or that NatWest pays 
the early repayment charge (ERC) to their lender so they can re-mortgage.
What happened
Mr and Mrs F made an on-line mortgage application to NatWest in August 2022. There were 
delays with the application. The valuation was lower than Mr and Mrs F had expected, which 
meant they had to choose a new product from a different loan to value range. By this time, 
product interest rates had increased.
In response to Mr and Mrs Fs complaint NatWest said it would allow them to take out a 
product available in August 2022 and compensate them for the cost of being on their lenders 
standard variable rate (SVR) for 46 days. It paid £100 compensation.
Mr and Mrs F say they couldnt accept NatWests offer as by the time they received the final 
response (in December 2022) theyd taken out a new product with their existing lender. They 
said they couldnt take the risk of waiting for the outcome of their complaint when living costs 
and interest rates were rising. Theyd have paid an ERC to their lender if they re-mortgaged.
I sent a provisional decision setting out why I intended to uphold this complaint and order 
NatWest to pay compensation. I said the starting point to calculate compensation would be 
the rate Mr and Mrs F could have taken out with NatWest if there hadnt been the delays 
caused by NatWest. But this should be discounted for various reasons, including that 
NatWest wasnt responsible for all of the delays and that Mr and Mrs F would receive the 
payment before they had to pay all of the interest.
NatWest sent calculations for the compensation, as Id requested. 
Mr and Mrs F didnt agree. In summary, they said it wasnt fair to expect them to be familiar 
with the re-mortgage process or suggest that as consumers they bear partial responsibility 
for a banks errors. They said theyd have been able to take out a rate in late August 2022 if 
NatWest hadnt caused delays.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the 
balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in 
light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
Mr and Mrs F submitted an online mortgage application to NatWest on 1 August 2022 on a 
non-advised basis. They said they wanted to re-mortgage on 1 November 2022. They chose 
a product from NatWests 60% loan to value range.
NatWest accepts there were delays with Mr and Mrs Fs application. It told them it would 
send an email to register for the online document process. The email didnt arrive and Mrs F 
called NatWest in mid-September 2022 to ask what was happening. The application then 
proceeded, and NatWest booked the valuation for late September 2022.
The property was valued at £275,000, which was lower than Mr and Mrs Fs estimated value 
of £328,000. The lower valuation meant Mr and Mrs F had to choose a new product from 
NatWests 75% loan to value range. NatWest called Mr and Mrs F on 30 September 2022, to 
tell them about the valuation and that theyd need to look online to choose a new product. 
Mrs F said the property was down valued due to the delays. I havent seen anything to 
suggest that was the case. The valuation was carried out by a member of the Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors, so I think the valuer was suitably qualified. NatWest 
raised Mrs Fs concerns about the valuation with the valuer, who didnt change the valuation. 
I think it was fair and reasonable for NatWest to rely on the valuers expert opinion. 
NatWests notes say it told Mrs F on 5 October 2022 it would expedite their application. I 
think thered have been time for Mr and Mrs F to re-mortgage on 1 November 2022, as 
theyd intended. However, interest rates had increased since late July 2022. From 3 October 
2022 a five-year product equivalent to the one Mr and Mrs F had chosen but with a 
maximum 75% loan to value ratio had an interest rate of more than 5%.
Mrs F made a complaint in mid-October 2022 about the delays with the application, saying 
this meant they missed out on the lower rates available in August 2022.
NatWest issued a final response to Mr and Mrs Fs complaint on 6 December 2022. It said 
their application could proceed with a product available on 1 August 2022. And it would 
compensate them for the cost of being on their lenders standard variable rate for 46 days.
Mr and Mrs F didnt accept this offer because theyd taken out a new product with their 
lender. Theyd have incurred an ERC if theyd re-mortgaged. Mr and Mrs F say the product 
they took out has a rate of 3.99%. They say this will cost about £5,000 more over five years 
than if theyd re-mortgaged with NatWest.
Was NatWests offer fair?
In many circumstances, NatWests offer (to allow Mr and Mrs F to take out a rate available in 
August 2022 and cover the cost of being on their lenders SVR) would have been fair. But I 
dont think that was the case here.
In October 2022 interest rates for NatWests products equivalent to the one Mr and Mrs F 
had chosen were over 5%. This was higher than the rate offered to Mr and Mrs F by their 
existing lender (of 3.99%). Its understandable that they didnt continue with the re-mortgage 
in October 2022, given this would have meant paying a higher interest rate.
Mr and Mrs Fs product was due to expire on 31 October 2022. Interest rates were 
increasing at that time. Mr and Mrs F didnt know when theyd receive a response to their 
complaint, or what the outcome of their complaint would be. In the circumstances, I think it 
was reasonable for Mr and Mrs F to limit their potential interest costs by taking out a new 
product with their lender. As is usually the case with fixed interest rate products, the product 
had an ERC. This meant Mr and Mrs F couldnt re-mortgage with NatWest and accept its 
offer without paying an ERC to their lender.Mr and Mrs F had told NatWest they wanted to re-mortgage on 1 November 2022, so it was 
aware of their timing. I appreciate that NatWest needed to look into what happened and 
consider how to put it right. But the offer in NatWests final response letter simply arrived too 
late for it to put matters right for Mr and Mrs F.
What should NatWest do to put matters right?
I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to pay compensation based on the 
difference between the interest rate Mr and Mrs F are paying and the rate NatWest offered in 
its final response. NatWest offered this on the basis that Mr and Mrs F re-mortgaged with it. 
They cant do that.
When considering compensation, we take into account the impact of the mistake on the 
customer  which could be financial, emotional or impact on their time or wellbeing. And we 
take the wider circumstances into account, including whether the customer could have taken 
steps to limit their loss.
NatWest said if there hadnt been any delays with Mr and Mrs Fs application the valuation 
would have been carried out on or about 10 August 2022. Mr and Mrs F would then have 
needed to make a new application, choosing a rate from the 75% loan to value band.
NatWest changed its product rates on 3 August 2022, so the rates available on 1 August 
2022 would not have been available.
I need to take into account that I cant necessarily assume that Mr and Mrs F would certainly 
have provided all of the necessary documents immediately. And that they could have taken 
steps which would have reduced the delays with the application.
NatWest said that Mr and Mrs F contacted it on 12 September 2022 to say they hadnt 
received emails asking for documentation. This was about six weeks after Mr and Mrs F 
submitted their application. NatWest said Mr and Mrs F could reasonably have contacted it 
sooner if they were concerned about the application proceeding. I think thats a fair point.
Mrs F said in response to my provisional decision that they werent at that point worried 
about interest rises. So, as I said, I cant assume theyd have provided all necessary 
documents immediately if theyd received the email from NatWest.
Mrs F says they, as borrowers, cant be expected to be fully acquainted with the intricacies 
of the mortgage process and NatWest didnt give a deadline for when theyd receive its 
email. But they were expecting an email to register for an online process and theyd have 
known whether it had arrived. I think Mr and Mrs F could reasonably have contacted 
NatWest sooner than about six weeks. Had they done so, the application would have moved 
on sooner.
Mr and Mrs F made an online application without advice. They chose a product from the 
60% loan to value range based on their own estimate of the property value. While they were 
disappointed with the valuation (which meant they had to re-apply with a product from the 
75% loan to value range) this wasn't due to an error by NatWest. If Mr and Mrs F had 
chosen a product from the 75% range at the outset, theyd have been able to keep the 
product. I note that the property value in the product offer from their existing lender puts 
them in the 75% loan to value range.  
Ive also taken into account that it would be reasonable for Mr and Mrs F to wait a week or 
so before becoming concerned about not receiving an email from NatWest. And that 
NatWest took responsibility for the delays with Mr and Mrs Fs application in its final response letter.
Taking all this into account, I dont think NatWest was solely responsible for Mr and Mrs F 
missing out on rates available in August and early September 2022. So I dont think its fair 
to require NatWest to pay compensation based on Mr and Mrs F missing out on rates 
available at that time. But it did make an error which resulted in delays and I think it should 
pay compensation on the basis that, due to this, Mr and Mrs F missed out on rates available 
in late September 2022. 
NatWest provided evidence of available rates in late September 2022. The product 
equivalent to the one chosen by Mr and Mrs F but in the 75% loan to value range had an 
interest rate of 3.80%.
While I think this would be a fair starting point to calculate compensation, I think any 
compensation should be discounted, for the following reasons.
Mr and Mrs F will have the use of the compensation payment in advance of making most 
of the interest payments. They could use the payment to reduce their balance (if this is 
within their overpayment allowance). This would reduce the amount of interest they pay 
overall. I dont, as Mrs F suggests, think it would be better to require NatWest to pay a 
larger amount in instalments. I think this would be unnecessarily complicated and risk 
further dispute. 
If Mr and Mrs F were worried about interest rates rising and wanted to secure a product 
rate, they could have contacted NatWest in early August 2022 when they didnt receive 
the expected emails. In response to my provisional decision, Mrs F said they werent 
worried about rate rises at that time.
NatWest told Mr and Mrs F on 30 September 2022 about the lower valuation and that 
theyd need to re-apply with a product from the 75% loan to value range. Mrs F said 
NatWest didnt offer them a new product. She said because theyd applied online and on 
a non-advised basis they were told to look online and call back with the rate they chose. I 
dont think that was incorrect, given theyd made an online application. Mr and Mrs F did 
have had an opportunity (albeit brief) to reapply with the five-year rate available at that 
time (3.80%). 
Mr and Mrs F took out a new product with their lender in October 2022. This didnt give 
NatWest much time to look into what happened and offer to put things right. This isnt a 
criticism of Mr and Mrs F  simply an acknowledgement that NatWest didnt have much 
time to offer a fair resolution before they committed to a new product with their lender. 
Ive also taken into account that NatWest was aware of Mr and Mrs Fs timing, and that 
they were likely to be concerned about further rate increases.
Mrs F said its unfair for a consumer to bear partial responsibility for an error by a bank and 
face financial loss for events outside their control. There were several factors here that 
resulted in Mr and Mrs F missing out on the lower interest rates available in August and 
September 2022, and not all of them were errors by NatWest. 
There was an error by NatWest when it didnt send the email to Mr and Mrs F to register for 
the online document process. But NatWest wasnt responsible for Mr and Mrs Fs estimate of 
the property value being different from the valuation, which resulted in them having to 
choose a new product or for the wider events that led to increases in interest rates. Mr and 
Mrs F could have contacted NatWest in August 2022, when they didnt receive an email, and 
they could have chosen a new product in late September 2022 before rates increased. Overall, having considered Mr and Mrs Fs comments, I think the compensation I suggested 
in my provisional decision is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
NatWest should calculate compensation as follows.
1. NatWest should calculate the interest Mr and Mrs F will pay from 1 November 2022 until 
30 November 2027 at the interest rate of the product theyve taken out (3.99%).
2. NatWest should calculate the interest Mr and Mrs F would have paid from 1 November 
2022 until 30 November 2027 if theyd re-mortgaged on 1 November 2022 at the 3.80% 
product rate.
When doing the calculations in 1 and 2 NatWest should use the loan amount (including 
the £995 product fee) set out in the product offer from their existing lender, assume the 
same mortgage term and that Mr and Mrs F make their contractual monthly payments in 
full and on time, and that the balance reduces over time accordingly.
3. NatWest should deduct the result of 2 from the result of 1. It should then discount the 
result by 50%, for the reasons set out above.
NatWest provided calculations in response to my provisional decision which weve shared 
with Mr and Mrs F. NatWest initially based the calculations on the loan Mr and Mrs F applied 
for. But I think it should use the balance in the product offer from Mr and Mrs Fs existing 
lender, which better reflects their actual interest costs.
NatWest paid £100 for the upset caused by the delays. While I think this matter did cause Mr 
and Mrs F trouble and upset, not all of this was due to errors by NatWest. For instance, they 
were upset that the valuation was lower than theyd expected. If Mr and Mrs F were worried 
that they hadnt heard from NatWest after they submitted their application in early August 
2022, Id have expected them to contact NatWest sooner. Taking all this into account, I think 
£100 is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and order National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
compensation to Mr and Mrs F calculated as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F and Mr F to 
accept or reject my decision before 23 November 2023.
