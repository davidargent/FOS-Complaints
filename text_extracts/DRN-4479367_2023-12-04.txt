The complaint
Mr G complains about the service he received from MoneyGram International Limited
(MoneyGram) when he attempted to transfer funds to a family member.
What happened
In January, Mr G used MoneyGrams money transfer service to send £75 to a relative (who
Ill refer to in this decision as the recipient). The recipient needed the money urgently and Mr
G selected cash pickup as the method for her to receive the money. MoneyGram
confirmed the transfer and said the cash would be available for the recipient to collect at any
location within minutes. But the funds werent made available to the recipient.
Mr G says he called MoneyGram several times and was told that the money would be
transferred any minute. But the transfer never completed and Mr G says that MoneyGram
didnt explain why. In May, Mr G brought his complaint to this service. At that point, the
money still hadnt been transferred, nor had it been refunded to Mr G.
MoneyGram told our Investigator that it required verification documents from the recipient
before it could release the funds. It said it had placed the transaction on hold until these
documents were provided. MoneyGram said that the recipient had provided some
documents, but it needed further information before it could release the funds. It said it didnt
receive this information, so couldnt complete the transfer. But Mr G said that MoneyGram
never came back to him to tell him it couldnt complete the transfer. He said he had to keep
chasing to find out what was happening and never received an explanation.
MoneyGram said it had briefly released the hold on the funds in February. It said that it sent
Mr G an email at the time, telling him that the recipient would be able to collect the funds
within a limited window of time. It said that the funds werent collected in the timeframe
given, so the transfer was put on hold again. But Mr G said he didnt receive the email and
didnt know about this.
MoneyGram processed a full refund to Mr G on 24 May, the same day it responded to our
Investigator.
I issued a provisional decision on 13 November, indicating my intention to uphold this 
complaint and award Mr G compensation of £250. MoneyGram didnt respond to the 
provisional decision. Mr G did respond and asked me to reconsider the amount of 
compensation. He says that his treatment by MoneyGram was deliberate. He says its very 
unlikely that managers within MoneyGram were oblivious to his calls, emails and complaints 
or those from the recipient. He says its not true that MoneyGram released the money for a 
short period of time. And he feels that MoneyGram treated him and the recipient with a lack 
of compassion or humanity. He asked me to consider awarding compensation of up to £750.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive taken account of Mr Gs latest comments and thought about everything again. Im sorry 
to disappoint him, but I havent changed my mind about what I think is a fair outcome to this 
complaint. My reasons are set out below.
I find that MoneyGram accepted Mr Gs transfer and agreed to make the funds available to
the recipient within minutes. MoneyGrams terms and conditions say that recipients will be
asked to identify themselves so that they can collect the funds and that identification
requirements vary by country. So, I find that MoneyGram didnt have to release the funds to
the recipient until it had received satisfactory identification documents from her.
MoneyGram has extensive regulatory and compliance duties, including due diligence
obligations. It is required to have systems and processes in place to comply with these
obligations, but it has some discretion as to exactly what these are. I think its reasonable for
MoneyGram to view each transaction on a case-by-case basis, and the verification
requirements are likely to vary from case to case. I think it was reasonable for MoneyGram
to seek additional verification from the recipient here. But I dont think the way it handled the
situation was fair. Ill explain why.
Ive seen a statement from the recipient detailing her contact with MoneyGram, as well as
various emails between the recipient and MoneyGram. She says she spoke to the customer
service team over the phone on the day she first visited the branch. She says she was told
she would have wait two working days for someone to contact her. In another call the same
day, she says she was told it would take at least two working days for any documentation
she submitted to be reviewed. The recipient provided documents to MoneyGram by email
the following day but says she didnt hear anything. So, after five days, she called the
customer service team again. She says she was asked for further information, but she only
found this out because she had called MoneyGram: it hadnt contacted her to let her know.
The recipient provided the additional information by email the same day. Three days later,
MoneyGram asked for proof of her address. She responded that night saying that she had
already sent all the documents she had to MoneyGram and didnt know what else she could
provide. She provided a copy of her passport at the same time. She says she didnt hear
anything, so called MoneyGram three days later. She says she discussed the documents
with MoneyGram and was told she would just have to wait for an answer.
In the meantime, Mr G had been contacting MoneyGram as well. He has provided a
recording of a call he made on 6 February, in which MoneyGrams agent said the case
would be resolved within two days - it wasnt.
I dont think it was reasonable for MoneyGram to take so long to review the recipients
documentation or contact her, particularly as Mr G had selected (and MoneyGram had
agreed to provide) the 10 Minute Service. At no point was Mr G told that MoneyGram
wouldnt be able to fulfil this, nor was he given a new timescale for the transaction. When he
was told over the phone that the issue would be resolved within two days, that deadline
wasnt met either.
It was reasonable for MoneyGram to request identification documents from the recipient, but
I think it should have made clear at the outset exactly what information it needed. I dont
think it did. I understand that the recipient didnt have the proof of residency documents
which MoneyGram required, so the transaction couldnt be completed. I think it was
reasonable that MoneyGram required these documents. But I dont think it was fair that it
didnt tell Mr G this was the outcome or that the transaction couldnt be fulfilled. I havent
seen anything to indicate that MoneyGram contacted Mr G about this. In the call Ive heard,it wouldnt discuss its requirements with him. This created distress and uncertainty for Mr G.
Mr G raised a complaint in early February. MoneyGram says it responded on 17 February,
but Mr G says he didnt receive the response and only saw it for the first time when our
Investigator sent him a copy. MoneyGram says the final response letter was sent to Mr G by
email but, from the information Ive seen, I cant safely conclude that it was sent to him.
MoneyGram says it released the hold on the funds for a limited time to allow the recipient to
collect them. The final response letter says that the funds have been made available and
asks Mr G to let the recipient know that she must collect the money within 71 hours. But Mr
G didnt receive the letter, so couldnt have let the recipient know.
However, the recipient says that she called MoneyGram herself on 16 February and was told
that the money was available to collect. She says she went to the branch that day but, when
she got there, the branch staff said there was still an error. She says she was told to wait
there for 15 minutes, but the branch still didnt release the money and the store then closed
for the day. The recipient says that the branch staff called her on 18 February and said their
system was still showing an error and they couldnt release the funds. This was within the
71-hour window, so I find that the funds should have been available for collection.
I havent seen anything to explain why they werent, so this appears to be a mistake by
MoneyGram. It told this service that the funds werent collected within the timeframe, so the
transfer was placed back on hold. But Im satisfied that the recipient did attempt to collect the
funds within the timeframe. So, they should have been released. 
But the funds werent released to the recipient or returned to Mr G. They were refunded on 
24 May, but that was only because the complaint had been referred to this service. I dont 
think it was reasonable that MoneyGram didnt contact Mr G about the failed transfer or 
return the funds to him before he came to this service.
Mr G says that MoneyGram isnt being truthful when it says it made the funds available 
briefly. He says that approach doesnt make sense anyway because either MoneyGram 
wasnt satisfied with the recipients documents and couldnt release the funds or, if it was 
satisfied, it didnt need to put a time limit on the funds being available. I can understand Mr 
Gs point of view. But MoneyGram has confirmed to this service that it made the decision to 
release the funds briefly and it has produced evidence of a letter confirming this (although, 
as Ive said, I cant conclude that the letter was sent to Mr G at the time). 
In reality, the funds werent made available within the designated timeframe because the 
branch wouldnt release them to the recipient. I understand Mr Gs strength of feeling about 
this. But I havent seen anything which makes me think this was anything more than a 
mistake or lack of communication within MoneyGram. From what Ive seen, I cant conclude 
that MoneyGram deliberately withheld the funds when it had offered to release them or that it 
has latterly fabricated a story about the funds being available for a limited time.
In summary, I think it was reasonable for MoneyGram to place the transfer on hold while it
carried out checks. I wouldnt expect it to release the funds until it received satisfactory
documentation from the recipient. But I think MoneyGram made mistakes in the way it
handled the situation and these had a negative impact on Mr G.
Mr G suggests that the problems werent caused by mistakes but, rather, were deliberate 
acts by MoneyGram. From what Ive seen, I cant conclude thats the case. I think its more 
likely that a combination of mistakes and poor customer service caused the issues here.Mr G has commented again on the recipients situation and the need for MoneyGram to 
have resolved the issue quickly. But Mr G is the complainant here and we cant award 
compensation to third parties. So, although its clear that the recipient was most affected by 
this situation, we can only award compensation to Mr G himself for way he was affected. 
He has described how distressing this situation was for him: he had tried to help a family 
member who needed funds urgently but was unable to do anything or explain the delays 
once he had paid the money to MoneyGram. He contacted MoneyGram himself but didnt 
get answers. He says the recipient called him in tears which was very distressing for him. He 
has suffered embarrassment and says his reputation as a reliable person has been tainted in 
the eyes of his family because he wasnt able to help a relative. It was obvious in the call Ive 
listened to that Mr G was finding the situation distressing. He was also without his funds for 
around four months and had to bring the complaint to this service in order to find out what 
had happened and receive a refund.
Putting things right
I still think £250 is a fair amount of compensation for the way this situation impacted Mr G. 
Im sorry to disappoint him, but I dont think MoneyGrams treatment of him was deliberate 
and I dont think the impact of its mistakes was so severe as to warrant compensation within 
the higher parameters he has suggested. 
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint. MoneyGram International Limited should pay 
compensation of £250 to Mr G.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 January 2024.
