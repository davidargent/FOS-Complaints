K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains about Union Income Benefit Holdings Limited (UIB). 
background
Mr M has a free  policy that is provided by UIB. This is an annual  policy,  and Mr M asked for 
it to be renewed automatically  every  year whilst the free offer is available. UIB refused as 
they require policyholders  to contact them to renew cover. Mr M didnt think this was fair so 
he complained  to us. 
One of our case handlers looked into the matter but didnt uphold the complaint. Mr M has 
asked for a review of his case,  so it has been  passed to me for a final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I wont be upholding the complaint either. Ill explain why. 
UIB provide the policy as part of a marketing scheme though  an organisation Mr M is 
connected with. The policy  gives  no rights  to ongoing cover,  nor does it promise auto-
renewal. On that basis I cant see under  what policy or other contractual term I could ask UIB 
to provide auto-renewal of cover. It is up to UIB to decide on its renewal process and then for 
Mr M to decide if he wants to take advantage  of the cover on offer under those terms. If he 
does not he could always seek cover elsewhere,  although I appreciate that wouldnt be free. 
my final decision
I make  no award against Union Income  Benefit Holdings Limited.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019.
