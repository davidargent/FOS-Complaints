K821x#15complaint
Mr G says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr G had 12 loans with QuickQuid. Ive set out some of the information QuickQuid provided 
about the loans in a table at the end of this decision.
An adjudicator has looked at this case already  and recommended it be upheld  in part. She 
didnt think loans 5 to 12 had been  approved  responsibly.
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr G needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
Ref: DRN47991462the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
I think QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks for the first three loans. It asked  Mr G 
about his income  and expenditure and carried out credit checks and from what Ive seen 
these checks suggested the loans were  affordable.
I dont think the same  can be said of loan 4. Although the preceding loan was for just £50, 
Mr G still extended the repayment date by a month.  He then asked to borrow  again after just 
two weeks and wanted to borrow twice as much. So I think  QuickQuid ought to have had 
some concerns about whether Mr G had settled loan 3 sustainably   and ought to have 
looked more closely  at Mr Gs circumstances before approving loan 4. Ive not seen, for 
example, that QuickQuid  obtained or asked Mr G for details of his other short-term 
commitments (if any). I think this is something it shouldve done. Having said this, Ive not 
got enough information about Mr Gs short-term commitments at this time and so cannot say 
whether proportionate  checks wouldve made a difference to QuickQuids decision to lend. 
Im therefore  not upholding the complaint about loans 1 to 4.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr G with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 5. I say this because:
By the time of loan 5, Mr G had been  indebted  to QuickQuid for about eight months. 
So it was likely  he didnt simply have a need for short-term  finance and wasnt  using 
the loans for their intended purpose. Hed extended loans  3 and 4 and the amount he 
was borrowing was increasing. There hadnt been a gap of more than 14 days 
between the loans up to this point.  When Mr G asked for loan 5, he was borrowing  
more than the sum of all the previous loans. From loan 5 onwards,  the gaps between  
the loans continued  to be quite short. So QuickQuid ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr G was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  his 
previous loan was leaving  in his/her  finances and that Mr Gs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr G wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid. Loan  12 
was taken out 32 months after Mr Gs first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr G had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to QuickQuid over an 
extended period
Ref: DRN47991463I think that Mr G lost out because QuickQuid  continued to provide borrowing  from loan four 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and deferrals  was likely to have had negative  implications on 
Mr Gs ability  to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market  for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 12.
putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 5 to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove all entries about  loans 5 to 12 from Mr Gs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr G a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 June  2019.

Ref: DRN47991464Appendix  loan table  and notes
All of Mr Gs loans were  payday loans, repayable in between one and three payments. Some  of 
the loans  were topped-up  this means  Mr G borrowed extra  funds during the course  of the loan 
agreement. These  loans are denoted with a letter  in the loan no. column. On some occasions, 
the top-up also extended the length  of the loan agreement by way of rolling the funds into a new 
agreement.
