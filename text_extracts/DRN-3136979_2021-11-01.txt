The complaint
Mr C is unhappy that NewDay Ltd approved him for a credit account which he feels wasnt 
affordable for him at that time.  
What happened
In August 2015, Mr C applied for a NewDay administered credit account. His application was 
approved, and Mr C was issued with a credit account with a credit limit of £300.
In early 2021, Mr C raised a complaint with NewDay on the basis that he felt that the credit 
that NewDay approved him for in August 2015 hadnt been affordable for him at that time.
NewDay looked at Mr Cs complaint. They felt that theyd conducted checks into Mr Cs 
financial position at the time of the account application and that there had been nothing 
resulting from those checks that should have given them cause to suspect that the credit 
account might not be affordable for Mr C. So, they didnt uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Mr C wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They noted that at the time of the account 
application that Mr C had two recent defaults on his credit file. As such, our investigator 
didnt feel that it had been fair or reasonable for NewDay to have provided further credit to 
Mr C at that time, and they recommended that the complaint be upheld in Mr Cs favour on 
that basis.
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendation put forwards by our investigator, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how much 
and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before approving a 
customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of credit available to a 
customer on an existing line of credit, the business would undertake reasonable and 
proportionate borrower focussed checks to ensure that any credit being offered to a 
customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
NewDay say that they did that here. At the time of the account application they took details 
of Mr Cs annual income from Mr C to check that Mr C could likely meet any monthly 
repayments that might become due on the account. Additionally, NewDay also obtained 
information from a credit reference agency to get a better understanding of Mr Cs wider 
financial position. And NewDay contend that there was nothing resulting from these checks 
that they feel should have given them any cause to suspect that the credit account that Mr C 
was applying for might be unaffordable for him at that time.
However, its evident from the information that NewDay have provided to this service that the 
information that they obtained from the credit reference agency wasnt accurate and 
therefore didnt enable them to make an informed decision as to the affordability of the credit 
account for Mr C. And I say this because Mr Cs credit file confirms that Mr C had defaulted 
on two existing credit accounts in the months leading up to the NewDay application, 
including a default only two months prior.
NewDay have explained that, given the relatively low level of credit for which Mr C was 
applying, they still feel that the credit account was affordable for him at that time, and that as 
such they still would have taken the decision to approve the account, even had they taken 
the recent defaults into account at the time of the application.
I find it difficult to understand NewDays position here, and while I appreciate that they offer 
second chance lending and so do provide credit to applicants with lower than average 
credit scores, I still dont consider it fair or reasonable to provide any amount of credit to an 
individual who had defaulted on a credit account only a few months previously, and who had 
defaulted on a further credit account within a further six months  events which I consider to 
be a clear indicator of probable current financial difficulty at that time. 
Im therefore satisfied that the provision of further credit to Mr C under those circumstances 
didnt take fair or reasonable account of the risk that the credit provided to Mr C would serve 
to enable Mr C to get even further into an unsustainable level of debt. And Im further 
satisfied that, had NewDay obtained the accurate information about Mr Cs credit file position 
that they should have done at the time of the application, that NewDay should have made 
the decision to not provide any further credit to Mr C.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that NewDay were wanting here, but it follows that Ill 
be upholding this complaint in Mr Cs favour. I trust that NewDay will understand, given what 
Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have. 
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse to Mr Cs credit account all interest, fees, and charges incurred or 
accrued on the account since inception. 
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance on the account in Mr Cs favour, NewDay 
must pay that balance to Mr C along with 8% simple interest calculated to the date of 
repayment. 
NewDay must also remove all adverse credit reporting from Mr Cs credit file relating to this 
account from inception.
Finally, NewDay must make a payment of £50 to Mr C as compensation for the trouble and 
upset this matter has caused. This payment may not take the form of a credit to Mr Cs 
NewDay account unless Mr C gives his permission for it to do so.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 November 2021.
