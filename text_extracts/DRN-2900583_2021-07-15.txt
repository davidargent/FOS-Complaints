The complaint
Mr H complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money (118 118) charged 
him 58 days interest when he settled his loan early. He says that they misled him to believe 
it was a discretionary charge, but they always apply it. 
 
What happened
In January 2021 Mr H took out a fixed sum loan agreement with 118 118 to borrow £3,500. It 
was to be repaid over 24 months and the annual interest rate was 71.3%pa. (99.9% APR) 
The total repayable would have been £6,697.20. 
The terms and conditions allowed for full or partial early repayment and Mr H opted to take 
advantage of this only 3 months into his loan. When he contacted 118 118 they provided him 
with a settlement figure in line with their terms and conditions. 
The settlement figure included 58 days interest on the amount repaid early, which came to 
around £700. 
Mr H asked 118 118 to adjust this as he was settling the loan so quickly after taking it out. 
118 118 pointed to their loan agreement, signed by Mr H which says We may charge you 
interest on the amount that you repay early. The amount of interest we may charge you will 
be up to 28 days interest unless your loan term is for a period of more than 12 months, in 
which case we may charge you up to 58 days interest on the amount that you repay early. 
Mr H subsequently settled the loan. 
 
Mr H didnt think that 118 118 acted fairly in charging him 58 days interest, as he paid off the 
loan in less than 6 months and the terms and conditions only say they may charge, not that 
they will and so he complained. 
In their final response, 118 118 said that as the loan was for 24 months the interest is 
normally charged over that period, and so in the event of an early settlement they were 
entitled to charge 58 days interest to recoup some of that loss. They advised that they were 
adhering to the Consumer Credit Act (Early Settlement) Regulations in making this charge. 
They also said if he had been unhappy with these terms and conditions, he could have 
chosen not to take out the loan, and that he could continue to pay the loan rather than 
settling early. They further advised that the benefit of settling early would save Mr H 
£2,526.67 in interest. 
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Hs complaint. She thought that 118 118 hadnt acted 
unfairly in applying the interest to the early settlement figure.  
Mr H has asked for an ombudsmans decision and so it has come to me to review. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I am not upholding this complaint and I will explain why. 
Mr Hs concern is that 118 118 say in their terms that they may apply the 58-day interest 
charge to an early settlement, and he is not happy that they have done so in his case. Mr H 
asked 118 118 not to apply the charge in full, and they declined his request. 
Mr H has also complained that 118 118 should not use the term may charge in their 
agreement if they intend to apply it in every case and has asked for evidence of 118 118 not 
applying the charge. 
Firstly, I cant tell a business how to word the terms of their loan agreements or ask them to 
provide evidence of when they have not applied a term. I can only consider whether the 
terms have been fairly applied in the circumstances of the case before me.  
The Consumer Credit (Early Repayment) Regulations allow a creditor to apply a 
compensatory interest charge to the early settlement of a loan. In line with this, 118 118 
included a term in Mr Hs fixed sum loan agreement warning him of the charge. 
   
I think that although the term says that 118 118 may apply the interest, this doesnt 
preclude them from applying it in every case, more that it allows them to exercise a 
discretion not to apply it if they think its appropriate in the circumstances. They chose not to 
exercise that discretion in Mr Hs case, which they can do.
 
I think that the wording is sufficiently clear to warn Mr H that if he should settle his loan early 
there are likely to be charges. If he was considering settling his loan early at the time he 
signed the agreement, it would have alerted him to the fact that this may not be the right type 
of loan for him and could have queried it with 118 118.  
I further note that in the Information about your loan section which was sent to Mr H it also 
says, The type of loan we offer is intended for you to borrow money for a period of one year 
or more, where your scheduled monthly payments are fixed amounts. For borrowings over a 
shorter period or where you want flexibility on the repayment terms, it may be more 
appropriate for you to use an alternative method to obtain funds.. 
If Mr H was unhappy with the terms at the outset, he could have chosen not to sign the 
agreement. 
I appreciate that Mr H will find it frustrating that he has had to pay around £700 for the use of 
a loan facility for only 3 months, but in view of the above I cant fairly say that 118 118 have 
done anything wrong in applying the early repayment charge.  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint about 
Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2021.
