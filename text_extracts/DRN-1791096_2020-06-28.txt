The complaint
Mr O complains he was sold an interest free credit card with Vanquis Bank Limited but was 
later charged interest. Mr O also complains that Vanquis Bank unfairly defaulted the credit 
card after he tried to close it. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Ive listened to two calls Mr O had with Vanquis Bank during his application process
in July 2019. Im satisfied Vanquis Bank explained that the credit card was interest
bearing and that Mr O confirmed he understood. In addition, Mr O accepted a credit
agreement that says interest was payable on his credit card balance. I havent found
that Mr O was sold an interest free credit card by Vanquis Bank.
As Mr O used the credit card for purchases but didnt repay the outstanding balance,
the interest was correctly applied. I havent found any errors in the way Vanquis Bank
has added interest to the credit card.
Mr O says he called to close the credit card in October 2019 and paid Â£52.19. But
Vanquis Bank has no record of that call. I dont think Vanquis Bank would have told
Mr O his account had been closed and terminated as an outstanding balance made
up of Mr Os purchases and interest remained outstanding.
Vanquis Bank closed Mr O's credit card and defaulted it in February 2020. I think that
was a reasonable step to take as no payments were received after October 2019.
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
DRN-1791096Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 July 2020.
