The complaint
Mr S complains that  PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (Payal) didnt refund him under the 
buyer protection policy after he didnt receive goods hed paid for using PayPal.
What happened
In November 2020 Mr S purchased goods using his PayPal account. Payment was sent to 
the seller. Mr S contacted the seller when he didnt receive the goods hed ordered. He said 
the seller provided proof from the courier company that the goods had been delivered. The 
proof was a photograph of a house  but Mr S said this wasnt his house.
Mr S received a message from the courier company who confirmed the parcel was delivered 
incorrectly and the driver wasnt able to retrieve the parcel. The courier company advised 
him to contact the seller for a refund,  or a replacement.
Mr S complained to PayPal and requested a refund under its buyer protection policy.
PayPal said they investigated his complaint but didnt uphold it because the information 
provided by the seller showed that the goods had been delivered. They said he was still 
responsible for the payment due to the seller. PayPal said they relied on their terms, which 
say the buyer will not qualify for a refund under their buyer protection policy if the seller has 
provided proof of delivery.
Mr S wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred the matter to this service.
Our investigator didnt think PayPal acted acting fairly by relying on this clause when the 
courier company had confirmed theyd delivered the parcel to the wrong house. Our 
investigator said PayPal should refund all payments made to the credit account in relation to 
the Â£210.48 purchase including any interest paid.
PayPal didnt agree with the investigator and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. They said theyd acted in line with the user agreement, and 
Mr S hadnt provided the information within the investigation timeframe. They also said the 
courier was at fault for the missing item.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal explained that they denied Mr Ss claim because theyd seen proof that the item hed 
ordered had been delivered.
But Mr S has provided a message he received from the courier company acknowledging that 
their driver had delivered the item to the wrong address. And he couldnt retrieve it.
PayPal has told us that it has a copy of that email, sent to it by Mr S on 9 February 2021. Im 
assuming that was later than the date it asked Mr S to provide the information by. 
Ive considered their terms and conditions, including their Buyer Protection policy. This 
protection applies when the buyer doesnt receive an item. The terms state that you will not 
qualify for a refund if the seller has provided proof of delivery. They declined Mr Ss claim 
because the seller provided a proof of delivery to them.
But Mr S has provided PayPal with evidence, from the courier, that the item was delivered to 
the wrong address. So whilst there is proof of delivery, we know that the goods were 
delivered to the wrong address. So it is not proof of delivery to Mr S.
PayPal said Mr S sent this information him too late for them to consider it. But they also said 
theyd received it on 9 February 2021, on the same day they denied his claim for the second 
time, and one month before they wrote to Mr S telling him his claim was closed.
Im satisfied that Mr M didnt receive the goods, and that PayPal had sufficient evidence to 
uphold the claim under their buyer protection scheme.
Having considered everything, I don't think PayPal acted in a fair or reasonable way by 
rejecting Mr Ss valid claim.
Putting things right
To put matters right PayPal should refund Mr S the full amount he paid for the goods, plus 
any interest that hes been charged on top of this amount.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ss complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA, and require it to put 
matters right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 November 2021.
