The complaint
Mr A, who is a sole trader, is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest)
declined his application for a Bounce Bank Loan (BBL).
What happened
Mr A applied for a BBL with NatWest in April 2020. Mr As application stated that his
business had annual turnover of £40,000, and he applied for a BBL for £10,000.
NatWest declined Mr As application and explained that this was because Mr As business
hadnt been trading prior to 1 March 2020, and so didnt meet the BBL eligibility criteria. Mr A
wasnt happy about this, especially as his business had been trading for several years, so he
raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Mr As complaint. They confirmed they had given an incorrect reason as
to why Mr As BBL application had been rejected, and they apologised to Mr A for this.
However, NatWest confirmed that they were still declining Mr As BBL application, although
they didnt provide any further information on why the application was being declined. Mr A
wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They accepted that NatWest were within
their rights to have declined Mr As BBL application but felt that Mr A had been
inconvenienced by the service that NatWest had provided surrounding the application. As
such, our investigator recommended that NatWest should make a payment of £100 to Mr A
as compensation for the trouble hed incurred.
Mr A didnt agree with the view of this complaint put forwards by our investigator, so the
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 25 July 2022 as follows:
Its clear that NatWest did initially provide Mr A with an incorrect reason as to why his 
BBL application had been declined.
While the BBL scheme was in force and ongoing, it wouldnt generally have been 
expected that a lender would have provided a detailed reason to an applicant as to 
why an application hadnt been successful.
There are several reasons for this. These include that lenders had a need to process
applications quickly and an obligation to mitigate against the possibility of fraudulent
applications (which detailed explanations could have helped facilitate).
That being said, in this instance its notable that NatWest did provide a reason to Mr 
A as to why his application had been declined. But as noted earlier, it was the wrong 
reason.
The actual reason that NatWest declined Mr As application was because they 
couldnt see that the annual turnover of Mr As business was £40,000, as had been 
declared by Mr A on the application. Rather, having reviewed Mr As current account 
statements, NatWest believed the annual turnover of Mr As business to be 
considerably lower than this.
Because one of the criteria for the BBL was that the maximum loan that could be 
applied for was equal to 25% of a business annual turnover, this meant that Mr As 
application for a BBL of £10,000 couldnt be approved by NatWest  because they 
didnt feel that Mr As business demonstrated the required annual turnover to allow a 
BBL for £10,000 to be approved.
Having reviewed Mr As current account statements as provided by NatWest, I can
understand why they felt this way and why they made the decision to decline Mr As
application as they did.
For reasons similar to those explained above, it wouldnt generally be expected that 
NatWest would have explained this to Mr A while the scheme was ongoing. 
Conversely, it would be expected that an applicant would have an accurate 
understanding of their business turnover when submitting their application, and for 
that turnover to have been clearly demonstrable.
All of which means that I am satisfied that NatWest didnt act unfairly towards Mr A 
by declining the BBL application here, because the amount of loan that Mr A was 
applying for didnt appear to be allowed in consideration of the supporting 
information.
However, while I also accept that NatWest werent under any compulsion to have 
provided a detailed reasoning to Mr A as to why his loan application had been 
unsuccessful, I feel that NatWest set Mr As expectations as to whether he was 
entitled to such an explanation by providing one in the first instance  albeit one that 
was incorrect.
I can also understand, from Mr As perspective, how he may have questioned 
NatWests decision-making process, given that they declined his application on the 
basis of a declared reason that was incorrect, which was then followed up by a 
refusal to provide a corrected reason. And I feel that because of these factors, Mr A 
has incurred a degree of trouble and upset here that he most likely wouldnt have 
done, had NatWest been more accurate in their initial correspondence about the 
declining of the application with Mr A.
As such, my provisional decision here is that Ill be upholding this complaint in Mr As 
favour and provisionally instructing NatWest to make a payment of £250 to Mr A, 
which I feel more fairly compensates him for the trouble and upset that hes incurred 
here.
In arriving at this compensation amount Ive considered that while Mr A may have 
been eligible to receive a BBL, he doesnt appear to have met the criteria for the loan 
amount he requested. Ive also considered that, following the declining of the 
application by NatWest, Mr A could have applied for a BBL via other providers had 
he wanted to do so.In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr A and NatWest the opportunity to provide 
any comments or new information they might wish me to consider before I moved to issue a 
final decision. 
NatWest confirmed they were happy to accept my provisional decision, while Mr A didnt 
respond. As such, I see no reason not to issue a final decision upholding this complaint in  
Mr As favour on the basis described in my provisional decision. And I can confirm that I do 
uphold this complaint on that basis accordingly.
Putting things right
NatWest must make a payment of £250 to Mr A.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc
on the basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 September 2022.
