The complaint
Mr B and Ms B complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont pay them the compensation 
that theyve claimed in relation to some holiday club membership points. Theyre being 
represented in their complaint by a legal adviser. 
What happened
Mr B and Ms B entered into a purchase agreement with a holiday company in November 
2015 to buy some holiday club membership points to upgrade their existing holiday club 
membership. The price of the points was £4,900 and they entered into a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Shawbrook Bank for a loan of £4,900 to pay the holiday company. Mr B and 
Ms B agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £70.87 to Shawbrook Bank.
Mr B and Ms B say that theyve had very limited usage of the points since the upgrade in 
November 2015 and their representative made a claim to Shawbrook Bank under sections 
75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in August 2020. It said that the holiday 
company took consideration for the points within the cooling off period, failed to provide key 
information about the contract, failed to inform Mr B and Ms B that the meeting was a sales 
event, and failed to provide for the contract price to be paid in instalments which is prohibited 
by the applicable regulations and is clear evidence of the agreement being unfair. It also said 
that Mr B and Ms B were subjected to a high pressure sales pitch, were told that the offer 
was only available for a limited time and were given misleading information about the 
purported benefits of the membership. It also said that holiday company misrepresented the 
sale to them as it said that they were on its top package so wouldnt be subjected to further 
sales pitches, there would be no issues with availability and the resorts were exclusive. 
Shawbrook Bank set out in a detailed response the reasons that it didnt agree that the 
membership had been misrepresented to Mr B and Ms B and that it didnt consider that its 
relationship with them was unfair. It said that the holiday company had provided the incorrect 
compliance statement to Mr B and Ms B so had agreed to refund to Mr B and Ms B the £49 
commission that it had received from Shawbrook Bank in relation to the loan agreement. 
Mr B and Ms B werent satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. He said that he 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and didnt think that 
the holiday company had breached the purchase agreement. He didnt think that the 
contractual terms were so problematic as to be unfair or that Mr B and Ms B had agreed to 
the purchase without knowing something that was important to that decision or that 
Shawbrook Banks conduct fell so short of the standard that could have been reasonably 
expected that it made its relationship with Mr B and Ms B unfair. He also said that he hadnt 
seen enough to suggest that there were any other relevant considerations that might mean 
the relationship was unfair and that he wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the 
conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He said that he thought that the holiday company 
had acted fairly in offering to refund the commission. 
Mr B and Ms Bs representative has asked, on their behalf, for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It has described the history of Mr B and Ms Bs timeshare 
purchases and says that the membership was misrepresented to Mr B and Ms B and that 
there was a breach of contract because the holiday company has no ownership of the 
properties that it was selling rights in, and it wasnt made clear that the contract was not an 
investment in real estate or that there was no resale or buy-back programme available. It 
also says that the relationship was unfair because Mr B and Ms B were invited to a disguised 
sales event, the product was described as an investment, they were advised that they had to 
enter into the loan to fund the purchase, the holiday company failed to accept no as an 
answer, the contract terms werent provided to them which meant that they had no 
opportunity to cancel the contract, and consideration was accepted from them within the 
cooling off period in violation of section 25 of the Timeshare Holiday Products Resale and 
Exchange Contracts Regulations. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr B and Ms Bs claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Shawbrook Banks response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Mr B and Ms B signed the purchase agreement and the holiday companys terms 
and conditions in November 2015 - they also signed a separate standard withdrawal 
form to acknowledge receipt of that information and an eleven page key information 
document;
they also signed the loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank which included their right 
to withdraw from the loan agreement and a compliance statement;
Mr B and Ms Bs representative says that the timeshare membership was 
misrepresented to Mr B and Ms B and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt 
been misrepresented to them - the latest time that any such misrepresentations could 
have been made to them was in November 2015 as that was when they entered into 
the purchase and loan agreements, but they didnt complain to Shawbrook Bank 
about the misrepresentations until August 2020  nearly five years later  and I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have complained about any 
misrepresentations before then;
the terms and conditions that Mr B and Ms B signed (and which only included eight 
terms and conditions) said, if you have relied on verbal promises please ask for 
these to be put in writing - but Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr B and Ms B 
asked for any information on which theyd relied to be confirmed in writing;
Mr B and Ms Bs representative says that Mr B and Ms B were told that they were on 
the holiday companys top package so wouldnt be subjected to further sales pitches, 
there would be no issues with availability and the resorts were exclusive  but theres 
no written evidence from the time of the sale to show that the holiday company had given those assurances to them and Im not persuaded that theyve provided enough 
evidence to show that the membership was misrepresented to them by the holiday 
company before they entered into the purchase agreement;
Mr B and Ms Bs representative also says that theres been a breach of contract 
because the timeshare company had no ownership of the properties that it was 
selling rights in  but the holiday company says that Mr B and Ms B made 
reservations for holidays in March and October 2016 but havent paid their annual 
management charges for 2017 onwards, so havent been permitted to secure any 
further reservations since then;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the membership rights werent available for Mr B 
and Ms B to use during the periods for which theyd paid their management charges;
their representative also says that theres been a breach of contract because it 
wasnt made clear that the contract was not an investment in real estate or that there 
was no resale or buy-back programme available  but the terms and conditions that 
Mr B and Ms B signed say: You should not purchase your Points as an investment 
; and: Should you choose  to dispose of your points, please note that there are 
conditions in connection with that which are described in the  Articles of 
Association;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract by the holiday company;
Mr B and Ms Bs representative has described the way that the membership and 
timeshares were sold to Mr B and Ms B but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that they were unduly pressured into entering into the purchase 
agreement or loan agreement in November 2015 or that the holiday company used 
unacceptable commercial practices against them  theyve clearly entered into other 
timeshare agreements and have complained about the way that those agreements 
were sold to them  but if they were concerned about the way that other timeshares 
had been sold to them, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have 
been aware of those issues before they entered into any discussions with the holiday 
company about buying more membership points;
Mr B and Ms B both signed a separate standard withdrawal form which set out their 
right to withdraw from the purchase agreement and said: The consumer has the 
right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason;
the loan agreement also clearly set out Mr B and Ms Bs right to withdraw from the 
loan agreement without giving any reason within 14 days  they signed the loan 
agreement and immediately above their signatures it says: This is a Credit 
Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be 
legally bound by its terms;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mr B and Ms B to have read the 
agreements before they signed them and, if theyd done so, they would have been 
aware of their right to withdraw from them - but Ive seen no evidence to show that 
they tried to withdraw from either the purchase agreement or the loan agreement 
during the withdrawal periods;
Mr B and Ms B signed the purchase agreement and loan agreement in November 
2015  the purchase agreement says that the payment wasnt due from them until 
fifteen days later, which was after the withdrawal period had ended, and Ive seen no 
evidence to show that the payment was made before the due date so Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that consideration was accepted 
from Mr B and Ms B within the withdrawal period or that theres been a breach of the 
regulations to which their representative has referred  but even if the payment was made by Shawbrook Bank during the withdrawal period in breach of those 
regulations, Im not persuaded that Mr B and Ms B have suffered a loss as a result of 
that breach or that it caused their relationship with Shawbrook Bank to be unfair;
Im not persuaded that Mr B and Ms B have provided enough evidence to show that 
their relationship with Shawbrook Bank was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely 
that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr B and 
Ms B and Shawbrook Bank; 
Shawbrook Bank says that the holiday company had provided the incorrect 
compliance statement to Mr B and Ms B so had agreed to refund to Mr B and Ms B 
the £49 commission that it had received from Shawbrook Bank in relation to the loan 
agreement  I consider that to have been a fair and reasonable response to that 
issue and, if Mr B and Ms B havent received that refund from the holiday company 
and now wish to accept its offer, I suggest that they contact the holiday company;
I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to Mr B and Ms Bs claims under section 
75 and 140A claim was fair and reasonable in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr B and Ms B for the issues that theyve had with their 
membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require 
Shawbrook Bank to refund to them any of the money that they paid under the 
purchase agreement, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr B and Ms Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B and Ms B 
and Ms B to accept or reject my decision before 27 December 2022.
