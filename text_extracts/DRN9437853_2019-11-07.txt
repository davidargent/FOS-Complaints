K821x#15complaint
Mr A complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA has continued to send correspondence  
suggesting that he should pay more  than the minimum payment, even though  he asked it to 
stop. 
background
Mr A was first approved for a PayPal credit card account in June 2018. PayPal told us the 
first payment  was due in August 2018 and it would appear that Mr A has made the minimum 
payments since then.  
Mr A contacted PayPal  in March 2019  requesting that it stop sending  him communication  
about paying more than the minimum payment. PayPals communication was to let Mr A 
know that if he chose  to make larger payments each month, he would pay less in interest.
PayPal turned off paper  correspondence  for Mr As account on 30 April 2019 but continued 
to send him emails.
After Mr A complained to PayPal, it responded to say that as a responsible lender, and in 
accordance with the rules and guidance  issued by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), 
particularly around  persistent  debt and early intervention, its required to assess  a 
customers repayment behaviour over time and encourage customers to pay more  of their 
debt if they can. So, in essence, it suggested  it would continue  to send him some form of 
contact around this.
Unhappy with PayPals  response, Mr A referred  his complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into Mr As complaint and said it should  be upheld.  He 
acknowledged that the FCA does  require a lender to monitor  a customers  account and 
encourage them to repay  debt faster if they can, but that the rules dont say they must 
contact that customer every month. A customer doesnt need to be contacted until after an 
18-month period   and the account  hadnt even been open for this long. So he 
recommended PayPal make a payment  of £50 for the distress  and inconvenience caused. 
Mr A and PayPal disagreed with our investigators view.  Mr A thinks  that more should be 
done. PayPal  doesnt believe its done  anything wrong.
So the complaint has been passed  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
While it may come as a disappointment  to both parties,  Im upholding this complaint but not 
awarding compensation beyond that recommended by our investigator. 
Ref: DRN94378532PayPal has referenced the rules and guidance  issued by the FCA, alongside  being  a 
responsible lender, as the reason for its proactive approach to contacting Mr A. The FCA 
defined persistent debt as being a situation  where,  over a period of 18 months, a customer 
pays more in interest, fees and charges than theyve repaid  of the principal.  And it said that 
at 18 months, firms  would  need  to prompt customers in persistent debt to change  their 
repayment behaviour if they can afford  to.
But as Mr A first opened his credit card account  with PayPal in June 2018, it still hasnt been  
open for 18 months, as of today. So theres  no regulatory requirement  for it to contact Mr A 
in the way that it has been.  
PayPal has rightly said that it has a duty of care as a responsible lender to keep its 
customers informed of their requirements  to repay  any outstanding debt. But here, Mr A has 
asked PayPal to stop reminding him that he could pay more than the minimum payment to 
prevent being  charged more interest.  I appreciate PayPal opts to share this information  with 
its customers, including Mr A, but it doesnt necessarily need to do this each month. And, if 
its customer has specifically requested it stops  sending  this information, then it should 
comply with that request where its not required to send it. PayPal was able to stop letters 
being sent to him in April 2019,  and it should  now do the same  with emails, or other forms of 
communication. 
It seems  clear  to me that PayPal is trying  to make sure Mr A doesnt end up in a cycle  of 
persistent debt and is therefore encouraging him to pay more  than the minimum payment. 
But the point here is Mr A is meeting  his contractual obligation to make at least  the minimum 
payment and doesnt wish to be contacted  continuously about this. So PayPal should comply 
with his request.  But if Mr A is still making the minimum  payment after 18 months,  I would 
expect PayPal  in line with its regulatory  requirements - to get in touch to remind him that 
he can pay more of any debt he may owe to pay less in interest.  
I appreciate Mr A has experienced some  inconvenience  as he had to contact PayPal  several 
times to sort this problem out. And I appreciate it must have been frustrating to receive  
emails he doesnt  wish to receive. I note these emails can simply be read or deleted  but I 
recognise that he shouldnt have to do this, having  already  expressed  his dissatisfaction. I 
think the investigators recommendation of £50 compensation is a fair reflection of any 
trouble or upset  caused and I wont be asking  PayPal to do any more.   
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and instruct  PayPal to pay Mr A £50 
compensation for the distress  and inconvenience  this experience  had caused  him. I would 
also expect PayPal to adjust its communication with Mr A so he no longer receives  these 
emails.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 December 2019.
