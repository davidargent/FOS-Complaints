K820x#14Complaint
Mr S complains that NewDay Ltd pursued him for a debt he says he didnt recognise and 
then failed to explain what it was for. 
Background
In May 2017  an application was made in Mr Ss name for an Amazon credit card. The 
Amazon credit card is issued and administered by NewDay Ltd. A card was issued and in 
July 2017 used for a £28.88 purchase. That purchase appeared on a statement issued in 
August 2017 and the minimum payment was due by 7 September. No payment was made 
and NewDay contacted Mr S by telephone  and by letter seeking payment.  A £12 late 
payment fee and interest were  then added to the account each month. 
The account  was passed to a debt collection business in March 2018, and Mr S paid the 
purchase amount  of £28.88 shortly  afterwards. He hasnt paid the interest and fees that have 
accrued on the account, however. 
Mr S opened  a further Amazon credit card in August 2017. Spending on that account has 
been paid in full, and theres no dispute  arising from it; I mention it only as background. 
Mr S said he didnt  recognise the first account, and NewDay couldnt tell him how the 
spending arose. NewDay wouldnt send copy statements in a way that would enable  him to 
identify this. 
Mr S complained to NewDay  about  the way hed been treated. NewDay  said it was 
upholding his complaint and paid him £10 in recognition of that. Mr S remained dissatisfied, 
however, and referred the matter to this service. 
Out investigator looked into things.  She concluded  however that it was more likely than not 
that Mr S had opened the account and used it for the purchase in July 2017. When  no 
payment was made, NewDay  was entitled  to add interest and charges to the account  and to 
notify credit  reference  agencies  about the missed payments. 
Mr S accepted that he probably had opened  two accounts but forgotten  about  one of them.  
But, he said,  that was only part of his complaint. He remained unhappy that NewDay hadnt 
been able to help him find out what the debt was for and that it hadnt sent statements. He 
also pointed out that NewDay had accepted it was at fault. He asked that an ombudsman  
review the matter.             
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Since Mr S accepts that he probably did open  the first account but had overlooked it, I dont 
need to discuss  that issue  any further.  I can see why he might have suggested fraud  as a 
possible explanation,  but can see too that he now agrees this was not a case  of fraud. 
Mr S says that NewDay should  have been able to help him identify what  the payment for 
£28.88 was for. But the August 2017 statement records only a payment to Amazon. It seems 
to me, therefore, that Mr S was better  placed  than NewDay to find out that information   
through his Amazon account. In addition,  NewDay  has provided evidence that it did send 
Ref: DRN80633832email reminders to Mr S telling him that statements were available  to view through online 
account registration. During a call in September 2017 Mr S was told what  he needed  to do in 
order to view his account statements  online. I believe therefore that NewDay did what it 
could to help Mr S identify  the payment and arrange payment. 
I turn therefore to NewDays  handling  of Mr Ss complaint. In April 2018  it wrote to him and 
included in its letter:  we have upheld your complaint due to inconvenience  caused to you. 
In addition, as a gesture of goodwill, we have credited  £10 to your account for the 
inconvenience caused due to this matter  
A payment of £10 fell some way short of what Mr S had been seeking. To that extent, 
NewDay didnt really  uphold his complaint, and I think NewDay  might have explained that 
more clearly. It was upholding the complaint  only in the sense that it acknowledged it had 
done something wrong  namely,  its handling of one telephone call and delays  in sending 
paper statements.  But its primary  finding was that it was entitled  to payment. But, whilst I 
think that NewDay could  have been clearer about  what it meant here, it didnt suggest  that it 
was intending  to write off the debt or do anything other  than credit  the account  with £10.  
Mr S has also disputed  NewDays right to apply charges  and interest. But I agree with our 
investigator on this point. They appear to have been  applied  in line with the account terms 
and are not excessive.  Mr S may be able to negotiate a reduction in the amount he needs to 
pay, but hell need to take that up with the current owner of the debt. There also does not 
appear to be any reason  why NewDay shouldnt notify credit reference agencies  about the 
account. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont require NewDay Ltd to do anything more  to resolve Mr Ss 
complaint. Under  the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to 
accept or reject my decision  before  4 October  2019.
