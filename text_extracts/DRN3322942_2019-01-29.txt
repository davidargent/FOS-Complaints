K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains about the length of time he had to wait for an answer from National 
Westminster Bank Plcs (NatWest)  telephone  service. He says hes had similar experiences  
before and been given  compensation, so he wants NatWest to be consistent in its approach 
over such  matters.
background
Mr C has an account with NatWest. In August 2018  he called its automated  telephone 
service. He says he had to wait 28 minutes  for an answer. He complained to NatWest  about 
the length of the wait and wanted it to compensate him for his time. 
NatWest explained  that when Mr C had complained previously about similar issues it had 
offered him alternative ways to contact it including a Freephone number for the same  
service. So it said,  on this occasion, it wasnt going  to reimburse  him for the calls or his time.
Mr C agreed hed had many previous similar experiences.  But he says hes received 
compensation because NatWest agreed the waiting times hed experienced were outside of 
its service standards.  He said that as hed been waiting for a similar length of time on this 
occasion NatWest  should be consistent  and compensate him.   
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint but he thought NatWest had acted fairly in 
this case. Mr C didnt  agree. He said hed previously been  compensated for waits of 15 
minutes or longer so he believed  he should be compensated this time. As no resolution 
could be found  the case has been  passed to me for final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen that NatWest  has compensated Mr C for similar issues  a number of times since 
2012. And Ive some  sympathy for his position as he feels NatWest is being inconsistent  on 
this occasion.  But I dont think NatWest has made any errors here. I know this will come  as a 
disappointment to Mr C so Ill explain why.
Mr C said NatWest should compensate him because it breached its service standards. And I 
accept that NatWest (like many businesses)  would aim to answer as many calls as it can 
within a set timeframe. And I think its likely that  when referring  to service standards 
previously, NatWest was simply acknowledging that sometimes  calls arent  answered as 
quickly as it wouldve wanted to. 
But Ive not seen anything that would make me think NatWest has guaranteed  it would 
answer telephones calls with a specific timeframe. Or that compensation is automatically  
due when call waiting  times are longer than expected. 
NatWest says, in responding to Mr Cs previous complaints, that its given him a number of 
alternative ways he can contact it. Ive seen  copies of the responses which  have suggested 
Mr C could use the webchat facility, online banking, a mobile application and a freephone 
number for the same  automated  telephone  service.  So I think  NatWest  has given Mr C other  
options which dont  involve any costs and could  avoid possible lengthy call waiting times. 
Ref: DRN33229422NatWest says that because its made Mr C aware of these alternatives a number of times 
previously  and because it disputes he was on hold for 28 minutes,  it didnt offer any 
compensation on this occasion. On the other  hand Mr C believes that it should because of its 
previous actions. It was NatWests decision to give that compensation to Mr C. But Im looking at 
the circumstances in this case, so I cant say that NatWest should  have paid compensation on 
those occasions.  From time to time we all experience some inconvenience when dealing  with 
financial firms  but not to the extent that compensation is warranted. And I dont think  on this 
occasion that it was. 
  
Ultimately here Mr C says he spent up to around  30 minutes on his phone to NatWest.  
Theres no suggestion that he didnt achieve what he rang NatWest to get done  so he hasnt  
suffered any financial  loss. And I dont think NatWest has done anything  sufficiently wrong  to 
persuade me to award  compensation to Mr C. I dont think  theres an obligation for NatWest  
to automatically compensate someone  every  time they have a complaint and on this 
occasion Im satisfied with NatWests  explanation  for why it treated this complaint of Mr Cs 
differently.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint against National Westminster Bank 
Plc. Under  the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 March  2019.
