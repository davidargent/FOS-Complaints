DRN-2122598
The complaint
Mr D complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
RCI Financial Services Limited, trading as Nissan Finance, doesnt have all of the features 
that he was expecting. He also complains about other issues relating to the supply of the 
car.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mr D under a hire purchase agreement with Nissan 
Finance that he signed in June 2019 and the description of the car in the agreement 
was consistent with the description of the car on the order form that hed signed 
about a month earlier;
after hed collected the car, Mr D became aware that it didnt have the infotainment 
system that he was expecting and which he says was an important feature for him so 
he contacted the dealer and then complained to Nissan Finance and this service;
Mr D had enquired through a web-site about a car with a different specification and 
the dealer had provided him with a quote for it but had also provided him with a quote 
for the car that was supplied to him;
Mr D ordered that car, it was his decision to do so and Ive seen no evidence to 
support his claim that he enquired about the infotainment system or was told by the 
dealer that it included the latest infotainment system  and in an e-mail to the dealer 
after hed collected the car he said: I kind of gave for granted that the vehicle would 
have it as I know that all new models are equipped with it;
I understand how disappointing and frustrating it must be that the car doesnt have all 
of the features that Mr D was expecting it to have, but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the dealer gave him incorrect information about the 
car or that it misrepresented the car to him  and I dont consider that the dealer was 
required to give him more information about the features that the car did and didnt 
have unless he asked about them;
Mr D also says that he paid for the chrome pack but the car doesnt have the chrome 
wing mirrors that he was expecting  the dealer says that the chrome pack only 
includes front and rear bumper finishes and Im not persuaded that theres enough to 
show that Mr D was told that the chrome pack included chrome wing mirrors;
Mr D has also complained about the service provided by the delay in relation to the 
collection of the car and the provision of a courtesy car - and also about an issue with 
the car  he clearly feels very strongly about some of those issues and Ive carefully 
read his detailed response to the investigators recommendations;
I sympathise with him for those issues but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the dealer has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr D in any 
significant way, or that would require further action by Nissan Finance; and
I dont consider that Nissan Finance has acted incorrectly in its response to Mr Ds 
complaint and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for 
me to require it to allow Mr D to reject the car, to pay him any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 January 2021.
