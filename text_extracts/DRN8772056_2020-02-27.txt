K820x#14complaint
The trustees of Mr Gs life policy trust complain  that Aviva Life Services  UK Limited have not 
paid out the right amount  of death  benefit  under Mr Gs Whole  of Life (WOL)  policy on the 
death of Mr G.
background
Mr G took out a reviewable  unit-linked WOL policy through Norwich Union  now Aviva  
which provided a sum assured of £50,000  at a premium of £31.13 with the policy  being  
placed in trust.
The policy was reviewed  after 10 years  and then every five years, with the last review  before 
Mr Gs death being  in 2015. The amount paid out by Aviva  on the death of Mr G was 
£24,180. Mrs G is the beneficiary  under the trust and she thought  the amount shouldve  
been the original sum assured of £50,000  and a complaint was made to Aviva about  this.
Aviva investigated the complaint but didnt agree that it had paid out the wrong  amount. One 
of our investigators considered the complaint but didnt think it should  be upheld.  She said 
Aviva had sent review  letters explaining  the options  Mr G had and these werent unclear or 
misleading. She acknowledged  that Aviva had made  a mistake  in the 2015 review but these 
were clarified and put right by Aviva  in 2015.  She said the amount it had paid out on the 
death of Mr G was the right amount in the circumstances.
Mrs G didnt agree with the investigator and, in short, made  the following points:
The original documents dont give any indication  that the policy  would be 
reviewed. 
The clarity of choices available left a lot to be desired  and the wording is 
unclear to a lay person.
She does not all have  all the documents from Aviva but after a letter  dated 
6 February 2015 which referred  to the cover remaining the same for at least  
30 days things get very confusing.
She is sure that the response  from Mr G and the trustees to the letter  of 
December 2015 to keep everything  the same  and increase  the fund value 
was understood  to mean the value of the policy would  remain  the same.
Aviva  has made mistake after mistake and no consideration has been given 
to this by the investigator.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have considered the documents  Mr G was provided with when he took out the policy. I 
acknowledge that the schedule itself doesnt  make any reference  to the policy  being 
reviewable. But the key features document he will have  received states  that the £50,000 of 
cover is guaranteed for 10 years and explains that after this the policy  will be reviewed. This 
was also repeated in the Technical Information  document Mr G will have  been  given.
So Im satisfied Mr G was given the information he needed when he took out the policy to 
understand it was reviewable and that the sum assured of £50,000  was only guaranteed  for 
Ref: DRN87720562the first 10 years. I also think Mr G and the other trustees understood this is how the policy  
worked, given in 2005 and 2015  they chose to reduce  the sum assured on receipt of the 
review documents.  If they thought the sum assured was guaranteed  and the premium  would 
remain the same throughout Mr Gs lifetime I can see no reason they wouldve agreed to 
reduce the cover in 2005 and 2015, or why a complaint wasnt  raised at the first review.
The review  letter in 2005 indicated there wouldnt  be enough money  in the plan on 
14 January 2010   the next review date  to keep the level of death benefit  at £50,000. A 
change request form was sent with the letter  which  explained that if there was no response 
the death benefit would reduce  to £45,208.  But it also gave the option of increasing the 
premium to £37.27  to keep the benefit  at £50,000.  There is nothing  unclear or ambiguous 
about the options that were set out.
Aviva sent a chaser  letter dated 24 September 2005, with a further change request form, 
asking for a response by 17 October 2005.  The change request  form was duly returned,  
signed by Mr G and the two other  trustees  and confirming they wanted to maintain the 
premium at £31.13  and reduce the death  benefit  to £45,208. 
This was a clear choice  made by Mr G and the other trustees not to increase the premium to 
keep the death benefit at £50,000.  This was followed by a letter  dated 10 October 2005 
enclosing a policy alteration statement that showed  the guaranteed  death benefit going 
forwards as £45,208.
The outcome of the next review after a further  five years is shown in a letter  dated  
24 December 2009. As it was anticipated the policy  would maintain its benefits  until the next 
review there was no need to do anything and the sum assured remained at £45,208 with the 
premium at £31.13.
The next review  letter is dated 9 December  2014 and this warned that there was a high risk 
that the policy may not sustain the benefits. The letter indicated that payments could be 
increased to maintain the benefits  or the premium could be kept the same and the benefits 
reduced. 
The option  selection form sent with the letter showed the only options as a reduction of the 
death benefit from £45,208  to £24,180  - with the premium to remain  the same  - or to leave 
the policy unchanged - in which case it states  the policy wouldnt support the benefits for its 
whole term.
Aviva then wrote to Mr G on the 6 February 2015 referring to Mrs G having contacted it 
about the latest review. It stated that the review  shouldnt have been issued as it contained  
errors. It said Mr G shouldve been given the option of increasing the premium  to keep the 
death benefit the same. It stated that a revised  review would be issued and that the premium  
of £31.13 and death benefit of £45,208  would remain unchanged for at least 30 days  after 
receipt of the letter.
The revised review was communicated to Mr G by letter dated  10 February 2015 which gave  
three options as set out in the enclosed options form. The first was to increase the premium 
from £31.13 to £68.79 and leave the death  benefit  unchanged at £45,208. The second was 
to keep the premium  the same but reduce the death benefit to £24,180, which  was also the 
default option if no response  was received.
Ref: DRN87720563I have seen no evidence  that Mr G returned  the options form so the default  option was 
applied at that time and the death  benefit was reduced to £24,180. This was confirmed by 
Aviva in a letter to Mr G dated 20 March  2015 which enclosed an endorsement showing the 
changes made to the policy.  This clearly refers  to the death benefit decreasing from £45,208 
to £24,180. So as at the time Mr G received the endorsement I think the amount of death 
benefit was clear.
 
Aviva did then write to him on 4 December 2015  informing him that it hadnt  always  done the 
reviews correctly so the figures given when the policy was reviewed werent correct and the 
options given  may also not have been right. The letter  and attached explanatory document  
then set out what the options were to rectify  this.
The first option was to keep the premium at £31.13  and the sum assured at £24,180   in 
other words the position Mr G was aware  the policy was in as a result  of the correspondence 
in March 2015. The second option shows a premium of £62.20  and a sum assured of 
£45,208. The third option shows a premium  of £31.13 but a slightly lower sum assured than 
the first option of £23,650 - this was also the default option.
Mr G and the trustees signed the instruction form they were sent choosing the first option  
to leave the premium  and sum assured unchanged at £31.13 and £24,180  respectively.  As 
with the review in 2005 I think the options  were clear and Mr G and the trustees wouldve 
known the amount payable on the death  of Mr G after December 2015 would be £24,180 not 
any other amount.
I note that Mrs G has said no account has been taken of the mistakes made by Aviva and 
that the choices  were  unclear and everything was confused after the letter of 6 February 
2015. I acknowledge that Avivas administration of the policy  was poor,  but this doesnt  
mean Mrs G is entitled to any more from the policy. As I have already said, I think Mr G and 
the other trustees  were given clear  options in 2005  and 2015  and chose the options  they 
wanted and knew  the amount of death benefit  that would be paid out as result  of their 
choices. 
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint for the reasons I have explained.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask the trustees of 
Mr Gs life policy trust to accept or reject my decision before 27 March 2020.
