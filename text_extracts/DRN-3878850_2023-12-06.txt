The complaint
Mr G complains that Honeycomb Finance Limited wont refund to him the money that he 
paid for some holiday club membership credits. His wife is also involved in his complaint and 
hes being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr G and his wife had bought holiday products from a holiday company in July 2016 and 
August 2017. They then entered into a membership application agreement in August 2018 to 
buy 14,000 level three holiday club membership credits from the holiday company. The 
membership price was £19,085 and Mr G also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Honeycomb Finance for a loan of that amount. He agreed to make 179 monthly payments of 
£194.82 and a final payment of £195.32 to Honeycomb Finance, but he repaid the loan in 
November 2018.
Mr Gs representative, on behalf of Mr G, made claims to Honeycomb Finance in January 
2022 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said, in summary and 
amongst other things, that: the membership credits were mis-sold to Mr G and his wife and, 
but for the misrepresentations made to them, they wouldnt have purchased them nor 
entered into the loan agreement; the holiday company is in liquidation and cant provide the 
service sold so is in breach of contract; the terms of the agreement are so egregious as to 
be unfair; the payment of commission was hidden from view; the membership credits were 
marketed as an investment and were sold to Mr G and his wife under extreme sales 
pressure and they werent given the opportunity to consider any other creditors; no 
affordability checks were carried out on Mr Gs ability to afford the loan; and his relationship 
with Honeycomb Finance was unfair.
Honeycomb Finance responded to those claims in detail and set out the reasons that it 
denied and rejected all of the allegations contained within Mr Gs representatives claim 
letter. Mr G wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. Mr G 
and his wife signed a complaint form in which they wrote: Honeycomb Finance agreed to 
lend money through [the holiday company] to us, without checking to see if the product was 
legal or cost worthy. The [membership credits] system is not fit for purpose. We bought a 
product that doesnt live up to the promise at the point of sale. 
Mr Gs representative also sent an unsigned complaint form to this service that says: 
Honeycomb Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to 
Mr G; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mr Gs ability to afford 
the loan; the holiday company unduly pressured Mr G into entering into the membership 
application agreement and the loan agreement and used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure him; the membership credits were misrepresented to Mr G and his wife; the holiday 
company marketed and sold the credits as an investment in breach of the Timeshare 
Regulations; the holiday company is in liquidation so is in breach of contract; and Mr G and 
his wife werent provided with key information necessary for them to be able to make an 
informed decision regarding their purchase; all rendering the loan agreement unfair under 
section 140A; and it said that the complaint should also be considered under section 75.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Gs complaint should be upheld. She didnt think 
that Honeycomb Finances decision to turn down Mr Gs claims was unfair or unreasonable. 
She wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt 
think that the holiday company had breached the contract. She said that shed seen that no 
commission was paid to the holiday company by Honeycomb Finance in relation to this 
purchase and that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr G 
and Honeycomb Finance was unfair, and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the 
conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She also said that she hadnt seen anything 
persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr G.
Mr G hasnt accepted our investigators recommendation and his representative says that it 
would like the matter referred to an ombudsman for a decision. Mr G says that hes still 
paying off the loan but has nothing to show for it other than upset and disappointment at how 
he and his wife have been treated by the holiday company. He says that they were led to 
believe that they could sell a portion of their membership credits back to the holiday 
company to cover the fee after an 18 month waiting period but apparently that was never the 
case. He says that they were told they could use the same grade of room that they had with 
their previous deal but on their first booking using the membership credits the holiday 
company wanted an extra £500 for a one week stay. He also says that another finance 
provider has reimbursed its customers and that Honeycomb Finance should reimburse him.
Mr G representative has provided an addendum containing Mr Gs additional arguments 
which says, in summary and amongst other things, that: the product was sold to Mr G and 
his wife as an investment; the holiday company represented to them that trading-in their 
existing product for the membership credits was the only method of realising their investment 
on their earlier purchases; the re-sale scheme would be open for members five years 
following the start of a membership but the holiday companys resale programme opened in 
2015 and is now discontinued; the holiday company breached the Timeshare Regulations 
and misrepresented the membership credits as something that could be re-sold easily in the 
future; and, were it not for the representations, Mr G and his wife wouldnt have purchased 
the membership credits and traded-in their existing product.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Gs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
the addendum containing Mr Gs additional arguments says Mr G and his wife had 
bought holiday products from the holiday company in July 2016 and August 2017 but 
Ive not been provided with any of the contractual documentation for those 
purchases, and Mr Gs complaint only relates to the purchase that they made in 
August 2018 and which he paid for using a loan provided by Honeycomb Finance;
Mr Gs representative says that Mr G and his wife traded in their existing product in 
August 2018 for 14,000 membership credits and they entered into a membership 
application agreement with the holiday company at that time for the purchase  the 
agreement shows that the membership price was £19,085 but Ive not been provided 
with the terms and conditions that are referred to in that agreement or any of the 
other contractual documentation that its likely that Mr G and his wife would have also 
signed with the holiday company at that time;
Mr G also entered into a loan agreement with Honeycomb Finance in August 2018 
and he confirmed that hed received pre-contract credit information and a loan information document;
Mr Gs representative made claims to Honeycomb Finance in January 2022 under 
sections 75 and 140A and a complaint was then made to this service: section 75 
gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or 
the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section are met); and section 
140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay 
any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an 
unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Gs claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Honeycomb 
Finances response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
the January 2022 claim letter says that it was represented to Mr G and his wife by the 
holiday company before their August 2018 purchase that: their current product was 
unsellable as part of the re-sale scheme and that they would be required to purchase 
the membership credits if it was their intention to sell their product at a profit; the 
holiday company was ceasing to trade in timeshare apartments; the membership 
credits were marketed and sold as an investment; and the membership credits were 
available for a greatly reduced discount price but only if purchased on that day;
the claim letter says that those were false and misleading representations made to 
induce Mr G and his wife into entering into the membership application agreement 
but the letter doesnt include a detailed account of the circumstances in which the 
alleged misrepresentations were made, the conversations that took place or the 
information that was provided to Mr G and his wife before their August 2018 
purchase;
the complaint form that was signed by Mr G and his wife says: Honeycomb Finance 
agreed to lend money through [the holiday company] to us, without checking to see if 
the product was legal or cost worthy. The [membership credits] system is not fit for 
purpose. We bought a product that doesnt live up to the promise at the point of sale; 
but it doesnt contain an explanation of the reasons why they consider the 
membership credits to be illegal or not fit for purpose;
Mr G and his wife agreed to pay the membership price of £19,085 for the 
membership credits and I dont consider that there was any requirement for 
Honeycomb Finance to check that the membership price was cost worthy; 
Mr G says in response to our investigators recommendation, that he and his wife 
were led to believe that they could sell a portion of their credits back to the holiday 
company to cover the fee after an 18 month waiting period and that they could use 
the same grade of room that they had with their previous deal but on their first 
booking using the membership credits the holiday company wanted an extra £500 for 
a one week stay  and the addendum containing Mr Gs additional arguments says 
that the membership credits were marketed and sold to Mr G and his wife as an 
investment and that the re-sale scheme would be open for members five years 
following the start of a membership but the resale programme opened in 2015 and is 
now discontinued;
neither Mr G nor his representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which it was represented to Mr G and his wife that the membership 
credits were an investment, the conversations that took place, the information that 
was provided to them before their August 2018 purchase or any documentary or 
other evidence to show that it was represented to them that the membership credits 
were an investment;I understand that the membership credits can be used for accommodation and 
experiences and Im not persuaded that its likely that the membership credits would 
properly be considered to be an investment and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the membership credits were misrepresented to Mr G 
and his wife as an investment, or that they were marketed or sold to Mr G and his 
wife as an investment in breach of the Timeshare Regulations;
Honeycomb Finance says that the resale facility wasnt available to Mr G and his wife 
until 2020 at the earliest but there was a worldwide pandemic which compromised 
resale opportunities and, in August 2018 the holiday company couldnt have foreseen 
what the market conditions would be in 2020 - it also says that the management 
companys website says that members can register their interest to sell a 
membership entitlement; 
theres no reference in the documents that Mr G has provided from the time of sale to 
show that the holiday company had said that a resale scheme would be available 
and Ive seen no evidence to show any steps that Mr G and his wife have taken to try 
to re-sell their membership credits;
neither Mr G nor his representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the other alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to them and which 
caused the membership credits to have been misrepresented to them;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
misrepresented the membership credits to Mr G and his wife, that they were mis-sold 
to them or that they were induced into buying them by any such misrepresentations;
the claim letter also says that the holiday company is in liquidation and cant provide 
the service sold so is in breach of contract but Honeycomb Finance says that at no 
time have the rights of use and occupation of Mr G and his wifes membership been 
affected by the liquidation of the previous management company and the 
appointment of the new management company;
I consider that the liquidation of the holiday company could be a breach of contract 
for which Honeycomb Finance might have liability under section 75 - but I consider 
the appointment of the new management company to have been a suitable remedy 
for any such breach of contract and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr G and his 
wifes use of their membership credits has been adversely impacted by the 
liquidation of the holiday company;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any other 
breach of contract, or any breach of any applicable regulation by the holiday 
company for which Honeycomb Finance would be liable under section 75 in these 
circumstances;
as well as claiming that the membership credits were misrepresented to Mr G and his 
wife and that theres been a breach of contract, the January 2022 claim letter makes 
other claims, including that: the terms of the agreement are so egregious as to be 
unfair; the payment of commission was hidden from view; the membership credits 
were sold to Mr G and his wife under extreme sales pressure and they werent given 
the opportunity to consider any other creditors; no affordability checks were carried 
out on Mr Gs ability to afford the loan; and his relationship with Honeycomb Finance 
was unfair;
Mr Gs representative says that the terms of the agreement are so egregious as to be 
unfair  but it hasnt provided the terms and conditions or said which of the terms it 
considers to be unfair;it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the terms in the 
agreements that Mr G and his wife entered into in August 2018 are unfair but I dont 
consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is likely to 
mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship between a 
debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated in practice 
and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr G and his wife and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr G and Honeycomb 
Finance;
Mr Gs representative says the payment of commission was hidden from view but 
Honeycomb Finance says that there was no commission arrangement between it and 
the holiday company and Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that 
Honeycomb Finance paid a commission to the holiday company;
Mr Gs representative says that no affordability checks were carried out on Mr Gs 
ability to afford the loan but Honeycomb Finance says that there were full credit 
checks, including affordability and eligibility, and its provided evidence showing that 
Mr G asked it for a settlement quote in November 2018 and then made payments of 
£10,000 and £9,204.87 later that month to settle the loan;
Mr G says that hes still paying off the loan but neither he nor his representative has 
provided any evidence to show that the loan wasnt repaid in November 2018 or that 
the loan wasnt affordable for Mr G when it was made to him in August 2018;
Mr Gs representative says that Mr G and his wife werent given the opportunity to 
consider any other creditors but Mr G confirmed that hed seen and read the loan 
information document which said: The duration or term of the agreement is 180 
months. If you want a shorter repayment period or to make separate purchases over 
a period of time you may wish to consider whether an alternative product is more 
suitable for your requirements;
the loan was made to Mr G in August 2018 and he spoke with Honeycomb Finance 
in November 2018 to ask for a settlement quote but theres no reference in the file 
notes that Honeycomb Finance has provided to show that Mr G complained about 
the loan being unaffordable for him or that he wasnt given the opportunity to 
consider any other creditors and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr G, that the loan was mis-sold to him or 
that Honeycomb Finance has acted incorrectly in connection with the loan;
Mr Gs representative says that the membership credits were sold to Mr G and his 
wife under extreme sales pressure but theyd bought other holiday products from the 
holiday company in July 2016 and August 2017 so I would expect them to have been 
prepared for the sales tactics that might be used by the holiday company before they 
went into the sales presentation in August 2018 and that, if they didnt want to buy 
the membership credits, they would have made that clear to the holiday company at 
that time;
Mr G and his wife had the right to withdraw from the membership application 
agreement within fourteen days without giving any reason but Ive seen no evidence 
to show that they contacted either the holiday company or Honeycomb Finance to 
withdraw from the membership application agreement within the withdrawal period;
the loan agreement that Mr G electronically signed in August 2018 said that he had 
the right to withdraw from the loan agreement without giving any reason for a period 
of fourteen days but Ive seen no evidence to show that he contacted Honeycomb Finance to withdraw from the loan agreement within that period;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr G and his wife were 
unduly pressured into buying the membership credits in August 2018, that Mr G was 
unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptably aggressive commercial practices against them;
Mr Gs representative has also referred to breaches by the holiday company of the 
Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 and 
the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008  and the addendum 
containing Mr Gs additional arguments says that the holiday company failed to 
provide the necessary information required by the regulations;
neither Mr G nor his representative has identified the information that was necessary 
for Mr G and his wife to make an informed decision regarding the purchase but 
wasnt provided to them by the holiday company and I dont consider that theyve 
provided all of the documentation that would have been provided to Mr G and his 
wife at the time of the purchase;
Mr G and his wife have made other purchases from the holiday company and I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have been aware of the 
information that they needed before they made a decision to buy the membership 
credits in August 2018 and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that theres been a breach of either of those regulations;
having considered all of the information and evidence that Mr G and his 
representative have provided, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that Mr Gs relationship with Honeycomb Finance was unfair and I dont 
consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr G and Honeycomb Finance in these circumstances;
Mr G says that another finance provider has reimbursed its customers and that 
Honeycomb Finance should reimburse him  but the reimbursement policy of another 
finance provider is a matter for that finance provider and doesnt mean that 
Honeycomb Finance should also be required to offer to reimburse its customers - I 
can only require Honeycomb Finance to take any action in these circumstances if I 
consider that its response to Mr Gs claims wasnt fair or reasonable;
I sympathise with Mr G for the issues that he and his wife had with their membership 
credits and the upset and disappointment that they feel, but I consider that 
Honeycomb Finances response to the claims that had been made to it was fair and 
reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Honeycomb Finance to refund to Mr G any of the money that he paid under the loan 
agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2024.
