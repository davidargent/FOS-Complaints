K821x#15complaint
Miss T has complained about a number of loans she took out through  a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Miss T says she was lent 
to irresponsibly and the loans caused her financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Miss T took out 9 instalment  loans from Sunny between  April 2015 and 
October 2016. Ive enclosed a summary  of Miss Ts borrowing  with Sunny, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  we should uphold it 
about loans 3 to 9. Sunny initially said it hadnt  done anything wrong, but later it said it was 
prepared to make an offer in respect of loans 8 and 9 (only). Miss T has asked for an 
ombudsmans final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice, on our website. Ive followed this approach when  thinking  about Miss Ts 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Miss T 
could repay  all the loans she was given  in a sustainable manner. These  checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN85036062There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss T could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  a loan being affordable on this basis might  be an indication that Miss T could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Miss T including assessing  her income,  expenditure and creditworthiness.  It says all this 
information showed that she would  be able to make the loan repayments  she was 
committing to. Ive thought about this and also looked at the overall pattern of lending  history 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans to Miss T. 
Ive also taken account of what Ive said above, about the length of the lending  relationship,  
and applied  it to the circumstances of loans 1 and 2 in this case. And I dont think its clear 
enough that what Sunny would have would have  seen,  from its checks,  suggested loans 1 or 
2 were either  unaffordable  for Miss T or that the information from the checks it carried  out 
undermined the income or outgoings Miss T had declared. 
I accept that Miss T may have already been  finding managing her money quite  difficult at this 
point. However, theres no clear  record that the type or depth of credit checks  that were  
carried out at that time would have exposed  these issues. So Im afraid I dont agree that 
Sunny knew its lending was unsustainable.  I therefore dont uphold this part of the complaint.
However, I think from the point of loan number 3 the situation was different. When  Miss T 
applied for this loan it was her 3rd such loan in less than 2 months. Although shed  paid back  
one of these loans, one was still outstanding at the point she was applying  for loan number 
3. This meant that the monthly repayments  to Sunny were around  £316 at that point.
Ive looked carefully  at what Miss Ts declared income was at the time. I note it was relatively  
low and it differed from the declared income for her (recent) loans, 1 and 2.  I think  this 
would have been worthy of more stringent verification and financial checking to make sure it 
was correct and affordable.  But looking at what her monthly repayments were to Sunny at 
the point of loan number  3, I think this represented a substantial  portion of her disposable 
income and I think it would have been apparent that she would have problems paying it all 
back. So I dont  think it was responsible to lend Miss T loan number 3 because it wasnt 
affordable and I uphold the complaint in respect of this loan.
Loan 4 was taken out after shed made  some  repayments to previous loans but again,  she 
still had other borrowing  outstanding with Sunny  which meant  the overall monthly repayment 
increased again. I think this was unaffordable and unsustainable for Miss T. I accept loan 5 
then came about at a time when, due to paying down previous borrowing, the monthly  
repayment figure did see a reduction, which no doubt might have provided  temporary  rest-
Ref: DRN85036063bite for Miss T. But nevertheless,  at £650 this was her largest Sunny loan so far and in my 
view, unsustainable  over the term given what should  have been  known  about  Miss Ts 
situation. So I dont  think it was responsible to lend her the money for loans 4 or 5 either and 
I uphold the complaint in respect  of these.
By loan 6 onwards, there was a clear pattern emerging of repeated  and irresponsible 
lending. This was Miss Ts 6th loan in a year; it was the highest yet (£900). And in common 
with much of her borrowing pattern thus far, she was again  asking  to borrow from Sunny 
relatively quickly after paying off a previous loan. Sunny ought to have realised that Miss T 
was probably borrowing  to meet regular shortfalls in her income and to meet  an ongoing 
need. She was having to consistently take out high interest, short-term  lending and her 
indebtedness was becoming unsustainable. Sunny  should have  seen this and ought to have 
realised Miss T was at risk of not managing to repay  her loans sustainably. 
So Im upholding  this complaint in respect of loans 6, 7, 8 and 9 too. For these loans, Sunny 
repeatedly lent to Miss T in an unsustainable  manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Miss T borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost  loans.
Ive taken into account what Sunny has said but her actually  paying off many  of these loans 
successfully. But to me, this only demonstrates  the narrow view Sunny took of Miss Ts 
financial situation and the benefit of hindsight it now has. I think  a more proportionate  and 
comprehensive assessment of her situation would  have  exposed that Miss T had undertaken 
other borrowing and was experiencing financial hardship as a result.
putting things right
In order to put things  right for Miss T, Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges Miss T paid on loans 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Miss Ts credit file in relation to loan 3, 
4 and 5.
The overall pattern  of Miss Ts borrowing for loans 6, 7, 8 and 9 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse so Sunny should completely remove 
these loans from her credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Miss T a certificate  
showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I partially uphold  Miss Ts complaint and direct Elevate Credit International Limited to put 
things right as set out above. 
Ref: DRN85036064Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 March 2020.
