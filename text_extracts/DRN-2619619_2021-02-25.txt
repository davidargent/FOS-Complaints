The complaint
Mr B complains that TSB Bank plc failed to recover his money after he accidentally sent it to 
the wrong account.
What happened
In 2020 Mr B transferred £200 to a third party. Shortly afterwards he realised he had sent it 
to the wrong person. He immediately told his bank, TSB. TSB contacted the recipients bank 
and asked it to return the money. In due course, that other bank told TSB that it was unable 
to recover the money because the account was empty.
TSB told Mr B to ask the recipient to return the money. He spoke to her on the phone. He 
says she agreed to return the money, but she never did. Instead she stopped answering his 
calls and then blocked him from sending her text messages.
Mr B brought this complaint to our Service. He asked us to make TSB refund his money. But 
our investigator did not uphold this complaint, saying that TSB had done all it could. Mr B 
asked for an ombudsman to review this case.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I regret that my decision will come as a disappointment to Mr B, but I am afraid that our 
investigator was right. TSB did what it was supposed to do, and it acted in a timely manner  
the same day. But unfortunately, what happened to the money was beyond its control. The 
person who received the £200 was not a TSB customer, and her account was at another 
bank.
By the time the other bank had investigated (which it did within the permitted timescale), the 
money was gone from the account. TSB isnt responsible for that. All TSB could do was 
report back to Mr B that the money was gone. I would not expect TSB to do more than that.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 March 2021.
