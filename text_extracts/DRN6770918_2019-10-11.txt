K821x#15complaint
Miss S complains  that Provident Personal Credit Limited lent to her in 2010 when she could 
not afford  it. 
She also complains that she has to repay  the interest and charges added  over several years 
but she was not informed  about these. 
background
Miss S took five loans and using the Provident information I have created a table which gives 
a brief summary of the loan details. For accuracy  on exact figures  the Provident Statements  
of account need to be referred to. This is a summary  for illustration purposes only.

5 £300 £225 56 x £10.50 16 December 2010both repaid  
September 2019
The Provident Statements of Account show me that Loan 2 overlapped with Loan 1 and so 
from mid-February 2010 Miss S was repaying  £20 each week. 
Provident says that Miss S debt was sold to a third party in September  2014. Miss S has 
sent me copy correspondence from that third party who confirms that the debt for two 
agreements had been purchased and assigned to it. These were Loans 4 and 5.  
One of our adjudicators looked  at this complaint and thought that these loans were not 
affordable and should not have been  approved for Miss S. She recommended that Provident  
put things right for Miss S in relation to each of the five loans. 
Miss S has agreed with this opinion. She has explained that she has repaid the last 
outstanding sum for the last loan on 30 September 2019. 
Provident has not responded and so the complaint has been passed  to me for a decision.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.  We 
have set out our general approach to complaints about high cost loans and short-term 
lending on our website.  
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner 
without it adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
Ref: DRN67709182they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. The 
key element was that any checks needed  to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different  things,  including how much was being lent and when  the sum being  
borrowed was due to be repaid. 
Provident says that it carried out appropriate  checks and was satisfied that Miss S was able 
to afford the debt.  
Miss S has sent to me explanations about her personal circumstances in 2009 and 2010. 
I have received copy P60s from her employment for the year to April 2010 and to April 2011 
which show that she earned just under £2,665 in 2009-2010 and about £3,200 in 2010-2011.
These figures translate into about £51 and £61 a week respectively.
Miss S has explained she received an education maintenance allowance (EMA)  of £30 for 
her college  study days. She was living with her parents at home  and had a dependant. 
Miss S was on a low wage and although she was living  at home  she will have had costs and 
expenditure for herself  and one dependant. Miss S has explained  that she used the £30 
EMA for her college  days and so that would have left £51 a week  likely less than that  
when Loan 1 was approved. Her repayments were £10 a week  at first and then within a few 
weeks - in February 2010  Miss S would have been paying £20 a week as Loans 1 and 2 
overlapped. And these repayments would  have been a large portion of her weekly income 
and very large  proportions  of her disposable  weekly income even with very modest 
spending. 
In these circumstances, there was a significant risk that Miss S would not have been able to 
meet her existing commitments without having  to borrow again. So, I think it is unlikely 
Miss S would have  been able to sustainably  meet  the monthly repayments for Loan 1 and 
certainly not for Loans  1 and 2 combined.  
I think that Loan 2 was refinanced into Loan  3 (at the same time as paying off Loan  1) as the 
Statement of Account  for Loan 2 shows a large payment of £122.09  and an early settlement 
refund (ESR) of £17.91 to settle it on 22 June 2010.  
I think that Loan 3 was refinanced into Loan  4 as the Statements of Account show that on 
the 19 October 2010 Loan 3 was repaid  with a large sum - £422.68 - and Miss S was given  
an ESR of £52.32.  
This demonstrates  continual refinancing  of the loans and ought to have alerted Provident  
that she was not in a position  to repay  these loans  without having to borrow  again.  And the 
amounts Miss S was repaying  each week had increased but her income each week  had not 
increased much. 
I uphold Miss S complaint in relation to Loans  3 to 5. 
Miss S appears to have paid Loan  4 quite regularly until 1 March 2011 and then collections 
stopped. For Loan  5 collections  ceased  around 1 March  2011. After a gap, Miss S 
recommenced paying about £6 a week and has now repaid the debt. 
One specific aspect  of the complaint  was not covered in our adjudicators view. This was that 
Miss S Provident agent stopped collecting around  March 2011 which led to her being 
unaware of the interest and charges being  added  to an account. Miss S moved  house  and 
Ref: DRN67709183then noticed the debt on her credit file. After  Miss S contacted Provident  it wrote to her with a 
notice of the arrears.  This was in 2014  and so the interest and charges had become high. 
Then she was contacted  by the third party agent.  No default was added  to her credit file, but 
I have seen a screenshot  which shows that the payments for it showed  on her file as being 
late. Since then Miss S has repaid at a rate of about £6 a week  since  1 November 2014 until 
recently. 
I will direct  that Provident put things  right by refunding all the interest and charges  and so 
this payment of many  years of interest  and charges will be corrected.  So  I do not think  that 
anything further  needs to be said on this aspect of the complaint.
putting things right
Provident should do as follows:
calculate the total of the repayments made  by Miss S towards interest and charges  
on these loans, including any payments  made to a third party;
calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Miss S from the 
date she originally made them to the date the complaint is settled; and
add the sums arising from the above  two calculations together and pay them to 
Miss S; and
remove any adverse payment information  recorded on Miss S credit  file in relation to 
each of these  loans. Where the third party may have made entries  onto her credit file, 
Provident must ask it to amend its entries in relation to these loans for Miss S in the 
same way.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  Provident  to deduct tax from this interest figure. It should  give Miss 
S a certificate showing  how much was deducted if she asks for one. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss S complaint and direct  that Provident Personal Credit 
Limited do as I have set out above. Under  the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  
Im required  to ask Miss S to accept or reject my decision before 11 November 2019.
