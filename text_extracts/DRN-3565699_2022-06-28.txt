The complaint
Miss J complains that although MotoNovo Finance Limited (MotoNovo) accepted the
finance they had provided was mis-sold; they didnt acknowledge it was lent irresponsibly.
She is also unhappy that to resolve her complaint they offered £150 in recognition of the
distress and inconvenience caused rather than offer a refund of the interest paid.
What happened
I issued my provisional decision on this complaint in May 2022. An extract from that 
provisional decision is set out below.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont currently agree with our investigators view on this complaint and Im expecting to tell
MotoNovo to take some further action. Ill explain why.
When MotoNovo provided their final response to Miss J they accepted that the finance had
been mis-sold to her because it wasnt affordable. I dont think they had to say the money
had been provided irresponsibly as I think that was clear in their response.
I wont reconsider that irresponsible lending decision, but I will consider whether the redress
MotoNovo offered was fair.
I dont think the investigator has taken account of the fact the car was taken back before the
agreement ended. Interest was being charged on each monthly payment and I dont think its
fair to suggest that because the capital hadnt been paid there should be no refund of the
interest that had been, up to the point the car was returned. 
When we decide a business ought not to have approved lending we try to put the consumer 
back in the position they would have been in had the agreement not been mis-sold. We 
usually tell the business to refund all the payments the consumer has made, including any 
deposit. But, we think the consumer should pay for any use they have had from the goods.
Here, Miss J voluntarily terminated her agreement in December 2018, so I think its fair she
pays for the use she had from it from 2015 when the agreement started. But Im not
persuaded that monthly repayments of over £183 are a fair reflection of what fair usage
would be. This is because a proportion of those repayments went towards repaying interest.
There isnt an exact formula for working out what a fair usage should be. In deciding whats
fair and reasonable Ive thought about the amount of interest charged on the agreement,
Miss Js likely overall usage of the car and what her costs to stay mobile would likely have
been if she didnt have it. In doing so, I think a fair amount Miss J should pay is £121 for
each month she had use of the car. This means MotoNovo can only ask her to repay a total
of £4,598. Anything Miss J has paid in excess of that amount should be treated as an
overpayment.
To settle Miss Js complaint, Im therefore expecting to tell MotoNovo to:
Refund all the payments Miss J has made, less £4,598 for fair usage.
oIf Miss J has paid more than the fair usage figure, MotoNovo should refund
any overpayments, adding 8% simple interest per year* from the date of each
overpayment to the date of settlement. Or.
oIf Miss J has paid less than the fair usage figure, MotoNovo should arrange
an affordable and sustainable repayment plan for the outstanding balance.
It seems MotoNovo have already done so but, for completeness, once they have 
received the fair usage amount, MotoNovo should remove any adverse information 
recorded on Miss Js credit file regarding the agreement.
*If HM Revenue & Customs requires MotoNovo to take off tax from this interest. MotoNovo
must give Miss J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if Miss J asks for one.
My provisional decision
Im expecting to uphold this complaint and tell MotoNovo Finance Limited to put things right
in the manner Ive set out above.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss J accepted my provisional decision and didnt have any further information to add. 
MotoNovo didnt reply with any new evidence.
So, Ive not been provided with information that would lead me to change my provisional 
decision.
Putting things right
My provisional decision therefore becomes my final decision on this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above I uphold this complaint and tell MotoNovo Finance Limited 
to:
Refund all the payments Miss J has made, less £4,598 for fair usage.
oIf Miss J has paid more than the fair usage figure, MotoNovo should refund
any overpayments, adding 8% simple interest per year* from the date of each
overpayment to the date of settlement. Or.
oIf Miss J has paid less than the fair usage figure, MotoNovo should arrange
an affordable and sustainable repayment plan for the outstanding balance.
It seems MotoNovo have already done so but, for completeness, once they have 
received the fair usage amount, MotoNovo should remove any adverse information 
recorded on Miss Js credit file regarding the agreement.
*If HM Revenue & Customs requires MotoNovo to take off tax from this interest. MotoNovo
must give Miss J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if Miss J asks for one.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 July 2022.
