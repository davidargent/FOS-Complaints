The complaint
Mr P complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr P and his wife say that they purchased a six week holiday ownership product in 
December 2008 for £25,000. They each entered into a credit card agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance in December 2008 and each used £12,500 of credit to pay for the product. 
The credit was on buy now pay later terms so wasnt charged to their accounts until six 
months from the purchase date. 
They each entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in May 
2009 for a loan of £12,500 which they each used to repay the credit that had been provided 
to them under the credit card agreements. Mr P agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of 
£180.70 to Barclays Partner Finance. The loan was repaid in June 2011.
Mr P and his wife say that they exchanged the six week holiday ownership product in 
November 2009 for a four week product and also made a payment of £4,350. They say that 
they exchanged those weeks for another product with one fixed week and one floating week 
in November 2011 and paid a further £39,950. They say that the £39,950 was paid using two 
loans that were made to Mr P  a loan of £18,702 from Barclays Partner Finance and a loan 
of £21,248 from another finance provider. I understand that Mr P and his wife bought credits 
in a different holiday product in September 2015 for which they paid £8,800.
Mr Ps and his wifes representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance under sections 
75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act in July 2021 about the credit agreements that it 
said that theyd entered into in May 2009 and they made a complaint to this service in 
August 2021. Barclays Partner Finance then issued a final response letter to each of Mr P 
and his wife in which it said that the claims were time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980.
Mr P and his wifes complaint form says that in May 2009: Barclays Partner Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mr P and his wife; the holiday 
company failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mr P and his wifes ability to afford the 
loan, unduly pressured them into entering the agreements and used aggressive commercial 
practices to pressure them; the membership was misrepresented to them; and the holiday 
company went into liquidation in January 2020 so was in breach of contract; all rendering the 
agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A  and it said that the claim should also be 
considered under section 75. 
Our investigator considered Mr Ps and his wifes complaints separately and she didnt 
recommend that Mr Ps complaint should be upheld. She thought that his section 140A claim 
was late under the Limitation Act and that Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on 
the timing of his misrepresentation claim to turn it down. She said that there wasnt the 
evidence to demonstrate that the holiday company had failed to fulfil the contracts terms so 
she didnt think that it had breached the contract. She also said that she hadnt seen 
anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr P.
Mr Ps and his wifes representative says that Mr P and his wife disagree with our 
investigators recommendations and have asked for their complaints to be considered by an 
ombudsman. Their representative has provided a detailed response and says, in summary 
and amongst other things, that:
although some of the loans were made to Mr Ps wife, its clear that they were for 
their joint benefit;
the holiday ownership product was marketed as an investment but theres no 
functioning re-sale market for it;
the products were essentially perpetual long-term contracts;
no affordability assessment was carried out;
Mr P and his wife were subjected to aggressive sales practices and pressured into 
the agreements;
the holiday company went into liquidation in January 2020 so is in breach of contract;
although Mr Ps loan was discharged in June 2011, the unfairness in the relationship 
with Barclays Partner Finance continued;
Mr P and his wife could only reasonably have been aware of their cause for 
complaint when they went to professional advisers and the nature of the 
representations were such that their falsity were only discovered much later;
under section 32 of the Limitation Act, the limitation period doesnt begin to run until 
the facts relating to that unfair relationship could have been discovered with 
reasonable diligence;
the product was misrepresented to Mr P and his wife and there was an unfair 
relationship between them and Barclays Partner Finance; and
there were multiple breaches of accepted good practice, guidance and statutory duty. 
In this decision Im only considering Mr Ps complaint about Barclays Partner Finances 
response to his claims under sections 75 and 140A concerning the holiday ownership 
product that he and his wife bought in December 2008. His wifes complaint about Barclays 
Partner Finances response to her claims under sections 75 and 140A concerning that 
product will be considered separately. 
I dont consider that the claims that were made to Barclays Partner Finance or the complaint 
that was made to this service included claims relating to the loan that was made by Barclays 
Partner Finance to Mr P in November 2011. If Mr P wants to complain about those issues, 
he should first make a claim to Barclays Partner Finance and then, if hes not satisfied with 
its response, he may be able to make a separate complaint to this service.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ps complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ps complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that he and 
his wife had made to it and I accept that they referred their complaint to this service 
within six years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 
applies to Mr Ps claims;
Mr Ps claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ps claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company and that the holiday ownership product was misrepresented to him and his 
wife and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
Ive not been provided with copies of any of the purchase documents that would have 
been entered into by Mr P and his wife in December 2008 for their purchase of the 
holiday ownership product but Barclays Partner Finance has provided copies of the 
credit agreements that they entered into in December 2008 and the loan agreements 
that they entered into in May 2009;
Mr Ps representative says that the holiday company went into liquidation in January 
2020 and that theres been a breach of contract  but Mr P and his wife say that they 
exchanged the six week holiday ownership product that theyd bought in December 
2008 for a four week product and that they then exchanged those weeks for another 
product with one fixed week and one floating week and theyve also bought credits in 
a different holiday product;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the contract under which they bought the 
holiday ownership product in December 2008 would have been replaced by a new 
contract for their exchange of that product for another product in November 2009  
and, as Barclays Partner Finance didnt provide them with any credit for that 
purchase, I dont consider that it would be liable under section 75 for any subsequent 
breach of contract and I dont consider that it has any liability to Mr P in these 
circumstances arising from the liquidation of the holiday company in January 2020;
even if Im wrong about that, Barclays Partner Finance says that the management 
company for the resorts has confirmed that customers are able to book holidays and 
are able to list their property for resale in accordance with their agreements so Im 
not persuaded that there would have been a breach of contract;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any other 
breach of contract by the holiday company for which Barclays Partner Finance would 
be liable to Mr P under section 75;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr P could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into buying the holiday ownership product in December 2008 as that was the latest 
time that any misrepresentations would have been made to them and any loss would 
have been incurred as that was when Mr P also entered into the credit card 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made under section 75 
until July 2021, more than twelve years later which was outside of the time limits set 
out in the Limitation Act so I consider that his misrepresentation claim is now time-
barred;
Mr Ps representative says that the limitation period doesnt begin to run until the 
facts relating to the unfair relationship could have been discovered with reasonable 
diligence  but I dont consider that the time when Mr P became aware that he could 
bring a claim assists him for the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a 
claim under some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have 
knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that 
those sections are applicable to Mr Ps claims;
Mr Ps representative says that section 32 of the Limitation Act postpones the 
limitation period - section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right 
of action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt 
begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable 
diligence have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate 
commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time 
amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Im not persuaded that Mr P has provided enough evidence to show that theres been 
a deliberate concealment of any facts from him and I dont consider that section 32 is 
applicable in these circumstances;
Mr Ps representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr P and 
Barclays Partner Finance and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that the credit under the 
credit agreement was repaid in June 2009 after Mr P had entered into a loan 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in May 2009 to repay the credit  it has 
also provided evidence to show that the loan was repaid, and the loan agreement 
ended, in June 2011;I consider that Mr P would have had six years from then to bring a claim against 
Barclays Partner Finance but a claim under section 140A wasnt made until his and 
his wifes representatives letter to Barclays Partner Finance in July 2021, more than 
ten years after the loan had been repaid, which was outside of the time limits set out 
in the Limitation Act so I consider that his claim under section 140A is now also time-
barred; 
our investigator also considered Mr Ps complaint that the holiday company failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan but she said that she 
hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for 
Mr P;
the credit was made available to Mr P in December 2008 and he had the benefit of a 
buy now pay later offer so the credit wasnt charged to his account until six months 
later  Mr P then entered into a loan agreement which he used to repay the credit 
and that loan was repaid in June 2011;
Mr Ps wife entered into similar arrangements and her loan was also repaid in June 
2011 and Mr P has described further purchases that they made between November 
2009 and September 2015 totalling £53,100;
Mr P and his wife say that they had to extend their mortgage, delay early retirement 
and continue working past retirement age, which has impacted their health and 
stress levels but Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr P asked Barclays Partner 
Finance for any information about the affordability assessment that it conducted 
before his and his wifes representatives letter to Barclays Partner Finance in July 
2021  more than ten years after his loan had been repaid;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mr P to have raised any concerns 
about the affordability of the loan or the affordability assessment that was conducted 
before then and Ive seen no evidence to show that the credit and the loan werent 
affordable for Mr P when they were made to him;
Barclays Partner Finance issued a response to Mr Ps claims in which it said that his 
claims were time-barred under the Limitation Act  I consider that its response was 
fair and reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mr P for the issues that hes described, but I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance 
to refund to him any of the money that he paid under the credit card agreement or 
loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2023.
