Note: a letter after the loan number denotes additional borrowing or a top-up on an existing 
loan. Mr S drew down from the flexible credit loan 12 times between  14 August 2013  and 2 
August 2014.  It provided an initial credit limit of £450, but this appears  to have later 
increased when  Mr S borrowed £900 from the flexible credit loan on 13 April 2014.
CashEuroNet said that our service was unable to consider the first loan as it was lent to Mr S 
more than six years before he complained.  Mr S has withdrawn his complaint about  that 
loan, so I havent considered it in this decision. 
Our adjudicator assessed Mr Ss complaint and he thought the loans from 2 to 14c shouldnt 
have been given. CashEuroNet responded and disagreed, but it did offer to refund all the 
interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 2 and 3, pay 8% simple  interest  on the amount due 
to be refunded and remove negative information  about those loans from Mr Ss credit  file.
Ref: DRN96995732As Mr S didnt accept  CashEuroNets offer and CashEuroNet didnt accept the adjudicators  
findings, the complaint has been passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
CashEuroNet says that the number of instances that a consumer borrows  is not, in itself,  
evidence that the borrower  is reliant  on high cost short term loans. And has asked for a 
detailed breakdown of why each  and every check it carried out wasnt proportionate and 
what loss Mr S suffered  as a result of that. But I think that there  may come a point where the 
lending history and pattern  of lending itself does clearly demonstrate that the lending  was 
unsustainable.
However, I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  was required  
to establish whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And although CONC applies to lending agreed  
since April 2014, the Office of Fair Trading had similar requirements in its irresponsible 
lending guidance,  which was in effect in the period that Mr S took out loans 2 to 8b.
Ref: DRN96995733And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments within the term of the loan,  without borrowing further.
So Ive carefully  considered  all of the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, he thought that CashEuroNet shouldve  carried out more 
detailed affordability  checks on loans 2 and 3, than just checking  Mr Ss income  and 
completing a credit  check. And having  looked at the circumstances of those loans, I agree. 
Loan 2 was an instalment loan which Mr S had to repay over a period  of 12 months. And 
loan 3 (a payday loan) was taken  out around  a month after Mr S had taken out loan 2. So 
given that loan 2 was Mr Ss second  instalment loan, and was a loan that required Mr S to 
repay it over a relatively  long period of time (compared to a payday  loan),  I think  
CashEuroNet shouldve  completed better  checks than it did, especially as Mr S borrowed 
more money from Quick Quid (loan  3) when hed only just taken  out an instalment loan with 
Pounds to Pocket.
And looking at Mr Ss finances at the time, had CashEuroNet checked Mr Ss expenditure, 
including his regular  financial commitments, it wouldve  been  clear that Mr S was unable to 
sustainably repay  these loans. I say this because his income was stated as £1,500  and 
£1,650 respectively for the two loans. And his normal living costs were  around £550. But Mr 
S also had considerable regular financial commitments of nearly £800 as well. So I dont 
think he had sufficient disposable income  to be able to sustainably  repay loan 2 and 
especially loan 3  given that as he had two loans running together, Mr S was going to have 
to repay  CashEuroNet over £700 in October 2012.   
Because of the above, I dont think that CashEuroNet shouldve  lent Mr S loans 2 and 3, as I 
think proportionate checks wouldve shown that he wasnt in a position to sustainably  repay  
them.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of CashEuroNets lending history  with Mr S, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point where  CashEuroNet should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so CashEuroNet  should  have realised  
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
4. I say this because:
By loan 4, Mr S had been  borrowing from CashEuroNet for 11 months.  His first two 
loans had been for £1050  and £1500, but had been instalment loans. Loan 3 was for 
a reduced amount  of £400,  but this was due to be repaid over a much  shorter  period: 
47 days. So having repaid loans 2 and 3 on 13 and 12 October 2012 respectively, 
Mr S then returned  to CashEuroNet  in November 2012 for another  instalment loan  
this time to borrow £950. That loan was due to be repaid over 12 monthly 
instalments, but around five months into it Mr S returned to Quick Quid  for another 
payday loan of £400 (loan 5). And this pattern  of lending  continued.   
Ref: DRN96995734From  Loan 4 onwards Mr S was provided with a new loan within weeks, and 
sometimes days, of settling a previous one, and as I've mentioned  - sometimes  when  
the previous loan was still running.  He also often topped up his loans with further 
borrowing. And even  with the flexible credit loan, Mr S was initially  given  a credit limit 
of £450 and this looks to have  been increased to £900 in April 2014.  So 
CashEuroNet ought to have realised each  time Mr S applied for another loan, that it 
was more likely than not he was having  to borrow further amounts to cover the hole 
left in his finances  from repaying  previous loans and that Mr Ss indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed CashEuroNet.  For 
example Loan  14c was taken out 45 months after Mr Ss first loan. And the amounts 
Mr S was borrowing  werent substantially decreasing over time either. I accept that 
loans 13 and 14 were  for a lower amount  both £150. But Mr S topped up loan 14 
on three occasions  so that in the end loan 14 amounted to £800.  So overall Mr S 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to CashEuroNet over 
an extended period of time.
I think that Mr S lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ss 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about Loan 4 onwards and CashEuroNet should put 
things right.
putting things right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on Loans 2 (taken  on 12 August  2012) 
onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges, calculated  
from the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 2 and 3 from Mr Ss credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 4 (taken on 21 November 2012) onwards means 
any information recorded about  them is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 4 
onwards should  be removed  from Mr Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  CashEuroNet must  
give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN96995735my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Ss complaint and require CashEuroNet UK 
LLC to do what I have  set out above to put matters right.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before19 August 2019.
