The complaint
Mr T complains about a failed chargeback claim thats left his account with PayPal (Europe) 
Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) in a negative balance.
Mr T has also complained that PayPal didnt offer any seller protection.  
What happened
Mr T sold a mobile phone through a third-party selling site and accepted payment through 
PayPal. Once he received the money, the buyer raised a chargeback dispute with their card 
issuer. 
PayPal sent information to defend the claim, but the card issuer upheld it in the buyers 
favour. So, Mr Ts PayPal account was debited and now remains in a negative balance. 
Mr T raised a complaint with PayPal, but it wasnt upheld. PayPal said that it supplied all the 
evidence that it had to defend the claim, but it was the card issuer that made the final 
decision. PayPal went on to say that as the payment was made and accepted as a personal 
payment, it wasnt eligible for seller protection. Mr T remained unhappy, so he brought his 
complaint to our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt uphold it. Our investigator found that 
PayPal had done all it could to defend the claim. He went on to find that Mr T didnt get any 
seller protection due to the way the payment was sent, and this was covered in PayPals 
User Agreement. 
Mr T remained unhappy. So, the complaints been passed to me to issue a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator, for largely the same 
reasons. Ill explain why. 
Im very aware that Ive summarised this complaint briefly, in less detail than has been 
provided, and in my own words. No discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on 
what I think is the heart of the matter here. If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt 
because Ive ignored it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual 
point or argument to be able to reach what I think is the right outcome. Our rules allow me to 
do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as a free alternative to the 
courts.
PayPal didnt authorise the chargeback of funds, the buyers bank did. So, PayPals role was 
to supply information to the bank to support Mr Ts case for defending the claim.
I can see PayPal did send the information to the bank, as wed expect it to. I can also see 
what information was sent, and Im satisfied this was enough to attempt to defend the claim. 
As the claim was upheld in the buyers favour by the bank, Im satisfied PayPal cant be held 
responsible in these circumstances. PayPal did what it was required to do, but unfortunately 
the bank made the decision to refund the buyer. 
Ive then gone on to look at whether Mr T was covered under PayPals seller protection 
policy. 
PayPals User Agreement says. 
PayPal determines whether your claim is eligible for PayPals Seller Protection program.
It goes on to list the payments not covered by the seller protection.
Personal payments including a payment sent using PayPals friends and family 
functionality
PayPal have supplied evidence that shows Mr T accepted a payment through the personal 
payment function, rather than goods and services. So, as per the User Agreement, Im 
satisfied its not covered under the Seller Protection Policy. 
I understand Mr T has provided information to show other people using the PayPal platform 
may have been victims of the same potential scammer and had different outcomes including 
a refund of their money. Unfortunately, Im only considering the circumstances of Mr Ts 
complaint and whether PayPal have acted fairly on this occasion. 
In summary, although Im sorry to hear Mr T may have been the victim of a scam, I havent 
found PayPal have acted against its User Agreement or unfairly in the circumstances of this 
complaint.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2023.
