The complaint
Mr J complains That American Express Services Europe Limited (AESEL) (Amex) lent to 
him irresponsibly.
What happened
In December 2015, Mr J applied for a credit card from Amex. This was approved limit
of £27,000. Subsequent increases were agreed, before a decrease in May 2020:
Date Limit
December 2015 £12,700
February 2016 £18,000
March 2016 £18,600
May 2017 £21,000
April 2018 £27,000
May 2020 £19,560 (decrease)
Mr J complained  he said that proper checks hadnt been done by Amex. He said he paid 
huge amounts of interest and fees as a result. He worked out hed paid £16,584 over the 
time hed had the card. He said his credit file had been affected and he cant now get any 
credit. He also said the decision to reduce his limit in May 2020 affected him  as this 
meant he didnt have any spending capacity.
Amex said that Mr J had passed their credit checks. They had approved a card limit of
£27,000 when it was issued in 2015 and hadnt increased it since. In 2015, he advised his 
salary was £120,000 per annum. Mr J advised he was in financial difficulty in November 
2019 but still met the minimum payments. In May 2020, following a review they reduced Mr
Js limit to £19,560. His annual salary was then said to be £210,000.
Mr J brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Amex had acted reasonably, and in 
line with their terms and conditions  these also gave them the right to reduce Mr Js limit if 
they wished.
Mr J didnt agree. He said Amex had increased his limits as hed stated  and asked for an 
ombudsman to look at his complaint.
I reached a provisional decision where I said:
We asked Amex for more information about what had happened. We asked for:
Limit history
The letters sent to Mr J at the time of the increases
Evidence of the credit checks that were done at the time of each increase, and at 
the issue of the credit card
Mr Js statements.
Amex told us that  contrary to what theyd said before - they did increase Mr Js limits and 
showed us some of the letters sent to Mr J at the time. From those, we built up a possible 
schedule of increases as shown above. The letters also showed that Mr J couldve opted 
out of the offered increases if he wished. Amex said that Mr J had maintained a 
satisfactory account and had made the minimum payments.
Amex told us that Mr J was earning £120,000 a year in 2015, and £210,000 a year in 
2020. But other than that  they couldnt tell us what checks theyd done at either the 
issue of the card or the subsequent increases. They couldnt show us Mr Js statements 
either  which might have helped us understand what happened.
Turning to the decrease in Mr Js limit in May 2020  Amex told us theyd reviewed Mr 
Js account and took a decision to reduce it to £19,560  but thats all they could tell 
us.
And so  we have limited information here on which to base a balanced decision. Weve 
asked Amex several times for more information, but this hasnt been provided. And so  I 
must make a decision based on the information we have. And because theres little 
evidence from Amex, I must provisionally conclude that Amex did lend irresponsibly, and 
ask them to refund all interest and fees from the time Mr Js account was opened to the 
date of final decision. I am inviting comments from both Mr J and Amex. If Amex come 
forward with more details about what happened, and in particular the credit checks they 
made  both for the increases and the decrease in May 2020 - then we will review this 
before issuing a final decision.
Looking at the decrease in limit in May 2020. Mr J has argued this restricted his 
spending. And so  without any information from Amex, I must also accept what Mr J has 
told us here.
So  my provisional decision is to uphold this complaint, and ask Amex to refund all interest 
and fees to Mr J since the credit card was issued; delete any adverse information from his
credit file; and pay compensation of £200  in respect of the reduction in limit in May 2020.
Responses to the provisional decision:
Mr J had no further points to make. Amex didnt provide any further information about the 
credit checks.
I now need to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As there were no comments from either Mr J or Amex, and Amex didnt provide any 
information about credit checks, I wont be departing from my original decision  for the reasons I gave in it. And so  I am upholding this complaint.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. American Express Services Europe Limited (AESEL) must:
Refund all interest and fees debited to the account since it was opened.
Remove any adverse entries from Mr Js credit file from the time the account 
was opened to date.
Pay compensation of £200 for distress and inconvenience  regarding the 
decrease in May 2020.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 February 2022.
