The complaint
Mrs M complains about Barclays Bank UK PLCs handling of a rate switch on her buy-to-let 
mortgage. 
What happened
Mrs M wanted to switch her Barclays buy-to-let mortgage to a better rate. She met Barclays 
on 27 July 2019 and agreed she would pay £20,000 off her £50,000 mortgage balance and 
take a five year fixed rate interest only mortgage  this would reduce her monthly payments 
to £57.25. Mrs M paid £20,000 by bank transfer to the account number Barclays gave her 
and handed her completed forms in to branch. 
Mrs M says Barclays sent her a letter dated 6 August 2019 saying her rate had been 
switched, for a repayment mortgage with monthly repayments of £444.64 from 3 September 
2019. This wasnt what Mrs M expected, so she contacted Barclays and was reassured it 
would be put right. Mrs M hadnt heard back two weeks later, so she contacted Barclays 
again but says it couldnt find her details. 
On 3 September 2019 Barclays took a £444.64 payment from Mrs M. She again contacted 
Barclays, and it said her mortgage had been wrongly switched to a repayment basis. And 
around this time, Mrs M found it had returned her £20,000 payment without telling her. 
Mrs M complained to Barclays. In its final response letter dated November 2019, Barclays 
said her mortgage was wrongly switched to repayment rather than interest only, so the 
August 2019 payment it had taken was too high. It couldnt say how the error happened but 
confirmed Mrs Ms mortgage was now interest only and it would refund £122.92 to Mrs M. 
Barclays gave Mrs M account details to pay her £20,000 into again and said her monthly 
payments would reduce to £57.45 when it got this payment. Barclays apologised for its 
handling of Mrs Ms mortgage switch and offered her £150 compensation.
 
Mrs M says she visited a branch to again pay the £20,000 but was told the details Barclays 
gave her were for a holding account and her payment might be returned again. Mrs M says 
this gave her doubts so she asked Barclays to keep her mortgage balance at £50,000, but 
on the five year fixed rate interest only basis shed wanted. Mrs M says she invested the 
£20,000 elsewhere.
In March 2020 Mrs M again raised her complaint with Barclays, through her Member of 
Parliament (MP). It reviewed things and in a further final response dated April 2020, 
Barclays said it had got the refund wrong. It said it owed Mrs M a further refund of £103.39, 
and also offered her an additional £100 compensation. Through her MP, Mrs M said 
Barclays still hadnt refunded the correct amount. But Barclays didnt change its position. 
In August 2020 Mrs M referred her complaint to our service, saying that this matter had 
caused her a lot of distress and inconvenience, and had affected her financial planning. 
In September 2020 Barclays issued a further response to Mrs Ms MP. It said it had again 
got the refund wrong. It noted Mrs M thought she was owed a further £246.31, however it 
actually owed her a further £123.35. But because of its further errors, Barclays agreed to 
instead pay a further £246.31 as Mrs M thought, plus 8% simple interest (less tax). And it 
increased its offer of compensation to a total of £400.  
After looking into things, our investigator said it wasnt in dispute that Barclays made errors 
when switching Mrs Ms mortgage and when giving her details about where to send her 
£20,000 payment. But she thought its latest offer was a fair way to put things right. 
Mrs M disagreed and asked for her complaint to be referred to an ombudsman. She said 
shed spent a lot of time contacting Barclays and it had only made its latest offer because of 
her persistence. And shed found it upsetting to be dismissed when she was correct, and 
wouldve been awarded more if shed gone to court. Mrs M also said she didnt understand 
how Barclays worked out it only owed her a further refund of £123.35, instead of the £246.31 
Mrs M thought. 
We put this to Barclays and it explained the August 2019 payment was due in September 
2019, so the rate change wouldnt have taken effect as quickly as Mrs M thought. Barclays 
said it had backdated Mrs Ms switch request to 3 August 2019, and the total refund it had 
offered Mrs M took account of any amounts it had incorrectly taken from her since that date. 
As Mrs M requested, her complaint has been referred to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of Mrs Ms complaint is that shes unhappy with how Barclays handled her 
mortgage switch. Barclays accepts it incorrectly switched Mrs Ms mortgage to a repayment 
basis and gave her incorrect bank account details to pay her £20,000 into. As thats not in 
dispute, Ive not considered it further. 
What is in dispute is how to put things right. So Ive considered this. If Barclays hadnt made 
any errors and things had gone as originally planned, then Mrs Ms monthly payments would 
have changed to £57.25, with the first payment due in September 2019  I say this because 
Barclays says the new rate was backdated to 3 August 2019 but that the August 2019 
payment was due for payment in September 2019. In other words, Mrs Ms monthly 
mortgage repayments were paid a month in arrears. This is supported by what Mrs M says 
the Barclays letter of 6 August 2018 said, that her new monthly repayments would start from 
3 September 2019. 
However, Mrs M changed her mind about paying £20,000 off her mortgage, albeit because 
shed lost confidence in Barclays. Therefore her monthly mortgage repayments werent 
going to be £57.25. Both Mrs M and Barclays accept her September 2019 monthly 
repayment should have been £94.98. I can see from Barclays system records that she 
instead paid £444.64 on 3 September 2019. So Im satisfied that Barclays took £349.66 
more than it should have from Mrs M in September 2019. And this is the total refund 
Barclays says Mrs M is owed.  
But Mrs M also thinks she overpaid in August 2019, as she says thats when her mortgage 
and rate should have changed. However, Barclays has explained that while the change was 
backdated to 3 August 2019, her August 2019 payment wouldnt have been taken until 
September 2019  as Ive said, Mrs Ms mortgage repayments were paid a month in arrears. Therefore I dont think Barclays took more than it should have from Mrs M in August 2019, 
so I dont think it owes her a refund for that month. 
But as I say, Barclays did take £349.66 too much from Mrs M in September 2019. And it has 
ultimately offered to refund her more than this  as well as the refunds of £122.92 and 
£103.39 it had previously offered, it has now offered to refund Mrs M the £246.31 she 
believes it still owes her. And its offered to pay 8% simple interest on this latest additional 
refund. Im satisfied thats fair.
But its taken Barclays a long time to get to this point and it has repeatedly calculated the 
refund incorrectly. And it only reached the correct refund amount because Mrs M kept 
pursuing the matter. I think having to keep chasing Barclays about this over an extended 
period wouldve caused Mrs M unnecessary inconvenience as well as increasing upset and 
frustration. And I think this would have added to the inconvenience and distress Barclays 
errors originally caused Mrs M, as shes told us not getting the mortgage switch that was 
originally agreed meant she had to rearrange her finances in her retirement. However, 
Barclays has offered Mrs M a total of £400 compensation for the distress and inconvenience 
its errors caused her. I think thats fair compensation in the circumstances, so Im not asking 
Barclays to increase it. 
I note Mrs M says she would have been awarded more if shed taken this matter to court. I 
cant say what a court might have awarded Mrs M. In any case, Mrs M instead chose to 
bring this complaint to our service, a free alternative to the courts. And Mrs M can also 
choose whether or not to accept my decision. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 February 2021.
