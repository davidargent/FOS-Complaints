K820x#14complaint
Mr J complains Shop Direct  Finance  Company Limited trading as Very (SDFC) has added 
interest to his account after hed paid his Buy Now Pay Later  (BNPL)  payment in time.
background
Mr J has an account with SDFC.  Mr Js account offered different payment arrangements,  
depending on the items purchased. This included BNPL  where a customer  can defer 
payment until a specified date and no interest is charged as long as payment is made in full 
by that date.
Mr J purchased an item on BNPL which needed  to be paid by 29 March 2019.  He said he 
successfully made the payment before this date,  but later found interest on the item had 
been added  to his account.
SDFC said that the interest- which began accruing from the purchase date - was added to 
Mr Js account because  the payment hadnt  been  made in time. 
Mr J wasnt happy with the response  and referred  his complaint to us.
Our investigator said that Mr J could  show hed been online on SDFCs payment portal but 
there wasnt any evidence  to show the payment had been successfully made. And so SDFC 
hadnt done anything wrong.
Mr J disagreed and said again that the payment had been  made  and that SDFC had failed in 
noting the payment as being  successful. He asked for an ombudsman to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not upholding this 
complaint. Ill explain  why.
I should say first of all that its not our role to calculate what  the balance of Mr Js account  
should be. What Ive done is to look at whats  happened and determine whether SDFC 
should have done something  differently.
Mr J purchased an item in September  2018 on a six month BNPL option. This meant  he 
needed to pay off the BNPL  balance  no later than 29 March 2019.  
Ive seen the online activity for 12 March 2019,  the day Mr J said he made  the payment. I 
have tabled below, for ease of reading,  the online activity captured by SDFC:

This does  show that Mr J was attempting to make the payment needed to settle his BNPL  
balance. I have compared this to the online activity Mr J has sent to us and can see that this 
does show similar activity at the same times. But Mr Js evidence  also shows  that at 17:38, 
at the time he attempted to make the payment, that he got a system error message.   
Mr J says he got a message on his system  that said the payment had been successful. And 
that the error  message  wasnt  for the payment hed made. But he hasnt been able to 
provide evidence of the payment successful  message, or that the error message related to 
another payment he was attempting to make.  And there isnt any evidence that the payment 
was taken from Mr Js card account.
Its not unusual  for me to need to decide a case where its simply not possible to know 
exactly what happened. In situations where I cant ever know for sure what took place, I will 
decide what I consider  is most likely to have happened, based on the balance  of the 
evidence that I do have. 
I dont doubt Mr J was looking to pay his BNPL balance before the end of the option period. 
And I can understand his frustration as he thought hed paid in time. 
But I cant see that the payment was successfully made. The error message being received 
at the same  time as Mr J was attempting to make  the payment I think  shows  it was more  
likely than not that the payment didnt  go through. And as the payment wasnt  made  in time 
to meet  the required  payment date I cant hold SDFC responsible for this happening.  
So, I dont think SDFC was being  unreasonable in adding the accrued interest  to his 
account.
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above. I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 October  2019.
