The complaint
Mr C has complained that ManyPets Limited (ManyPets) changed the date on which his 
monthly direct debit payments for his pet insurance premiums were taken after he notified it 
of a change of address,  and also that ManyPets took an instalment of premium after hed 
cancelled his policy.
What happened
Mr C made two complaints to ManyPets. 
Complaint 1
Mr C contacted ManyPets on 14 November 2022  as he wanted to change his address on 
his pet insurance policy. This caused the date of his monthly direct debit to come forward 
and he received an email from ManyPets on 15 November 2022 explaining that his next 
direct debit payment  of £21.27 would be taken on or after 18 November 2022. He normally 
paid his premiums on or after the 29th of the month.
Mr C contacted ManyPets about this and wanted to understand why this had happened.  
ManyPets acknowledged that an error had been made and that this was a one-off 
adjustment and that his direct debits would go back to the 29th of each month from January 
2023 onwards. 
Mr C was unhappy with the explanation given by ManyPets and the inconvenience this had 
caused him and lodged a complaint on 15 November 2022. He had to chase his complaint 
when he hadnt received confirmation that the complaint had been received. 
ManyPets says that it aims to resolve complaints within 3 working and where this isnt 
possible, a complaint is passed to its Complaint Specialist Resolution Team who will provide 
a written acknowledgement within a further 5 working days. It says that as a response was 
emailed to Mr C on 22 November 2022 it had responded to his initial complaint of 15 
November 2022 within its complaint timeframe.
ManyPets has acknowledged that  an error was made when, as a consequence of his 
change of address, his direct debit date was brought forward. Its said that this was a system 
error which shouldve been adjusted manually but its team member hadnt done this.  It 
upheld this complaint and said that feedback would be provided to the relevant team 
member. 
Complaint 2
On 1 December 2022 ManyPets emailed Mr C a renewal notice which reflected an increase 
in his premium from £21.27 to £28.85 a month. As he wasnt happy about this and had found 
an alternative insurer, he emailed ManyPets on the same day to ask if anything could be 
done to reduce the premium. Many Pets responded the following day suggesting options 
which would reduce his premium such as increasing the policy excess or lowering the level 
of cover.  ManyPets says that Mr C was advised to let it know what he proposed to do before 
the policy renewal date of 29 December.
ManyPets records show that Mr C responded to it on 21 December requesting that the 
policy be cancelled from the renewal date and to be sent confirmation of this. ManyPets 
accepts that Mr C wasnt sent any response to this request and that it wasnt actioned. His 
policy was therefore renewed and the new premium of £28.85 was requested from his bank. 
Mr C phoned ManyPets on 29 December 2022 to complain about this and the level of 
service provided by ManyPets and also that hed not received any response to his previous 
complaint. ManyPets then cancelled his policy and said it would refund the premium of 
£28.85 once it had cleared on 5 January 2023. 
On 30 December 2022 ManyPets issued a final response to Mr C in which it acknowledged 
the errors made and apologised for these and gave Mr C a £20 Amazon voucher by way of 
compensation. It also invited him to send it copies of any bank statements in support of a 
claim for any bank charges Mr C had incurred because of its error, which would be 
reimbursed to him.
Mr C wasnt satisfied with the compensation offered by ManyPets for its errors and brought 
his complaint to this service. 
Our investigators view was to uphold Mr Cs complaint in so far as it related to ManyPets 
failure to inform Mr C that it had changed the direct debit date as this caused Mr C stress 
and inconvenience at a busy time when he was undergoing the stress of moving house. 
However, she didnt consider that when Mr C asked ManyPets to cancel the direct debit 
there was enough time for ManyPets to cancel the payment request it had made to Mr Cs 
bank.
Our investigator initially set up this complaint against the policy underwriter, who didnt 
respond to her view. It was subsequently set up against ManyPets as the administrator of 
the policy as Mr Cs complaints dont relate to a claim. This was communicated to the wrong 
team at ManyPets so there was a delay in a response from the correct team.
In the absence of a response from ManyPets, I issued a provisional decision in which I said 
that I proposed not to uphold Mr Cs complaint and invited any further comments from Mr C 
and ManyPets. Mr C has expressed dissatisfaction at my provisional decision, but his 
response doesnt persuade me to change my view which is in line with the approach of this 
service to the awarding of compensation. 
Im therefore issuing my final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im not upholding Mr Cs complaint and Ill explain why.
Its not the role of this service to fine or punish a business. Our role is to make an award that 
recognises the impact a businesss mistake has had on a customer. Were all 
inconvenienced  from time to time in our dealings with financial businesses, and a certain 
level of frustration and annoyance is to be expected. But for us to make an award of 
compensation we need to see that the impact of what a business has done wrong was more 
than what someone would experience in everyday life, or because of a vulnerability, a 
customer has been particularly affected in a way that others might not be.In my view, although there were two errors made by ManyPets resulting in two complaints by 
Mr C, these errors were acknowledged, apologised for, and corrected promptly by 
ManyPets. Compensation was given, and also an offer was made to pay any costs that Mr C 
mightve sustained to his bank as a consequence of ManyPets having taken a premium for a 
matter of days. It was a small amount of money for which Mr C was out of pocket for a very 
short time. Mr C has said he was moving house at the time, which is stressful, but I dont 
consider that the impact of the errors made by ManyPets should have added greatly to that.
In my view the inconvenience to Mr C was minor and I consider that the compensation 
provided by ManyPets in the form of a £20 Amazon voucher is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above, Im not upholding Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2023.
