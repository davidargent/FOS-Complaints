DRN-3787933
The complaint
Ms D is unhappy National House-Building Council trading as NHBC has declined a claim 
she made under a buildings warranty policy (Buildmark policy).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on providing my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusion reached by the investigator that the case should 
not be upheld. I do so for the following reasons:
Section 3 of the policy, which applies in years two to ten after completion of the 
property, provides cover for damage caused by defects in certain specified parts of 
the property. The warranty policy doesnt provide cover for every defect that could 
possibly occur in the build of property, nor does it cover every eventuality. 
It is agreed that the windows in question were not correctly installed and that is the 
cause of the water ingress. However only defects in windowpanes (i.e. the glass) are 
specifically listed as being covered by the policy. The actual installation of the 
windows isnt something that is covered. There are no defects in the windowpanes 
and therefore the policy will not respond in this instance. 
It is not the role of this service to review how NHBC ensures builders comply with the 
technical requirements referred to in the policy before it provides the Buildmark 
cover.  
For the reasons above, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Ms Ds complaint against National House-Building 
Council trading as NHBC.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 December 2022.
