The complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA failed to contact several merchants to 
tell them payments made from his bank account had been reversed in error.
What happened
PayPal attempted to collect several amounts from Mr Ss bank account through an existing 
direct debit mandate. Mr S believed the payments may have been fraudulent and, after 
discussing the payments with his bank, Mr S instructed his bank to cancel the existing direct 
debit mandate and refund the payments to his bank account. Mr Ss bank informed PayPal 
and the amounts were refunded under the rems of the direct debit mandate. Mr S later 
established that the payments had been authorised by him and werent fraudulent.
Mr S complained to PayPal that the narrative on his bank account was different to what he 
usually saw and that this had led him - and his bank - to believe the debits may have been 
fraudulent. Mr S told PayPal that hed now been blacklisted by the merchants, and he can 
no longer use the services they provide. Mr S wanted PayPal to contact all of the merchants 
again to tell them the reversals were an error.
PayPal didnt uphold Mr Ss complaint and said that it advised the merchants through its 
automated process that the payments hadnt been authorised by Mr S and that the 
payments had been reversed.  
Mr S brought his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service where one of our 
Investigators looked into things. During the investigation PayPal accepted that it had 
provided a poor customer experience to Mr S when dealing with his complaint and offered to 
pay Mr S £100 as a goodwill gesture. The Investigator thought that PayPal hadnt done 
anything significantly wrong and had followed the process it was required to when Mr S 
instructed his bank to reverse the transactions.
Mr S asked that an Ombudsman decides the complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive independently reviewed the telephone calls between Mr S and the Investigator and 
reviewed the relevant evidence and submissions made by Mr S and PayPal before reaching 
my decision. I understand Mr S will be disappointed, but Ive decided that PayPal didnt do 
anything significantly wrong, and I wont be upholding the complaint. I will now explain why.
Mr S says he doesnt dispute that PayPal followed the correct process when it was made 
aware hed cancelled the direct debit mandate and the payments on his account. Mr S says 
the crux of his complaint is that PayPal changed the narrative on his bank account, which led 
him to suspect the payments were fraudulent, and that PayPal didnt do enough to tell the 
merchants affected that the payments had been reversed in error. I will therefore focus my 
final decision on the crux of Mr Ss complaint.
Bank account narrative
Mr S says PayPal changed the narrative for the debits it applied to his bank account and this 
muddied the waters and led him to believe he hadnt authorised the payments and was the 
victim of a scam or fraud. Mr S didnt dispute hed made several recent purchases through 
PayPal, so I dont think it would have come as a shock that PayPal was making an attempt 
to collect these payments from his account. Mr S has strong views that the narrative on the 
debits to his account was a significant cause of his concern about the validity of the debits, 
but Im not persuaded the change Mr S has highlighted was so significant that I can 
conclude PayPal had done something wrong here. It seems to me that its more likely than 
not PayPal were attempting to collect the payments under its existing direct debit mandate - 
the mandate the bank subsequently cancelled on behalf of Mr S. Taking all of this into 
account, Im not persuaded PayPal did anything significantly wrong when it debited the 
amounts it did from Mr Ss bank account under the terms of the direct debit mandate.
Mr S has asked for the contact details of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) so that he 
can raise concerns about how PayPal could change the narrative when collecting payments 
from his bank account, as this isnt something that I can consider. Ive therefore attached a 
link the FCA website www.fca.org.uk   
Contacting the merchants 
When Mr Ss bank cancelled the direct debit mandate and payments, PayPal refunded the 
payments to the bank and sent automated messages to the merchants. In his initial 
discussion with the Financial Ombudsman Service Mr S confirmed issues with some 
merchants had been resolved but has since clarified his accounts with three merchants 
remain blocked. In his response to the Investigator Mr S says that PayPal should contact 
the service providers to explain hed cancelled the payments in error because he believed he 
hadnt authorised them. I can empathise with Mr S that the decision by the merchants to 
block him from accessing their services is frustrating and Ive no doubt this has caused him 
some difficulties, but PayPal didnt cause this to happen  when Mr S cancelled the 
payments it was the merchants that made the decision to refuse Mr S further services. Mr S 
later discovered he had authorised the payments, but theres no dispute PayPal had already 
contacted the service providers to tell them Mr S had instructed his bank to refund them as 
he thought he hadnt authorised them. 
PayPal has said it would provide a written statement similar to one Mr Ss bank has provided 
to the merchants, but Mr S wants PayPal to contact each merchant to provide an 
explanation that the payments were cancelled in error. In this case, PayPal acted on 
instructions from Mr Ss bank to return the payments in line with the direct debit 
arrangements, and then told the merchants why the reversals happened. This is what we 
would expect PayPal to do, so I cant tell PayPal it must contact each merchant to provide 
the explanation Mr S wants. However, Mr S may wish to approach PayPal again to see if its 
still willing to provide a written statement that could be forwarded on to the merchants 
involved as I think the offer PayPal made to do so was a reasonable in the circumstances of 
this complaint. Ive noted that one of the merchants has said it would consider such a 
response from PayPal and provided a contact email to Mr S so that it could be forwarded to 
its legal team for consideration.
PayPal offered Mr S £100 as a goodwill gesture for the poor customer service it provided 
when it dealt with his complaint. As complaint handling isnt a regulated activity, Im unable 
to make address this issue, but if Mr S wishes to accept this offer, he should contact PayPal 
directly to see if its still available for acceptance.My final decision
Ive decided PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA didnt do anything significantly wrong, and I 
havent upheld Mr Ss complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 May 2023.
