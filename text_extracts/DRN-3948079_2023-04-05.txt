The complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly blocked and closed his 
accounts. He says this caused him financial problems and upset. He wants NatWest to pay 
him compensation. 
What happened
In March 2022, NatWest decided to review Mr Ps accounts. Whilst it completed its review 
the bank restricted his access to his accounts. Following its review, in April 2022, NatWest 
decided to close Mr Ps accounts and wrote to him giving him 60 days notice that he needed 
to make other banking arrangements. 
Mr P contacted NatWest to try and find out what was happening with his accounts but says 
the bank wouldnt tell him much. He also says that NatWest agreed to send him a letter 
explaining its actions, but it never did.
Mr P complained to NatWest. He said he hadnt done anything which wouldve caused the 
bank to block and then close his accounts. And he pointed out that he had been a customer 
of the bank for many years. He said due to the banks actions he was left without access to 
any money and couldnt go to work as he had no money to buy petrol to travel his job. 
Overall, he said he was caused a great deal of stress and inconvenience by the banks 
actions.
In response, NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong when it reviewed and closed Mr Ps 
accounts. The bank also said it had closed Mr Ps accounts in line with the terms and 
conditions. It apologised for not writing to Mr P and said it had given Mr P incorrect 
information when it told him he would get a letter from them about why his accounts had 
been blocked. Unhappy with this response Mr P brought his complaint to our service. 
One of our adjudicators looked into Mr Ps complaint. She said NatWest hadnt done 
anything wrong when it had reviewed and closed Mr Ps account. Mr P disagreed. He said 
NatWest treated him unfairly and left him without access to his money, which meant he 
couldnt go to work or see his children. He wants the bank to explain why it blocked his 
accounts in the first place and pay him compensation for the impact the banks actions had 
on him.
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill deal first with NatWests decision to block and review Mr Ps account. NatWest have 
important legal and regulatory obligations they must meet when providing accounts to 
customers. Those obligations are ongoing and dont only apply to when an account is 
opened. They can broadly be summarised as a responsibility to protect persons from 
financial harm, and to prevent and detect financial crime.
To comply with their obligations, NatWest will monitor accounts for activity which appears 
unusual or out of place. And may ask its customers to provide information about certain 
transactions. Its common industry practice for firms to restrict access to an account to 
conduct a review on a customer and/or the activity on an account. And, considering the 
information Ive been provided, I understand why NatWest carried out a review and I dont 
find their initial decision to restrict Mr Ps accounts was unreasonable. So, whilst I appreciate 
the restriction caused Mr P inconvenience and was upsetting, I cant say the bank treated 
him unfairly when it blocked and reviewed his accounts.
I understand that Mr P wants NatWest to explain the reason it applied the block to his 
accounts. Hes also unhappy that when he called and spoke to staff, he wasnt able to find 
out much at all about what was happening and wasnt given any warning that his accounts 
would be blocked. But NatWest doesnt disclose to its customers what triggers a review of 
their accounts. And its under no obligation to tell Mr P the reasons behind the account block, 
as much as hed like to know. So, I cant say its done anything wrong by not giving Mr P this 
information. And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it to do so or for me to disclose 
the reasons. 
I can see that Mr P was given incorrect information by NatWest. The bank said it would write 
to him explaining why it had blocked his accounts. NatWest has apologised to Mr P for 
giving him misleading information. I think this which I think is a reasonable way to resolve 
this aspect of Mr Ps complaint. So, Im not going to ask NatWest to do anything more. 
Mr P says because of the block on his account he wasnt able to buy petrol, see his children 
and pay for everyday expenses. So, he wants NatWest to compensate him for the trouble 
and upset this caused. But it wouldnt be appropriate to me to award Mr P compensation for 
this since I dont think the bank acted inappropriately when it blocked and reviewed his 
accounts. 
I can see that it took NatWest around two weeks to complete its review and remove the 
blocks from Mr Ps accounts. But I dont consider that it would be right for me to conclude it 
should not have taken in excess of any particular or specific timeframe. Because NatWest 
was entitled  as a matter of principle  to do what it did. From looking at the timeframe and 
NatWests records, I can also see that NatWest were actively progressing its review and 
didnt cause any unreasonable delays in doing so. Once it had completed its review it also 
promptly removed the block from Mr Ps accounts and allowed him access to his funds.
I then turn to NatWests decision to close Mr Ps accounts. Banks are entitled to end their 
business relationship with a customer, as long as its done fairly and is in line with the terms 
and conditions of the account. But I understand it cant be pleasant being told youre no 
longer wanted as a customer. Especially so, given how long Mr P had been a customer of 
NatWest. However, unless theres a very good reason to do so, this service wont usually 
say that they must keep a customer or compensate a customer who has had their account 
closed. Having looked at all the evidence, Im satisfied that NatWest was within its rights to 
close Mr Ps accounts and it did so line with the account terms and relevant regulations. So, 
I cant say NatWest have done anything wrong when it closed Mr Ps accounts and it 
wouldnt be appropriate for me to award Mr P compensation since I dont think NatWest 
acted inappropriately in closing Mr Ps accounts.
In summary, its clearly caused Mr P inconvenience when he wasnt able to use his 
accounts. And then had them closed. So, I realise he will be disappointed by my decision. But having looked at all the evidence and circumstances of this complaint, I dont think 
NatWest treated Mr P unfairly when it blocked and closed his accounts. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 May 2023.
