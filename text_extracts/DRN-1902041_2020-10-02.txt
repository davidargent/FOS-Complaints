The complaint
Mr T complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) failed to tell him about 
important changes to the terms of his travel insurance policy. He says this led to the insurer 
of the policy turning down a cancellation claim he made.
Mr Ts represented by his solicitor, L.
What happened
Mr T took out a Black packaged bank account in 2016. One of the benefits provided by the 
account was worldwide travel insurance. 
In August 2018, Mr T booked a trip with his family and was due to travel the following year. 
Unfortunately, one of the members of the party had an accident and the trip had to be 
cancelled. Mr T made a claim for his share of the costs from the underwriter of his insurance 
policy. 
The insurer told Mr T his claim wasnt covered. Thats because he hadnt called it to pay an 
annual age extension for his policy and go through medical screening. This was required by 
the policy terms for any policyholder aged over 70 years.
L complained to NatWest on Mr Ts behalf. It said Mr Ts account manager hadnt explained 
the age extension when Mr T opened his account. Hed been told the policy had no upper 
age limit, so NatWest had misrepresented the benefits of the account to him. It said the 
travel insurance had been a key reason why Mr T had opened the Black account. 
NatWest told L that the age extension hadnt applied when Mr T opened his account. Itd 
been introduced in June 2017. It said itd sent Mr T annual statements of eligibility in 
September 2017, 2018 and 2019 which explained the age extension and that travel 
insurance would only apply for policyholders aged over 70 if the additional premium was 
paid. It also provided a copy of a template letter it said itd sent Mr T in March 2018 which set 
out the eligibility criteria.
L wasnt satisfied that the template letter was enough to show that the insurance eligibility 
letter had been sent to Mr T. It said he hadnt received the letter or any of the annual 
eligibility statements NatWest said itd sent. L considered that NatWest should pay Mr Ts 
cancellation costs, together with its own fees. It asked us to look into Mr Ts complaint.
Our investigator didnt think Mr Ts complaint should be upheld. NatWest had provided 
screenshots which showed annual eligibility statements had been sent to Mr T in September 
2017, 2018 and 2019, by email. The investigator felt it was most likely NatWest had sent 
these emails, even if Mr T hadnt received them. 
L disagreed. It said Mr T was adamant that hed never received a letter or email from 
NatWest drawing his attention to the change in conditions. It maintained the burden of proof 
was on NatWest to show it had sent this information. If hed seen the age extension criteria, 
hed have complied with it. It didnt accept the screenshots NatWest had posted were 
evidence that the annual eligibility statements had been sent. It felt NatWest should provide 
the actual emails that had been sent to Mr T to prove theyd been sent.
The complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I think NatWest has treated Mr T fairly. Ill explain why.
Theres no dispute that the policy insurer only covers policyholders aged over 70 years if 
they pay an additional annual premium and go through medical screening. It also now 
seems accepted by both parties that this requirement wasnt part of the policy terms until the 
year after NatWest sold Mr T the Black account. 
So Ive gone on to consider whether I think, on the balance of probabilities, its most likely 
that NatWest did enough to bring the age eligibility criteria to Mr Ts attention after the policy 
terms changed. 
NatWest has provided us with a copy of a template letter it says was sent to all of its 
customers in March 2018, which set out the age eligibility criteria. Mr T says he never 
received a copy of this letter. Unfortunately, NatWest doesnt have a copy of the actual letter 
it sent to Mr T. And it also hasnt provided me with a screenshot or record to show the date 
this letter was sent to Mr T or where it was sent to. So I dont think NatWest has done 
enough to show me, on balance, that this particular letter was sent to Mr T.
However, the relevant regulators rules oblige banks to send their packaged bank account 
customers annual statements of eligibility for any insurance products that are attached to the 
account. NatWest has provided me with a template to show what information is set out on an 
annual eligibility statement. This includes a table setting out the eligibility criteria for each 
insurance benefit that comes with the account.
The travel insurance section includes the following information at the top of the table:
If anyone covered by the policy is aged 70 or over
When you or anyone who relies on this Travel Insurance policy reaches age 70 you must 
call each year to confirm cover. You or they will be medically screened and will be required 
to pay an annual premium of Â£75 per person insured aged 70 or over in addition to any 
premium charged for any declared existing medical condition, if you want these to be 
covered. You are not eligible for the benefits on this policy until you have called.
I think this section is clearly worded and sets out the need to pay an additional premium and 
go through medical screening once a policyholder turns 70, if they want to take advantage of 
the travel insurance attached to the account. 
NatWest says that the annual statements of eligibility were emailed to Mr T in September 
2017, 2018 and 2019. I appreciate L would like to see actual copies of the emails that were 
sent to Mr T and I understand why it mightve found this helpful. But NatWest has provided 
me with a screenshot showing that the statements were sent to the email address it has on 
file for Mr T on the dates it says the eligibility statements were sent. This record is labelled 
as ASoE (Annual statement of eligibility) last statement enquiry. So it seems to me that this 
record shows its most likely the annual statements of eligibility were sent to Mr T on the dates NatWest says they were. And given Ls told us Mr T has received some emails 
containing other information about his account from NatWest, Im satisfied NatWest sent 
these statements to Mr Ts correct email address.
Overall, while Mr T may not have received the annual eligibility statements from NatWest, 
Im satisfied, on balance, that its more likely than not that NatWest sent them to him. So I 
think it met its regulatory obligation to provide Mr T with annual eligibility statements. And I 
think NatWest provided Mr T with enough information about the policy age criteria to allow 
him to take the appropriate action with his insurer when he booked his trip. While I 
sympathise with Mr Ts position, I dont think NatWest has done anything wrong that it needs 
to put right. This means I make no award against NatWest.
I appreciate Mr T was also seeking for NatWest to cover Ls costs. Generally, we wont direct 
a financial business to pay a consumers legal fees. Thats because we are a free service 
and consumers can bring their complaints directly to us without any need for legal 
representation. This means that even if I had thought NatWest should pay Mr Ts claim 
costs, its very unlikely Id have directed it to pay Ls costs.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above, my final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 October 2020.
