The complaint
Mr E is unhappy that NewDay Ltd provided him with credit that was unaffordable for him and
didnt sufficiently explain what his rate of interest would be.
What happened
Mr E opened a credit account with NewDay at the end of 2017 with an initial credit limit of
£300. In June 2018, NewDay increased Mr Es credit limit to £1,300. Further credit limit
increases took place in October 2018 (to £2,500) and in May 2019 (to £3,250).
In August 2019, Mr E contacted NewDay and made them aware that he was in financial
difficulty. Mr Es account fell into arrears, and the account was ultimately defaulted by
NewDay in February 2020. Mr E wasnt happy about this, and he felt that NewDay shouldnt
have increased his credit limit when they did because the credit limit increases had been
unaffordable for him at those times, and that NewDay hadnt clearly told him what the rate of
interest on his account would be. So, he raised a complaint.
NewDay looked at Mr Es complaint. They felt that, with regard the initial account application
and the first two credit limit increases, there had been nothing resulting from the checks that
they had undertaken into Mr Es financial position at those times that should have made
them consider that the credit being offered might not be affordable for Mr E.
However, with regard the final credit limit increase in May 2019, NewDay acknowledged that
this credit limit increase shouldnt have been offered. So, they upheld Mr Es complaint on
that basis and reimbursed Mr E the interest, fees, and charges that had accrued on the
account following that credit limit increase.
Mr E wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but they felt that NewDay had undertaken
reasonable checks into Mr Es financial position at the time of the account application and
the credit limit increases, and they agreed that there had been nothing resulting from these
checks, up to and including the second credit limit increase, that should have given NewDay
cause to suspect that the credit being offered wasnt affordable for Mr E, at those times.
Additionally, our investigator felt that the response already issued by NewDay regarding the
final credit limit increase, including the reimbursement made to Mr E, did represent a fair
resolution to what had happened. And finally, our investigator noted that the rate of interest
had been clearly indicated to Mr E during the application process. So, they didnt uphold the
complaint.
Mr E remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I initially issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 15 July 2021 in which I explained 
that I was provisionally upholding this complaint in Mr Es favour as follows:
Its up to a business to decide whether they will offer credit to a customer, and if so,
how much and on what terms. What this service would expect would be that the
business would conduct reasonable and proportionate checks into the financial
circumstances of their customer at the time that the credit is being offered, to ensure
that the credit is affordable for that customer at that time.
For the most part, I feel that NewDay did that here. When Mr E first applied for the
account, NewDay took information directly from Mr E regarding his income and
expenditure to confirm that the potential payments due on the credit account would
have been within Mr Es means to pay.
Additionally, NewDay obtained data from the credit reference agencies to gain a
better understanding of Mr Es wider financial position. And, having reviewed the
information that NewDay obtained in this regard, Im satisfied that there was nothing
in this information that ought reasonably to have given NewDay cause to consider
that Mr Es credit account application, for a credit card with an initial limit of £300,
wouldnt have been affordable for him at the time that he applied for it.
Im also satisfied, having reviewed the relevant data, that the information that
NewDay gathered before offering the first two credit limit increases  in June and
October 2018  was such that there remained nothing within that data that should
have given NewDay reason to suspect that the increases in credit being offered to Mr
E werent affordable for him at those times.
I say this because, in both instances, the data obtained from the credit reference
agencies didnt indicate that Mr E was in financial difficulties at those times, including
that he had no active payday loans, and the management of Mr Es existing other
borrowing appeared reasonable. And, while the total amount of other borrowing did
increase by the time of the second credit limit increase, I dont feel that the amount of
this increase was such that NewDay shouldnt have felt that the credit limit increase
being offered wouldnt still have been affordable for Mr E at that time.
It also must be noted that Mr E had managed the NewDay account in question
without incident since it was taken out, and while Mr E had exceeded his credit limit
in the first few months of having the card, Mr E had made a complaint to NewDay
about this on the basis that he hadnt been given the correct information regarding
the amount of monthly payment he needed to make to stay within this limit. And this
complaint had been upheld by NewDay in Mr Es favour.
All of which means that Im satisfied that it was reasonable for NewDay to consider
that Mr E would have been able to afford the credit that was given to him, both at the
time of the initial account application and at the times of the first two credit limit
increases.
With regard the third credit limit increase  in May 2019  NewDay have already
acknowledged that this credit limit increase shouldnt have been offered to Mr E. And
this was because the data that NewDay obtained from the credit limit increases did
contain information that suggested that Mr Es financial position was worsening at
that time, and this data wasnt appropriately considered by NewDay before they
offered the credit limit increase to Mr E.As a result, NewDay have reimbursed to Mr Es account the interest, fees, and
charges incurred on the account after that date  totalling approximately £1,200.
However, in their correspondence with Mr E about this point, NewDay stated that
they were unwilling to amend Mr Es credit file as they felt that they had an obligation
to accurately report to the credit reference agencies what had taken place.
I can appreciate NewDays point here  to a degree. But it must be noted that Mr Es
account was defaulted with a balance of approximately £4,050  which was £800
above the £3,250 credit limit. Given that the reimbursement paid by NewDay to Mr E
was approximately £1,200, this means that following the reimbursement, Mr Es
account balance is below the credit limit of £3,250. And it doesnt feel fair to me that
Mr Es credit file shouldnt be amended, and that a default should remain on it for
exceeding the £3,250 credit limit, in these circumstances.
So, I will be provisionally upholding this aspect only of Mr Es complaint and
instructing NewDay to remove all adverse reporting from Mr Es credit file from the
date of the third credit limit increase  May 2019  onwards. This should result in Mr
Es account being reopened and having a balance lower that the £3,250 credit limit. It
would then be expected that NewDay would work with Mr E to agree a reasonable
repayment plan on the remaining balance, with NewDay providing Mr E with a fair
degree of forbearance.
Ill also be provisionally instructing NewDay to make a payment of £100 to Mr E for
the distress and inconvenience he may have incurred regarding this matter -
although NewDay may apply this amount to reduce the outstanding balance of Mr Es
account, if they choose to do so.
Finally, Mr E has stated that NewDay didnt sufficiently inform him of the interest rate
that would be applied to his account. However, having reviewed the information
available to me, Im satisfied that this information was readily available to Mr E, at
that time that he applied for the account, and so I do not uphold this aspect of his
complaint. 
However, following further information received from NewDay in response to that initial 
provisional decision, I issued a second provisional decision on 2 September 2021 in which I 
explained that I was not minded not to uphold this complaint, as follows:
The spirit of my provisional decision was that I didnt feel that it was fair that Mr E 
should incur adverse reporting on his credit file if it were the case that the 
reimbursements paid to his account by NewDay  in acknowledgement that certain 
credit limit increases provided to Mr E should never have taken place  took the 
balance of Mr Es account lower then credit limit amount he was reported to have 
exceeded.
However, subsequent to my provisional decision, NewDay provided further 
information that confirmed that my appraisal of the current position of Mr Es account, 
as outlined in my provisional decision letter, was incorrect.
Specifically, NewDay confirmed that they had in fact concluded themselves that only 
the first credit limit increase on the account was justified, and that all credit limits from 
the second credit limit increase  from £1,300 to £2,500 in October 2018  had been 
deemed by them as being unfair and that Mr Es account had, in March 2020, already 
been reimbursed all relevant interest, fees, and charges for his account balance 
beyond this time that exceeded £1,300.NewDay also confirmed to this service that the outstanding balance still owing on Mr 
Es account following these reimbursements was approximately £3,100, and so was 
greater than the credit limit of £1,300 that the reimbursements had been affected 
back to.
This means that it isnt the case, as I initially believed, that the reimbursements to Mr 
Es account had taken the balance of that account lower than the credit limit for which 
the account was reported to the credit reference agencies as having exceeded.
And it follows from this that it also isnt the case that Mr E has incurred adverse 
reporting on his credit file following the reimbursements paid to his account by 
NewDay taking the balance of his account lower then credit limit amount he was 
reported to have exceeded.
As such, the very basis on which I provisionally upheld this aspect of Mr Es 
complaint has been demonstrated to be invalid. And, given that after the 
reimbursements were applied to Mr Es account by NewDay the balance of that 
account remained above the relevant credit limit of £1,300, Im satisfied that any 
adverse information that has been recorded on Mr Es credit file in relation to his 
exceeding that credit limit following these reimbursements is fair and reasonable.
Finally, given that it remains my position that NewDay didnt act unfairly in approving 
Mr Es initial account application or in increasing the credit limit on the account in the 
first instance, it follows that my updated provisional decision will be that I do not 
uphold this complaint and that I wont be instructing NewDay to take any further 
action at this time.
In my second provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr E and NewDay the opportunity to 
provide any comments or further information that they might wish me to consider before I 
moved to a final decision.
NewDay confirmed that they were happy to accept my revised provisional decision. 
However, Mr E expressed his dissatisfaction at the change of outcome detailed in my 
second provisional decision and forwarded details of two Consent Orders, one of which 
demonstrated that Mr E had incurred a County Court Judgement a few months before he 
applied for the NewDay account and which Mr E felt that NewDay should have been aware 
of, had they undertaken the checks into his financial position that they said theyd done at 
that time, and which Mr E feels should have provided a clear indication to NewDay that his 
credit application with them shouldnt have been approved.
I presented this new information to NewDay and asked for their comments. NewDay 
confirmed that had they been aware at the time of the application that Mr E had recently 
incurred a County Court Judgement that they wouldnt have approved his application or 
offered credit to him. However, NewDay confirmed that they did obtain information from a 
credit reference agency at the time that Mr E applied for the account, and that no record of 
the County Court Judgement was present in that information presented to them.
It's unclear why information about Mr Es recent County Court Judgement wasnt included in 
the information provided to them by the credit reference agency, but Im satisfied from the 
information that NewDay have provided to this service that they did obtain information from 
the credit reference agency at that time, as would be expected of them, and that this 
information didnt include any reference to a County Court Judgement.NewDay can only make lending decisions based on the information that they receive. If it 
had been the case that NewDay hadnt sought to check Mr Es wider financial position 
before issuing the credit account to him, then I might think differently here, but given that 
NewDay did undertake the credit reference agency checks that would be expected of them, 
and these checks didnt inform NewDay of Mr Es recent County Court Judgement, I dont 
feel that I can reasonably or fairly censure NewDay for approving Mr Es credit account 
application in this instance. Indeed, Im satisfied that NewDay approved Mr Es credit 
account application in good faith, and in consideration of all the information that they had 
available to them at that time.
Additionally, NewDay have confirmed that their stated account application criteria included 
that persons who had incurred a County Court Judgement within the last twelve months 
shouldnt apply. But Mr E made his application to NewDay within two months of incurring a 
County Court Judgement, and as such at a time when he didnt meet the necessary 
application criteria. Its also notable that Mr E didnt declare his recent County Court 
Judgement to NewDay at any time during the application process.
All of which means that I dont feel that this further information presented by Mr E gives me 
any reasonable cause to change the outcome of my provisional decision as explained in my 
second provisional decision letter, and as such I can confirm that my final decision will be a 
confirmation of that later provisional decision and that I wont be upholding this complaint.
I realise that this wont be the final decision that Mr E was wanting, but I hope that hell 
understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2021.
