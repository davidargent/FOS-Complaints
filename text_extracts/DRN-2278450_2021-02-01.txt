The complaint
Mr C complains about Revolut Ltds decision to hold him responsible for transactions which 
he says he didnt authorise. 
What happened
In March 2020, Mr C received a notification from his Revolut online banking application to let 
him know his card had been frozen due to suspicious activity. A series of transactions were 
made from Mr Cs account to a gambling account. Mr C says he was at work at the time, on 
a night shift, and isnt meant to use his card while working. Mr C says the notifications 
continued and so he pressed a few buttons to try and make them stop. Mr C thinks he may 
have accidently authorised the transactions.
When Mr C finished work, he went to his locker to get his belongings and noticed his Revolut 
debit card was missing. Mr C confirmed his other debit cards remained in his wallet. Mr C 
called Revolut to report the transactions and completed a chargeback form. Mr C also 
contacted the gambling site, but they couldnt help him as Mr C said it wasnt him who 
opened the gambling account.
The transactions relevant to the dispute are as follows:

Revolut didnt return the money To Mr C. They said that as Mr C was using his mobile 
banking app at the time of the transactions, and also unblocked the card by authorising them 
on the app, they were holding him liable for the transactions. 
Mr C brought the complaint to our service. As part of the investigators review, she requested 
information from the gambling site in question. The gambling site confirmed that the account 
was opened on the same day the disputed transactions started  29 March 2020. And the 
account was opened in Mr Cs name including his personal details such as his address, date 
of birth, telephone number and email address. The investigator also learned that £259 was 
credited back into Mr Cs account from the gambling site in September 2020. However, it 
doesnt appear that the account had been used between the date of the disputes in March 
2020 and the credit in September 2020.
The investigator didnt uphold Mr Cs complaint. She said that she thought it was more likely 
than not Mr C who authorised the transactions. In summary she thought there wasnt a clear 
point of compromise as to how an unauthorised person would have had access to Mr Cs 
personal information to open the gambling account. So, she thought that even if Mr C had 
lost his card, the card alone wouldnt have been enough to carry out the transactions.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the investigator for broadly the same reasons. Ive explained 
further below.
The basic position is that Revolut can hold Mr C liable for the disputed payments if the 
evidence suggests its more likely than not that he made them or authorised them. For each 
transaction, Revolut has been able to provide evidence to show these payments were 
appropriately authenticated (using the card number, security code and expiry date) but that 
isnt enough to hold Mr C liable. I also need to consider whether the evidence suggests he 
consented to them.
The issues I have considered include: 
A gambling account was opened on 29 March 2020  the same day as the first 
disputed transaction  in Mr Cs name. This was done with his correct personal 
details, including his date of birth and address. The email and mobile phone number 
used also match those Mr C used when he brought his complaint to us. 
Theres nothing definitive from these details that show the account was set up by 
someone else or by Mr C. Although I do wonder how someone who isnt Mr C would 
have known this amount of personal information.Mr C told us when he tried to contact the gambling site, they wouldnt speak to him 
because he told them it wasnt him who opened the account. 
By reviewing Mr Cs statements, I can see the disputed transactions all took place 
between 10.24pm on 29 March 2020 through to around 3.20am on 30 March 2020. 
Mr C says he was at work at the time on a night shift.
Revolut blocked the card due to suspicious activity which flagged on their security 
systems at around 01.31am on 30 March 2020.
Mr C unblocked the card, and in turn authorised the payments on his mobile banking 
application around a minute after it was blocked.
Mr C said he unblocked the card by mistake because he was trying to make the 
notifications stop because he was at work and shouldnt have been using his phone.
Mr C said he realised his card was missing from his locker when he ended his night 
shift at around 3am on 30 March 2020  however his other cards remained in his 
wallet.
If I was to believe Mr C hadnt made these transactions himself, Id be accepting that an 
unauthorised third party stole Mr Cs card, opened a gambling account in Mr Cs name using 
his personal information and pursued to spend money on the gambling site without making 
any withdrawals. 
I think its reasonable to believe that a fraudster attempting to use Mr Cs money unlawfully, 
would likely want to benefit from the activity. Therefore, I find it difficult to believe they would 
open the gambling account in Mr Cs name and not make any withdrawals for their own 
benefit. In fact, the gambling account was left with around £250 in there and wasnt used 
again until the money was withdrawn to Mr Cs own personal Revolut account in September 
2020.
Ive thought carefully about what Mr C has said about his card going missing. The last 
authorised transaction Mr C made was in a supermarket in the afternoon before Mr Cs shift 
started at work. Mr C says he may have lost his card in the supermarket  or it may have 
been taken from somebody at work.
If Mr C lost his card in the supermarket, it must have been while he was walking out. I say 
that because he successfully paid for his shopping using chip and PIN which he doesnt 
dispute. While its plausible a third party could have taken Mr Cs card, I find it unlikely they 
would have known Mr Cs personal details such as his date of birth, home address, email 
address and telephone number to open an account with the gambling site. And I dont think 
its likely they would have waited around 10 hours to start using the card. So, I dont 
conclude this is what happened.
Ive then thought about whether somebody at Mr Cs work could have taken his card. Again, 
its difficult to see how somebody at work would have known the level of personal details 
used to open the gambling account. However, it may be that Mr C has shared this with his 
colleagues so it could be a plausible option. However, I do find it difficult to understand why 
somebody from Mr Cs work would open the gambling account in Mr Cs name and not 
benefit from the money in there. Ive also seen no explanation as to how somebody could 
have accessed Mr Cs card as he says it was in his wallet which was in his locker. Mr C also 
said his other cards remained in his wallet and only his Revolut card went missing. This isnt 
what Id expect to see from somebody trying to steal money from Mr C  it would seem more 
realistic that somebody would take all of Mr Cs cards to take as much money as possible.
Ive reviewed the transactions which took place on the gambling site and can see that at one 
point, the account had a balance of over £2,000 from winnings. However, instead of this 
money being withdrawn, it was used to continue to make transactions on the website. I dont find this a usual pattern of a fraudster. I say that because a fraudster usually tries to gain 
from their actions  so it would have been more likely a fraudster would withdraw the money 
for them to access directly once theyd made such a large profit. 
Revoluts security systems blocked Mr Cs card due to the amount of transactions which had 
been made. However, Mr C unblocked the card using his mobile banking application a 
couple of minutes afterwards. Mr C has said he didnt intend to unblock the card and was 
rushing through the screens on his mobile banking application to stop the notifications. I 
appreciate Mr C was at work while this was happening and said he wasnt allowed to be on 
his phone. Ive thought really carefully about this point. Revolut have provided us with 
screenshots to show the journey a consumer would have to go through to confirm the 
unblocking of the card. Having considered the amount of information on the screens Mr C 
would have seen, and the warning messages, I think its reasonable to assume Mr C knew 
he would be unblocking the card and authorising the transactions. Mr C also didnt need to 
respond to the notification straight away  if he hadnt, the card would have remained 
blocked until Mr C had the opportunity to log on when he had the time to focus on it. I cant 
fairly hold Revolut responsible for Mr Cs decision to use his phone while he was working.
I appreciate Mr C said he shouldnt have been on his phone, and this situation resulted in 
him losing his job. But he would have only been on his phone for a few minutes while 
completing the screens to unblock the card, so I think its more likely than not he lost his job 
due to being on his phone most of the evening carrying out the transactions on the gambling 
site. 
Mr C received a credit into his Revolut account in September 2020 from the gambling site. I 
havent seen any evidence to show that Mr C queried this transaction and therefore it seems 
he was expecting to receive it. If Mr C didnt have an account with this site like he says, I 
cant understand why Mr C would have been expecting a credit from them. 
Therefore, considering the circumstances of this complaint, and the activities which have 
taken place, I cant reach any reasonable conclusion here other than to say I think Mr C is 
responsible for the disputed payments. So, it follows that I wont be asking Revolut to do 
anything differently.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2021.
