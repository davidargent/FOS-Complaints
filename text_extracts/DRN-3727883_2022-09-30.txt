The complaint
Mr G says National Westminster Bank Plc was unfair to decline his application to convert his 
mortgage to interest only and increase his borrowing.
What happened
Mr G has a repayment mortgage and other banking products with NatWest. In February 
2022 he applied for additional borrowing and to switch to interest only payments. Mr G 
considers himself a low risk customer and says it was unfair for NatWest to decline his 
application. He says as a premier customer he should be able to access all of the products 
offered by NatWest. Mr G says he was told his application was declined due to NatWest 
writing off a business loan in 2018. He says this is unfair and a breach of data protection 
rules.
I sent a provisional decision which said, in summary, that NatWest declined Mr Gs 
application fairly and in line with its lending criteria. I said while there was poor 
communication and a delay in NatWest refunding the product fee, the £100 compensation it 
offered was fair.
Both parties agreed. In the circumstances, I see no reason to change my findings from my 
provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Lenders are entitled to make a commercial decision about their lending criteria. They dont 
have to share their criteria with customers.
In early March 2022 NatWest told Mr G his application was declined due to adverse data 
coming to light. Mr G says his relationship manager told him this related to NatWest having 
written off a loan (of about £60,000) in 2018. NatWest has confirmed this was the reason. 
Mr Gs application didnt meet NatWests lending criteria. I dont think it made an error or 
treated him unfairly when it declined his application.
I think it was fair for NatWest to consider how Mr G had managed loan repayments in the 
past. This would include the business loan that Mr G had guaranteed and which wasnt 
repaid in full.
Mr G says NatWest didnt tell him that writing off this debt would affect future loan 
applications. But I dont think Mr G would have acted differently if it had. In 2014 Mr G told 
NatWest he was living overseas and wasnt worried about the debt affecting his credit file. 
This suggests Mr G was aware that there could be adverse consequences from failing to pay 
the debt, even if he wasnt worried about this at the time. NatWest was in discussions with 
Mr G about the debt for some years, with Mr G saying consistently that he couldnt afford to 
repay it. When Mr G made an offer of full and final settlement of the debt he told NatWest 
that was as much as he could afford. So Mr G wasnt in a position to repay the debt in full, 
regardless of how this might affect his ability to borrow in future.
NatWest provides information to customers about how it uses data. Other than in relation to 
his loan application, Mr G hasnt said how he feels his data has been misused. As Ive said, I 
think it was fair for NatWest to take into consideration the business loan that Mr G 
guaranteed and which wasnt repaid in full. If Mr G considers this is a breach of data 
protection rules he can consider contacting ICO. 
Mr G says hes paid a monthly fee to be a premium customer. He says NatWest shouldnt 
have accepted his business if it didnt consider he was an acceptable customer. From what 
Mr G says he has a number of banking products with NatWest, and he chose to pay a fee to 
be a premium customer. That doesnt mean that NatWest has to offer further borrowing to 
him or agree to change the terms of his borrowing, and I havent seen anything to suggest 
that NatWest told Mr G it would. I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to 
refund any fees or profit related to Mr G being a premium customer.
NatWest did make an error when it didnt refund the product fee (of £995) until early April 
2022. And it didnt confirm in writing that Mr Gs application was declined. NatWest offered 
£100 compensation for this, which I think is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
My final decision
My decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay £100 to Mr G, if it hasnt 
already done so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2022.
