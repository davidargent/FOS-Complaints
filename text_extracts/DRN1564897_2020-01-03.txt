K820x#14complaint
Ms P complains  about National Westminster Bank Plc charges on her account  that have left 
her in financial difficulty.
background
Miss P says the charges  applied to her account  by NatWest are unfair  and have caused her 
severe financial hardship. She also says the letters it has sent to her are threatening and 
NatWest has been  unhelpful.
NatWest says the charges have been  applied in line with the account terms and conditions  
and that its not made a mistake. It says it refunded charges in 2016  of about £250  when it 
agreed a repayment  plan with Miss P and its also refunded £72 of charges when Miss P 
made it aware of her position  in 2019. NatWest says it doesnt have a record  of any other  
contact from Miss P.
Miss P brought her complaint to us but our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought the charges were  applied in line with the account terms and conditions.  She thought 
NatWest should  treat customers  in financial difficulties positively and sympathetically and 
thought it had acted in such  a way here by agreeing the repayment  plan and refunding 
charges. The investigator didnt  think  the letters were threatening.
Miss P didnt accept  that view and said in summary  that there was no repayment plan in 
2016 and asked the investigator to listen to the calls between  her and NatWest. She says 
shes been left in dire financial hardship and told NatWest her income was benefits.  She also 
says NatWest agreed to freeze interest  until this complaint was resolved.
The investigator asked  NatWest for the calls but it couldnt find any. NatWest  said charges 
had been frozen.
The investigator issued  a second  view which again  didnt uphold  Miss Ps complaint.
Miss P doesnt accept  that view and says NatWest  charges are above the base interest rate 
and it should have taken into account  her disability. She says NatWest is not being truthful 
about the calls.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall view as the investigator and for the same reasons.  I realise Miss P will be 
disappointed by my decision. I also make  clear to Miss P that I can only look at those parts  
of her complaint that NatWest has had an opportunity  to look at and so I cant comment  on 
her latest  complaint about NatWest failing  to make reasonable adjustments  for her disability.
I have looked  at the account terms and conditions which  I think Miss P would have agreed to 
when the account was first opened. And having done so Im satisfied that NatWest is entitled 
to charge Miss P when  her account was overdrawn.  So Im satisfied that NatWest hasnt 
made a mistake or acted unfairly be charging Miss P when her account became overdrawn  
and has acted in line with those account  terms and conditions.
Ref: DRN15648972I appreciate Miss P also says those charges are too high. But following a Supreme Court  
case it has been decided  that charges cant be challenged on the grounds they are too high 
and so unfair. For the reasons I have explained  I dont think NatWest has acted unfairly  and I 
also think its up to NatWest to decide what those charges  are when exercising  its 
commercial judgement.
I have looked  at Miss Ps account statements since the account was opened.  And I dont 
think the account was overdrawn regularly and can see that during  that period it was usually 
in credit.  I can see that in September 2016 the account was overdrawn and again in early 
2019. But I can also see that Miss P stopped crediting the account in early 2019  which  I 
think caused the account to be overdrawn. So whilst I appreciate  that Miss P says shes  
been caused severe financial  hardship  I dont think its clear why she says that was the case  
over the time period  the account  was opened.
Banks and building societies should treat customers in financial difficulties positively  and 
sympathetically. I can see from NatWests notes in 2016 that it agreed a repayment  plan with 
Miss P when the account  was overdrawn and refunded about £250 of charges. I appreciate  
that Miss P says that no such plan was agreed. But I think  on balance  such a plan was 
agreed. I say that as I can see that NatWests notes say the plan was for £87.71 which was 
the balance on Miss Ps account that day. So Im satisfied  that in 2016 NatWest did treat 
Miss P appropriately and fairly. I also think that the plan wasnt  needed as Miss P credited 
her account  shortly after and there would have been no need for a repayment  plan in those 
circumstances.
I appreciate Miss P would have liked me to have listened to that call between the parties in 
2016 and any later calls. But Im satisfied that NatWest has carried out all reasonable 
searches for any calls but without success.  I dont  think  I need to listen  to that call from 2016 
as I think its clear NatWest acted positively and sympathetically by refunding  charges.
Im also satisfied that when Miss P made NatWest aware of further difficulties in 2019 that it 
again acted positively and sympathetically by refunding charges and freezing interest. I 
appreciate Miss P says the letters  NatWest sent her were threatening but whilst Im sorry to 
disagree with Miss P I think NatWest would have been  obliged to have sent them  and Im 
satisfied they were appropriate in the circumstances.
Overall Im satisfied NatWest has acted fairly and so I cant  order it to do anything  further  in 
the circumstances of this complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision 3 February 2020.
