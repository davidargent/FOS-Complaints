my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  affordability - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry 
practice - on our website.
Relevant rules and regulation include the Office  of Fair Tradings Irresponsible Lending 
Guidance (ILG) until April 2014,  at which time the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
introduced its Consumer Credit Sourcebook  (CONC). The content of the ILG and CONC at 
the times  Provident  lent to Mr R was broadly similar and made it clear what  was expected  of 
regulated consumer credit firms like Provident in terms of what constituted responsible  and 
irresponsible lending.
The ILG set out examples of what might constitute  irresponsible lending, including  (bold 
emphasis as per source):
4.20 Failing  to undertake a reasonable assessment  of affordability in an individual case or 
cases.
Ref: DRN110105624.21 Failing to consider sufficient information to be able to reasonably assess  affordability, 
prior to granting credit, significantly  increasing  the total amount of credit  provided, or 
significantly increasing the credit limit (in the case of a running  account credit
agreement).

This could (but not necessarily) include,  for example: Where applicable, appropriate  and 
proportionate, failing to verify  details  of current income and/or expenditure by, for example, 
checking hard copies of payslip/contract of employment (when a borrower  is in employment),
accountant's letters (when a borrower  is self-employed) or benefit statements (when a 
borrower is not in employment).
4.22 Failing to undertake an assessment of creditworthiness of a borrower  on the basis of 
sufficient information  obtained from the borrower  where this is appropriate, and a credit 
reference agency where this is necessary, before  a regulated consumer credit agreement, 
other than an excluded agreement, is made  with the borrower, or the amount of credit 
provided by the creditor to the borrower  is increased significantly, or the credit limit is 
increased significantly (in respect of an agreement for running account credit), in accordance  
with the requirements  of section 55B of the Act.
4.23 Failing to take reasonable  steps  to assess (on the basis  of information  that the creditor 
is aware of at the time the credit is granted)  whether  a prospective borrower is likely to be 
able to meet  repayments in a sustainable  manner.
4.27 Inappropriately encouraging borrowers  to increase, aggregate or roll over existing 
debt to unsustainable levels.
The following  are also listed in the ILG as deceptive  and/or unfair practices:
6.25 Repeatedly refinancing (or 'rolling over') a borrower's existing credit commitment for a 
short-term credit product  in a way that is unsustainable or otherwise harmful.

The OFT considers that this would include a creditor allowing a borrower to sequentially 
enter into a number of separate  agreements  for short-term loan products, one after another,  
where the overall effect is to increase  the borrower's indebtedness in an unsustainable  
manner. The general purpose of short-term  loans, such as 'payday  loans', is to provide 
borrowers with a cash advance until their next pay day and they are usually about 30 days,  
or just over,  in duration. The purpose  of payday  loans is to act as a short-term solution to 
temporary cash flow problems experienced by consumers. They  are not appropriate for 
supporting sustained borrowing over longer periods, for which  other products are likely  to be 
more suitable.
The language used in CONC in the relevant period  was similar  to the language used in ILG, 
for example (non-exhaustive):
CONC 5.3.1G
(1) In making the creditworthiness assessment  or the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R 
(1), a firm should take into account more  than assessing the customer's ability  to repay  the 
credit. 
(2) The creditworthiness assessment and the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R (1) 
should include the firm taking reasonable steps  to assess the customer's ability  to meet 
repayments under a regulated credit  agreement in a sustainable manner  without the 
customer incurring financial difficulties or experiencing significant adverse consequences.
Ref: DRN11010563
CONC 6.7.22G
A firm should not allow a customer to enter into consecutive agreements with the firm for high-
cost short-term credit if the cumulative effect of the agreements would be that the total amount 
payable by the customer is unsustainable .
I have carefully considered all the arguments,  evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.  
Provident needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Provident should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Provident was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
Ref: DRN11010564As theres  been  no ongoing dispute  since the adjudicators recommendation that loans 1 to 6 
should not be upheld, Ive not looked  as closely at these loans in my decision. I do think that 
for loans  1 to 3 its reasonable to say Providents checks  were proportionate. For loans 4 to 
6, I do not think Provident  carried out proportionate checks, but also do not think the pattern 
of lending at this stage suggested the lending had become unsustainable.  I have  no 
information to tell me whether proportionate  checks at this time wouldve suggested these 
loans were unaffordable and so I do not uphold the complaint about  loans  4 to 6.
I have also looked  at the overall pattern of Providents lending  history with Mr R, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Provident should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Provident should have realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
Loan 7 and I say this because:
By the time Provident approved loan 7, Mr R had been approved for 6 loans in 
around 18 months  and the amount approved (individually and cumulatively) was 
the largest amount to date.  It appears that loan 7 was likely used to refinance loan 4, 
which was previously  Mr Rs largest loan and loans 5 and 6 were  still outstanding. 
From all of this, Provident ought to have realised Mr R wasnt likely  simply in need of 
short-term cash1 and that his indebtedness  was increasing in a way which wasnt 
likely to be sustainable.
Mr R didnt really  make any inroads  into the amount he owed Provident. Loans 
including and after loan 7 appear  to have been used to refinance previous loans or 
were taken  so soon after previous loans that the cumulative effect  was also to extend 
Mr Rs indebtedness in a way which wasnt sustainable. Loans 14 to 17 were for a 
total of £4,500 and represented  a clear  further increase in Mr Rs overall borrowing.
In total, Mr R borrowed from Provident, without any real breaks,  for about seven 
years. Mr R had paid large  amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to 
Provident over an extended period.
I think that Mr R lost out because Provident  continued to provide borrowing from Loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit use over an extended period.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Rs ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about  Loans 7 to 17 and Provident should  put things right.
putting things right
Provident should not have  given Mr R loans 7 to 17.
1 I note Providents product  literature for its Handycash  loans says, Borrowing small sums over 
short terms  is more expensive than larger  sums over a longer term.  Handycash loans  are intended  to 
meet short-term, immediate needs.  These are not suitable if you are looking  for a long term,  high 
value loan.
Ref: DRN11010565If Provident has sold the outstanding debts, it should  buy these back if able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If Provident  is not able to buy the debts back, then it should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
Provident should: 
A) add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr R towards interest,  fees and 
charges on all upheld  loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything  already 
refunded.
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr R which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr R originally made the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled.
C) remove  all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding  loans, 
and treat any repayments made by Mr R as though they had been repayments of the 
principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr R having  made  overpayments  then 
Provident should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint 
is settled. It should  then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans and any principal Provident  
may already have  written-off. If this results in a surplus, then the surplus  should  be paid to
Mr R. However,  if there is still an outstanding balance then it should try to agree an 
affordable repayment  plan with Mr R. Provident shouldnt pursue  outstanding balances made 
up of principal already  written-off.
E) The overall pattern  of Mr Rs borrowing for Loans 7 to 17 means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse, so Provident  should remove these loans entirely from Mr Rs credit  
file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Provident  to deduct tax from this interest.  It needs to give
Mr R a certificate showing  how much tax it has deducted,  if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN11010566my final decision
I uphold Mr Rs complaint  in part. Provident  Personal Credit Limited must put things  right by 
taking the steps  set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2020.
