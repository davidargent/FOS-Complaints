Our adjudicator upheld Mr Bs complaint in part and thought loans 5 onwards shouldnt 
have been given. MyKredit disagreed so the complaint was passed to me.
I reached a different conclusion to the adjudicator and so issued a provisional decision (see 
extract below which forms part of this final decision). I asked both parties to let me have any 
further evidence, information or comments by 6 July 2020. 
Mr B replied saying he accepted the findings in the provisional decision. MyKredit did not 
respond.
Extract from my provisional decision
MyKredit needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make 
sure Mr B could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take 
into account a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the 
DRN-1987212repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that MyKredit should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
make any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of 
income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period 
of time during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk 
that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or 
was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MyKredit was required to 
establish whether Mr B could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow 
this is the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be 
able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as 
well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender 
should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able 
to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their 
repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided 
in this context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. Having done so, Ive 
reached a different conclusion to the adjudicator. Ill explain why.
MyKredit has told us about the affordability and creditworthiness checks it carried out 
for Mr Bs loans. As I set out earlier in this decision, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship we think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. 
However, we would always expect a lender to act on any information it gathers from 
the checks it decides to do.
As part of the checks MyKredit completed to make its lending decision for loan 1 it 
carried out a credit check for Mr B. This showed that he had five other active short-
term loans with different lenders. I think from this MyKredit ought to have realised that 
Mr B was most likely having problems managing his money and so he was unlikely to 
be able to repay this loan, or any subsequent loans, sustainably. And so it shouldnt 
have agreed to lend to Mr B. At least until it had evidence that his finances had 
stabilised  and I cant see it had this when it agreed to loans 2 to 6. It follows I think 
MyKredit was wrong to give loans 1 to 6 to Mr B.Ive then looked at the overall pattern of MyKredits lending history with Mr B, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which MyKredit should reasonably have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MyKredit should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Bs case I think, like the adjudicator, that this 
point was reached by loan 7. I say this because:
At this point MyKredit ought to have realised Mr B was not managing to 
repay his loans sustainably. Mr B had taken out seven loans in less than 
three months. So MyKredit ought to have realised it was more likely than 
not Mr B was having problems managing his money and that Mr Bs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Bs pattern of borrowing was in itself evidence of the unsustainability of 
the lending. He took out loan 3 the day after repaying loan 1; loan 4 three 
days after repaying loan 2; loan 5 on the same day as repaying loan 3; loan 6 
just days after repaying loans 3 and 4 and loan 7 just days after repaying 
loans 5 and 6. So I think MyKredit ought to have realised there was a risk that 
he was borrowing to make up for the hole in his finances that repaying 
previous loans had caused. And it was likely that Mr B had longer-term 
financial issues, not just a short-term cash flow problem.
Loan 7 was for the same amount as loan 1  there was no evidence of a 
consistent and significant reduction in the amount Mr B needed to borrow.
Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MyKredit. Loan 
19 was taken out around seven months after Mr Bs first. Mr B had paid 
large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to MyKredit over an 
extended period. This is a high volume of relending, and the loans MyKredit 
was giving Mr B were high cost  so I think they were most likely unsuitable 
for his apparent ongoing need.
I think that Mr B lost out because MyKredit continued to provide borrowing from 
loan 7 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an 
extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr B borrowed from 
MyKredit were likely to have had negative implications on Mr Bs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
I have considered the points that MyKredit raised in response to the adjudicators 
review. MyKredit said Mr B didnt show any hint of difficulty repaying his loans, and 
there was no structure showing he was paying one with another. But I disagree. As 
Ive set out above there was a clear and repeated pattern of borrowing very soon 
after loan repayment. So MyKredit ought to have realised there was a high risk Mr 
Bs repayments were not made sustainably.
MyKredit also said that given Mr Bs disposable income of around £600, his interest 
payments of around £30 to £40 a month were affordable. But this point does not 
consider its obligation as a responsible lender to look at the sustainability of the 
borrowing, not just the pounds and pence affordability. And for all the reasons I have 
set out in this provisional decision, I think there was clear evidence that Mr B was struggling to manage his money  right from the start of the lending relationship.
In summary, Im planning to uphold the complaint in full and MyKredit will need to put 
things right.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party provided any new evidence, information or comments there is no reason for 
me to change the findings or outcome I set out in my provisional decision.
It follows I am upholding Mr Bs complaint in full.
Putting things right  what MyKredit needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 1 to 19;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from
the date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information about loans 1 to 6 from Mr Bs credit file;
the number of loans taken from 7 onwards means any information
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 7 to 19 should
be removed from Mr Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MyKredit to take off tax from this interest. MyKredit 
must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I am upholding this complaint in full and Global Kapital Group Ltd (trading as MyKredit) must 
par Mr B compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 August 2020.
