K822xcomplaint
Mr K complains that NewDay Ltd didnt allow him to make a payment online.  There was no 
prior notice that this wouldnt be possible. As a result, he made  a late payment which was 
recorded on his credit file. He thinks  this is unfair.  
background 
It appears that Mr K had an outstanding  debt with NewDay Ltd. His preferred method of 
payment was online payments. On one of the occasions that he wanted  to make a payment, 
he went online to find that the service wasnt  available. He had insufficient time to make the 
payment in person and it ended up being  a day late. 
Mr K says that he had no prior notice from NewDay Ltd saying that he wouldnt be able to 
make an online payment. Because the payment was late, NewDay  Ltd recorded this on 
Mr Ks credit  file. 
Mr K says that, because  of this, he has been  unable  to get good credit rates. 
Mr K contacted us to raise a complaint against NewDay  Ltd in February 2018. There was a 
delay on our part in progressing the complaint. Our investigator then contacted NewDay Ltd 
a number of times to get their file. She wasnt sent this. Nor was she given NewDay Ltds  
thoughts on this complaint. 
Eventually, our investigator found  that, as she hadnt received any information from NewDay  
Ltd, they were  wrong to have  placed a late payment marker on Mr Ks credit  file.  
NewDay Ltd were given the opportunity  to respond  to this but they didnt. I then looked  at the 
complaint and gave  my initial  thoughts  to NewDay Ltd and to Mr K. I agreed  with our 
investigator but gave  both Mr K and NewDay Ltd to respond with further  information  that 
they might  want me to take into account.  
NewDay Ltd came back saying that the complaint was brought  to us out of time and that 
they didnt give us consent to look at the complaint outside of the six month time limit.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay Ltd say that the Mr K brought the complaint to us outside of the six month time limit 
that is allowed. I have  looked into this and find that it isnt the case. NewDay  Ltd wrote their 
final response letter on 30 November  2017.  Mr K contacted our service  on 12 February  
2018. Although  there was some delay on our part in dealing with the complaint,  it is clear 
that Mr K came to us within six months of getting  the final response letter.  Therefore,  it is a 
complaint that we can look at. 
As to whether  to uphold the complaint, I agree  with the investigator  that it should  be upheld.  I 
will explain  why. 
Ref: DRN32531222From all that I have seen, I think that Mr K did try to make his payment on time but was 
unable to because  NewDay  Ltds service wasnt working. 
Mr K made the payment  as soon as he could, in fact, the very next day. 
I dont think that NewDay  Ltd shouldve placed a late payment marker on Mr Ks credit file. I 
think that this should  be removed and compensation given to Mr K for the distress and 
inconvenience that he has suffered. 
my final decision
Because Mr K did try to make his payment on time but was unable to do so because  of 
NewDay Ltds poor service, I require NewDay Ltd to do the following:
1.remove the late payment marker for Mr Ks credit file
2.pay Mr K compensation  of Â£200 for the distress  and inconvenience caused  to him by 
their actions.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019.
