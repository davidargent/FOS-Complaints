K821x#15Complaint
Mr H has complained that Response Funding Limited (trading as Fancyapayday.co.uk) 
irresponsibly lent to him. 
Background
Mr H was provided with eighteen  loans between  October 2013  and January 2017. 
Fancyapayday has provided  limited information  about these  loans in relation to their 
repayment history and when they were paid but based on what  I do have this is his lending  
history.

One of our adjudicators looked  at Mr Hs complaint and concluded that Fancyapayday 
unfairly and irresponsibly provided loans 4 to 18 to Mr H. So she partially upheld the 
complaint. 
Fancyapayday responded to say that it would look into our assessment and in the meantime 
calculated how much compensation it needed to pay Mr H. It then asked our adjudicator  to 
confirm Mr H accepted  this offer and provide details of where  Mr H wanted to be paid. Mr H 
confirmed his acceptance and provided his details. Fancyapayday  then clarified that it did 
not agree  with our assessment but did not say why but it did ask that this case  be passed 
forward for a final decision.
Ref: DRN56962192My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Fancyapayday needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Fancyapayday should fairly  and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Fancyapayday was required to 
establish whether  Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 4 and 5 would most likely have 
shown that Mr H was having issues managing his money. As he was borrowing from multiple 
sources at the time of both of these loans it wouldve shown that it was unlikely he wouldve 
been able to pay either of these loans in a sustainable manner. To explain  in the month  prior 
Ref: DRN56962193to the January 2014 loan Mr H took up to 6 separate loans with other  lenders this borrowing 
totalled over £800  and in January itself a further  6 loans were taken out again exceeding 
£800. Further loans  were taken out in the following months. Had proportionate checks been 
carried out I think that Fancyapayday wouldve found this and therefore I think  that it 
wouldve known that Mr H was struggling to manage  his finances. So Im upholding loans 4 
and 5.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Fancyapaydays lending  history with Mr H, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Fancyapayday should reasonably have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Fancyapayday should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Fancyapayday ought  to have realised Mr H was not managing to repay 
his loans sustainably.  Mr H had been  indebted to Fancyapayday for 7 months. So 
Fancyapayday ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr H was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Hs first loan was for £175 and loan 6 was for £156. At this point Fancyapayday 
ought to have known that Mr H was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall 
in their income but to meet an ongoing  need.  
From  6 onwards Mr H was provided  with a new loan within  weeks of settling a 
previous one. I note that there  is a gap between loan 16 and 17. But by this point     
Mr H had been borrowing for so long I dont  think this gap was sufficient to indicate 
that Mr Hs underlying issues were resolved or that he was not reliant on this kind of 
borrowing.
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Fancyapayday. Loan  18 
was taken out around 38 months  after Mr Hs first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr 
H had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Fancyapayday 
over an extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out because Fancyapayday continued to provide  borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Hs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about 4 and 5 and loans 6  18 and Fancyapayday 
should put things right.
Putting things  right  what  Fancyapayday needs to do
Ref: DRN56962194refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on 4 -18 taken out between  January 2014 
and January 2017;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about 4 and 5 from Mr Hs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loan 6 to 18 should be removed from Mr 
Hs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Fancyapayday to take off tax from this interest. 
Fancyapayday must give Mr H a certificate  showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for 
one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. Response  Funding 
Limited (trading as Fancyapayday) should  pay Mr H compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 November 2019.
