The complaint
Mr C has complained PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie, SCA wont refund Â£195 for an 
unauthorised transaction.
What happened
In February 2021 Mr C noticed a transaction on his PayPal account he didnt recognise. He 
queried this with PayPal. PayPal told him timescales had expired for them to take any action. 
They drew his attention to their user agreement.
Mr C was unhappy with this and brought his complaint to the ombudsman service.
Our investigator noted that the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (PSRs) state that a 
payment service user, Mr C in this case, need to notify their payment service provider 
(PayPal) no later than 13 months after the debit date. On this basis she couldnt ask 
PayPal to do anything further.
Mr C doesnt believe this is the case and has asked his complaint to be reviewed further.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator. Ill explain why.
Theres no dispute that Mr Cs PayPal account was debited in October 2018. Mr C only got 
in touch with PayPal in February 2021 to confirm this was unauthorised. Thats more than 
13 months after the original debit. I can confirm this means that Mr C has no legal protection 
to be refunded for an unauthorised debit to his account in accordance with the PSRs. 
PayPals own user agreement also confirm they have no liability for unauthorised 
transactions after 13 months have passed.
Mr C has made the point he got in touch with his bank (whose debit card tops up his PayPal 
account). However this complaint is about PayPal. Theres no evidence hed contacted 
PayPal before February 2021. 
I can see no reason why the law shouldnt apply in this case. I do have the power to say 
certain circumstances may mean that its fair and reasonable for a payment service provider 
to consider a complaint even though its long after the original debit. But theres nothing in 
this case which suggests this would be a fair and reasonable way forward.
Mr C has continuously stated the transaction was never authorised despite this transaction 
matching his PayPal account usage at the time. However even if it was a case of goods 
being undelivered rather than the transaction being unauthorised, Mr C was well out of 
PayPals timescale for arranging a chargeback when he got in touch with them in February 
2021.
Based on the evidence, I wont be asking PayPal to do anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is not to uphold Mr Cs complaint against 
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie, SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 September 2022.
