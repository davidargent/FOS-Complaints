The complaint
Mr S complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
FirstRand Bank Limited, trading as MotoNovo Finance, was misrepresented to her. Shes 
being helped with her complaint by her partner.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Ms S under a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo Finance 
that she signed in September 2018. She complained to MotoNovo Finance in November 
2018 about the cars paintwork but it didnt uphold her complaint and she then didnt 
complain to this service within the required time limits. She complained to MotoNovo 
Finance again in July 2020 and said that the car had been misrepresented to her because it 
had been damaged in a crash before it was supplied to her so she wanted to reject it.
At MotoNovo Finances request, she arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent 
expert in September 2020. The experts report concluded that the car had been damaged 
before it was supplied to Ms S so MotoNovo Finance offered to cover the costs of all 
necessary repairs. Ms S didnt accept its offer because she wanted to reject the car - she 
returned the car to the dealer in October 2020 and left it there. She then complained to this 
service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She was satisfied 
that MotoNovo Finance wasnt reasonably aware of the damage to the car and that it wasnt 
misrepresented to her. She thought that it had attempted to put things right and had offered 
an outcome in line with what she wouldve recommended.
Ms S has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has responded 
in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
she rejected the car within 28 days of it being supplied to her;
the dealer made a fraudulent misrepresentation about the car to her on the phone 
and when she went to the dealer;
the car was of unsatisfactory quality because of the accident damage, wasnt in a 
roadworthy condition and the MOT test didnt reveal the damage;
she wouldnt have entered into the contract if the truth was revealed; and
shes not in possession of the car and theres no alternative but to rescind the 
contract.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the car was supplied to Ms S by MotoNovo Finance in September 2018  it was a 
used car that was about four years old, had been driven for 72,095 miles and had a 
price of Â£10,298;
Ms S says that she asked the dealer if the car had ever been in an accident and it 
said that it hadnt and that the car was in pristine condition and like new;
MotoNovo Finance says that Ms S noticed that that the driver doors was out of 
alignment when she inspected the car and the dealer corrected the doors alignment 
before the car was supplied to her  it also says that no issue about the paintwork 
was raised at that time;
Ms S says that she noticed issues with the cars paintwork a few weeks later and 
contacted the dealer, but it didnt return her call;
she took the car to another garage in October 2018 and it said that there was 
nearside damage to the car, the nearside front door wasnt properly aligned and 
there were issues with the paintwork;
Ms S complained to MotoNovo Finance in November 2018 about the issues with the 
car but it said that shed inspected the car and had accepted its condition at that time; 
she complained to it again in July 2020 and said that the car had been 
misrepresented to her, and at MotoNovo Finances request, she arranged for the car 
to be inspected by an independent expert in September 2020;
the experts report concluded that, before the car was supplied to Ms S, it had: 
 undergone previous repairs, which have not been [undertaken] to manufacturers 
standards and/or an acceptable industry standard  however the vehicle has been 
repaired to a roadworthy condition, and therefore complies with minimum MOT 
standards and all the criteria laid out in section 75 of the Road Traffic Act allowing the 
vehicle to be used on the public highway;
MotoNovo Finance offered to cover the costs of all necessary repairs but Ms S didnt 
accept its offer because she wanted to reject the car and she returned the car to the 
dealer in October 2020 and left it there;
MotoNovo Finance has made an HPI check which shows theres been no write-off or 
insurance damage claim recorded against the car and the car passed MOT tests in 
July 2018, before it was supplied to Ms S, and July 2019 when its mileage was 
recorded as 86,658;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the car had suffered some damage before 
it was supplied to Ms S, the damage had been repaired (but some of the repairs 
werent of an acceptable standard) and that the car was in a roadworthy condition 
when it was supplied to her;
Ms S clearly feels very strongly that the car was misrepresented to her and she says 
that she asked to reject it within 30 days of the car being supplied to her because of 
the issues with it;
she says that the nearside rear door was sitting an inch out from its closed position 
when she inspected the car and the dealer said that it could be fixed by its body 
panel team while she waited and it wasnt a problem;as Ms S had noticed an issue with the door alignment, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect her to have checked the car for any other damage and to have 
raised any issues with the dealer at that time  but she accepted the car in the 
condition that it was in after the door had been re-aligned;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the dealer told Ms S 
that the car hadnt been damaged in a crash and I dont consider it to be likely that 
the dealer would have described a car that was four years old, had been driven for 
72,095 miles and on which Ms S had identified an issue with the alignment of a door 
as being in pristine condition and like new  and Im not persuaded that the car was 
misrepresented to Ms S;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Ms S asked to reject 
the car within 30 days of it being supplied to her  she didnt complain to MotoNovo 
Finance about any issues with the car until November 2018 and theres no reference 
in that complaint, or the complaint that she then made to this service, about a request 
to reject the car being made within 30 days;
MotoNovo Finance has offered to cover the costs of all necessary repairs to the 
paintwork and door alignment issues which I consider to have been a fair and 
reasonable response to her complaint  but she didnt accept its offer and she 
returned the car to the dealer in October 2020 and left it there;
Ms S was able to use the car to drive more than 14,500 miles between September 
2018 and July 2019 and I consider it to be likely that she continued to use it until 
October 2020; and
I sympathise with Ms S for the issues with the car but Im not persuaded that it would 
be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require MotoNovo Finance to 
allow her to reject the car or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
I suggest that Ms S collects the car and contacts MotoNovo Finance about the amount that 
she owes to it  if shes unable to pay that amount to it she should try to agree an affordable 
repayment with it for the amount that she owes to it. If she doesnt do so, I consider it to be 
likely that it will take further action against her, to the extent that its legally entitled to, to 
enforce the terms of the hire purchase agreement. If shes experiencing financial difficulties, 
she should explain those difficulties to MotoNovo Finance. Its required to respond to any 
such difficulties positively and sympathetically. If Ms S now wants to accept its offer to pay 
for the repairs to the car she should also contact it about those repairs.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ss complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2021.
