K822xcomplaint
Mr H has complained about short-term loans granted to him by Active  Securities Limited 
trading as 247MoneyBox.  Mr H says he couldnt afford these loans and that 247MoneyBox 
didnt take appropriate steps to check whether he could  afford  them when he took them  out. 
background 
247MoneyBox agreed nine short-term  loans for Mr H between  December 2017 and 
June 2018. The loans ranged from £80 to £391  and it seems  that each was due to be repaid 
around a month after being taken out. Ive set out a summary of lending  below.  
loan no. application principal  amount (£) amount repaid (£)
1 04/12/2017 80 89.60
2 27/12/2017 155 164.92
3 07/01/2018 230 248.40
4 22/01/2018 300 319.20
5 09/03/2018 175 186.20
6 21/03/2018 300 307.20
7 26/03/2018 200 209.60
8 04/06/2018 150 172.80
9 25/06/2018 391 not repaid
One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Hs complaint already and recommended  the 
complaint be upheld in part. The adjudicator thought the checks  247MoneyBox carried out 
across the first three loan applications  were  proportionate. But he thought  the checks carried 
out from loan 4 onwards werent. And that had 247MoneyBox carried out proportionate 
checks, it wouldve  realised that loans 4  9 wouldve  been  unaffordable for him, and 
therefore would not have  agreed to them. 
So he recommended  that 247Moneybox  refund the interest and charges Mr H paid towards  
loans 4  8. But that any refund due, could be used to reduce the capital balance  
outstanding on loan 9, as Mr H had made no payments towards this loan.
247MoneyBox accepted  the adjudicators findings.  Furthermore, it has also now agreed to 
write off the outstanding debt that will remain on loan 9 after its reduced the capital balance 
from the refund due on loans 4 - 8. Which means  Mr H will no longer owe anything  to 
247MoneyBox in respect of the above  loans. 
Mr H however, disagreed  with the adjudicators findings, so the case  has been  passed to me 
decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, good  
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
The Financial Conduct Authority was the regulator at the time Mr H took out the above loans. 
Its regulations for lenders  are set out in its consumer credit sourcebook  (generally  referred  to 
Ref: DRN68001622as CONC). These regulations require lenders to take reasonable steps to assess  the 
customers ability to meet repayments under  a regulated credit  agreement in a sustainable 
manner without the customer incurring financial difficulties or experiencing significant 
adverse consequences.  -  CONC 5.3.1(2). 
CONC 5.3.1(7) defines sustainable as being  able to make repayments without undue  
difficulty. And explains that this means  borrowers should be able to make their repayments 
on time and out of their income  and savings without having to borrow  to meet  these 
repayments. 
In making this decision Ive considered whether or not 247MoneyBox  did everything it 
shouldve when assessing Mr Hs loan applications. And if it didnt,  had it done  further  
checks, whether  it wouldve realised  these loans may have been unaffordable for him.
Having reviewed the case, I agree  with the adjudicators findings. I think  that the checks 
247Moneybox carried  out from loan 4 onwards were not proportionate. And I think  that had it 
carried out proportionate checks, it wouldve concluded these loans wouldve been 
unaffordable for Mr H, and therefore  would  not have agreed to them.
So Im upholding  Mr Hs complaint for the same reasons  as our adjudicator did and directing 
247MoneyBox to put things right in the way he recommended. I appreciate this is less than 
Mr H was hoping for as a resolution to his complaint, but I hope my explanation will make it 
clear as to how and why Ive reached  this conclusion. 
247Moneybox said it carried out proportionate checks  before agreeing  Mr Hs loan 
applications. It said these  checks  included taking an income and expenditure declaration 
from him at the point  of each application to calculate his free cash  flow (disposable  income).
And that it then built in a 55% buffer,  so that it only lent up to 45% of this figure,  to allow  for a 
margin of error. 247Moneybox also said that Mr H confirmed at every point he drew down 
funds, that he had no other high cost short-term credit,  and that all of the information  he 
provided was accurate.
In addition to the above,  247MoneyBox says it made  enquiries  into things like but not limited 
to; whether Mr H had entered an IVA; been  declared bankrupt; and what  his current level of 
indebtedness was. And that it confirmed Mr Hs employment, and ensured his credit  score 
met its minimum  threshold for approval. So Ive considered this when deciding this case. 
loans 1 - 3 
Mr H took out his first three loans with 247MoneyBox between  4 December 2017 and 
7 January 2018. The loan amounts  ranged  from £80 to £230, and were generally repayable 
within around a month  from being taken out. It seems that the time of these three applications,  
247MoneyBox recorded details of Mr Hs monthly income along with details of his monthly 
expenditure, which it broke down into sections covering his - rent/mortgage payments, food, 
transport costs, monthly credit commitments, and a section labelled other. 
Mr H seems to have  provided figures to 247MoneyBox which  suggest his net monthly  
income at the time of these applications was around  £1,800.  And that his outgoings in the 
above categories totalled in the region of £1,000 a month. 
As these  were the first three loans Mr H had taken from 247MoneyBox, and given that they 
were for relatively modest amounts in relation to his £1,800 declared monthly income,  I think  
Ref: DRN68001623247MoneyBoxs checks went far enough. And  given the above  checks wouldve suggested  to 
247MoneyBox that Mr H had a monthly disposable  income in excess  of £700 at the time of 
each application,  I think it was reasonable for it to have concluded these loans wouldve 
been affordable  for him based on the results of those checks. 
So I dont  think 247MoneyBox was wrong in approving Mr Hs first three  loan applications.
loan 4
Mr H took out his fourth loan towards the end of January 2018, and he was now borrowing 
£300. Given the increase in the amount  borrowed, and the fact that this was now his fourth 
application in less than two months,  I think 247MoneyBoxs checks  shouldve gone further. 
But 247Moneybox has since  accepted  the adjudicators findings that the checks from loan 4 
onwards werent  proportionate. And has agreed  to refund all of the interest and charges 
Mr H paid on these loans,  which is in line with what I would award, had I gone onto to have 
found these loans to have  been  unaffordable for him. So I havent looked any further into the 
affordability of these loans  for Mr H. 
Mr H has argued  that any monies  due back to him should include not just the interest and 
charges that hes paid,  but also the capital that he borrowed. However,  our approach  to 
these types of cases, is to try as so far is reasonably practical, to put the customer back  in 
the position they wouldve  been, had the loans in question not been approved.
So this means  that while  Mr H would not have had the interest  and charges applied  to his 
loan which  Im now recommending  247MoneyBox  refund, he also would not have been in 
receipt of the £391 of capital 247MoneyBox  lent him on loan 9, which  in effect, he now 
needs to return.  So 247MoneyBox is entitled  to offset any principal balance that remains 
outstanding against this refund. And Ive set out how 247MoneyBox should best put this right 
for Mr H, taking  these factors into account. 
Mr H has also requested  additional compensation as a result of delays he feels  he 
experienced from 247MoneyBox in its handling  of his case. But having  reviewed  the file, I 
havent seen any delays significant enough  that Id consider would warrant  compensation. 
And furthermore, 247MoneyBox  has now agreed to write off the outstanding balance on 
loan 9 in lieu of compensation, and this is already over and above what I wouldve awarded 
for Mr H. So I make  no further award  in respect  of the delays hes mentioned. 
Ref: DRN68001624what 247MoneyBox should do to put things right
For the reasons  outlined  above, I think 247MoneyBox should not have approved  loans 4  9 
for Mr H. 
So it needs  to refund all of the interest and charges he paid on these loans.
Specifically, it should:
refund the interest and charges paid for the loans it agreed  between 22 January 2018 
and 4 June  2018  (loans 4  8)
pay interest on these  refunds at 8% simple from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement
remove any adverse  information about these  loans  from Mr Hs credit  file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 247MoneyBox to take off tax from this interest. 
247MoneyBox must  give Mr H a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
247MoneyBox has told us that Mr H still owes some of the principal balance he borrowed on 
loan 9, so it may deduct this from the compensation thats due to him. To be clear, that 
outstanding balance should be recalculated to remove any interest and charges, but should 
take account of any repayments Mr H has made on this loan, as though they were  applied 
against the principal sum borrowed.
If 247MoneyBox no longer  owns  this debt, it needs to buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt 
entitled to make any deductions  for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr H. 
247MoneyBox has also told us that after the total compensation has been  applied against 
the principal balance outstanding on loan 9, there will still be a sum outstanding. But that as 
Mr H is in financial difficulty, it will write  off this outstanding balance as a gesture of good will. 
So it should  still do this. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Mr Hs complaint in part.
And I require  Active  Securities Limited trading  as 247MoneyBox to put things right as 
described above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 February  2019.
