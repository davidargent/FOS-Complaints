K820x#14Complaint
Mrs T says she was mis-sold a payment  protection  insurance (PPI) policy.
Although another business  sold the PPI to Mrs T, Allianz Insurance Plcs accepted 
responsibility for the sale. So Ill refer only to Allianz in this decision.
Background
Mrs T applied for a personal  reserve account  in 1996. The PPI was sold to her at the same 
time. 
The policy cost 64p per Â£100 of the accounts  monthly outstanding balance.  It would  have 
paid 15% of the monthly outstanding balance if Mrs T was off work sick or became  
unemployed. And it would  have continued to pay while she was off work until the outstanding 
balance (at the start of the claim) had been paid off. Life cover was also included.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend the complaint be upheld.  Mrs T didnt agree, so the case  
was passed to me to review afresh.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  the sale of PPI on our website. And Ive taken this into account in deciding  
Mrs Ts case.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. Ill explain why.
Allianz ought to have  informed Mrs T that the PPI was optional and get her agreement  
before adding it. Ive seen  a copy of the account application form Mrs T signed, which 
included a separate section for PPI. In that section, Mrs T marked a box  which  she could 
have left unticked  to take PPI and wrote her name and date of birth as the person to be 
insured. 
Overall, I think Mrs T was made  aware the PPI was optional and that she agreed to take it.
I dont think Allianz advised  Mrs T to take the PPI in the sense that I dont think  it gave her a 
personal recommendation based  on her circumstances at the time of the sale. So I dont 
think it needed to take steps to ensure the PPI was right for Mrs T. 
But Allianz still had to give Mrs T clear, fair and not misleading information so she could 
make up her own mind about  whether the PPI was right for her. I cant say for sure if that 
happened, but I dont  think  having better information would have put Mrs T off taking out the 
PPI in any case. I say that because:
It seems  Mrs T was eligible for the cover under the policy terms. And she wasnt  
affected by any of the main things the policy excluded or limited  cover for.
The PPI provided  a relatively high level of benefit per month  for a prolonged period of 
time, and at a relatively low cost. Potentially, it would have continued to pay out until 
the outstanding balance  of her account  was paid off. So I think she still would have

entitled to.
Ive seen nothing  to suggest  Mrs T would have found the premium  unaffordable. And, 
as it was payable  on a monthly  basis,  Mrs T could have  cancelled  the PPI at any time 
at no extra cost if she decided she no longer  wanted it.
Taking everything into account,  I dont think Mrs Ts lost out because of how Allianz sold her 
the PPI.
My final decision
For the reasons  given,  Ive decided not to uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 December 2019.
