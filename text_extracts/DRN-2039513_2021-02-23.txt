The complaint
Mrs N is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wouldnt reimburse a purchase that 
she made under their Buyer Protection Scheme, having previously told her that they would 
do so.  
What happened
Mrs N ordered an item online and paid using her PayPal account. When the item arrived, it 
was damaged. Mrs N attempted to contact the seller for a refund, but without success. So, 
Mrs N asked PayPal if the she could be reimbursed the cost of the item via their Buyer 
Protection Scheme.
PayPal agreed that Mrs N qualified for buyer protection but explained that in order to receive 
a reimbursement Mrs N would have to return the damaged item to the seller at her own 
expense.
Mrs N arranged for the item to be delivered back to the seller, but initially the seller refused 
to accept the delivery and so the item couldnt be returned. After a number of attempts to 
return the item across several days, the return was eventually completed successfully.
However, some time later PayPal told Mrs N that she no longer qualified for buyer protection 
because she had not been able to provide proof of the items delivery in the timescale that 
PayPal required. Mrs N wasnt happy about this, so she made a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mrs Ns complaint, but they confirmed that they had given Mrs N a 
deadline to provide confirmation of the items return, and that because Mrs N hadnt met that 
deadline, she didnt qualify for a refund under the Buyer Protection Scheme. So, they didnt 
uphold Mrs Ns complaint.
Mrs N wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that Mrs N had followed the steps 
that PayPal had asked of her in returning the item. 
So, our investigator upheld the complaint in Mrs Ns favour and said that PayPal should 
reimburse Mrs N the purchase price of the item as PayPal had previously said they would. 
Our investigator also thought that PayPal should pay Mrs N an additional £100 for the 
distress and inconvenience she had suffered.
PayPal didnt agree with the view put forward by our investigator, so the complaint was 
escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I find that I have reached the same outcome as our investigator here, and 
for essentially the same reasons.
PayPal dont dispute that Mrs N returned the item as they requested her to. However, 
because Mrs N didnt provide information confirming the return to PayPal within a timeframe 
set by PayPal, they consider that Mrs N no longer qualifies for a reimbursement of the 
cabinets cost.
One reason that PayPal ask a customer to return an item to a seller before they are willing to 
make a reimbursement under their Buyer Protection Scheme is because it would be unfair to 
reimburse a customer while they still have possession of the item. It is unfair that a customer 
should have both the item purchased and the money that they paid for that item.
In this situation we have precisely the opposite. Mrs N no longer has the item  because she 
returned it to the seller as per PayPals instruction  and she also doesnt have the money 
that she paid for the item. This seems unfair to me.
PayPal asked Mrs N for proof that the item has been returned. This was initially problematic 
because while Mrs N had arranged for the items return, the seller at first refused to accept 
the item from the courier. So, Mrs N provided PayPal with tracking information which PayPal 
used to confirm that the item was in transit.
After several attempts the item was delivered to the seller and the return was completed. 
This information was available to PayPal via the tracking information previously supplied to 
them by Mrs N.
However, some time later, PayPal sent a message to Mrs N advising that they still hadnt 
been provided with proof of return, and that if Mrs N didnt provide this information within a 
specific timeframe then she would no longer qualify for a reimbursement under the Buyer 
Protection Scheme. And, when Mrs N didnt respond to that message, PayPal stopped the 
reimbursement to Mrs N on that basis.
PayPal have provided this service with a copy of the terms and conditions of the Buyer 
Protection Scheme, and these confirm that PayPal can require a customer to provide 
information within a timeframe to be set by PayPal in order to continue to qualify for 
protection under that scheme. However, there can be instances where rigidly following terms 
and conditions can lead to an unfair outcome. 
I think thats the case here. Especially considering that PayPal were requesting information 
from Mrs N that should have been available to them already using the tracking information 
previously supplied to them.
So, by deciding to withdraw their offer to reimburse Mrs N under their Buyer Protection 
Scheme, its difficult to conclude that PayPal have treated Mrs N fairly or reasonably here. 
And it follows that Ill be upholding this complaint in Mrs Ns favour. 
In addition, I also agree with our investigator that Mrs N should be compensated by PayPal 
for the distress and inconvenience this matter has caused her, so Ill instructing PayPal to 
make a further payment to Mrs N of £100 in line with the recommendation put forward by our 
investigator. 
Putting things right
To put things right, PayPal should reimburse Mrs N the cost of the item as they originally 
agreed. 
PayPal should also make an additional payment of £100 to Mrs N to compensate her for 
inconvenience she has incurred.  My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA on 
the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs N to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 March 2021.
