The complaint
Miss G complains that she has not been given enough redress by Bank of Scotland plc 
trading as Halifax (Halifax) after it upheld her complaint about a packaged bank account she 
took out in August 2009.
What happened
Miss G received redress from Halifax after it agreed that an account was mis-sold to her in 
2009. Miss G says the redress was not enough because Halifax deducted the savings she 
made through having the account. And she says that Halifax took over two years to deal with 
her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our adjudicator.
Ive looked carefully at the calculation of the redress Miss G was given, as described in the 
final response letter that Halifax sent to her.
Halifax has returned all the monthly account fees and any charges caused by the fees, 
adding 8% simple interest from the time she paid them. 
It has then deducted the savings she made on her overdraft as a result of having the 
packaged bank account as opposed to a fee free account.
Halifax has then deducted tax from the interest she has been paid as is required under tax 
rules.
Finally, Halifax has given Â£50 to Miss G for distress and inconvenience for the delays in 
handling her complaint.
In my view this is in line with the approach this service would have taken if it had awarded 
redress in this case. 
While I know Miss G will be disappointed, I have to be fair to both parties, and I cant uphold 
her complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Miss Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 November 2021.
