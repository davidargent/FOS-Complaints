The complaint
Mrs C complains that a hire purchase agreement with BMW Financial Services (GB) Limited, 
trading as Mini Financial Services, was mis-sold to her because she was told that she could 
take the car with her if she moved to a British Crown dependency outside of the UK.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mrs C signed the hire purchase agreement in October 2017 which said that she 
should ensure that she'd read the terms and conditions and, below her signature, it 
said: "This is a Hire-Purchase Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. Sign it only if you want to be legally bound by its terms";
the terms and conditions say: "... you must ... not allow the Vehicle to be taken 
outside the UK, except that you may take it to any country within the European Union 
for [specified] periods ...";
Mrs C says that she discussed with the dealer that she was planning on moving to a 
British Crown dependency outside of the UK and she was assured that she'd be able 
to take the car with her and the dealer confirmed that she'd be able to get it serviced 
there;
she moved there in December 2018 and says that, when she contacted Mini 
Financial Services in May 2019 to update her address, she was told that she was in 
breach of the agreement and that it would be defaulted;
she borrowed money from her mother to buy the car and end the agreement, but she 
says that the agreement was mis-sold to her and that Mini Financial Services should: 
apologise to her; acknowledge that she's bought the car; amend its future 
agreements; ensure that sales representatives are fully trained; and pay her 
compensation;
Mini Financial Services says that the sales representative has no recollection of 
telling Mrs C that she could take the car with her when she moved and that there's no 
written evidence to support what she says she'd been told; 
she's referred to the special relationship between the dependency and the UK - but if  
she was aware that there might be issues with taking the car with her I consider it to 
be reasonable to expect her to have known that the dependency wasn't part of the 
UK and to have obtained written confirmation that she could take the car with her;
she signed the hire purchase agreement and agreed that she wouldn't take the car 
outside the UK (other than in the circumstances described) and there's no 
documentary evidence from that time to show that she was told that she would 
be able to take the car with her;I consider it to be clear from the terms and conditions that Mrs C wouldn't be able to 
take the car outside the UK (other than in the circumstances described) and that it's 
reasonable to expect that she would have read the agreement (including the terms 
and conditions) before she signed it;
I sympathise with Mrs C for the difficulties that she's experienced and I can 
understand the frustration that she feels - but I'm not persuaded that there's enough 
evidence to show that Mini Financial Services has acted incorrectly in these 
circumstances;
Mrs C bought the car and ended the agreement but says that she hasn't received 
any documentation to show that the agreement has been settled in full - Mini 
Financial Services has confirmed that the agreement has been settled in full and, if 
Mrs C requires any documentation from it, I suggest that she contacts it; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Mini Financial Services to pay any compensation to Mrs C or to take any other action 
in response to her complaint.
 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Cs complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 June 2020.
