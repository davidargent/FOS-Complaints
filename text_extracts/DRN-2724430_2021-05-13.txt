The complaint
Mr M complains that Capital One (Europe) plc wont refund to him the money that he paid for 
some granite kitchen worktops. 
What happened
Mr M used his Capital One credit card in August 2019 to make payments of £232.82 and 
£931.28 for some granite worktops. Hed agreed to make a further payment for the worktops 
on completion of his order with the supplier. There was then a dispute about some additional 
charges and Mr M cancelled his order in September 2019 but the supplier offered to refund 
£55.30 and said that the worktops were available for collection. It then said that it would 
carry out the works to Mr Ms specification free of charge if he made the further payment in 
advance. 
Mr M claimed a refund of the payments that hed made to the supplier from Capital One 
under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that it didnt feel that a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation had been proven so it couldnt accept his claim. Mr M wasnt 
satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She wasnt 
persuaded that the supplier had breached the contract and she thought that it had offered a 
suitable remedy. She didnt think that Capital One had treated Mr M unfairly in the handling 
of his claim.
Mr M has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that the 
supplier violated the contract as it promised the round edge and agreed to make the upstand 
in three pieces but later changed it to five pieces. He says that he cancelled the contract 
verbally and then in writing.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ms complaint about Capital One, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that 
Capital Ones response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but 
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ms claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
the supplier provided estimates to Mr M in June 2019  all of which described the 
work that was to be done and referred to Polished edges  standard profile; 
Mr M accepted one of those estimates, with a total cost of £2,328.21, in August 2019 
 the estimate said: Terms of Payment: 10% deposit, 40% before fabrication and 
remaining 50% on completion and he paid a 10% deposit of £232.80;
there were further discussions about the specification in August 2019 and later that 
month Mr M made the 40% payment of £931.28 that was required before fabrication;
the fabrication template sheet shows that the worktops were to have Polished edges 
 standard profile, which was consistent with the estimate and the granite was 
fabricated on that basis;
Mr M says that changes had been agreed in the discussions, including that the 
worktops were to have a rounded pencil edge, but the supplier says that that hadnt 
been agreed and that a rounded pencil edge would cost an extra £208.40;
Mr M wasnt happy with the specification to which the granite had been fabricated, 
including the edging, the under sill and the number of pieces of granite used for the 
upstands, and (after further discussions with the supplier) he cancelled his order in 
September 2019;
the supplier said that its costs at that time were £1,108.80 and Mr M had paid 
£1,164.10 so the refund due to him was £55.30 and that the worktops were available 
for collection  but it then said that it would carry out the works to Mr Ms specification 
free of charge if he made the final payment in advance; 
Mr M didnt agree and claimed a refund of the £1,164.10 that hed paid to the supplier 
from Capital One - and he then complained to this service; 
Mr M clearly feels very strongly that the supplier has breached its contract with him 
and that Capital One should refund to him the money that he paid for the worktops  
but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
breach of contract by the supplier in these circumstances;
Mr M accepted an estimate, paid a deposit, then made a further payment for the 
fabrication to go ahead and Im not persuaded that hes provided enough evidence to 
show that the supplier had agreed to make the changes that hes claimed;
I consider that the suppliers response to his cancellation of his order was consistent 
with what had been agreed and was fair and reasonable in the circumstances  and I 
also consider that Capital One responded to his claim fairly and reasonably; and
although I sympathise with Mr M for the issues that hes had with the supplier about 
the worktops, I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Capital One 
to refund to Mr M the payments that he made to the supplier, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 June 2021.
