K821x#15Complaint
Mr H says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) failed to identify that he 
had become dependent on its loans. He also said he was stuck  in a cycle  of borrowing
Background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  6 May 2020. 
An extract  from this is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I will not repeat that 
information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to partly uphold the complaint. I invited 
both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. Mr H has told us he accepts 
the provisional decision and he doesnt  have anything further to add. Sunny didnt respond 
to the provisional  decision. 
My findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mr H accepted the provisional decision and Sunny  didnt respond  with any further 
comments or evidence it wanted  me to consider, I see no reason to depart  from the findings  
that I outlined  in my provisional decision. 
So, in summary,  I still think Sunny was wrong to have provided loans 7  31. Ive explained 
below what Sunny needs to do to put things right. 
Putting things  right  what  I think Sunny needs  to do
So, in addition to what Sunny has already agreed to settle loans 20-31, it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 7- 31;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  from Mr Hs credit file about loans 7 and 8
remove loans 9-31 from Mr Hs credit file entirely. This is because  the period  of time
Mr H owed Sunny money means that any information  still recorded about these loans
is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN35053932My final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I partly uphold Mr Hs 
complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr H as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 July 2020.

Complaint
Mr H says Elevate Credit  International  Limited  (trading as Sunny)  failed to identify that he had 
become dependent on its loans. He also said he was stuck in a cycle of borrowing.
Background
Mr H took out a running credit facility and 30 instalment loans between  October  2014 and
June 2018. A summary  of Mr Hs borrowing,  based  on the information  provided to us by
Sunny, can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision.
In our adjudicators  most  recent findings, she didnt  think Sunny  was wrong to provide Mr Hs running  
credit facility and his first three instalment loans. She thought Sunny had completed proportionate 
checks for these loans  and there were no concerns about  the way Mr H ran the facility.   But by loan 5, 
she thought Mr Hs pattern  of lending suggested he had become persistently reliant  on Sunnys loans 
and that he couldnt  sustainably repay them. 
Mr H appears to have accepted our adjudicators most recent  findings.
Sunny didnt  agree, but its most recent offer was to uphold the complaint  about loans 20-31. The offer 
was to refund the interest on these loans  along with 8% simple interest and to amend Mr Hs credit 
file. Mr H has rejected  this offer.
As no agreement could  be reached  the complaint  has been  passed to me for a final decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach to complaints about  short-term 
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good
industry practice - on our website.
Having thought about the above, as well as the evidence available to me, Ive provisionally  decided to 
partly uphold  Mr Hs complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
meant that it should have carried out proportionate checks in order to reasonably  conclude whether 
Mr H could repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts, and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
In general, Id expect a lender to require  more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way. Certain factors might  point to the 
fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish  that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include, but are not limited to:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income);
Ref: DRN35053934the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during which 
a customer has been given  loans  (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that 
the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
To begin with, Sunny has already agreed with our adjudicator about  loans 20-31 and has made  an 
offer in-line  with our adjudicators recommendation. And Mr H has accepted our adjudicators opinion  
about the checks completed  at the start of his RCF (loan1) and loans 2, 3 and 4  that Sunny wasnt 
wrong to approve  them.
Because of this I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about the RCF (loan  1), loans 2-4 and 
loans 20-31.   So, I wont  be making a decision about this lending and will instead focus on loans  5-19. 
But Ive kept in mind the other loans as they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr H had with 
Sunny, I will take them into account when considering his overall lending history.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
By the time Mr H applied for his fifth loan (the first loan Im considering),  our adjudicator  thought  
Sunny shouldve  seen a pattern of lending  had developed which  made these loans unsustainable. But 
Im not satisfied that Sunny should have reasonably been aware of this by loan 5 or indeed 6.
I say this because although  he had taken  a number of loans there were some gaps between  when  the 
loans were taken out and repaid, and Mr H had been  borrowing for a relatively  short period of time.  
So I dont yet think it had yet reached the point where  Sunny ought  to have realised that these loans 
were unsustainable for Mr H. However, I do think a pattern of lending had developed  by loan 9 which 
made this loan and any subsequent loans unsustainable.
Firstly, I note for loans 7 and 8, Mr H informed Sunny that his monthly income  was £3,177.  Sunny 
also asked Mr H for his monthly expenditure and it completed  credit checks  with Credit  Reference 
Agencies (CRAs).  The information Sunny gathered from the CRAs  coupled  with what Mr H declared 
about his expenses suggested his monthly expenditure for loans 7 and 8 totalled £3,086 and £3,043 
respectively. So for these  loans, Sunny was aware that Mr H was already committed to spending 
almost his entire monthly income on living costs  and other credit commitments. And knowing this, I 
dont think it shouldve provide either of these loans  and Ive explained why below. 
The highest  monthly  repayments  for loans  7 and 8 were £48.69 and £64.29 which  wouldve  left Mr H 
with a disposable income of no more than £70. But by this point in the lending relationship, I think 
Sunny wouldve been aware that Mr H wasnt making  his repayments in-line  with the credit agreement 
 over six monthly instalments. He was repaying  his loans in full within  a few weeks of taking them 
out. This is not how Sunny intended these loans to be repaid. 
So Sunny ought to have  been aware that it was more likely than not that Mr H would repay loans 7 
and 8 within a matter  of weeks  rather than over a number of months.  In effect, by now, Mr H was 
using these loans as if they were payday loans and Sunny needed  to be alert to this. And knowing 
this Sunny wouldve  been  aware  that Mr H wasnt in a position to sustainably repay these  loans 
because he didnt have  enough disposable income to afford the principal sum, plus interest due within 
a matter of weeks. 
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr H, with a view to seeing  if 
there was a point at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further  loans. 
Ref: DRN35053935Given the particular circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 9. I say 
this because:
By loan 9, Sunny  ought  to have realised Mr H was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr H had taken out 9 loans in 10 months. Sunny ought  to have realised  it was 
more likely  than not that Mr H was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his 
previous was leaving  in his finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
Mr Hs first instalment loan was for £100 and loan 9 was for £200.  At this point Sunny ought 
to have known that Mr H was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary  shortfall in his income  
but to meet an ongoing  need.  
From loan 9 onwards  Mr H was provided  with a new loan within a few days  of a chunk of 
loans being repaid. For example loan 13 was taken out shortly  after loans 11 and 12 were 
repaid. 
I think  that Mr H lost out when Sunny provided loans 9 onwards because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  over an extended period of time and;
the time in debt and the sheer number of loans would  more likely than not have had negative 
implications on Mr Hs ability  to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
