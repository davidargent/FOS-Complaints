The complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc told him theyd closed his savings 
account in 2013, but that they didnt actually close it until 2020. He says he was caused 
distress when he received an email telling him a statement for the account was ready to 
view.
What happened
Mr P held several accounts with NatWest. In 2013 he had difficulty repaying the overdraft on 
one of the accounts. His accounts were transferred to debt recoveries in April 2014.
In September 2018 Mr Ps outstanding overdraft debt was sold to a third party. As there was 
no debt on the account at the centre of this complaint  the savings account  it stayed with 
NatWest.
NatWest deposited £20 into the savings account in 2019. This was compensation in relation 
to a separate complaint. But, realising the account was inactive, they issued Mr P with a 
cheque instead, and debited the £20 from the savings account  returning the balance to nil.
In March 2020 NatWest closed the savings account and an email was sent to Mr P which 
began, Your latest statement for account ending XXX is ready for you online now 
Mr P queried this, and NatWest responded on 2 April 2020 explaining the statement (and the 
subsequent email to Mr P) had been generated automatically on their closure of the account. 
They apologised for any inconvenience hed experienced. Unhappy with this, Mr P made a 
complaint.
NatWest issued a final response on 7 April 2020. They said although the account had been 
inactive since 2011 it had remained open, and they couldnt find any evidence Mr P had 
asked them to close it.
What Mr P told us
Mr P told us he was informed in 2013 that all his NatWest accounts would be closed, and 
hed no longer have access to view them online. Then, in 2019, hed been told by a NatWest 
complaint handler that hed never be able to use the savings account again.
He said that when he received a statement for the savings account, he had to go to the 
effort of emails and get nowhere with NatWest. He also said hed had an awful call with a 
member of NatWest staff when theyd told him they wouldnt compensate him.
What NatWest told us
NatWest explained that when a customer is with debt recoveries all their accounts, including 
any savings accounts, become non-operational. This means they cant use the account, and 
no statements are issued. Whilst a savings account with a nil balance would normally be 
closed at this point, they said it seems Mr Ps savings account remained open in 2014 
because of an oversight. They explained the savings account wasnt closed until it was 
reviewed as part of a project in March 2020.
However, they added that Mr P wouldve been aware the account was still open in 2019 
because he was told about the £20 that had been deposited in it in error at the time.
Our investigators view
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Ps complaint. She said theres no evidence Mr P was told 
his savings account would be closed in 2013, nor that he asked for it to be. She 
acknowledged that NatWest had taken a long time to close the account and that Mr P had 
found receiving the email about the statement upsetting. But overall, she didnt think 
NatWest had done anything that meant they should pay Mr P compensation.
Mr P didnt accept this outcome. He said there was no need for NatWest to send him the 
email about the savings account statement, and hed experienced stress and anguish and 
wasted time having to respond to it. He said NatWest were wrong to keep an inactive 
savings account open for so long and to not send him regular statements. He didnt think an 
apology was enough and said he wanted £50 compensation.
Our investigator still didnt think NatWest had done anything wrong. But she asked them if 
theyd be willing to make an offer of financial compensation to resolve the complaint anyway.
NatWest declined pointing out that although the savings account remained open thered 
been no detriment caused to Mr P. They also explained theyd sent him a gift hamper after 
hed raised concerns about the conversation hed had with a member of NatWest staff.
So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusion as the investigator did and for broadly the 
same reasons  I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Mr P has been open with us about his long-term health conditions and I understand that, in 
the context of these, he was unsettled and troubled by the email from NatWest in March 
2020 about the savings account. Afterall, hed not used it since 2011, thought it had been 
closed in 2013/4, and as recently as 2019 had been told he couldnt use this account.
But I dont think what NatWest did here means that they should pay Mr P compensation. 
I think their explanation of what happened is reasonable, and their apology for any 
inconvenience caused by the automatically generated email is fair in the circumstances.
Im sorry that Mr P is likely to be disappointed by my decision. I know that he feels deeply 
that NatWest got it badly wrong by keeping an inactive and non-operational account open for 
so long, and then caused him the inconvenience of having to respond to the automated 
email. But I cant agree that NatWest made any significant error by either keeping the 
account open or sending the email. And I note that NatWest responded to Mr Ps enquiry 
about the email within two days explaining it had simply been prompted by the accounts 
closure  in short, letting him know there was nothing he needed to do or be concerned 
about in relation to that account.I also dont think NatWest were obliged to send Mr P regular statements for this account in 
the circumstances. Of course, if statements had been sent, hed have known throughout that 
the account remained open, and the email advising of its closure might not have been so 
unexpected. But I still dont think Mr P has been caused any detriment by the account 
remaining open, and I find NatWests apology for the inconvenience caused is enough.
Overall, I dont think what happened justifies the financial recompense Mr P seeks.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 May 2021.
