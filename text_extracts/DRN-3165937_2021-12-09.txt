The complaint
Mr S says Short Term Finance Limited (STFL) lent to him irresponsibly. He says that he had 
significant other debt and this made the STFL loans unaffordable. He thinks STFL shouldve 
seen this and not lent to him. 
  
What happened
This complaint is about 23 loans STFL provided to Mr S between March 2015 and 
May 2020. Some of the information I have been provided about the lending is in the table

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He didnt think that STFL had irresponsibly 
lent loans 1 to 4. He said that STFL shouldve made better checks before approving loan 5 
but he didnt have enough to say this loan was lent irresponsibly. But he thought that the 
lending pattern itself was harmful by loan 6. And so, it shouldnt have approved loans 6 to 
23. 
STFL disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It said:
It believed there was nothing wrong with the way it dealt with Mr S when he had 
credit with them.  
It followed the relevant guidance at the time.
It said there was a seven-week gap between loan 11 and loans 12 and 13 which 
were taken on the same day. It thinks this shows Mr S wasnt dependent on the 
lending.
Mr S didnt disagree with what the adjudicator said. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
STFL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that STFL should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.Ive decided to uphold Mr S complaint in part and have explained why below.
Mr S didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 5. Because of this, I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I wont be making a decision 
about this lending. But it was part of the borrowing relationship Mr S had with STFL. So, it is 
something I will take into account when considering the other loans he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 6 to 23 because I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of STFLs lending 
history with Mr S, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which STFL should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so STFL should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr S case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point STFL ought to have realised Mr S was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken out six loans over 17 months. So STFL ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr S was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying his previous loans was leaving in his finances and that Mr S 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr S first loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £300, this is a significant increase 
over this time. At this point STFL ought to have known that Mr S was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Right from the start Mr S was provided with a new loan within a very short time of 
settling a previous one. Sometimes he had more than one loan running at the same 
time. I dont think the shorter gaps that STFL refer to after loan 11 really make a 
difference to this. Mr S had been borrowing for a significant amount of time already 
by this point. 
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed STFL. Loan 23 was 
taken out over five years after Mr S first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr S had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to STFL over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr S lost out because STFL continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr S indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for shorter term use over an extended period of 
time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr S ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 to 23 and STFL should put things right.
  
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STFL should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Mr S from loan 6 as Im satisfied it ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. For example, having been declined this lending Mr S may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between him and this particular lender which he may not have had with others. If this wasnt 
a viable option, he may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming 
that was even possible.
Or, he may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if he had done that, 
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how he would (or ought 
to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is impossible to 
now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can 
fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would have been 
able to lend to Mr S in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mr S would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFLs liability in this case for what Im satisfied 
it has done wrong and should put right.
STFL shouldnt have given Mr S loans 6 to 23.
If STFL has sold any outstanding debts STFL should buy these back if it is able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If STFL is not able to buy the debts back then STFL should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) STFL should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr S towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything 
it has already refunded.
B) STFL should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr S 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr S originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) STFL should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr S as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr S having made 
overpayments then STFL should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. STFL should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B 
and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr S. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then STFL should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr S. STFL shouldnt 
pursue outstanding balances made up of principal STFL has already written-off.
E) The overall pattern of Mr S borrowing for loans 6 to 23 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Mr S credit file. STFL 
does not have to remove loans 22 and 23 from Mr S credit file until these have been repaid, 
but STFL should still remove any adverse information recorded about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STFL to deduct tax from this interest. STFL should give 
Mr S a certificate showing how much tax STFL has deducted, if he asks for one.
  My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mr S complaint.
Short Term Finance Limited (STFL) should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 January 2022.
