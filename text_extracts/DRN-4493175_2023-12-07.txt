The complaint
Mr P is unhappy that following a chargeback filed against him his account with PayPal 
(Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) has been left with a negative balance. 
What happened
Mr P says that he sold a watch via an online forum to a buyer in the US. The buyer and Mr P 
exchanged messages and the buyer then paid £5,995.88 via PayPal for the watch on 27 
November 2021. Once he received the funds Mr P shipped the watch. In December 2021 
the owner of the card used to make the transaction raised a chargeback with their card 
issuer saying the transaction wasnt authorised. 
PayPal contacted Mr P to gather information to dispute the chargeback, but ultimately the 
card issuer decided in the card owners favour and the payment was reversed, and a 
processing fee of £14 was also applied to Mr Ps account. As Mr P had removed the funds 
for the watch, this left his PayPal account with a negative balance. 
PayPal noted that the card issuer decides the outcome of a chargeback claim, but that if a 
seller is protected under its seller protection scheme it would not normally hold the seller 
responsible. But as the payment was sent as a personal payment, seller protection doesnt 
apply. PayPal also confirmed that it had initiated an internal review and limited the buyers 
account. 
Mr P was unhappy with PayPals response. He said he is being held responsible for a debt 
that was incurred as a result of a scam and that the same individual has raised other 
disputes, but PayPal hasnt taken action.  
 
Our investigation so far
When the complaint came to this service PayPal made a goodwill offer of a £500 credit to 
create a better customer experience. The offer was made without any admission of liability.
The investigator who considered this complaint didnt recommend that it be upheld. She said 
it was the cardholders bank that authorised the chargeback  not PayPal. When the dispute 
was raised PayPal asked Mr P to provide evidence to dispute it and then forwarded this 
evidence as it should have. Ultimately the decision didnt go in Mr Ps favour, but PayPal 
wasnt responsible for this decision. And PayPal acted reasonably and in accordance with its 
terms and conditions in not applying seller protection, as Mr P accepted the payment as a 
personal payment making it ineligible for this protection. Overall, the investigator felt that 
PayPals goodwill offer was more than reasonable. 
Mr P didnt agree with the investigators findings. In summary, he said:
- He is an innocent party who sent the item in good faith and in the belief the buyer 
was the genuine cardholder.
- Normally if a person receives a payment that has been made mistakenly and for 
example hands over goods in reliance on that payment common law gives a defence 
to a claim for restitution of the payment.
- Under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 in certain circumstances the paying 
bank is responsible for unauthorised transactions. So in a case like this it is 
reasonable to think the loss should be borne by the payee bank that made the 
mistake. 
- PayPal didnt act correctly in the way it defended the dispute. As the payment was 
made on a friends and family basis the buyer had essentially used PayPal as a 
money transfer service which would make PayPal the merchant in the transaction 
rather than him. Mr P says this means the chargeback claim against him shouldnt 
have been successful. 
- PayPal had a list of victims scammed by the same buyer so if it had provided this as 
part of its response to the dispute it would likely have been successfully defended. 
- PayPal hasnt handled complaints from others consistently and neither has this 
service. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My role is to consider the individual circumstances of Mr Ps case, so I wont comment in this 
decision on what PayPal or this service have done in any other case. I wont consider wider 
issues like the use of PayPal accounts by fraudsters or the actions of the payee bank. 
I appreciate that Mr P has lost funds in what he describes as a scam and am sorry to hear of 
his loss. But that doesnt mean PayPal are responsible and should reimburse him. My role is 
to consider whether PayPal acted fairly and reasonably and in accordance with its user 
agreement. 
Whilst I understand Mr Ps strength of feeling, I consider the offer made by PayPal exceeds 
any award I would make and will explain why.
The cardholder contacted their own bank to raise the chargeback claim. In situations like this 
the buyers bank contacts PayPals bank and asks whether it wishes to defend the 
chargeback. PayPals bank will ask PayPal as the payment processor to send it any 
evidence to use as a defence, and it will then send this onto the cardholders bank. PayPals 
role is to provide evidence from its customer (Mr P) so it can put forward a defence. Im 
satisfied PayPal did this and that PayPal provided the evidence supplied by Mr P.
PayPal didnt authorise the chargeback of funds, the buyers bank did. As the claim was 
upheld in the buyers favour by the bank, Im satisfied PayPal cant be held responsible. I 
also note that PayPals user agreement covers the situation Mr P finds himself in in the 
Reversals section:
If you receive a payment in your account and a reversal takes place, you owe us the full 
amount of the payment and our losses arising from processing the payment (including any 
Chargeback fee. 
The agreement goes on to say that a reversal can happen when there is a claim for 
unauthorised or incorrect payments made to a customers account and specifically mentions 
chargeback as an example.  Ive gone on to consider whether Mr P was covered by PayPals seller protection policy. Im 
satisfied that Mr P hasnt met the requirements set out in PayPals user agreement to be 
eligible for seller protection. The agreement says that the payment must be marked as 
eligible, and the goods must be shipped to the recipients address on the transaction details 
page in the senders account (amongst other things). This isnt what happened here. The 
payment was personal, and PayPals terms are clear that seller protection doesnt apply:
Ineligible items and transactions
Personal payments including a payment sent using PayPals friend and family 
functionality.
Im satisfied that Mr P was aware of the difference between goods and services and 
personal payments as a few months before the sale of the watch he received a goods and 
services payment. The payment was subject to a hold by PayPal and Mr P was asked to 
provide shipping details. Mr P refunded the buyer and later accepted a payment from the 
same person as a personal payment. 
The fees that apply to goods and services payments are in place so that protection can be 
provided but no such fees were paid, and Mr P didnt follow the correct process.
Overall, Im satisfied PayPal treated Mr P fairly in applying the terms of its user agreement 
and dont consider it is responsible for his loss.
If Mr P now wishes to accept PayPals offer, he should contact PayPal directly. As PayPal 
has already made the offer, I consider it ought to stand by that offer  which was made as a 
gesture of goodwill in any event.  
My final decision
For the reasons stated, I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2024.
