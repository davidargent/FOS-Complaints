The complaint
Mrs B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and closed her accounts 
without providing an explanation or warning. Mrs B says this caused her unnecessary 
inconvenience and worry for which she should be compensated.
What happened
Mrs B had three accounts with NatWest. 
On 6 May 2022, NatWest decided to review how Mrs B was operating her accounts. Whilst it 
conducted its review the bank blocked Mrs Bs access to her accounts, this meant Mrs B 
couldnt access the funds in her account and no payments could be credited to the account. 
Mrs B was also blocked from accessing her accounts online.
Mrs B discovered that her account was blocked on 9 May 2022 when she tried to access her 
accounts online and couldnt do so. Thinking that there was a technical problem, Mrs B 
deleted her mobile banking app and re-installed it on her device. However, this didnt fix the 
problem. So, she called the bank to try and find out what was happening with her accounts. 
But NatWest wouldnt give her much information. Mrs B continued to call NatWest over the 
next few days but each time she spoke to someone she was told that no information could 
be provided to her. Mrs B wasnt happy with this response and complained to the bank.
In response, on 16 May 2022, NatWest wrote to Mrs B and told her that her accounts were 
unavailable due to the bank complying with its legal and regulatory obligations. And that it 
had blocked her accounts in line with the terms and conditions. NatWest also said it wasnt 
obliged to provide Mrs B with an explanation for its actions. Following this, NatWest decided 
to close all of Mrs Bs accounts. The bank wrote to her on 19 May 2022 giving her two 
months notice that shed need to make alternative banking arrangements.
Mrs B complained to NatWest about the block and closure of her accounts. She said the 
bank hadnt given her any warning that she wouldnt be able to access her accounts and had 
treated her like a common criminal. She said the accounts were her main accounts and 
NatWests actions had caused her a great deal of stress and worry. She said that her health 
was also impacted, and her husband wasnt well at the time, so NatWest blocking and 
closing her accounts made an already difficult situation much worse.
In response, NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong when it blocked and closed Mrs Bs 
account. And it had done so in line with the account terms and its regulatory obligations.
Mrs B wasnt happy with this response, so she brought her complaint to our service where 
an investigator considered it. The investigator asked NatWest to provide more information 
about why it had blocked and closed Mrs Bs account. But NatWest said it couldnt provide 
anything more than it had already provided to us. And maintained that it hadnt treated Mrs B 
unfairly when it had blocked and closed her accounts.
The investigator said that NatWest hadnt done anything wrong when it reviewed Mrs Bs 
accounts but based on the limited information the bank had provided, she couldnt say the 
bank had treated her fairly when it had closed her accounts. So, she said NatWest should 
pay Mrs B £150 compensation for any trouble and upset the closure of her accounts had 
caused Mrs B. NatWest accepted what the investigator said. Mrs B didnt. She said that the 
amount of compensation doesnt adequately reflect the amount of trouble and upset she has 
suffered. She wants more compensation and wants to know why NatWest closed her 
accounts. 
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill deal first with NatWests decision to block and review Mrs Bs accounts. NatWest has 
important legal and regulatory obligations it must meet when providing accounts to 
customers. These obligations are ongoing, so do not only pertain to when an account is 
opened. To comply with its obligations NatWest may need to review an account and/or 
restrict its customers access. The terms and conditions of Mrs Bs accounts also permit 
NatWest to block and review an account. So, whilst I accept this caused Mrs B 
inconvenience and worry, I cant say NatWest treated her unfairly when it blocked her 
accounts. 
I understand Mrs B wants NatWest to explain the reason it applied the blocks to her 
accounts. But NatWest doesnt disclose to its customers what triggers a review of their 
accounts. Its under no obligation to tell Mrs B the reasons behind the account review and 
block, as much as shed like to know. So, I cant say its done anything wrong by not giving 
Mrs B this information. And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it do so. 
The timing of NatWests actions was unfortunate. Mrs B has said that at the time her 
husband was recovering from a serious health issue, and she was caring for him. Shes also 
said that she was dealing with her own medical condition. So, I can understand why she 
found this whole experience with NatWest frustrating  especially as her attempts to get 
information from NatWest about what was happening didnt give her any answers. But as 
Ive already explained financial businesses have a legal obligation to comply with various 
laws and regulations. And NatWest were following an internal process which they carried out 
in order to comply with their obligations. So, whilst I appreciate Mrs B was inconvenienced 
when her accounts were blocked, I cant say NatWest treated Mrs B unfairly. I note too that 
NatWest completed its review within in a timely manner
I then turn to the banks decision to close Mrs Bs accounts. NatWest needs to provide 
information to this service so we can fairly decide a complaint. Despite being asked by the 
investigator, NatWest has failed to provide information about why it no longer wanted Mrs B 
as a customer. Ive considered what NatWest has said about why it wont provide further 
information to our service about the reasons it closed Mrs Bs accounts. This service has the 
power to request evidence of this nature under the dispute resolution rules (DISP) and Im 
not persuaded the reasons given by NatWest exclude it from complying with these rules. So, 
in this particular case, because of the lack of information I cant be satisfied that NatWest 
has treated Mrs B fairly when it closed her accounts. Taking this into account, I agree 
NatWest should pay Mrs B compensation for the trouble and upset caused by closing her 
accounts.
NatWest agreed to pay £150 as recommended by the investigator. Having considered what 
Mrs B has told us about how the closure of her accounts impacted her Ive no doubt this was a worrying and upsetting time for her. She also had to go to the trouble of finding and 
opening new bank accounts. But having looked at all the evidence and circumstances of this 
complaint, I havent found grounds to increase the level of compensation. Im satisfied that 
£150 compensation is a fair amount of compensation and proportionate to the trouble and 
upset Mrs B was caused. So, while Mrs B may disagree with me, I wont be asking NatWest 
to do anything else to resolve this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained I uphold this complaint. To put things right National 
Westminster Bank Plc should: 
pay Mrs B £150 compensation for the trouble and upset caused by the bank closing 
her accounts
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 April 2023.
