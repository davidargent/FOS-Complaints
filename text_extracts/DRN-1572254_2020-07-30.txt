The complaint
Mr Cs complaint is that National Westminster Bank Plc lost a cheque for £2,450 that he paid 
into his account in branch. He needed these funds to make his loan repayments and as a 
result, hes incurred interest and charges.
Hes unhappy that NatWest did not provide him with an overdraft facility and that NatWest 
paid compensation of £150 into his account without telling him.
What happened
Mr C paid in a cheque at branch. As NatWest were unable to process the cheque 
electronically, the physical cheque was sent from the branch to its processing centre in order 
to manually claim for the funds. 
During this time Mr C was given conflicting information about the cheque. NatWest initially 
said there were problems with the bank that issued the cheque, but it later turned out 
NatWest had lost it.
Mr C says as he didnt have the funds in his account, he was unable to make loan 
repayments to other third parties and he incurred interest and charges as a result. He felt 
NatWest shouldve provided him with an overdraft whilst he was waiting for the funds from 
his cheque.
Our investigator noted Mr C deposited the cheque on 13 August and by 15 August NatWest 
wrote to Mr C explaining it couldnt obtain the funds from the bank that had issued the 
cheque. She said Mr Cs loan payments were due after hed been informed the funds didnt 
clear and he therefore had time to seek an alternative method of payment. So overall our 
investigator thought Mr C couldve mitigated his losses.
Our investigator explained she couldnt find any evidence that Mr C requested an overdraft 
facility, so she didnt think NatWest had done anything wrong in not providing one to Mr C. 
She also said it would be up to NatWest to decide who to lend to and on what terms.
She didnt think NatWest were liable to pay interest and charges Mr C had incurred. She felt 
that the compensation of £150 was fair and didnt ask NatWest to do anything further.
Mr C didnt agree. He remained unhappy with the length of time it took NatWest to tell him 
the cheque had been lost. Mr C said he didnt ask for compensation and had NatWest 
provided him with an overdraft, this couldve all been avoided. He was also unhappy that 
NatWest suggested he should ask the issuer of the cheque to make alternative payments.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
On 15 August NatWest informed Mr C there had been a delay in processing the cheque. 
They said theyd contacted the bank whod issued the cheque and would be in touch within 
15 days.
Four days later, NatWest told Mr C they couldnt process the cheque as there was no debit 
authority. And in NatWests letter of 23 August they explained this issue was not NatWests 
error.
NatWests notes show Mr C spoke to NatWest over the phone and I can see he told 
NatWest he needed the funds by the Friday (30 August). 
Mr C also visited the branch to try and resolve this issue. NatWest says during this branch 
visit Mr C was told the cheque was lost. But in NatWests subsequent letter it said this was 
incorrect. It explained Mr C was most likely told this as the narrative on his account said 
delayed/lost but this wasnt the case so the information he was provided with in branch was 
incorrect. NatWest explained the sending bank had not paid the cheque so Mr C should 
contact the issuer of the cheque. 
On 2 September NatWest issued a final response letter explaining theyd lost the cheque. 
They admitted they previously gave incorrect information. They waived £1.57 in debit 
interest and paid £150 in compensation. NatWest explained the automated system didnt 
work so they had to send the physical cheque off to a processing centre but during this time 
the cheque was lost.
I do understand that receiving conflicting information about the whereabouts of the cheque 
wouldve been incredibly frustrating for Mr C. And the cheque payment was highly important 
to him because he needed these funds for his loan payments.  
But like the investigator, I think Mr C couldve made alternative arrangements. By 15 August 
he was aware there were issues with the cheque and by 19 August NatWest had said there 
was no debit authority. 
Mr C said he needed to make his payments by 30 August. However, I think there was 
enough time to make alternative arrangements. For this reason, I dont think NatWest need 
to pay any fees Mr C has incurred. And I dont think NatWest need to pay anything further for 
the level of service Mr C experienced. 
Mr C said his family member had issued the cheque and he felt he shouldnt have to ask him 
to write a new cheque when the issue was between Mr C and NatWest. Although losing the 
cheque was NatWests fault, I dont think this was an unreasonable request and it wouldve 
meant Mr C could make his loan repayments and avoid any associated fees.
Mr C says he wanted NatWest to provide him with an overdraft whilst he was without the 
funds from the cheque. Whilst he couldnt recall who hed spoken to, he said he spoke to the 
department who was dealing with his complaint over the phone to request an overdraft was 
put in place. Our investigator asked NatWest about this but they said they didnt receive a 
request from Mr C.
Having looked at NatWests records, I cant see that this was discussed in detail with Mr C. I 
can see NatWest told Mr C to call back if he needed temporary assistance, but it doesnt 
look like this was discussed any further. 
So on balance, it seems NatWest didnt receive a specific request for an overdraft facility. 
But even if they did, they wouldve been under no obligation to provide one. I therefore dont 
think NatWest has done anything wrong in not providing Mr C with an overdraft facility. 
Mr C is unhappy the compensation was paid too late and says this isnt one of the solutions 
he asked for. Whilst I understand this, I have looked at this case overall, in particular the level of service provided by NatWest. There were shortcomings  mainly that NatWest lost 
the cheque, provided conflicting information and didnt tell Mr C the cheque had been lost 
until 2 September. However, I have balanced this with the fact that Mr C had the opportunity 
to mitigate his losses and make alternative arrangements so he could meet his repayments. 
Taking all of this into account, I think the payment of £150 is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances. So I wont be asking NatWest to do anything further. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 August 2020.
