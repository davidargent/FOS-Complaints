Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ys complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because he didnt seem to be managing his finances and seemed 
to be dependent on this type of borrowing. Mr Lender disagreed but offered to uphold Mr Ys 
complaint about loans 6 to 11 and loan 15. The offer was put to Mr Y, but he didnt accept it. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr Y 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr Y could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ys complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Mr Lender needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 3.    
Mr Y didnt respond to the view. As there is no dispute about these loans, I wont be making 
any findings on them.
Mr Lender says it carried out checks before it lent loan 4 to Mr Y and the results of these 
checks didnt raise any concerns. But as this was Mr Ys fourth loan in seven months, I think 
Mr Lender should have been looking to build a clearer picture about Mr Ys finances before 
lending him this loan. 
I say this because Mr Y had been in debt with Mr Lender almost continuously during that 
seven-month period. Each time Mr Y had repaid a loan he needed to borrow again within a 
matter of days. For example, he was returning to borrow loan 4 only three days after hed 
repaid loan 3 and it was for a larger amount. And loan 4 was for a significantly larger amount 
that hed originally borrowed. It was likely this behaviour of indebtedness was becoming 
increasingly more difficult to sustain. Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders lending history with Mr Y, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Mr Lender should have realised 
that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Ys case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7. I say 
this because: 
at this point Mr Lender ought to have realised Mr Y was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr Y had taken out seven loans in 15 months. So, Mr Lender 
ought to have realised it was more likely that Mr Ys indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably. 
Mr Ys first loan was for £200 and loan 7 was for £400. By now, Mr Lender ought to 
have known that it was unlikely that Mr Y was borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
He also wasnt really making any inroads to the amount he owed Mr Lender. Loan 15 
was taken out just under four year after his first. And was for a much larger amount. 
Mr Y had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Mr Lender over 
an extended period.
I think that Mr Y lost out because Mr Lender provided borrowing for loan 7 onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ys indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The number of loans and the length of time over which Mr Y borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ys ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding Mr Ys complaint about loans 4 to 15 and Mr Lender should put things 
right. 
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr Y paid on loan 4 to 15;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4 to 6 from Mr Ys credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 7 to 15 should be removed from Mr 
Ys credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender must give 
Mr Y a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.My final decision
Im partially upholding Mr Ys complaint. PDL Finance Limited should put things right as set 
out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 August 2020.
