An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld  in part. She didnt 
think S.D. Taylor had acted unfairly  by providing loans 1 to 5 but didnt think it had been right 
to agree loans  6 to 23. S.D. Taylor didnt  respond  to the adjudicator,  so the complaint was 
passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN00310652Relevant rules and regulation include the Office  of Fair Tradings Irresponsible Lending 
Guidance (ILG) until April 2014,  at which time the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
introduced its Consumer Credit Sourcebook  (CONC). The content of the ILG and CONC at 
the times  S.D. Taylor lent to Ms M was broadly similar and made it clear what was expected 
of regulated consumer  credit firms  like S.D. Taylor in terms of what  constituted  responsible 
and irresponsible  lending.
The ILG set out examples of what might constitute  irresponsible lending, including  (bold 
emphasis as per source):
4.20 Failing  to undertake a reasonable assessment  of affordability in an individual case or 
cases.
4.21 Failing to consider sufficient information to be able to reasonably assess  affordability, 
prior to granting credit, significantly  increasing  the total amount of credit  provided, or 
significantly increasing the credit limit (in the case of a running  account credit
agreement).

This could (but not necessarily) include,  for example: Where applicable, appropriate  and 
proportionate, failing to verify  details  of current income and/or expenditure by, for example, 
checking hard copies of payslip/contract of employment (when a borrower  is in employment),
accountant's letters (when a borrower  is self-employed) or benefit statements (when a 
borrower is not in employment).
4.22 Failing to undertake an assessment of creditworthiness of a borrower  on the basis of 
sufficient information  obtained from the borrower  where this is appropriate, and a credit 
reference agency where this is necessary, before  a regulated consumer credit agreement, 
other than an excluded agreement, is made  with the borrower, or the amount of credit 
provided by the creditor to the borrower  is increased significantly, or the credit limit is 
increased significantly (in respect of an agreement for running account credit), in accordance  
with the requirements  of section 55B of the Act.
4.23 Failing to take reasonable  steps  to assess (on the basis  of information  that the creditor 
is aware of at the time the credit is granted)  whether  a prospective borrower is likely to be 
able to meet  repayments in a sustainable  manner.
4.27 Inappropriately encouraging borrowers  to increase, aggregate or roll over existing 
debt to unsustainable levels.
The language used in CONC in the relevant period  was similar  to the language used in ILG, 
for example:
CONC 5.3.1G
(1) In making the creditworthiness assessment  or the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R 
(1), a firm should take into account more  than assessing the customer's ability  to repay  the 
credit. 
(2) The creditworthiness assessment and the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R (1) 
should include the firm taking reasonable steps  to assess the customer's ability  to meet 
repayments under a regulated credit  agreement in a sustainable manner  without the 
customer incurring financial difficulties or experiencing significant adverse consequences.
Ref: DRN00310653I have carefully considered all the arguments,  evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ms complaint.  
S.D. Taylor needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that S.D. Taylor should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that S.D. Taylor  was required to establish  
whether Ms M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ms complaint.
For most  of Ms Ms loans I can see that S.D. Taylor captured some information about  her 
income and expenditure. I havent seen  the loan application forms for loans 1 to 3, so I cant 
be sure about what they said. But as Ms Ms circumstances  remained broadly unchanged  for 
a number of years, I think the first set of application  forms I do have will give me some 
insight into what S.D. Taylor likely knew about  Ms Ms circumstances at the time of loans  1 
to 3.
Ref: DRN00310654For loan 4 it seems the expenditure  information  section wasnt  completed  so Ive moved on 
to look at loan 5. Ms Ms weekly income  is recorded  as £411 (the same as for loan 4) and 
her weekly  expenditure  as £245.  Ms M is recorded  as being not in employment and having  
five dependents, with her income  entirely comprised of state benefits. I have some concerns  
about the level of expenditure recorded, averaging about £1,000 a month, as being enough 
to reasonably reflect the cost of maintaining a household of six people.  It isnt clear  to me 
that expenditure on clothing, toiletries and other  essentials was taken into account. £100 a 
week to feed six people  also seems to me to be on the low side.
In the circumstances, Id have expected  to see that S.D. Taylor at least  asked Ms M for proof  
of her benefits income  and I have no evidence  it did this. So for the first five loans, I am not 
satisfied S.D. Taylor carried out proportionate checks.
Having said this, I am also unable to establish  that loans 1 to 5 were  not sustainably  
affordable for Ms M. I only have partial  information from Ms M (in the form of bank 
statements for one bank account), so dont have  a full picture of Ms Ms financial situation. 
So whilst I do think S.D. Taylor shouldve  done more to check  loans 1 to 5 were  affordable  
for Ms M, I cant conclude  that proportionate  checks wouldve suggested these loans were 
for affordable for her.
I have also looked  at the overall pattern of S.D. Taylor lending  history with Ms M, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which S.D. Taylor should reasonably  have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so S.D. Taylor  should  have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ms case, I think that this point was reached by 
Loan 6 and I say this because:
By the time Ms M asked for loan 6, shed been borrowing from S.D. Taylor  for about 
18 months without a break and was continuously borrowing the same amounts. From 
this, S.D. Taylor ought to have realised Ms M wasnt likely  to have been settling her 
loans in a sustainable  manner.
Ms M didnt really  make any inroads  into the amount she owed S.D. Taylor. Loans 
including and after loan 6 appear  to have been used to refinance previous loans or 
were taken  so soon after previous loans that the effect was also to extend  Ms Ms 
indebtedness in a way which wasnt sustainable.  There was a clear increase in Ms 
Ms borrowing from loan 6 onwards as many of the loans after this point overlapped.
In total, Ms M borrowed from S.D. Taylor, without any real breaks, for about four 
years. Ms M had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to S.D. 
Taylor over an extended period.
I think that Ms M lost out because S.D. Taylor continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ms indebtedness by allowing  her 
to take expensive credit use over an extended period.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Ms Ms 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about  loans 6 to 23 and S.D. Taylor should  put things right.
Ref: DRN00310655putting things right
S.D. Taylor shouldnt have given Ms M loans 6 to 23.
If S.D. Taylor has sold the outstanding debts it should buy these back if it is able to do so 
and then take the following steps. If S.D. Taylor is not able to buy the debts back  then it 
should liaise  with the new debt owner to achieve  the results  outlined below.
A)S.D. Taylor should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms M towards  
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything it has already refunded.
B)S.D. Taylor should calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by Ms M 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms M originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C)S.D. Taylor should remove  all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made by Ms M as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Ms M having made 
overpayments then S.D. Taylor should refund these overpayments  with 8% simple  interest*  
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments  would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. S.D. Taylor should  then refund the amounts calculated  in A 
and B and move  to step E.
D)If there  is still an outstanding balance then the amounts  calculated  in A and B should be 
used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding  loans and any principal SD Taylor has 
written-off. If this results in a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Ms M. However if 
there is still an outstanding balance then it should try to agree an affordable  repayment  plan 
with Ms M. S.D. Taylor shouldnt pursue outstanding balances  made  up of principal it has 
already written-off.
E)The overall pattern  of Ms Ms borrowing for loans 6 to 23 means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse, so S.D. Taylor should remove  these  loans entirely from Ms Ms 
credit file. S.D. Taylor  does not have to remove the outstanding  loans  from Ms Ms credit 
file until these have  been repaid, but S.D. Taylor should still remove any adverse 
information recorded about these  loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires S.D. Taylor to deduct tax from this interest.  S.D. Taylor 
should give Ms M a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Ms Ms complaint in part. S.D. Taylor Limited must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 May 2020.
