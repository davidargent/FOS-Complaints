The complaint
Mr M complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) charged him for international payments.
What happened
Mr M made three international payments using HSBCs online service. They were all 
returned, and Mr M received less money back than he sent. The payments were: 
Date Amount Rate Amount - Out/In
23 November 2020 EUR 10000 1.08075 £9252.77 Out
24 November 2020 EUR 10000 1.1478 £8711.82 In
24 November 2020 EUR 10000 1.08905 £9182.31 Out
25 November 2020 EUR 10000 1.1453 £8731.16 In
5 January 2021 EUR 10000 1.07301 £9319.54 Out
6 January 2021 EUR 10000 1.1258 £8882.53 In
Mr M complained that the amounts returned were less than expected. He accepted there 
would be a charge, but he felt scalped by HSBC. 
HSBC said the losses were incurred as a result of the payments being returned - due to 
difference in exchange rates. This was in line with their policy.
Mr M brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said HSBC had acted fairly and in line 
with the terms and conditions which were shown on its payments pages  as part of the 
online payment screens. So, she couldnt see that HSBC had made an error.
Mr M disagreed  he said that while HSBC may have acted in line with its terms and 
conditions, that didnt make its pricing fair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr M made three online payments in euros in November 2020 and January 2021. They were 
returned on the following day  but each time there was a difference of between £437 and 
£541. Mr M says this wasnt fair. 
Ive looked at HSBCs terms and conditions. These are shown on the payments screen when 
the payments were made. They are shown as a warning just before the confirm button is 
pressed. They say Please select confirm if you would like to accept the rate above and 
confirm your payment instruction. Please be aware if this payment cannot be made
or is returned by the foreign bank for any reason the payment will be reversed. If there have 
been movements in exchange rates which leads to a gain or a loss, this will be passed to
your account.  So  this was made clear on the payment screen that Mr M used to make the 
payments. So, I cant say that HSBC were wrong in passing the costs of the returns onto Mr 
M.
Ive looked at the transactions. In each case, there was about a 5% difference between the 
buy and sell rate  which caused the amounts returned to be less than those sent. For all 
banks and foreign exchange businesses, there will always be this spread between the buy 
and sell rates  thats how they make their money. And its for those businesses, including 
HSBC, to set these as part of their pricing. We cant interfere with their prices  thats their 
commercial decision. But  customers will find that different businesses use different 
spreads.
So  while Mr M will find this disappointing, I dont think I can say that HSBC acted unfairly 
or incorrectly and I wont be asking them to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 August 2021.
