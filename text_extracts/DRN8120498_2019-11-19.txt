K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that WorldRemit Ltd delayed  in processing a transaction  and took too long to 
refund his money.
background
Mr B had a financial obligation overseas which he wanted to settle.  A relative  in the UK took 
out a loan and advanced some of the funds to Mr B for him to use to pay the debt. Mr B 
transferred the money from his bank account to WorldRemit, as he intended to make the 
payment overseas through  them. 
Mr B says that WorldRemit delayed in processing the transaction.  So he cancelled  it and 
asked them to refund  his money. He says WorldRemit took more than a week  to do this and 
that he had to keep chasing  for his money back,  including a wasted journey to WorldRemits 
office in London where  he wasnt able to speak to anyone. He says hes used WorldRemit to 
transfer money several times before without a problem.  But he says their process is faulty 
and caused him problems  on this occasion.
Mr B is unhappy about what  happened  and says its caused him a lot of stress.  He says his 
reputation has been  damaged as he wasnt able to pay his debt on time. And that, as a 
result, interest has been applied to the outstanding amount at a rate of 12%. He wants 
WorldRemit to reimburse him for this and the interest which accrued on his relatives loan.  
And he wants compensation  for the distress and inconvenience the situation caused him.
WorldRemit say theyre obliged to carry out checks to ensure the safety and security of 
customers money. In Mr Bs case, they say this meant they needed to see his bank 
statement before  they could  process  the transaction and, later,  the refund. They  say they 
processed the refund once theyd received the bank statement.  They  dont think  theyve  
done anything  wrong but, as a gesture of goodwill, they gave Mr B a promotional  code  to 
use on his next transaction  so that it would be free of charge. 
Mr B wasnt  happy with WorldRemits response  so he brought  his complaint to this service. 
Our investigator thought that WorldRemit had dealt  with the situation fairly and didnt ask 
them to do any more.  But Mr B was disappointed with our investigators findings  and asked 
for his complaint  to be reviewed by an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think it would be useful  to set out a brief timeline  of events here. From  the information 
available to me, I find that the key events  took place as follows:
28 January  Mr B transferred the funds to WorldRemit. They contacted  him to 
request information  which they say they needed  to process the transaction.
29 January  Mr B provided documentation  to WorldRemit.
30 January  WorldRemit emailed Mr B saying  the information  hed provided wasnt  
sufficient. They asked  him for more information.  Mr B replied and asked WorldRemit 
to discontinue  the transaction and return his funds immediately. WorldRemit said 
that, in order to process the refund, they needed to see a bank statement for the 
Ref: DRN81204982account from which Mr B had transferred the funds  and it needed to show  the 
account holders  name.
31 January  Mr B sent a bank statement but WorldRemit say it didnt show  the 
account holder  name. They asked Mr B for the information again.
5 February  Mr B sent the bank statement to WorldRemit. They confirmed they 
would complete the refund and said they expected  the funds to be back  in Mr Bs 
account within 1-2 working days.
8 February  Mr B received the refund.
WorldRemit didnt process the transaction straight  away because  they say they needed 
further information from Mr B. They say they had to carry  out due diligence checks because  
the transaction amount  was more than £10,000.  Mr B says hes made transactions through 
WorldRemit several times before and not been asked for additional information. But he says 
that his previous transactions  have been for smaller amounts. From the information 
available, I find that WorldRemit have  in place a threshold of £10,000 and that they carry out 
additional checks for transactions over this amount. 
Its right that WorldRemit  should put security measures and procedures  in place to safeguard 
customers accounts. As to exactly what those  procedures  are and how they are carried  out, 
thats a matter for WorldRemit to decide.  But Im satisfied that they were acting in line with 
their usual procedures  by flagging up this transaction for additional checks.
WorldRemit say there was also a name mismatch between Mr Bs account with them and 
the bank account theyd  received the funds from. They say that was another reason why 
they needed to ask Mr B for more information. I think thats reasonable. 
Its also in line with WorldRemits terms and conditions, which say that Mr B must give them 
any other information they need  in order to comply with their obligations under relevant laws, 
rules and regulations.  The terms and conditions  also say that WorldRemit may refuse  to 
process, or delay in processing, any instruction if Mr B doesnt provide them with any 
information theyve  reasonably requested. Mr B agreed to be bound  by these terms and 
conditions when opening his account.  
I think WorldRemits request  for information was reasonable.  And the first bank statement Mr 
B provided  didnt satisfy  their concerns, so I think it was reasonable for them to ask for a 
further statement. I think WorldRemit were entitled to delay the transaction  and refund until 
they received  this information from Mr B.
Once theyd received the bank statement they needed, WorldRemit processed the refund 
the next day (6 February). The funds took two further days  to arrive in Mr Bs account. 
Theyd told him they expected the funds to be with him within  1-2 working  days. This is what  
happened, although I appreciate it would have  seemed to Mr B that it took three days  
because he was told that on 5 February. In any event, I think  WorldRemits  timescale  for 
processing the refund was reasonable.
Mr B says he had to make several calls and send several documents before he got his 
money back. And he visited WorldRemits  office but couldnt speak to anyone  without an 
appointment. I realise Mr B feels strongly  about his complaint  and is very unhappy with the 
time it took to get the refund. But, for the reasons above, I think WorldRemit were  entitled to 
delay the transaction and refund until they were  satisfied  with the documentation. And I think  
they were clear about what information  they needed. Its unfortunate that Mr B had a wasted 
trip to their office. But I dont think a personal visit was necessary here.  So I cant conclude  
Ref: DRN81204983that WorldRemit acted  unfairly or caused unnecessary delay.  Once they had what  they 
needed, they processed the refund promptly.
I realise Mr B will find my decision disappointing, but I dont think  WorldRemit have done 
anything wrong  here. So Im not going to ask them to pay any compensation. And I dont 
think theyre responsible  for any interest charges  Mr B has incurred. As to interest accrued 
on his relatives loan, thats not something I can look at as part of Mr Bs complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 December  2019.
