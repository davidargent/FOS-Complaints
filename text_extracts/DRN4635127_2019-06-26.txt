K821x#15complaint
Miss M complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading as Pounds  to Pocket) gave her loans 
that she couldnt afford to repay.  She asks for compensation for the hardship  and worry this 
caused.
background
Pounds to Pocket gave instalment loans to Miss M between December 2012 and July 2018. 
Miss M says Pounds to Pocket was irresponsible to lend to her. She says the loans caused 
worry and financial hardship.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld. He said Pounds  to 
Pocket gave 13 loans to Miss M. He said it wasnt wrong for Pounds to Pocket to offer loans 
1 to 3. But by loan 4 Miss M showed signs she was struggling to repay the previous loans. 
Shed refinanced loan 1 three times,  each  time increasing the amount borrowed. Our 
adjudicator said that by loan 5 Miss M showed  signs of being  reliant  on short  term loans and 
her borrowing wasnt sustainable.
Our adjudicator said Pounds to Pocket should refund interest and charges on loans 4 to 13, 
with 8% interest. He said it should  remove adverse information about  loan 4 and all 
information about loans 5 to 13 from Miss Ms credit  files. 
Pounds to Pocket didnt agree. It said Miss M didnt initially take the full amount she was 
approved for and later topped up some of the loans. It said in total Miss M had six loans.  
Pounds to Pocket said requesting additional  money as top ups didnt show Miss M was 
struggling to repay the loans. It said Miss M made  payments on time and didnt say she was 
in hardship.
Pounds to Pocket said Miss M had breaks of up to 198 days between loans 2, 3 and 4. It 
said it hadnt seen  evidence  such as bank  statements  that show  that Miss M was 
dependant on its loans. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Pounds to Pocket says Miss M took out six loans and some top ups  not 13 loans as our 
adjudicator said in his view. However, Pounds to Pockets  emails  to Mrs M confirming the 
loans dont support  this: its emails say the existing loan was refinanced  into a new loan and 
provides a new loan number.  The emails  ask Miss M to note that the status of her previous 
loan will be paid off as it was rolled  into the new loan. The emails set out the contractual  
repayments and the period over which the loan is to be repaid is extended from the previous 
loan. For instance,  Loan 1 was to be repaid in 12 monthly instalments with the last due in 
November 2013.  But after Miss M took out additional borrowing in June  2013  the loan was 
repayable in 12 monthly instalments with the last due in May 2014. So I think these  were  
new loans.

*these loans were  refinanced by the next loan.
**while the account  statement  provided by Pounds to Pocket says this loan was repaid on 
31.10.2017, other information suggests  it was repaid at the end of June  2017.
Pounds to Pocket needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure 
Miss M could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into 
account a number of different things, such as how much  was being lent, the repayment 
amounts and Miss Ms income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
Loans 1 to 3 (December 2012  to September 2013)
When Miss M took out Loans 1 to 3 she told Pounds to Pocket  that her monthly  income was 
£2,000. Pounds to Pocket says it did credit checks and the results  didnt suggest any 
problems. Given the amount  of the repayments  and Miss Ms stated monthly income,  I dont 
think Pounds to Pocket needed to make further checks  before offering Loans 1 to 3. Based 
on the information it had, I dont think it had reason to think the loans werent affordable.
Ref: DRN46351273Loan 4 (September 2013)
I think Pounds to Pocket should  have  made  further  checks before Loan 4. This was the third 
time Miss M refinanced an existing loan and thered been no break in her borrowing since 
shed taken out Loan 1. This suggests  Miss M might be having difficulty  managing  her 
money.
Given the problems  Miss M appeared to be having managing her money, the amount of the 
repayments and the period over which theyd  be made, I think Pounds  to Pocket should 
have done more to check that the loan was affordable. I think it should have asked about  
Miss Ms expenditure, including her short term commitments. I think  it should have asked 
Miss M for evidence  to verify  what she told it about  her outgoings. There  are different  ways 
of doing this, one of which is to ask for bank statements. 
Its for Pounds to Pocket to carry out proportionate checks before  lending.  It hasnt provided 
evidence that it did so. I dont think Pounds to Pocket has shown that it was reasonable for it 
to believe Miss M could repay Loan 4 in a sustainable manner.
Miss M provided  copies  of bank statements to us. While I dont have bank statements for the 
whole period Miss M borrowed from Pounds to Pocket, I have statements for periods  before 
and after she took out Loan  4. I can see that Miss M was borrowing regularly from short  term 
lenders and was consistently overdrawn by an amount Id consider significant relative to her 
income. 
I dont think Pounds  to Pocket should have offered Loan 4 without making  proportionate  
checks. And if it had made proportionate checks, I think  its likely  it would  have known 
Loan 4 wasnt  affordable  and sustainable.  
Loan 5 (October 2014)
I think when Miss M asked for Loan  5 Pounds to Pocket should have realised further lending 
was unsustainable.  
Miss M had taken out four instalment  loans  from Pounds to Pocket in 17 months. The 
amount she borrowed  increased from £300 (Loan 1) to over £1,000 (Loan 4). There was no 
break in her borrowing during this 17 months period. And she asked for a new loan about  a 
week after she repaid  Loan 4. 
I think Pounds to Pocket ought  to have considered whether Miss M was reliant on its loans. I 
think it should have  realised it was likely Miss M asked  for Loan 5 to cover the gap in her 
finances left by repaying Loan 4  especially  as Miss M went on to increase her borrowing 
by taking out two more  loans (Loans 6 and 7) within a week  of taking out Loan 5. 
There was a gap of just over six months between Loans 8 and 9. A break in borrowing  can 
suggest a customers  financial circumstances have improved. However, given  the length of 
time that Miss M had been  borrowing  from Pounds to Pocket,  her pattern of increasing her 
borrowing and the amount  of Loan  9, I dont think it was reasonable for Pounds  to Pocket to 
assume that was the case here.  I think  it needed to take her borrowing  history into account.
The loans offered by Pounds to Pocket  were  intended  for short  term use. But Miss M didnt 
make any real inroads  into the amount she owed Pounds to Pocket. A number of her loans 
Ref: DRN46351274were refinanced instead of being repaid as originally  intended, with the result that the 
amount she owed and the period over which shed make repayments  both increased.
Miss M borrowed  from Pounds to Pocket for more  than five years. The amounts of her last 
three loans  increased  (£500, £1,000 and £1,700). In my view, this pattern of borrowing 
shows that the loans were  not sustainable.  In effect, Miss M paid large amounts of interest to 
service a debt to Pounds to Pocket  over an extended period. I dont think  this borrowing was 
sustainable.
So Im upholding  Miss Ms complaint about  Loan  4 and the later loans. Pounds to Pocket  
should:
refund  all interest and charges Miss M paid on Loan 4 and the later loans;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information  about  Loan 4 from Miss Ms credit file; and
remove all entries about  Loan 5 and the later loans from Miss Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Pounds to Pocket to take off tax from this interest.  It 
must give Miss M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Pounds to Pocket recently wrote to Miss M saying its written  off the account balance. This 
was because of adverse  information recorded on her credit file while it had suspended 
collection of payments. To the extent that the amount written off was capital (not interest or 
charges), Pounds  to Pocket can deduct it when calculating the compensation owed to 
Miss M. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order CashEuroNet  UK LLC to take the steps 
and pay the compensation set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 July 2019.
