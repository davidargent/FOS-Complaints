K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that TransferWise  closed his account and said he couldnt use their services  
in the future. Mr S would like the account reopened.
background
Mr S had a TransferWise  account  which he set up in June 2018. Following a review  on 
7 November 2018 Mr Ss account was closed with immediate effect 
Mr S says the account closure was prompted  by him helping  his uncle to set up an account. 
And using  his card to put money in his uncles account to show  him how to use 
TransferWise. 
Mr S was unhappy, and he complained to TransferWise. 
TransferWise reviewed  the situation and confirmed that they would close Mr Ss account. 
The funds were returned to Mr S on 28 November.
TransferWise said they were entitled to review the account and close  it in accordance  with 
the terms and conditions.
Mr S complained to us. Our investigator  said that TransferWise had acted fairly in closing his 
account in line with the terms  and conditions.
Mr S disagreed he said he didnt think he had breached  the terms of the account and he 
didnt think TransferWise  were justified in closing his account.
As no agreement could be reached  the matter has come to me for decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive reached the same 
conclusion as the investigator for broadly the same  reasons.
Ill start by setting out some context for the review  of Mr Ss account. UK legislation  places 
extensive obligations on regulated financial businesses.  Financial institutions  must establish 
the purpose and intended  nature  of transactions as well as the origin of funds, and there 
may be penalties if they dont. This applies to both new and existing relationships. These 
obligations override  all other obligations.
A bank  is entitled  to close an account with a customer just as a customer may close  an 
account with a bank. But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which 
complies with the terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions  of the account say that TransferWise could close the account with 
immediate effect  in certain  circumstances. Looking at the evidence  provided by 
TransferWise I am satisfied they were following the terms and conditions  to close the 
account with immediate effect.  Whilst  Mr S mayve expected to be given the reasons for the 
closure, TransferWise isnt required to give him a specific  reason  for closing the account.  So, 
Ref: DRN31947902I cant say TransferWise  has done anything wrong by not giving Mr S this information   as 
much as hed like to know.
I am satisfied TransferWise  completed  the review  of Mr Ss account in a timely manner and 
returned the funds to him without undue  delay.
I appreciate that TransferWises decision to no longer offer Mr S its services in the future has 
caused him inconvenience. But TransferWise  can make commercial  decisions about who 
they offer services to. They cannot unfairly  discriminate against  a customer. But they can 
say they no longer wish to do business with individuals. Thats  because  theyve got the 
commercial freedom to decide who they want to contract with. And Im satisfied  that 
TransferWise has exercised its commercial decision legitimately when it decided it no longer 
wished to do business with Mr S. So I cannot fairly and reasonably say its done anything  
wrong.
In summary,  I recognise Mr S feels unhappy about the closure and that TransferWise  isnt 
justified in closing  the account and Im sure that not finding a replacement  service has been 
frustrating to him. I realise Mr S will be disappointed by my decision, but overall, based on 
the evidence Ive seen, I cant say TransferWise  has acted unreasonably and treated Mr S 
unfairly when it closed his account. 
my final decision
For the reasons  I have  explained my final decision is I do not uphold  the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 31 January 2020.
