The complaint
Mr and Mrs F complain that GE Money Consumer Lending Limited, trading as First National, 
has rejected the claims that theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre 
being represented in their complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs F entered into a purchase agreement for an allocation of some holiday club 
points in May 2002 and they also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with a company 
thats now part of GE Money to pay for those points. Their representative made claims to GE 
Money under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act in January 2019 that the 
timeshare had been mis-sold to them. GE Money issued a detailed response to those claims 
in February 2019 in which it said, amongst other things, that:
Mr and Mrs F didnt have any actionable claim against it under section 140A as their 
account with it was closed prior to the implementation of that legislation;
any claim that they may have had would be statute barred by the expiry of the six 
year limitation period under section 9 of the Limitation Act 1980; and
the loan was paid to a trustee rather than to the supplier so there was no debtor-
creditor-supplier relationship and Mr and Mrs F arent afforded protection under 
section 75.
Mr and Mrs F werent satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our 
investigator didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. She said that Mr and 
Mrs Fs claims were more than likely time barred under the Limitation Act so she thought that 
GE Moneys decision not to look into them any further was fair  and because of that she 
didnt consider whether there had been a break in the debtor-creditor-supplier relationship.
Mr and Mrs Fs representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It says, in summary, that:
GE Money lent to Mr and Mrs F irresponsibly;
the timeshare company used high pressure sales practices and undue influence and 
it has provided a statement from Mr and Mrs F about the sales process;
Mr and Mrs F were told that the timeshare was an investment;
the timeshare company acted as an unauthorised broker;
GE Money paid a commission to the timeshare company which wasnt disclosed to 
Mr and Mrs F;
the misrepresentations by the timeshare company were fraudulent; and
information was deliberately concealed from Mr and Mrs F so they can rely on 
section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act.
GE Money issued a further response to those issues in which it explained why it considered 
that Mr and Mrs Fs claims shouldnt be upheld.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr and Mrs F referred their complaint to this service within six years of the event that 
theyve complained about  which is GE Money turning down their claims under the 
Consumer Credit Act - but I need to consider whether it has acted fairly in saying that 
the Limitation Act applies to their claims and the other reasons that it has given for 
not upholding their claims;
in this decision Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Fs claims as only a 
court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not GE Moneys 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr and Mrs Fs claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented to 
them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, GE Money would be expected to 
consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time limits set out in 
the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and 
to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr and Mrs F could have made a claim to the timeshare company or 
GE Money about the misrepresentations that induced them into buying the timeshare 
when they entered into the agreement to buy the timeshare in May 2002 as that was 
when they say that they entered into an agreement based on the misrepresentations 
of the timeshare company and suffered a loss as they entered into the loan 
agreement with GE Money to pay for the timeshare;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or GE Money 
 but they didnt make a claim against GE Money until January 2019, more than 
sixteen years later, which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mr and Mrs Fs representative says that Mr and Mrs F only became aware that they 
could make a claim to GE Money after they sought advice from it  but when they 
had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist them for the purposes of the 
Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of 
action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr and 
Mrs Fs claims;
their representative also says that the misrepresentations were fraudulent as the 
timeshare company knew that it wouldnt be possible for all purchasers to take their 
holidays at the same time;
in some cases actions based on a fraud have longer limitation periods but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the timeshare company 
fraudulently misrepresented the timeshare to Mr and Mrs F and I dont consider that it 
changes the limitation period that Ive described above; 
as I consider that Mr and Mrs Fs section 75 claim is time-barred under the Limitation 
Act, I dont consider that theres any need for me to assess whether or not there was 
a debtor-creditor-supplier relationship in these circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Fs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr 
and Mrs F and GE Money and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
but section 140A was introduced in 2006  after Mr and Mrs F had entered into the 
purchase agreement and loan agreement  so I dont consider that they are able to 
make a claim against GE Money under section 140A (and I consider that any claim 
under section 140A would also be time barred under the Limitation Act as their loan 
agreement ended in September 2003 but they didnt make a claim against GE Money 
until January 2019, more than fifteen years later);
Mr and Mrs Fs representative says that information about the credit agreement and 
timeshare was deliberately concealed from Mr and Mrs F and section 32(1)(b) of the 
Limitation Act says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been 
deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the 
debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have 
been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a 
breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate 
concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Mr and Mrs F and their representative have described what they say happened 
before Mr and Mrs F entered into the purchase agreement and loan agreement in 
May 2002  but I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that theres 
been a deliberate concealment of any relevant information and I consider that many 
of the things that they say werent right would have been known to Mr and Mrs F at 
the time of the sale so I dont consider that section 32 is applicable in these 
circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Fs representative has said that GE Money should have told them 
about any commission that it paid to the timeshare company for arranging the loan 
 but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, 
was paid by GE Money to the timeshare company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid 
it tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that GE Money didnt 
breach any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any regulatory 
duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these circumstances;Mr and Mrs Fs representative says that it was irresponsible for GE Money to have 
made the loan to them but the loan was made to Mr and Mrs F in May 2002 and GE 
Money says that it was repaid in September 2003  about sixteen months later;
Ive seen no other evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs F 
or that it was irresponsible for GE Money to have made the loan to them - and they 
didnt complain to GE Money about the lending until April 2021 so I also consider it to 
be more likely than not that any complaint about irresponsible lending would now be 
time-barred; 
nor have I seen evidence to show that Mr and Mrs F were unduly pressured into 
entering into the purchase agreement or loan agreement in May 2002 or that the 
timeshare company used unacceptable commercial practices against Mr and Mrs F  
they didnt complain to GE Money about those issues until April 2021  nearly 
nineteen years after they entered into the agreements and I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have complained to GE Money about any such issues 
before then; 
Mr and Mrs Fs representative says that Mr and Mrs F were told that the timeshare 
was an investment and that the timeshare company acted as an unauthorised broker 
 but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they were told that 
the timeshare was an investment and I consider that any such claim would now also 
be time-barred as Mr and Mrs F entered into the purchase agreement and loan 
agreement in May 2002 but no complaint was made about those issues until April 
2021  nearly nineteen years later;
I understand that the timeshare company held the required authorisation at the time 
of the sale so Im not persuaded that it acted as an unauthorised broker when the 
loan was arranged;
GE Money responded to Mr and Mrs Fs claims in February 2019 (and it provided a 
further response to their claims in July 2021 after their representative had responded 
to our investigators recommendations) and I consider that its responses were fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances; and 
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs F for the issues that theyve had with their timeshare 
and the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require GE Money to refund to them any 
of the money that they paid under the loan agreement, to pay them any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Fs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F and Mrs F to 
accept or reject my decision before 21 April 2022.
