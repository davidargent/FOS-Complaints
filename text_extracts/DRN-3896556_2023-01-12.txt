The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc processed a payment to his credit card 
without his authority. He is also unhappy with the service hes received. 
What happened
The detailed background to this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide 
a brief overview of some of the key events here. 
In 2020 Mr M was in dispute with his motor insurance provider, a firm Ill refer to as L. As 
part of Ls complaint response, they credited Mr Ms NatWest credit card with a £50 
compensation payment. The payment credited Mr Ms card in November 2020. 
Mr M complained to both L and NatWest. Part of Mr Ms complaint about L was that they 
shouldnt have made the payment to his credit card. The complaint about L has already been 
decided by one of my Ombudsman colleagues and wasnt upheld. The Ombudsman 
concluded that LV had acted fairly and that they didnt need to do more. 
Mr M was unhappy that NatWest accepted a payment onto his credit card without his 
authority. He was also unhappy with some of the customer service he received which 
included one of NatWests staff failing to disclose more than their first name to him. Initially 
NatWest didnt uphold the complaint and it was referred to our service. 
NatWest then made an offer of £75 compensation to settle the complaint. Ultimately one of 
our Investigators recommended that the complaint should be upheld, concluding that 
NatWests offer was a fair way to resolve matters. Mr M didnt accept this and asked for an 
Ombudsman to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Ms strength of feeling about his complaint is clear from his submissions and the phone 
calls that Ive listened to. But I think it would be useful to make clear that the Financial 
Ombudsman Service is an informal dispute resolution service and an alternative to the 
courts. We aim to resolve complaints with minimal formality. 
With that in mind, I dont need to conduct a forensic analysis of what has gone on between 
Mr M and NatWest. Ive considered everything Mr M has told our service, but Ill be keeping 
my findings to what I believe to be the crux of his complaint. This isnt intended as a 
discourtesy and is just a reflection of the informal nature of our service. If Mr M decides not 
to accept my decision, it wont be legally binding and he will be free to continue his dispute 
with NatWest through other avenues (such as the courts), should he choose to do so. 
Having carefully considered everything I dont think NatWest did anything wrong when 
processing the payment to Mr Ms credit card account from L. I dont agree that there was a 
risk in them doing so. Its also reasonably common for credits, refunds or (as in this case) 
complaint compensation payments to be made in this way. So I dont think NatWest ought to 
have questioned this or done more prior to processing the payment. And when Mr M raised 
this, I think it was fair for NatWest to tell Mr M this was something he would need to take up 
with L. 
Because I dont think there were any failings by NatWest in relation to the payment to Mr Ms 
account, there isnt any reasonable basis upon which I can tell them they need to liaise 
directly with L to arrange the return of the funds as Mr M would like. 
Mr M was also unhappy with the service he received from NatWest whilst they were dealing 
with this matter. Unfortunately, NatWest havent been able to share call recordings to hear 
exactly what was said. But Ive considered the call notes made at the time as well as what 
Mr M has told us. 
NatWest themselves accept that the service they provided wasnt of the standard they 
usually aim for. So it isnt in dispute that there was some poor service. However, I think the 
£75 compensation NatWest have offered is a fair way to put things right for the impact of the 
poor service Mr M received in relation to this matter. Im aware that Mr M has told our 
service that he doesnt want any money from NatWest. And as Ive mentioned above, he is 
under no obligation to accept my decision, but Im still going to direct NatWest to pay the 
compensation theyve already offered. This way should Mr M change his mind, the option 
remains for him to accept the decision and therefore the compensation from NatWest. 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. 
Unless theyve already done so, National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr M £75 
compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 February 2023.
