K821x#15complaint
Mr R complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest) stopped four payments 
from his business  account in 2017  and failed to tell him why.
background
January 2017  payment
In January 2017 Mr R gave his partner a cheque that was returned  unpaid. He was very 
annoyed about this, and asked NatWest to tell him why it had happened. NatWest  gave a 
number of different  reasons. At first it said a block  had been put on Mr Rs account because 
a suspicious activity enquiry had been carried out. Later it said it couldnt  explain why the 
cheque wasnt paid.  NatWests most  recent position  is that the block was put in place 
because it hadnt  received  information it had asked for about Mr Rs daughter,  a third party 
on the account. Mr Rs daughter  had married and changed her name, and NatWest said it 
needed to verify that in line with its regulatory  obligations to know who its customers  are.
Mr R has told us he felt fobbed off by NatWest, and that it hadnt been  honest with him. 
NatWest says it had given inconsistent explanations about what had happened because 
some of its staff wouldnt have always been able to see the reasons why decisions were 
taken.
In June 2017 our adjudicator upheld Mr Rs complaint in relation to the January 2017 
cheque. He said that NatWest hadnt been able say why the cheque wasnt  paid, and its 
records werent clear why it acted as it did. He concluded, on the balance  of probabilities,  
that NatWest was likely to be responsible for the cheque not being paid. He said that 
NatWest had contradicted  itself on several  occasions about whether a no operations 
marker has been placed on the account or not, and that NatWest  had provided poor 
customer service  to Mr R when he attempted to resolve the matter.
To put things right the adjudicator recommended that NatWest pay Mr R £250  compensation 
to reflect  the distress and inconvenience Mr R was caused by the non-payment  of the 
January 2017  cheque.
NatWest agreed to pay Mr R £250.  Mr R agreed to accept £250  in relation to this issue  
alone.
May 2017 payments
During our investigation of the January 2017  dishonoured  cheque  payment, NatWest failed 
to honour three further payments (one of which was another  cheque) that Mr R made in May 
2017. NatWest has told us this happened  because a no operations marker had been  on Mr 
Rs account.
The May 2017 payments were looked  at separately  by a different investigator. 
Mr R told us these incidents  were inconvenient, embarrassing and suggested he didnt  have 
enough money to cover  the payments. Amongst other things,  he told us his partner had 
asked him questions about his account  and whether he had money  difficulties. He also told 
us that one of the missed payments was to his club, where paying bills on time mattered, 
Ref: DRN59246802and could affect his reputation. NatWest has confirmed that Mr R had more  than enough 
money in the account to make the payments.
In March 2018 the investigator rejected Mr Rs complaint about the May 2017 refused 
payments. He said the payments in May 2017  werent made because Mr Rs account had 
been blocked. In other  words a no operations marker had been put on Mr Rs account.  In 
his view, NatWest had acted reasonably in blocking Mr Rs account at this time because Mr 
R hadnt provided it with information it required to fulfil its regulatory obligations  name, 
proof of his daughters identification.
In coming to this view,  our investigator  accepted  that Mr R had sent NatWest  a copy of his 
daughters marriage  certificate in 2014  as proof of her identification. However, the marriage  
certificate was in a foreign language, so NatWest had taken a copy  of it and sent the 
certificate back to Mr R, asking him to get it translated. Our investigator thought NatWest 
could reasonably expect that identification presented by Mr R should  be fit for purpose  and 
any amendments (such as the translation)  should be made by him.
Our investigator went on to say that NatWest  didnt get a response to its request for the 
marriage certificate to be translated,  despite chasing  Mr R for one. This matter came  to a 
head in December 2016 when NatWest sent Mr R a letter  saying that if the identification  
wasnt received, Mr Rs account would become inoperable. NatWest  had told our 
investigator that it had sent Mr R two letters in December 2016  and another letter in March 
2017 about needing identification from Mr R.
Mr R disagreed with the investigator. He seemed  to accept the May 2017  payments werent  
paid because his account had been blocked.  However he said he didnt know  he needed  to 
give NatWest more  information about his daughters  identity. He didnt receive a letter from 
NatWest saying it needed to update its records in line with financial and money  laundering 
regulations.
Mr R didnt think NatWest acted proportionately  when it put a block  on the account in May 
2017 because  information hadnt been  received. The block was removed after NatWest  
spoke to him on the phone, and it took the decision to use an online programme to translate 
the marriage certificate. So he thought  NatWest  shouldve  done this sooner - certainly before 
it blocked the account. Mr R also questioned NatWests decision to use staff in another 
country in connection  with the decision to block the account. He didnt think  they had the 
training or the experience to take the decision they did.
Mr R said he should also be paid another £250  compensation for each of the three  missed  
payments  so he should get £1,000 in total to resolve this complaint. He asked for his 
complaint to be reviewed  by an ombudsman.
my provisional decision
In my provisional decision I said that I didnt think it would be fair and reasonable for me 
require NatWest to pay Mr R more  than the £250 it has already offered to resolve this 
complaint. I have summarised  my arguments below. My arguments  are set out in full in my 
provisional decision.
January 2017  payment
I appreciated that Mr R was frustrated by NatWests handling of this matter. However, I was 
satisfied that he has accepted NatWests  offer of £250 to resolve this aspect of this 
Ref: DRN59246803complaint. I said £250 compensation was in line with what this service  would award  for 
matters that have had a moderate impact on a consumer.
May 2017 payments
In my provisional decision I said that Mr R seemed to accept that the May 2017  payments 
werent paid because NatWest had placed  a no operations  marker on his account. 
However, Mr R said he didnt  know he needed to give NatWest more  information about his 
daughters identity in late 2016/early 2017, and he thought NatWest  had acted  
disproportionately when  it put the no operations marker on his account as a result  of 
identification not being provided.
I said that NatWest had provided  us with a copy of a letter from it to Mr R dated 1 March  
2017. That letter said:
The Bank  is obliged to ensure that our customer records are accurately maintained and are 
up to date in accordance with the United  Kingdom's financial and anti-money laundering 
regulations. In light of this obligation, we have attempted to contact you on a number of 
occasions to update  the information  we hold with regard to your organisation,  and the 
individuals with the authority to exercise  financial  control of it.
To date we have not received the documentation we require therefore we regret  to inform 
you that we will now take steps to render  your account(s) inoperable from 30 April 2017.
Mr R said he didnt receive  this letter. NatWest hasnt been  able to demonstrate (using  its 
systems records) that it was sent.  However, I was also conscious that NatWest has told us 
that the 1 March 2017 letter followed two letters it sent to Mr R in December 2016: one on 14 
December 2016  and another on 22 December 2016.  NatWest was able to demonstrate  
(using its systems records)  that these letters were  sent. The 14 December  2016  letter  said 
Mr Rs account was going to be reviewed, the 22 December  2016 letter  said that his account 
would become inoperable on 20 February  2017 as documentation hadnt been received. 
Mr R said he didnt receive  either the 14 December 2016 or the 22 December 2016 letters 
either.
I considered, on the balance  of probabilities, that NatWest sent the 1 March  2017 letter  to 
Mr R. I said NatWest had been able to provide a copy of the original letter  it says it sent to 
Mr R on 1 March 2017. I thought  it was unlikely that NatWest would have a copy of this letter  
on Mr Rs file if it wasnt sent as it says it was. I also thought it was unlikely that the 1 March 
2017 letter,  the 14 December 2016 letter  and the 22 December 2016 all went  astray.  They 
were all written  to Mr R at his correct address.
As I thought, on the balance of probabilities, that NatWest  did send the 1 March 2017  letter  
to Mr R, I didnt  think  it would  be fair and reasonable for me to hold NatWest  for the fact that 
Mr R didnt receive it. Thats because  NatWest isnt responsible for any problems Mr R might 
have had receiving  his post. I thought  NatWest  could  reasonably  Mr R to look at the letters  it 
sent him.
In the circumstances, I thought, on the balance of probabilities, that NatWest acted to warn
Mr R that his account would become inoperable from 30 April 2017.
Mr R argued that NatWest shouldve been  done more to get the information it needed,
Ref: DRN59246804and that NatWest shouldnt have made his account  inoperable.  He asked why NatWest  
didnt phone him to sort the matter  out, and why it didnt use the online programme
to translate Mr Rs daughters marriage  certificate before it took this action, as the marriage
certificate contained information NatWest  wanted.
I thought it wouldve been helpful for NatWest  to have phoned Mr R about  the need  for 
identification before it put the no operations marker  on Mr Rs account  in early May 2017. 
However, I said that NatWest wasnt required to phone  him. I understood why it sent Mr R a 
formal letter  about  this matter. 
I thought NatWest couldve done  more  to resolve  the identification issue  with Mr R in early
2017. I said that because it didnt tell him about  the ongoing need for identification  when he
complained about the non-payment  of the January 2017 cheque in late January/early
February 2017. Instead NatWest gave inconsistent explanations about why the cheque
wasnt paid. I thought this was a missed opportunity on NatWests part, and I understood 
why Mr R didnt think there was an ongoing issue with his account after the matter of the 
unpaid January 2017 cheque was resolved. However, I was persuaded that NatWest  sent 
the 1 March 2017 letter to him, so I cant say that NatWest failed to warn  him that his 
account would be made inoperable from 30 April 2017.
Mr R also argued that the decision to put the no operations marker  on his account 
shouldnt have been taken by NatWests  staff outside of the UK. He questioned  whether 
NatWest had authority  to outsource such a decision.
I said that Im not a regulator, so it isnt for me to comment on the way that NatWest 
operates its business, including its use of staff outside the UK. It isnt for me to punish a 
business for mistakes, or to decide whether NatWest breached the or regulations  when its 
used staff outside the UK in connection  with Mr Rs account. In any event, I said there is no 
suggestion that NatWest hasnt  taken  responsibility, or is not liable, for the actions taken  by 
its staff outside of the UK.
Taking the matter  as a whole, I concluded that NatWest was entitled to put the no 
operations marker on Mr Rs account in early  May 2017. So I didnt think it would be fair and 
reasonable for me to require NatWest to pay Mr R £250 for each of the May 2017 payments 
that werent paid as a result of the no operations  marker being  put on his account,  despite 
the inconvenience Mr R has told us he was caused.
NatWest responded  to the provisional  decision to say that it was happy with it and had 
nothing to add.
Mr R provided  more  detail  about  the complaint to compliment what  I said in my provisional 
decision. He seemed to broadly accept what I said in my provisional  decision. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Ive also considered what NatWest and Mr R said in response to my provisional decision.
NatWest accepted my provisional decision and had nothing to add to it. 
Ref: DRN59246805Mr R seemed to accept what I said in my provisional  decision too. He responded by 
providing me with more  detail about  what had happened, largely obtained from the subject 
access request he had made. Amongst other  things  he pointed out where information was 
missing. He said the complaint was a know  your customer (KYC) complaint, not a money 
laundering one. Mr R also reiterated  that he wasnt told why the block had removed from his 
account after the January payment wasnt made,  that he was given  conflicting  and confusing 
information, and that he wasnt warned that his account could be re-blocked.
Mr R also asked how the letters I referred  to in my provisional decision were  sent.  As I said 
in my provisional decision,  I could see that the two December 2016 letters were issued to 
Mr R given the information NatWest has provided.  NatWests systems notes dont suggest 
that these letters were issued by email.  NatWest says these letters  were  sent by post.  The 
information I have  been provided  with suggests  thats the case.  I didnt have systems 
records from NatWest to demonstrate the March 2017 letter was sent to him, but I was 
persuaded it was sent to Mr R for the reasons set out in my provisional  decision.
I appreciate that Mr R is likely to remain disappointed by the decision I have reached. 
However, neither  Mr R nor NatWest has raised  anything in their response  to my provisional 
decision that has caused me to change my mind.   So I remain  of the view set out in my 
provisional decision that NatWest should  resolve  this complaint by paying Mr R the £250 it 
has offered him. My reasons are the same as set my provisional decision.
my final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should  pay Mr R the £250 it has 
offered to resolve  this complaint, if it has not done so already.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 September  2020.
