K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs B complain  that on their application  for additional  lending in 2006,  their 
mortgagee National Westminster Bank Plc gave them no option save  an expensive offset 
mortgage which has cost them  £70,000.00 being the difference  between  the repayments  on 
the offset mortgage and their current mortgage.
To resolve  their complaint  they want NatWest to pay them  compensation of £70,000.00.
background
Mr and Mrs B took a NatWest offset  flexible mortgage in 2006. They say that on visiting  their 
NatWest Branch in 2017  they were told they had overpaid by £70,000.00 and should change  
their mortgage product  immediately. They did this in May 2017 and the payments  reduced 
from £1,183.00  per month to £506.25  with no change  in the loan amount or the term.
On their complaint  to NatWest it said that in August 2006, they had a Foundations mortgage  
with NatWest. This was a flexible mortgage, and they had an interest-only facility of 
£150,000, with a balance  at the time of around £72,000.
They wanted  to increase  their facility to £200,000, and were  recommended  an offset 
mortgage product  with a term of 14 years and a facility of £200,000 interest-only.  This 
product began on 4 December  2006,  and Mr and Mrs B used the facility  to draw down the 
available funds gradually over the following 18 months. By August 2008, the balance  was 
just under the £200,000  available.
At this point they applied to extend the facility to £250,000 on the same offset mortgage 
product. This was completed on 26 August 2008, and over the following two years they drew 
down the remaining funds, until the balance  reached  £248,000  in July 2010.
NatWest acknowledged  that Mr and Mrs B could have  applied to extend  the facility  on their 
existing Foundations  mortgage in 2006. NatWest  had no documentation from that time but if 
they were told that they needed to move to an offset mortgage to apply for the increased 
facility, this would have been unsuitable  advice.
With no further evidence  available, NatWest upheld their concerns, because  in 2006 they 
could have applied  for a facility increase to £200,000 on their existing  Foundations 
mortgage.
However when they requested a further facility increase to £250,000 in August 2008,  this 
would have been declined if theyd been  on the Foundations mortgage. That product had 
been closed to new customers for several  years, and from June 2008 no further  borrowing or 
facility increases were  available to existing customers. They would have had to apply to 
switch to a different mortgage product if they wanted  further funds.
The offset mortgage would have been  the suitable  recommendation  at that point. 
Mr and Mrs B wanted an increased  facility  to draw upon gradually whilst they completed 
home improvements, and the offset mortgage  provided this. It was the only product NatWest 
had available  at the time with a flexible drawdown  facility and which  allowed customers to 
apply for further  borrowing.
Ref: DRN49894892So, whilst upholding Mr and Mrs Bs concerns that in 2006 they were wrongly advised to 
switch to an offset, NatWest was capping its calculations  at 26 August 2008.  At this point, 
Mr and Mrs B would have been  informed that they could  no longer apply for a further  facility  
increase on their Foundations mortgage, and would have looked to switch  to the offset 
mortgage to allow them to flexibly draw down the required  funds for their home 
improvements.
NatWest had calculated  what the balance would  have been on Mr and Mrs Bs mortgage at 
26 August 2008,  if they had made identical payments and drawdowns, but had remained on 
the Foundations product  until this point. It had also checked what fees they paid in 2006,  and 
compared those  to the fees which would have applied in 2008. 
Based on those calculations NatWest offered  to pay Mr and Mrs B compensation of £544. It 
also made a payment to them of £300 as an apology  for the time it had taken to investigate 
their complaint. NatWest  provided a separate calculation showing how the £544 was arrived  
at.
Mr and Mrs B werent happy  with this and brought their complaint to this service, but our 
investigator didnt  recommend it be upheld. He said that from December 2006 Mr and Mrs B 
were given an offset mortgage  as they wanted to increase their facility to borrow £200,000. 
In August  2008  they wanted  to extend  the facility again up to £250,000.
NatWest had agreed they were given unsuitable advice in 2006 when they switched from 
their existing product  to an offset mortgage. But if theyd  stayed  on the existing product, their 
application for an increased  facility in 2008  would have  been declined as the existing product 
was no longer available at that time. They wanted  an increased facility  to draw upon  
gradually whilst they completed home improvements and the offset  mortgage  provided this.
The investigator thought NatWests offer of £844 was fair and reasonable, as it put 
Mr and Mrs B in the position  they would have  been  in before taking out the offset mortgage.
Mr and Mrs B didnt  agree and asked for their complaint to be referred  to an ombudsman.  
They said that at the time they took out the offset mortgage, NatWest said their existing 
mortgage was no longer  available. It gave them no alternative to the offset mortgage, which  
had proved unsuitable. 
They said this advice  was subsequently refuted by a NatWest mortgage adviser who 
recommended they switch  to an alternative product, and they followed his advice. This 
wasnt a Foundations  mortgage but a fixed rate mortgage.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest hasnt suggested that the product subsequently recommended by its adviser  in 
2017 was a Foundations mortgage. That was the product Mr and Mrs B had before they 
made the change  to an offset mortgage  on 4 December 2006  in order  to increase their 
facility.
However that change  wasnt  necessary. They didnt need or want  an offset mortgage. They 
could have stayed  on the Foundations mortgage and still increased the facility. As from 
Ref: DRN498948934 December 2006 they were on an unsuitable  mortgage owing to wrong advice from 
NatWest.
NatWest admits that, but Mr and Mrs B havent  answered the point which  NatWest makes  in 
its defence.
In 2008 they wanted  to increase the facility  again.  But if theyd stayed on the Foundations 
mortgage they wouldnt have been able to do that. The Foundations mortgage had been  
closed to new customers for several years and no further borrowing or facility increases 
were available to existing customers. 
Fortunately they were  able to do it, because they were  on the offset mortgage not the 
Foundations mortgage. So in 2008  the mortgage  which had been unsuitable for them from 
2006 became  suitable for them. It was the only product NatWest had available  at the time 
with a flexible  drawdown facility and which allowed customers to apply for further  borrowing.
So NatWest  says Mr and Mrs B were on the wrong mortgage product for two years  from 
2006 to 2008. And it offers to pay compensation on that basis.  That seems  to me to be 
correct.
Mr and Mrs B will say that in that case, why did the product change they made in May 2017 
substantially reduce their monthly payments? The answer to that is that they changed from a 
variable rate product to a much lower fixed rate product. NatWest says they moved from a 
rate of 4% to a tracker  rate of base rate + 1.34% i.e. a total of 1.59%.
They could have  done that much  sooner than 2017. But that has nothing to do with the 
advice given by NatWest in 2006. 
While it has no bearing on Mr and Mrs Bs complaint, it might  help if I add that when a lender 
issues a new interest  rate product,  it isnt under a duty to examine the accounts  of all its 
existing customers and notify each customer who might benefit  from the new product. Any 
customer is able to contact the lender to discuss possible rate switches  at any time.  But its 
up to the customer  to take the initiative.
my final decision
NatWest has already paid £300.00  and offered to pay a further £544.00  to settle  the 
complaint and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
So my decision is that National Westminster Bank  Plc should  pay Mr and Mrs B £544.00.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision  before  8 November 2019.
