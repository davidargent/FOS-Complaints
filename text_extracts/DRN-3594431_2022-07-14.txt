The complaint
Mr A complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua Loans (NewDay) reported arrears and 
late payments on his credit file even though hed maintained payments under an agreed 
payment plan.   
What happened
Mr A applied for and was granted a loan with NewDay which was opened in January 2019. 
The loan agreement required 35 repayments of £242.60 followed by a final repayment of 
£242.50.
Mr A maintained his contractual repayments up to February 2020 when he contacted 
NewDay. He said he was experiencing financial difficulties and asked for support from them 
until he could resolve his situation. NewDay reviewed Mr As income and expenditure and 
agreed a temporary payment plan of £27.90 per month.
Having maintained payments under the payment plan, Mr A later identified and thought that 
NewDay had reported the position on his loan incorrectly to the credit reference agencies. 
He was also unhappy with the service received from NewDay in trying to resolve the 
situation. So, in September 2020 Mr A complained to NewDay.
NewDay responded to Mr As complaint in October 2020. They apologised for the service 
hed received from them and offered a credit of £70 to cover the trouble and upset caused. 
But NewDay didnt agree theyd done anything wrong when they reported the arrears that 
had accrued on his loan. They also said they wouldnt be able to remove late makers 
reported. They said that when the payment plan was agreed, theyd told him what would be 
reported.
In November 2020, Mr A complained to NewDay again. He didnt agree that the information 
reported on his credit file by NewDay was correct and they shouldnt have reported missed 
payments from September 2020. NewDay agreed to investigate further.
NewDay responded to Mr A in December 2020. They said theyd identified a technical 
problem with the information reported between March and September 2020. They 
apologised and offered a further £80 to cover the trouble and upset caused. NewDay 
confirmed again that Mr A had been told that missed payments would be reported on his 
credit file when they agreed the payment plan in February 2020. They also said he was told 
that the payment plan was for an amount less than his contractual repayment and so arrears 
would also be reported.
Mr A didnt agree with NewDays findings. He thought NewDay should remove the late 
payments and arrears reported as hed made all the payments agreed under the payment 
plan. So, he referred his complaint to this service.
Having considered all the evidence and information, our investigator thought NewDay hadnt 
acted fairly. Our investigator thought NewDay should amend the information theyd reported 
to show an arrangement was in place and should remove any missed payments and defaults 
added after that point.
NewDay didnt agree with our investigators findings. They insisted that the information 
reported was accurate and complied with their email to Mr A in March 2020 which confirmed 
the payment arrangement. They also said that a further arrangement was agreed in 
February 2021 for payments of £349.34 to ensure the accumulated arrears on Mr As loan 
would be repaid. But Mr A didnt maintain those payments, resulting in a default notice being 
issued.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Mr As complaint has been passed to me to consider. 
I reached a different outcome to that of our investigator. Because of that, I issued a 
provisional decision on 15 June 2022  giving both Mr A and NewDay the opportunity to 
respond to my findings below before I reached a final decision.
In my provisional decision, I said:
In their response letters to Mr As complaints, NewDay accepted that he didnt 
receive the expected level of service. Theyd also identified that theyd incorrectly 
reported information on Mr As credit file between March and September 2020. 
NewDay paid a total of £150 and corrected the information recorded. This is what I 
would expect, and the compensation paid does feel fair here. So, I shant consider 
these aspects further.
But Mr A is unhappy with the information that remains on his credit file. Our 
investigator referred to the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) Principles for the 
Reporting of Arrears, Arrangements and Defaults at Credit Reference Agencies 
(PRAAD). These principles set out the circumstances under which a business should 
report information on an individuals credit file together with the information required. 
Adhering accurately to those principles is important because it ensures that both 
existing and prospective lenders can see how an individual has managed their credit 
historically.
The payment arrangement agreed between NewDay and Mr A was a temporary one, 
to provide time for Mr As financial circumstances to improve. Ultimately, it was 
agreed for a total of six months and confirmed by NewDay in an email on 2 March 
2020. That email said, Well let Credit Reference Agencies know about this payment 
arrangement. As the amount you will now pay each month is lower than your 
contractual monthly payment, the arrears on your account will continue to increase 
and were required to send you notices relating to your arrears. We may also send 
you a Default Notice and a notice of our intention to register a default with Credit 
Reference Agencies.
Principal 3 of PRAAD says, Should a temporary reduction in the payment amount be 
jointly agreed between you and your lender, this arrangement will be recorded at the 
CRAs. It goes on to say, Depending on the period and amount of the arrangement, 
arrears may continue to be reportedFor such accounts arrears may continue to be 
calculated in accordance with the contracted terms.
The exception is where theres a permanent change in the payment terms which 
would normally be subject to a new agreement. Here, as long as the revised terms 
are complied with, arrears will not accrue further or be shown.
As I mentioned above, Ms As arrangement with NewDay was a temporary one. So, 
under the ICOs principles, NewDay were right to report any unpaid difference 
between the contractual repayment and the arrangement as unpaid arrears. So, 
while I realise Mr A will be disappointed, I cant reasonably say that NewDay made a 
mistake here.
In February 2021, a new arrangement was agreed whereby Mr A would pay his 
contractual monthly repayments of £242.60 together with an additional £106.74 each 
month. The additional amount was to address the arrears that had accumulated 
during the original reduced payment arrangement. But NewDay have said that Mr A 
didnt maintain repayments under this arrangement, so a default notice was issued.Mr A says that he isnt happy with NewDays decision to issue a default notice. But 
this doesnt form part of his original complaint. So, as NewDay havent addressed 
this within their response letters to him, Im unable to consider this aspect further. In 
the event that Mr A remains unhappy, he should first direct his complaint to NewDay 
to consider.
I appreciate that Mr A will undoubtedly have been very worried about his financial 
situation. Particularly given the impact upon his personal credit file. But having 
considered all of the information and guidance available, I dont think NewDay need 
to do anything more here.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision, I asked both parties to respond with any new information or 
comments they wanted me to consider. 
NewDay confirmed they accept the findings within my provisional decision and have nothing 
further to add. Despite a follow up request from this service, Mr A hasnt responded to my 
provisional decision.
As Ive not been provided with any additional comments or information, I have no reason to 
vary from my original findings. So, my final decision remains the same.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2022.
