K821x#15complaint
Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr H had 15 payday loans and one FlexCredit loan facility  from QuickQuid between 
March 2010 and September 2014. His complaint  is about the loans he took out from 
May 2012 (loan 11) onwards  which includes the FlexCredit facility.
An adjudicator considered  the complaint and thought it should be upheld. He didnt think 
QuickQuid was right to have approved any of the loans granted on or after 2 May 2012. 
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
Ref: DRN63136062the case. This is because the OFT defined sustainable as being without undue  difficulties 
and in particular  the customer should  be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
By the time of loan 11 Mr H had been  borrowing without  substantial breaks between loans 
for about two years. Given how long Mr H had been borrowing for (and the other  relevant  
factors, like the size of the loans and the length  of the gaps between them) Ive focussed 
primarily on QuickQuids lending history  with Mr H, with a view to seeing  if there  was a point 
at which  QuickQuid should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point had been reached  
by May 2012. I say this because:
Up to this point Mr H had been taking  out new loans within  days or weeks  of settling 
a previous one. So QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more likely than not that 
Mr H was having to borrow regularly to fill a persistent hole in his finances and that 
his indebtedness  was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid. The 
FlexCredit account (itself a long-term agreement)  was taken out around 30 months 
after Mr Hs first loan  and allowed him to borrow more. Mr H had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to QuickQuid over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr H lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from May 2012 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Hs ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN63136063Ive taken into account QuickQuids comments when it responded to the adjudicator. The 
adjudicator noted  that Mr Hs bank statements demonstrated significant expenditure on 
gambling and that QuickQuid  wouldve  been aware of this had it carried out proportionate 
checks - so it wouldnt have lent to Mr H. QuickQuid didnt accept it needed to obtain 
information such as bank statements and didnt think the gambling figures provided were  
problematic given Mr Hs income.
Ive placed less weight on proportionate  pounds and pence checks  as Ive explained 
above, I dont  think this is the key issue. But I agree that a proportionate review  of Mr Hs 
expenditure in around May 2012 wouldve likely revealed both significant  expenditure on 
gambling, as well as frequent  use of short-term loans to supplement income.  For example in 
April 2012 Mr H borrows about £2,500 from seven lenders.  At this time Mr H declared net 
monthly income to QuickQuid of £1,540  although I accept it may have been higher than 
this. Nonetheless,  I agree a proportionate  review of Mr Hs circumstances wouldve also 
bought to QuickQuids attention that further lending after May 2012 wouldve been  
unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
Im therefore  upholding the complaint  about the loans granted from May 2012  onwards.
putting things right
QuickQuid should:
refund  the interest and charges Mr H paid from May 2012 onwards
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when the interest and charges 
were paid until the date of settlement
remove the loans  approved from May 2012 onwards from Mr Hs credit history  (if 
they still appear)
QuickQuid may deduct any principal  amount  previously written off from what it owes Mr H.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr H a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Hs complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps 
set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 September 2019.
