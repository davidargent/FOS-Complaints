K820x#14complaint
Ms J is unhappy with the interest shes been charged when she settled her conditional sale 
agreement with Moneybarn No. 1 Limited.
background
In May 2017, Ms J was supplied with a car through a conditional sale agreement  with 
Moneybarn. The agreement was for £13,490  over 60 months  at an interest rate of 28.9%. 
Monthly repayments were  £404.33 and the total amount payable under the agreement was 
£23,855.47.
Ms J asked Moneybarn if she could settle the agreement early,  and Moneybarn provided an 
early settlement figure.  Ms J complained that Moneybarn  were charging an excessive 
amount of interest  on the settlement amount. Moneybarn didnt agree, so Ms J brought  her 
complaint to us for investigation.
Our investigator said the Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations 2004 tells lenders 
how to calculate  the settlement figure, so its fair for borrowers. He said hes reviewed  the 
settlement calculation and he thought this was correct and in line with the regulations.  So he 
didnt think Moneybarn needed to do anything more.
Ms J didnt agree with the investigator. She thought the settlement figure was £1,250  more  
than it shouldve been. So shes asked for an ombudsman  to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  In considering this complaint Ive had 
regard to the relevant law and regulations; as well as any regulators rules,  guidance and 
standards, and codes  of practice.  
An early  settlement figure is based on the total amount payable, less any payments already 
made. The remaining  sum may then be reduced  by an interest rebate, to give the final 
settlement figure. Interest  rebates are calculated by a mathematical  formula  set out in the 
Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations  2004 and is designed to protect  borrowers 
from paying more  than they need  to. 
Ive seen a copy  of the agreement Ms J signed  on 29 May 2017. This explains that total 
amount payable under the agreement; that Ms J needed to provide Moneybarn with written  
notice of her intent to repay the agreement  early; and that payment needed  to be made 
within 28 days. It also explains  a rebate  of interest may be due.
In their final response letter, Moneybarn explained that, on early  repayment, theyre entitled 
to charge interest for the 28-day notice period, plus an additional month deferment. Apart 
from this, they would rebate the customer any future finance  charges.  Moneybarn  have 
also explained that interest rebates  only apply  to early settlement, and not to lump sum 
payments that dont  clear the outstanding balance.
Ref: DRN41956562From reviewing her comments, it seems as if Ms J may have based  what she thinks  is the 
correct settlement figure on a straight  line interest calculation  where  the amount of 
interest charged each  month is exactly the same  over the full term of the agreement.  But this 
isnt the case.  The total interest charged under the agreement isnt applied equally  
because the interest  is calculated  on the outstanding amount, the interest proportion  of each 
payment varies, its higher on the earlier  payments and lower  on the later payments.
For example, the July 2017 payment included £288.07 interest,  whereas  the payment due in 
September 2020 only included £103.02  interest.
While Ms J had asked  Moneybarn for earlier settlement figures, Ive seen she asked for an 
early settlement figure  on 26 August 2020.  This said Ms J needed to pay £4,932.66 to clear 
the agreement  early. And Ms J paid this to Moneybarn on 2 September  2020.  Moneybarn 
then rebated Ms Js interest and closed the account.
At the time Ms J repaid the agreement,  she shouldve paid Moneybarn  a total of £16,035.60 
(£7,590.32 capital  and £8,445.28 interest).  But she actually  paid them £16,925.60 - £890  
more. Which meant she still owed Moneybarn £6,929.87  under  the original agreement. 
On 3 September 2020, Ms J paid Moneybarn £4,932.66 to settle the agreement,  which 
meant shed received a total interest  rebate of £1,997.21 - £540.39 in September  2020  and 
£1,456.82 in February 2019 (relating to an earlier lump sum partial repayment, even though 
Moneybarn werent  obliged to rebate the interest  at this point). 
Based on what Ive seen  and been  able to calculate, Im satisfied that the interest rebates 
Ms J received were  in line with what she was entitled to under the formula laid out in the 
Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations  2004. So I wont be asking Moneybarn to 
apply a further interest rebate to this account, or to refund  Ms J any of the settlement figure 
she paid in September 2020.
Ive also seen that, in her comments  on the investigators view,  Ms J has said this agreement 
wasnt affordable because of the rate or interest being charged, because the interest is front  
loaded, and because  the total interest charged was more than the amount  borrowed.
Ive not seen that shes raised this complaint with Moneybarn. And were unable  to deal with 
a complaint unless  the financial business  has had the opportunity  to consider  it first. So I 
wont comment on this particular point  within this decision.
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above I dont uphold Ms Js complaint against Moneybarn  No. 1 
Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 April 2021.
