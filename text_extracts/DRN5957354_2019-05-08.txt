K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs S complain  that Co-operative Bank plc (trading as Britannia) mis-sold them  a 
mortgage payment  protection insurance (MPPI) policy.
background
This complaint is about a monthly  premium MPPI policy taken out by Mr and Mrs S in 2007  
with a mortgage. The policy covered them both against unemployment, accidents and 
sickness. The first 6 months of premiums  of the PPI policy was free.
Mr and Mrs S say Britannia mis-sold the policy. They say they were led to believe to qualify 
for the mortgage  they had to also take PPI.
Our adjudicator did not uphold the complaint.  Mr and Mrs S disagreed  with the adjudicators 
opinion so the complaint has been  passed  to me.
 
my findings
Ive considered all of the available  evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr and Mrs Ss case.  
I have decided to not uphold Mr and Mrs Ss complaint, for the following reasons:
I cant be sure how the policy was presented to Mr and Mrs S during the meeting when it 
was sold to them by an advisor.  But Ive looked  at what  Mr and Mrs S have said and also 
the sales documentation from that time.
Mr and Mrs S say they were led to believe they had to have PPI. But based  on what  I 
know of how Britannia sold policies at that time,  I think they were given a choice to have 
it. 
I have come to this conclusion because the sales documentation I do have persuades  
me that the policy  was presented as optional. Britannia has provided a separate MPPI 
application form that would suggest  to me that Mr and Mrs S were  most likely given a 
choice by the advisor and they signed  the separate MPPI form agreeing to have it. 
Although I do have regard for what Mr and Mrs S have said,  recollections  do fade over 
time. Based on the documentation I have  seen, I am persuaded they were  given a 
choice during the meeting. 
Moving on I need to decide whether or not Mr and Mrs S were  given advice to have the 
PPI policy or not. If they were, Britannia would have needed to ensure the policy  was 
suitable for their needs.
I cant be sure if Mr and Mrs S were advised  to have  the PPI policy  but I dont need to 
consider this as I think the policy was suitable for Mr and Mrs S anyway, based on what 
Ive seen of their circumstances at the time. Mr S says he had reasonable sick pay with 
his employer (at least 3 months pay) and Mrs S would have most likely had sick pay as 
well but I consider the policy  would have been  useful in any extended period of sickness. 
Ref: DRN59573542They both could have  made a claim in addition to using the provisions they held at that 
time. I am persuaded  they would have found the benefit provided useful if they needed it. 
I also couldnt find anything else within  the policy terms that would have made  it 
unsuitable for them such as a restrictive  or significant term.
Britannia has provided some information  about the costs relating to the MPPI that         
Mr and Mrs S took out and although  I dont know for sure if these were  disclosed clearly, 
I dont think it would  have made  any difference to the choice Mr and Mrs S made even if 
it had for the reasons I have already  given.  The policy was reasonably priced compared  
to similar  policies available at the time and to the monthly  mortgage  repayment and      
Mr and Mrs S could  have cancelled the MPPI if it did become unaffordable.
I know this will come as a disappointment to Mr and Mrs S, but in conclusion I do not uphold  
their complaint for the reasons that I have given.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I do not uphold Mr and Mrs Ss complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision  before  8 June 2019.
