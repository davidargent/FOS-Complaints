The complaint
Mr H complains that after he took out a credit card with NewDay Ltd, it repeatedly increased
his credit limit. He said that none of this lending was affordable for him, and he got into
financial difficulties.
 
What happened
Mr H said he took out a card with NewDay, with a £900 credit limit. Over the course of a
year, NewDay increased this limit to £5,300 without asking him for any more information on
his financial situation.
Mr H said he had a relatively modest income, so what NewDay lent him was about half his
annual salary, and he could never have paid it back. He struggled to pay for a while, even
taking cash from the card to cover the monthly payments. Then he contacted NewDay.
The card account was closed in September 2019 and the debt was defaulted in late 2019.
Mr H said that he wanted NewDay to write this debt off.
NewDay said that it initially lent Mr H £900, when he said he had an income of £11,500, no
negative marks on his credit file, and other debts of only £100.
It offered him credit increases as follows 
to £1,800 in a letter of 6 June 2018, taking effect 13 July 2018.
to £3,000 in a letter of 8 October 2018, taking effect on 16 November 2018
to £5,300 a letter of 6 February 2019, taking effect on 13 March 2019.
NewDay didnt think it had done anything wrong. It said that Mr H had stayed under his credit
limit, and had paid on time. He couldve turned down these increases, but didnt.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld in part. He thought that the original
lending decision, and the two first limit increases, were reasonable. But he said that the last
increase was different.
Mr Hs overall credit card borrowing had increased from £55 in November 2018 to over
£10,000 in December 2018. At the same time, his usage of his card increased drastically,
and he started regularly using his card to withdraw cash, which is a very expensive way to
borrow.
Our investigator didnt think it was reasonable for NewDay to make the last increase to
Mr Hs limit on the basis of what it knew, and the relatively limited amount of personal and
financial information it held on him. He said NewDay should pay back all the interest and
charges that Mr H wouldnt have had to pay if this increase hadnt been made. And he said
NewDay should pay Mr H £50 in compensation.
NewDay didnt agree. It said that Mr Hs balance did increase significantly, from £177.98 in
November 2018, to £3,254.31 in March 2019. But some customers use their credit card for
everyday use, so their spend is concentrated in one place.
NewDay said that without knowing what Mr Hs cash withdrawals were for, it couldnt say
they are an indicator of financial difficulties.
NewDay said that the total balance (which our investigator said had increased from £55.00
in November 2018, to £10,462 in December 2018) was a snapshot of the borrowing
information available from the credit reference agency. So it included all borrowing, such as
loans and overdrafts. Mr H might have taken out a loan, perhaps even to pay off his card.
NewDay thought it had enough information to make a decision on Mr Hs limit increase. It
said it had acted in line with the relevant rules.
Our investigator reviewed this case, but he didnt change his mind. He said NewDay
shouldve considered all the information it had on Mr H, together, including that his lending
balance had increased, and he was making regular use of cash withdrawals. NewDay
shouldve been aware that if Mr Hs borrowing had increased, then whatever the form of
lending, Mr H would have to make repayments towards that lending. And all from a relatively
modest income.
Our investigator still thought that NewDay didnt have enough information to decide to make
this last, largest increase. And he thought that if NewDay had asked further questions, it
wouldve been unlikely to make the last increase.
NewDay said that Mr H didnt fall behind with his payments until July 2019, so the limit
increase was affordable until then. NewDay thought Mr H had got into financial difficulties in
July 2019, which was when he told NewDay he had moved departments at work and was
earning less money. NewDay said Mr H had told it that his debt was unaffordable due to a
change in his financial circumstances, not as a result of lending decisions made by NewDay.
And it thought that he had £900 a month in disposable income when the credit limit
increases took place.
NewDay still didnt think this complaint should be upheld.
Our investigator didnt change his mind either. He said that the system NewDay was using to
indicate Mr Hs disposable income said that he had the same amount of disposable income
when his overall borrowing was £50 and when it jumped to over £12,000. Because NewDay
hadnt agreed with him, he passed this case to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold it 
in part. This is what I said then: 
Like our investigator, I dont think that it was clear, when NewDay made the original 
lending to Mr H, or when it made either of the first two limit increases on his card, that 
this lending would not be responsible. The original lending was for a small amount, 
when Mr Hs credit file was in good order. And Mr Hs card had been relatively well 
managed prior to the first two limit increases.
But, like our investigator, I think something had clearly changed before the third credit 
limit increase was offered. Mr H was making regular use of cash advances, his 
overall repayment levels on this card had dropped against a very significantly higher 
monthly balance, and his overall indebtness had increased markedly.
I note that the rules on lending require NewDay to make a decision based on 
proportionate data. And, like our investigator, I dont think that making a decision in these changed circumstances, without seeking some information from Mr H on why 
things looked so different, was a robust form of decision making. I also think that it 
was unlikely that, if NewDay had asked further questions of Mr H, it wouldve been 
content to offer this third limit increase.
NewDay has argued strongly that it did nothing wrong. It also says it thinks Mr H 
could afford this increase when it was made, and he just got into trouble later. But I 
dont agree.
Mr H has told us that one of the reasons he was taking cash advances was to cover 
the monthly payment on the card. This limit increase took effect in March 2019, and I 
can see large cash advances were taken, in the month before and in March, before 
the monthly payments were due. These advances were larger than the payments Mr 
H then made.
So I think that the signs were there already that Mr H was starting to have financial
difficulties when this third limit increase was made, and this third increase should 
probably not have been made at all. It should certainly not have been made without 
more information to explain why things had changed.
For those reasons, I think that NewDay should do something to make up for whats 
gone wrong.
Mr H said he wanted NewDay to write off his whole debt. But I dont think thats 
reasonable.
Some of this lending was not clearly irresponsible. And Mr H did have, and 
presumably spend, the money NewDay lent him. It would be quite unusual for our 
service to say he didnt have to pay this back, and here, I dont think it would be fair 
to both sides for me to say that.
But I do think NewDay should refund onto Mr Hs debt any interest, fees or charges 
on borrowing over the old limit of £3,000. If NewDay needs to buy this debt back to 
do this, then it should do so.
I do think Mr H was, unfortunately, likely to have had financial difficulties anyway, 
even if this extra lending hadnt been made. But I also think that what NewDay did, 
by making this lending, made things worse. So I think NewDay should pay Mr H £100 
in compensation, to make up for its part in what has gone wrong.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied, and said they had nothing to add.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the award I originally proposed.  My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd must refund onto Mr Hs debt any interest, fees or 
charges on borrowing over his old limit of £3,000. If NewDay Ltd needs to buy this debt back 
to do this, then it should do so. And NewDay Ltd must pay Mr H £100 in compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 September 2021.
