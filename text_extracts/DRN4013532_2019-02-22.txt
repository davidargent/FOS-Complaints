K820x#14complaint
Mrs A complains that Curo  Transatlantic Limited,  trading as WageDayAdvance, was wrong 
to give her a loan that she couldnt afford to repay.
background
In June 2017 Mrs A borrowed  £500  from WageDayAdvance to be repaid in four monthly  
instalments of £203.55. Mrs A says that WageDayAdvance failed to carry out proper checks 
and if it had done so it would have  seen the loan wasnt affordable and her credit history  was 
poor. She hasnt been able to repay the loan.
The adjudicator didnt think this complaint should  be upheld. He thought  the checks  
WageDayAdvance had done  before approving the loan went  far enough and it wasnt wrong 
to lend to Mrs A at the time.
Mrs A didnt agree. She said, in summary,  that if WageDayAdvance  had checked  her credit 
file properly it would have seen that it was very poor so it shouldnt  have given her a loan.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
WageDayAdvance was required to lend responsibly. Before agreeing to lend to Mrs A, it had 
to check that she could afford to make the repayments without it adversely impacting on her 
financial situation. It had to gather enough  information so that it could make an informed 
decision on the lending.  
The guidance and rules dont set out compulsory checks but they do list a number of things  
a lender might wish to take into account before agreeing  to lend. But any checks need  to be 
proportionate and should take into account a number of things, including  things such  as how 
much is being lent and when whats being  borrowed is due to be repaid.
Mrs A was given a loan where there  was an expectation shed repay what  shed  borrowed 
plus the interest due over four monthly  repayments  of £203.55. As a result, the checks  
WageDayAdvance carried  out had to provide enough  for it to be able to understand whether 
Mrs A could afford to make all of these payments when they fell due. 
WageDayAdvance has told us about the checks it did before lending to Mrs A. It asked her 
for details  of her income, and her normal expenditure, before agreeing the loan.  And it 
gathered information  on Mrs As circumstances from a credit  reference agency. 
From what  I have  seen, the credit  check results that WageDayAdvance received didnt show 
Mrs A had any dependency on short term lending or other problems with Mrs As finances 
such as bankruptcy  or county court judgements. It did show  that Mrs A had had some 
defaults, with the most recent just one month before  she requested  the loan from 
WageDayAdvance. But it also showed  that she had seven accounts that were paid up to 
date. Im satisfied WageDayAdvance  did consider  Mrs As credit history  before it agreed to 
lend.
Ref: DRN40135322WageDayAdvance says that it checked  Mrs As income when she asked for the loan and 
she was earning  £2,065  per month. It checked her employment status.  It asked about her 
normal monthly expenditure and regular financial commitments,  which  she said totalled 
£580. From  this it found that she had a disposable monthly income  of more than £1,400. 
Based on this information WageDayAdvance concluded that Mrs A could afford  the monthly 
repayments of £203.55.
This was Mrs As first loan from WageDayAdvance.  Given the size of the loan in relation to 
her income, despite the default  showing on her credit  file, I think  the checks  
WageDayAdvance did were proportionate. I dont think the credit  check results should  have 
caused it to think  it needed to do any more  or that it would have prevented it from lending to 
Mrs A. WageDayAdvance offers loans to borrowers  with a poor credit history.  The checks  it 
did showed the loan was affordable so I think  its decision to lend was reasonable.
I understand that Mrs A still has an outstanding debt and I would urge her to contact 
WageDayAdvance to agree an acceptable repayment plan. I would also remind 
WageDayAdvance that it has an ongoing  duty to treat someone  in financial difficulty 
positively and sympathetically.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 March  2019.
