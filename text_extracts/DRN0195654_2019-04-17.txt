K821x#15complaint
Mr A thinks  that Sunny Marketing Ltd (trading as 100pounds) lent him a number of payday  
loans which  it ought to have known he would  struggle to repay.  
background
Mr A took out five loans with 100pounds, as follows:
Loan Date of loanAmount borrowed
Date of 
repaymentAmount repaid
1 31 December 2014 £100 9 January 2015£115 (including £5 
application fee)
2 22 January 2015 £200 10 February 2015 £232
3 10 February 2015 £300 10 March 2015 £372
4 11 March 2015 £300 28 March 2015 £372
5 1 April 2015 £300 19 April 2015 £372
Mr A believes that the credit checks 100pounds  completed were insufficient and should have 
picked up that he was in financial distress. He says it was wrong for 100pounds to lend to 
him.
100pounds has provided fairly limited responses to the complaint, both in its reply  to Mr A 
and in its submissions  to this service.  
In summary,  it says that it carried out credit  checks on Mr A through a third party credit 
reference agency. 100pounds does  not have the full reports it received as part of its 
checking process but it says Mr As credit  score was over the threshold that its credit 
reference agency recommended. 100pounds  also points out that all of Mr As loans were 
repaid on time.
One of our adjudicators looked  into this complaint  and concluded that the checks that 
100pounds completed for the first loan (£100 taken on 31 December 2014) went  far enough. 
But she didnt think its checks were adequate on any of Mr As other  loans. And she thought 
that if 100pounds had conducted  adequate  checks,  it would  have known that Mr A couldnt 
have afforded  these  loans.
100pounds has not disagreed with those findings,  but they have asked some questions  
about the redress recommended by our adjudicator, which have been answered. As it hasnt 
settled the complaint, the complaint has been  passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  or guidance,  and what I consider to be good industry practice at the 
time.
100pounds hasnt  disagreed with any of the findings of our adjudicator  in terms of the 
affordability of the loans.  The only point  raised in response  to the adjudicators  view was the 
need to deduct tax from the 8% simple  interest  awarded. Even  so, Ive reviewed the 
adjudicators findings  on affordability  and I find I agree with her assessment.
Ref: DRN01956542100 pounds needed to assess Mr As applications  for borrowing to check  that he could 
sustainably repay  them   in other words it had to find out whether Mr A could pay back his 
loans without too much difficulty. 
The checks  lenders needed to carry out when assessing the affordability of a loan for a 
borrower had to be proportionate  to the circumstances  of the application  for example, the 
size of the loan repayments, the borrowers lending history, and their income. But there  was 
no set list of things  that a lender had to check before deciding  to lend  and Ive thought 
about this when looking at Mr As complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator that the checks  completed for Mr As first loan were enough. 
100pounds was told that Mr A was earning  nearly £1,300 per month. And Mr A didnt have a 
previous history of extensive borrowing or missed  payments with 100pounds. On that basis,  
I think that 100 pounds could reasonably have offered Mr A a relatively low loan of £100  
(total amount repayable  £115).
But I agree  with the adjudicator about  Mr As subsequent loans.  Mr A came  back for a 
second loan within two weeks of repaying his first loan and was seeking double the amount. 
So I think a proportionate check ought  to have involved gathering  more  information about   
Mr As circumstances. For example,  it could  have asked Mr A more  questions about his 
outgoings or reviewed  his credit file.
Mr A took out loan three  (this time for £300,  total amount  repayable of £372)  on the same 
day he repaid loan two. He took out loan four the day after he repaid loan three. And he took 
loan five just four days after he repaid loan four.
With each new loan coming so quickly after the previous one had been repaid  and for 
increasing amounts   I think 100pounds  ought  to have been alive to the possibility that Mr A 
was becoming increasingly dependent on this high cost credit and that he mightve been 
experiencing difficulty repaying  his loans. So I think it should have taken further steps to 
check that each  loan application was affordable  and responsible.
The adjudicator pointed out that had 100pounds required more  information from loan two 
onwards (and I think it would have been  proportionate to gather some information  about      
Mr As regular  outgoings),  it would  have seen that he spent around £1,200 per month on 
rent, food,  utilities, TV / phone subscriptions,  travel and childcare. With less than £100 in 
disposable income, 100pounds ought to have known, from the second loan onwards, that   
Mr A couldnt sustainably repay the borrowing he was being provided with.
Indeed, as Mr As borrowing continued,  Id expect 100pounds to have  conducted more  
detailed checks into his financial circumstances. Ultimately, as the adjudicator has pointed  
out (and 100pounds has not disputed this) a full understanding of Mr As situation wouldve 
shown that, in addition to the regular outgoings I set out in the previous paragraph, he had 
significant existing  short-term lending commitments, totalling well over £500  due in the 
month Mr A took his fifth loan.
I dont think 100pounds  did enough checks when assessing whether Mr A could  afford loans 
2-5. Had it done  proportionate checks, it would most  likely have known that the loans werent  
affordable for Mr A.
Ref: DRN01956543what 100pounds should  do to put things right
100pounds specifically  queried the adjudicators  instruction that it should deduct basic  rate 
income tax from the 8% simple interest part of the redress  she set out. I can confirm  that this 
service does routinely  require this as part of our redress  awards   in line with current  HMRC  
guidance SAIM9115 and SAIM9116.
I understand that all Mr As loans have been  repaid.  And so, to put things right in this case, 
100pounds should: 
Refund what Mr A has paid in interest, fees, and charges on loans 2-5
Pay an additional  amount* equal  to 8% simple interest per year on each of these  
payments from the date they were paid by Mr A to the date of settlement. 
If there  is any adverse  information  about loans  2-5 on Mr As credit  file, this should  be 
removed by 100pounds
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 100pounds to take off basic rate tax from this interest. 
100pounds must give Mr A certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, Im upholding  Mr As complaint. Sunny Marketing Ltd (trading 
as 100pounds) should pay redress in the way that Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 May 2019.
