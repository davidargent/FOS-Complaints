K821x#15complaint
This complaint is about a successful critical illness claim  from a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy sold to Mrs C in December 1999. Mr C says Lloyds Bank  PLC did not 
use the money from the successful claim to clear  the loan. Mr C says this resulted in Mrs C 
continuing to pay the loan until January 2003.
background
In December 1999 Mrs C took out a loan for £4,500 with Lloyds. At the same time Mrs C 
was sold a PPI policy.  The PPI policy included cover against  critical illness.  This cover  
meant that if Mrs C was diagnosed with a critical illness the PPI would clear the loan.        
The premium for the PPI policy  was £1,103.92 which was added  to the loan meaning Mrs C 
borrowed £5,603.92  in total.  The loan had a term of 60 months.
In early 2000 Mrs C was diagnosed with a critical illness  and made a claim on the policy.    
On 4 May 2000  the insurer paid £541.88 to Lloyds, which I understand was the sum of four 
monthly loan payments.  In July 2000  the insurer paid out £5,420.39 which  was the sum 
needed to clear the loan balance.
The insurer  paid both sums directly to Lloyds. It is my understanding  that these payments 
were placed  in a holding  account.
It seems  Mrs C was unaware the payments had been  made and continued to pay Lloyds her 
monthly loan repayments. In January  2003  Mrs C was told by a member of staff at a Lloyds  
branch that the balance to clear  her account was £2,961.48. She wrote  to Lloyds asking to 
pay this amount from her current account to repay the loan. On 20 January 2003 this amount 
was paid from Mrs Cs account.
Mrs C later complained to Lloyds about the sale of the PPI. Lloyds said the policy  was not 
mis-sold so Mrs C asked this service to step in.
In 2015 an adjudicator from this service recommended the complaint should be upheld and 
Lloyds should  put Mrs C in the financial position shed be in if the policy had not been sold.
Lloyds said Mrs C had not lost out financially from the sale of the policy as she had made a 
successful claim  and received more  than the policy had cost her. Lloyds sent this service 
screenshots of its internal records to evidence  the claim.
An adjudicator from this service then wrote to Mrs C to say Lloyds did not owe her 
compensation for the mis-sale as she had already received the claims money.
Mrs C had no recollection of receiving any pay-out for the claim she made in 2000. Mrs C 
wrote again  to Lloyds  to say she had never received  the claim  pay-out.
In May 2017  Lloyds  agreed to pay Mrs C the compensation for mis-selling the PPI without 
making any deduction for the successful claim. It calculated that Mrs C paid 37 payments on 
her loan before it was cleared and the total cost of the PPI policy  to her was £1,517.75. It 
then added compensatory interest  calculated at 8% simple. After tax had been  deducted  
from the compensatory interest the total amount it paid Mrs C was £3,015.97. 
Ref: DRN98929942Mrs C felt Lloyds had still not properly compensated her. Mrs C complained  that because 
Lloyds had not used the claim money to clear her loan in May 2000  she was still out of 
pocket. 
On 5 October 2017 Lloyds wrote to Mrs C. In its letter it agreed to pay Mrs C the amount of 
£5,962.27 which was the claim money  paid out by the insurer in 2000. Lloyds said it would 
deduct from this the PPI compensation  from the mis-sale of the policy  it had already paid her 
in May 2017.  It also added 8% simple interest for the time Mrs C had been out of pocket, 
Lloyds calculated the 8% simple  interest  to be £47.19 after tax had been deducted.  
So, Lloyds paid Mrs C two amounts totalling  £6,009.94. These were £3,015.97 in May 2017 
and a further £2,618.94  in October 2017.  
In addition, Lloyds  paid Mrs C £100  for the trouble and upset shed experienced.
Mrs C remained  unhappy with how Lloyds had dealt with her complaint. Mrs C said the loan 
should have been cleared in May 2000,  so she was due more  interest to compensate her for 
being out of pocket. Mrs C again brought her complaint to this service.
Sadly, Mrs C died in late 2018,  her estate is being represented in this complaint by Mr C.
An adjudicator from this service asked Lloyds to provide a breakdown of the 8% 
compensatory interest  it had paid Mrs C in October  2017. Lloyds did not respond to the 
adjudicators request,  so the complaint was passed  to me.
In April 2020 I issued  my provisional  findings on this complaint and invited both parties  to 
comment and send  me any additional evidence  they wanted me to think  about.  A copy  of my 
provisional decision is attached and forms part of this final decision.
My provisional findings were that I was intending  to uphold this complaint, my main reasons 
were:
I was persuaded  that Lloyds made an error  in 2000 in not using the claim money  to clear   
Mrs Cs loan.
I thought that if it had then Mrs C would not have  continued to pay her loan until January 
2003
So I found that Mrs C was out of pocket for all payments made to her loan from January 
2000 onwards.
I thought Mrs C made 37 loan repayments  in total followed by a final payment of £2,961.48.  
So, Mrs C paid around £7,900 in total to repay the loan.
Lloyds has paid Mrs C only £6,009.94 in compensation to date which includes compensatory 
interest. So, I was satisfied that Lloyds needed to do more to compensate Mrs Cs estate.
I also set out in my provisional findings  how Lloyds  should put things right.
Ref: DRN98929943my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr C has told us he accepts the findings  I set out in the provisional decision.
Lloyds has not responded to the provisional  decision.
Therefore I see no reason  to depart from the findings I set out in my provisional decision in 
April 2020.
putting things right
Lloyds need to put Mrs Cs estate back in the financial  position  it would be in if it had used 
the funds from the PPI claim  to clear the loan in 2000. So it should:
Refund all the loan and PPI repayments  Mrs C made from January 2000 onwards.
Add simple interest to each payment from when Mrs C paid it until her estate gets it 
back. The rate of interest is and 8% a year .
Lloyds can deduct from the total it owes Mrs Cs estate the two amounts it already 
paid her in May and October 2017.
When calculating the simple interest  Lloyds can take into account  that it paid some  of 
what it owes Mrs Cs estate in May and October  2017.
 HM Revenue  & Customs  requires Lloyds to take off tax from this interest. Lloyds must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Lloyds should  provide  Mr C with a full breakdown of how it has calculated the compensation 
set out above.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold this complaint and 
direct Lloyds Bank PLC to pay Mrs Cs estate  compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 June 2020.

my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   
This complaint began as a complaint about a mis-sold PPI policy.  However, the crux of the 
complaint is that Mr C says the loan should  have been cleared in May 2000 when the insurer  
paid out the critical  illness  claim. Mr C says that Mrs C was left out of pocket for many  years 
because she paid the loan herself.
Ive seen evidence  that the insurer made  two payments totalling £5,962.27 directly  to Lloyds 
in May and July 2000. Lloyds has told us these payments were  placed in a holding account.
The payments should  have been used to clear  the loan so that Mrs C didnt have to make 
any further payments  to the loan. But Ive seen evidence  from Mrs Cs bank statements that 
she continued to pay the loan until 20 January 2003 when she made  a final payment of 
£2,961.48.
I note Lloyds said in a letter to Mrs C dated 7 August  2017  that there was not sufficient 
evidence to say the money  was not paid to her. Later, in a letter  dated  28 March  2018 it said 
there was not sufficient  evidence to say it was paid to her. 
It isnt clear what actually happened  to the claims money after Lloyds placed it in a holding 
account. Ive seen no evidence it was ever paid directly to Mrs C, but I am satisfied it was 
not used by Lloyds to clear Mrs C loan either.
Ref: DRN98929946It could be argued that Mrs C should have contacted  the insurer to question  what  had 
happened to her claim. But, bearing in mind  her illness I can understand if that was not her 
priority at the time, particularly if she was financially  able to continue with her loan 
repayments.
It isnt clear why Lloyds didnt use the claim money it received from the insurer  to clear  the 
loan directly. If Lloyds wasnt sure what the money was for Id have thought  it would have 
contacted the insurer  directly  to ask.
Having reviewed all the evidence I am persuaded that Lloyds made an error in 2000 in not 
using the claim money to clear Mrs Cs loan.
If it had then Mrs C would not have continued  to pay her loan until January 2003.
From what  Ive seen the payment made by the insurer in May 2000  was meant to cover the 
previous four loan repayments. It follows that due to Lloyds error Mrs C was out of pocket 
for all payments made  to her loan from January  2000 onwards.
It looks like Mrs C made 37 loan repayments  in total followed by a final payment of 
£2,961.48. So, Mrs C paid around  £7,900 in total to repay the loan.
Lloyds has paid Mrs C only £6,009.94 in compensation to date which includes compensatory 
interest. So, I am satisfied  that Lloyds needs to do more to compensate  Mrs Cs estate.
putting things right
Lloyds need to put Mrs Cs estate back in the financial  position  it would be in if it had used 
the funds from the PPI claim  to clear the loan in 2000. So it should.
Refund all the loan and PPI repayments  Mrs C made from January 2000 onwards.
Add simple interest to each payment from when Mrs C paid it until her estate gets it

paid her in May and October 2017.
When calculating the simple interest  Lloyds can take into account  that it paid some  of 
what it owes Mrs Cs estate in May and October  2017.
 HM Revenue  & Customs  requires Lloyds to take off tax from this interest. Lloyds must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
In response to this provisional decision I ask that Lloyds  provides this service with a full 
breakdown of how it has calculated the compensation set out above.
Ref: DRN98929947my provisional decision
For the reasons  set out above, but subject to both parties responses to this provisional 
decision, Im intending  to uphold this complaint and direct Lloyds Bank PLC to pay Mrs Cs 
estate compensation  as set out above.
