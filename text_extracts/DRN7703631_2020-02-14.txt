K821x#15complaint
Mr J complains that Uncle Buck  Finance LLP didnt do enough affordability checks before 
lending to him.
background
Mr J had seven loans  from Uncle Buck between Jan 2014  and April 2015 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly 
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 21 Jan 2014 £150 11d £202.43 31 Jan 2014 Yes
2 6 Feb 2014 £150 23d £202.43 28 Feb 2014 Yes
3 28 Feb 2014 £135 32d £182.18 31 Mar 2014 Yes
4 15 Apr 2014 £275 16d £371.11 30 Apr 2014 Yes
5 8 May 2014 £300 23d £404.85 30 May 2014 Yes
6 14 Jan 2015 £375 77d £170.19 31 Mar 2015 Yes
7 13 Apr 2015 £325 79d £150.23 30 Jun 2015 Yes
Mr J says the loan term was extended without  further assessment of his financial 
circumstances. He says the repayments  meant  he couldnt pay priority bills and ended up 
borrowing from other short-term lenders. Mr J says this created a spiral of debt which  
dramatically worsened  his financial position.
Uncle Buck  says it was satisfied it carried out sufficient credit and affordability checks. But it 
says that as some of the loans were  funded  in quick succession it ought to have  been  aware  
Mr J was becoming reliant on the loans. It offered to uphold Mr Js complaint about loan 4 on 
that basis.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She said the information  
Uncle Buck  had showed Mr J was also ready struggling to manage his money  before he 
applied for loan 1. She said Uncle Buck should  have realised Mr J was unlikely to be able to 
sustainably repay  loans 1 to 5, but, because  of the break in lending  before loan 6, she 
couldnt say it was unfair to have approved loans 6 and 7. Our adjudicator recommended  
that interest  and charges should  be refunded  on loans 1 to 5, and that any associated  
adverse information  should be removed from Mr Js credit file.
Uncle Buck  did not respond to the assessment.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr J 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN77036312But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Js complaint.
Loans 1 to 5
I can see that when  Mr J applied for his first loan Uncle  Buck asked for information about  his 
income and expenditure and reviewed his credit file. Although the repayments on loans  1 to 
5 appeared affordable based upon  Mr Js disposable income, I consider Uncle  Buck should 
have seen that, in fact, Mr J was already  struggling  financially. I say that because:
Mr Js credit file showed he had eight defaults on his account  two of those were  in 
the last 12 months, and four were since October  2012
oThree of these most recent defaults were  outstanding accounts  with other 
short-term lenders;
Mr J had an active account with a debt management company, on which  hed also 
defaulted;
There was an additional outstanding  short-term  loan account for which Mr J was in 
arrears;
Mr J took out his first five loans in quick succession and the amount borrowed 
steadily increased.
Ref: DRN77036313So I think Mr J was showing clear indications that he was struggling  financially and was 
unlikely to be able to sustainably repay the loans. Therefore I find Uncle Buck  should  not 
have approved loans 1 to 5.
Loans 6 to 7
As there was a significant  break in lending between loans 5 and 6, I consider its reasonable 
for Uncle Buck to have considered Mr J was no longer reliant  on short-term lending.  Its 
affordability checks showed the repayments were affordable and there were no recent 
additional defaults or loans on his credit file. So I cant conclude Uncle Buck  was wrong  to 
have approved loans 6 and 7.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 1 to 5 and Uncle Buck  should  put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Uncle Buck Finance LLP should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr J paid on loans 1 to 5;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loans 1 to 5 from Mr Js credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2020.
