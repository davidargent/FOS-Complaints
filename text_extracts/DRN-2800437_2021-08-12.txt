The complaint
Mr N complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles Card (NewDay) lent to him when it 
shouldnt have. 
What happened
Mr N took out a branded credit card in January 2017 with a limit of £900. There were then 
four credit increases to the credit limit between June 2017 and December 2018, at which 
point the limit had increased to £5,500.
Mr N also opened another branded credit card in October 2018 with a limit of £900. This limit 
was increased to £2,150 in January 2019, with no further increases after this. There was 
then a further application approved in March 2020 for a third branded card with a £500 limit. 
The limit on this card was increased to £950 in September 2020.
Mr N complained to NewDay about all of his borrowing with it  saying that it had been 
irresponsible in providing the credit cards where he couldnt afford to maintain them. 
NewDay responded to say that it had followed its usual approach in deciding whether Mr N 
could afford what it lent to him  including external searches and a review of his account 
activity prior to providing any lending.
Mr N wasnt happy with this and referred his complaint to our service, where one of our 
investigators looked into it. They felt that NewDay had done enough when assessing the 
affordability of the first and second branded cards  and the increases to the limits of these. 
They found that the checks went into sufficient detail and that there was no reason for 
NewDay to reasonably think the lending would be unaffordable for Mr N.
But our investigator didnt think NewDay had done enough in respect of the checks it did 
when assessing whether the third branded card was affordable. They said that Mr N had a 
number of credit searches on his credit record, two missed payments to a payday loan and 
that his overall borrowing was now £29,300. When considered alongside the conduct on his 
other cards with NewDay, they felt that it shouldve completed a more thorough check of 
Mr Ns situation before agreeing to lend.
Mr N agreed with the investigators view. But NewDay didnt. It said that it couldnt find any 
record of payday loans, although there were records of searches for credit. But NewDay 
restated that its searches for the card and for the subsequent increases, showed that there 
were no accounts in arrears, either with NewDay or other lenders and no other records of 
adverse data.
Our investigator acknowledged that NewDay may not have seen the payday loan data they 
initially referenced. But they maintained that more checks should have been done here, 
especially as Mr N informed NewDay he was in financial difficulties on two of his other cards 
with it. NewDay continued to disagree, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I note that the parties seem to be broadly in agreement that the first two 
branded cards that NewDay provided Mr N were affordable and responsibly lent. I agree and 
for the same reasons that our investigator outlined. Ultimately, the checks that NewDay has 
shown it did in relation to both of these cards  in terms of both the original limits and the 
increases to the credit limits  look to have been proportionate and reasonable in the overall 
context of the lending.
But by March 2020, when Mr N applied for the third branded card, it was over a year since 
NewDay had provided any lending to him. And I think its fair to say that the situation was 
different at this point. Based on what NewDays checks revealed at this point, compared to 
what it knew from previous lending checks, his sole and household income had increased  
but so had his overall unsecured indebtedness. From 2017 when the first branded card was 
provided, NewDays records show Mr Ns indebtedness as £6,700 in total. Then in 2018, just 
a year later, that increases to £22,900.
Those increases were approved against a relative increase in overall household income 
though and so I can see why this wouldnt have raised concerns with NewDay when its 
checks for the previous cards revealed this. But by the point the third branded card was 
applied for  NewDay recorded Mr Ns overall unsecured debt as £29,300. Thats a large 
amount of borrowing, relative to Mr Ns income. So NewDay knew that Mr N was someone 
who had steadily increased their overall borrowing since he had taken the first card out.
When taken in the context of the fact that Mr N had nine active credit cards and other 
indebtedness elsewhere, I think that NewDay had enough information to think twice about 
lending again on the basis of the information it did here. At the very least, I think this was a 
borderline lending decision and I note that NewDays own criteria assessed Mr Ns 
application as a medium risk. I accept that this alone wasnt reason for NewDay not to lend 
 but I think it wouldve been proportionate to what the checks revealed here to exercise 
some caution and make some further enquiries before agreeing to lend.
If NewDay had asked more questions of Mr N  then I think what he would have told it, 
based on the information Ive seen, would have strongly suggested that further lending 
wasnt affordable or responsible here. His statements show that he had a high level of 
indebtedness, with high monthly payments to a number of creditors and payday loan 
providers. I accept that NewDay may not have been aware of the specific details of some of 
these accounts from its initial checks  such as the payday loans. But I think it would likely 
have become aware, had it asked more questions.
So even considering that the limit here of £500 wasnt particularly high, I still think NewDay 
shouldve performed more checks than it did in order to be proportionate to what it knew 
about Mr Ns situation. The same goes for the increase to Mr Ns credit limit in September 
2020. Mr Ns financial situation hadnt changed much by then and he had told NewDay that 
he was in financial difficulties, yet it still increased the limit on the card.
Mr N did afford to make payments on the card for a few months between March and 
September, before he told NewDay that he was experiencing financial difficulties. But, after 
we asked him how this was possible  he explained that this was because he made sure all 
the minimum payments were made each month on what he owed  sometimes getting help 
from family members in order to do this. So Im satisfied that, while on the face of it, Mr Ns 
situation may have looked acceptable to NewDay  the underlying situation was that he was 
ultimately struggling to maintain his borrowing.Putting things right
Overall here, I think it would have been proportionate and reasonable in the individual 
circumstances for NewDay to have made further checks into the affordability of the third 
card. If it had, then Im satisfied that NewDay, as a reasonable lender, wouldnt have 
provided the card, or the further limit increase. 
Mr N has spent the money the card made available to him, so I think its fair that he repays 
that. But I dont think he should be disadvantaged by having to pay back any interest or 
charges on that amount, so NewDay should refund any that have been applied to the card. 
If after doing so, that results in a credit balance thats due to Mr N  then NewDay should 
add 8% to that to reflect the fact hes been without that money. As far as I know, NewDay 
hasnt recorded any adverse information in relation to this card  but if it has, then it should 
remove this too.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. NewDay Ltd must:
refund any interest and charges applied to the credit card Mr N took out in March 
2020
if any refunds made result in a credit balance due to Mr N, NewDay Ltd should pay 
8% interest on top of that
if NewDay Ltd has recorded any adverse information in relation to this card on Mr Ns 
credit file, it should remove this
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 September 2021.
