The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as Z, is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) defaulted its Bounce Back Loan (BBL) account for non-payment. Z is also 
unhappy that NatWest simultaneously closed its business current account (BCA) and used 
the money present in the BCA to partially repay some of the outstanding BBL debt.
Zs complaint is brought to this service by its director, whom Ill refer to as Mr R.
What happened
Mr R was unhappy to discover that Zs BBL had been defaulted for non-payment by NatWest 
 especially as he wasnt aware that Z had missed any payments towards the BBL  and 
that NatWest had also closed Zs BCA and applied the balance of the BCA towards the 
outstanding balance of the BBL. So, he raised a complaint on Zs behalf.
NatWest responded to Z and confirmed that the BBL had been defaulted because no 
payments had been received towards the loan for three months. NatWest also explained that 
they were within their rights to decide to close Zs BCA as well and to apply the BCA funds to 
reduce the BBL debt, and so didnt feel theyd acted unfairly by doing so. Mr R wasnt 
satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred Zs complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel NatWest had acted 
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation and noted that NatWest had sent several letters 
to Z advising that payments to the BBL had been missed and of the potential consequences 
of ongoing non-payment before taking the action they did. Mr R remained dissatisfied, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Id like to begin by confirming that this service isnt a regulatory body or a 
Court of Law and doesnt operate as such. This means that it isnt within my remit here to 
declare that NatWest have acted in a non-regulatory or unlawful way. 
Instead, this service is an informal, impartial dispute resolution service. And while we do take 
relevant law and regulation into account when arriving at our decisions, our remit is focussed 
on determining whether we feel a fair or unfair outcome has occurred  from an impartial 
perspective, after taking all the circumstances and factors of a complaint into consideration. 
Z didnt make payments towards its BBL in April, May, and June 2022. NatWest have shown 
that in May and June 2022 they sent several arrears letters to Z about the missed payments, 
as well as a formal demand on 12 July 2022 advising that an act of default had occurred on 
the BBL and that repayment of the full outstanding balance of the loan was now required. 
Mr R has explained that Z didnt receive any of these letters from NatWest. But the address 
NatWest sent the letters to is the same address that Mr R has provided to this service for Z 
and which is also listed on Companies House as being the registered address for Z. As 
such, Im satisfied that NatWest did send the letters to the correct address for Z. 
It therefore seems unlikely that Z wouldnt have received any of the letters that NatWest 
sent. And if it were the case that none of the correctly addressed letters were received at the 
address, this wouldnt be something for which Id consider holding NatWest accountable for, 
given that the delivery of correctly addressed letters is undertaken by a postal service and 
therefore isnt something which NatWest have direct control over or responsibility for.
Additionally, its the responsibility of a loan account holder to monitor the status of that loan, 
including whether the scheduled payments are being made or not. And this is especially true 
where the payments are being made by standing order  where control is retained by the 
party making the payments  as was the case in this instance. And so, I feel Mr R should 
have been aware that payments werent being made towards Zs BBL, even if it was the 
case that no arrears letters were received by him. 
Mr R has explained that Z did resume making payments towards the BBL in July 2022. But 
this was after NatWest had issued the formal demand notice and didnt include any payment 
of the arrears that had accrued because of the missed payments in April, May, and June. As 
such, I dont feel it was unfair or unreasonable for NatWest to have continued to consider 
that an act of default had occurred and to have moved to default the account as they did.  
Finally, Mr R is unhappy that when NatWest defaulted Zs BBL they also closed Zs BCA and 
used the money in the BCA to reduce the outstanding balance of the BBL. But I dont feel its 
unreasonable for NatWest to have no longer been willing to provide banking services to Z 
upon the defaulting of Zs BBL. And NatWest applied the money from the BCA to the BBL 
under their right of set off, which is included in the account terms issued by NatWest to 
which Z agreed when opening its accounts with NatWest.
All of which means that I dont feel that NatWest have done anything wrong or acted unfairly 
here, and it follows from this that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest 
to take any further action. I realise this wont be the outcome Mr R was wanting, but I trust 
he'll understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision I have. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2023.
