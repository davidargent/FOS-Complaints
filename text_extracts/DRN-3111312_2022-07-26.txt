The complaint
Mrs S complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that shes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Shes being represented in her complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs S and three others entered into a fractional property owners club application and 
purchase agreement in May 2012. The payment due under that agreement was Â£15,347 and 
Mrs J entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay that 
amount. The loan was repaid in May 2013 and a claim was made to Barclays Partner 
Finance in December 2019 that the fractional ownership product had been mis-sold and 
misrepresented and that it was an unregulated collective investment scheme. 
Barclays Partner Finance hadnt issued a substantive response to that claim by February 
2020 so a complaint was made to this service. Our investigator didnt recommend that 
Mrs Ss complaint should be upheld. He said that Mrs Ss claims were more than likely time- 
barred under the applicable limitation provisions so he thought that Barclays Partner 
Finances decision not to look into her claims was fair. 
Mrs Ss representative, on her behalf, says that it doesnt agree with our investigators 
recommendations. It has provided a detailed response to those recommendations and says, 
in summary and amongst other things, that:
Mrs Ss complaint isnt time-barred  the relationship ended in February 2017 when 
the last management fee invoice was paid so the limitation period ends in February 
2023 and Mrs S only found out that the product was an unregulated collective 
investment scheme when she was informed by it prior to her claim being made;
the sales tactics used by the property owners club, including the slide presentation, 
clearly indicate that the product was an investment;
the product was misrepresented to Mrs S and shes making a claim against Barclays 
Partner Finance under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act;
the relationship between Mrs S and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair under 
section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act;
the product was an unregulated collective investment scheme and its illegal to 
promote an unregulated collective investment scheme to a retail investor such as 
Mrs S so the loan was illegal; and
there were income assessment breaches by Barclays Partner Finance and its 
affordability assessment wasnt sufficient.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Ss complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance didnt accept the claims that were 
made under the Consumer Credit Act and I accept that the claims were referred to 
this service within six years of the event that shes complained about  but I need to 
consider whether those claims were made within the applicable limitation periods;
Mrs Ss claims are under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  in this 
decision Im not determining the outcome of those claims as only a court would be 
able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs Ss claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented to her and 
that she, and the other purchasers, wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the 
applicable time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to 
rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs S could have made a claim to the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that induced them into buying the 
timeshare when they entered into the agreement to buy the timeshare in October 
2009 as that was when they entered into an agreement based on the 
misrepresentations of the timeshare company and suffered a loss as they entered 
into the loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the timeshare;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance  but they didnt make a claim against Barclays Partner Finance until 
September 2018, which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mrs Ss representative says that Mr and Ms C only became aware that they could 
make a claim to Barclays Partner Finance after they sought advice from it in 2018  
but when they had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist them for the 
purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of 
that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the 
cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mrs 
Ss claims;
Mrs Ss representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs S and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that Mrs S entered into the loan agreement in October 
2009 and it ended in March 2011 - so Mrs S would have needed to make a claim 
against Barclays Partner Finance within six years of March 2011  but they didnt 
make a claim to it until September 2018, more than seven years later, which was 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mrs Ss representative says that information about the credit agreement and 
timeshare was deliberately concealed from Mrs S and that they didnt discover the 
concealment until after theyd sought advice from it in 2018;
section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors 
right of action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation 
doesnt begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with 
reasonable diligence have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that 
deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some 
time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Mrs S and their representative have set out what they say happened before Mrs S 
entered into the acquisition agreement and credit agreement in October 2009  but I 
dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a deliberate 
concealment of any relevant information, in fact many of the things that they say 
werent right would have been known to Mrs S at the time of the sale, such as the 
length of the contract and the intertest rate on the loan  so I dont consider that 
section 32 is applicable in these circumstances;
Mrs Ss representative has said that Barclays Partner Finance should have told 
them about any commission that it paid to the timeshare company for arranging 
the loan  but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, 
if any, was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the timeshare company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid 
it tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance didnt breach any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under 
any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to 
Mrs S risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Barclays Partner Finance hadnt issued a substantive response to Mrs Ss claim by 
March 2020 so a complaint was made to this service  I consider that it should have 
assessed their claim under sections 75 and 140A but it didnt do that so I cant say 
that it acted fairly and reasonably in response to their claims  but I consider that it 
wouldnt have upheld the claims if it had properly considered them as it would have 
said that the claims werent made within the periods set out in the Limitation Act;
Mrs Ss representative says that the loan was unaffordable for Mrs S and that no 
affordability assessment was made before the loan was made to them;Ive seen no other evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for Mrs S and 
they didnt complain to Barclays Partner Finance about the affordability of the loan or 
ask it for any information about the affordability assessment until 2018  as the loan 
was made in October 2009 and ended in March 2011, I consider it to be more likely 
than not that any complaint about the affordability of the loan would now be time 
barred; 
nor have I seen evidence to show that Mrs S were unduly pressured into entering 
into the acquisition agreement or loan agreement in October 2009 or that the 
timeshare company used unacceptable commercial practices against Mrs S  they 
didnt complain to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues until September 2018 
 nearly nine years after they entered into the agreements and I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect them to have complained to Barclays Partner Finance 
about any such issues before then; and 
I sympathise with Mrs S for the issues that theyve had with their timeshare and the 
difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to them 
any of the money that they paid under the loan agreement, to pay them any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 August 2022.
