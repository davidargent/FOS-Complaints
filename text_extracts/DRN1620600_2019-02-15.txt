K820x#14complaint
Mr B is unhappy that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc removed his overdraft and defaulted  his 
bank account.
background
NatWest emailed Mr B in June 2016.  It told him his Student account would become a 
Graduate account  in July 2016.  The email  said Mr B would  keep his interest-free overdraft 
limit of £2,000 for one year after the change, and his limit would then reduce to £1,000 for 
the second year. The email contained Mr Bs new account terms.
Mr B paid off £1,000  of his overdraft by August 2017. He thought he needed to repay  the 
remaining £995 by August  2018. But when Mr B went  to pay off his overdraft in July 2018, 
he discovered NatWest had closed his account.  
NatWest said the terms of Mr Bs account meant he had to use it as his main account and it 
needed to receive  regular  credits.  But Mr B hadnt used the account since  July 2017. 
Because Mr B wasnt paying anything into his account and he had an overdraft, NatWest  
referred the account to its collections department in January 2018. NatWest  then wrote to 
Mr B until May 2018 at his last known address, his parents house,  and tried to call him. 
NatWest then defaulted Mr Bs account and passed it to a third party in July 2018. And it told 
Mr B to contact the third party to make repayments.  Once the balance had been  repaid, 
NatWest said it would update his credit  file to show the account was fully satisfied.
Unhappy with NatWests  response,  Mr B referred his complaint  to our service.  Mr B said 
hed told NatWest he moved abroad and tried to change his address online several  times.  
But NatWest  had told Mr B he couldnt change his address this way and would need  to 
phone the bank. Mr B didnt want to do this because calling from abroad is expensive. Mr B 
says NatWest shouldve  known he would pay the amount owed by July 2018  as hed logged 
into the banks  mobile  banking  app. 
One of our investigators  reviewed Mr Bs complaint but didnt uphold it. He didnt think  Mr B 
had followed  the terms of his account,  which Mr B agreed to when  he opened it. NatWest 
tried to contact Mr B on a number of occasions and it wasnt obliged  to email Mr B. Our 
investigator explained NatWest was obliged  to report correct information  to credit reference  
agencies.    
Mr B disagreed, saying  there should  be some  leeway with his credit file as his account was 
closed in July 2018, and he still repaid his overdraft  later in July 2018. He said he was never  
made aware  he needed to use his account. He assumed the letters received at his parents 
house were statements and said NatWest could have emailed him. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive not upheld  Mr Bs 
complaint. I realise  my decision is likely  to disappoint him, but Ill explain my reasons. 
The terms of both Mr Bs student and graduate  accounts required him to use the account  as 
his main account by depositing his wages or regular income into it. This term was sent to 
Mr B when his account changed from a student  to a graduate account, so I think NatWest  
Ref: DRN16206002took reasonable steps to make Mr B aware  he had to credit  his account regularly. Ive 
reviewed Mr Bs account history and he stopped  making regular credits to his account in 
July 2017. So I think NatWest is right in saying Mr B was in breach of the terms of his 
account. NatWest wasnt  obliged to wait and hope  Mr B would repay his overdraft by 
July 2018. 
I dont think NatWests email of July 2016 told Mr B his overdraft didnt need to be repaid 
until July 2018.  The terms of Mr Bs account set out that his overdraft is not for a fixed period 
of time and NatWest can decide to end the arrangement ask for the overdraft to be repaid, in 
full, at any time if it has a valid reason. NatWest say it will usually give at least  30 days  
notice before it demands repayment. NatWest can also close an account by giving 60 days  
notice. In this case, Im satisfied NatWest wasnt obliged to offer the overdraft until 
July 2018. And as Mr B was in breach  of the terms of his account by not regularly  crediting  it, 
I think NatWest  had a valid reason to ask Mr B to repay the overdraft in full. 
Several months after Mr B stopped paying into his account, NatWest wrote  to him at this last 
known address. I know Mr B was concerned  about  the cost of calling from abroad  but it is 
for NatWest to decide how to safely protect  its customers  accounts, and a requirement  that 
a customer call them to change their address  doesnt seem to be an unreasonable  one. It 
remains that Mr B knew NatWest didnt have  his correct address  and it doesnt  appear he 
made any arrangements to ensure  any letters NatWest sent him would reach  him. I dont 
think NatWest had any alternative but to write  to Mr B at his last known address as its 
attempts to contact  Mr B by phone  also didnt work.  I think NatWest made reasonable 
attempts to give Mr B notice his overdraft  needed  to be repaid.
NatWest sent Mr B a default notice asking for the overdraft to be repaid. When no payment 
was received, NatWest  was entitled  to default the account. I dont think Mr B logging  into his 
banking app would constitute notice to NatWest that he would repay the agreement in full. I 
know Mr B would like some  leeway with his credit  file. But NatWest is entitled to record 
accurate information  on Mr Bs credit file, so I wouldnt  ask it to remove  the default it 
recorded against his account.   
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above, I dont  uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 March  2019.
