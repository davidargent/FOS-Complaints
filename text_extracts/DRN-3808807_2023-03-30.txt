The complaint
Mr F transferred his defined benefit occupational pension into a self-invested personal 
pension (SIPP) with Options UK Personal Pensions LLP, formerly Carey Pensions UK LLP 
(Options). This, and the investment in it, was recommended by an unregulated business 
called Caledonian International Associates (Caledonian). Mr F says Options failed in its 
duties towards him and should not have facilitated his transfer away from a pension which 
had significant guarantees. He says Options didnt carry out sufficient due diligence on 
Caledonian and that his transfer should never have been allowed to go ahead.
Mr F wants to be put back into the position he would have been in had Options not accepted 
his SIPP application.
The parties involved
Given the various parties involved in Mr Fs pension transfer and subsequent investment Ive 
set out a summary of each below.
Options
Options is a SIPP provider and administrator. At the time of the events in this complaint, 
Options was regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which later became the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Options was authorised, in relation to SIPPs, to arrange 
(bring about) deals in investments, to deal in investments as principal, to establish, operate 
or wind up a pension scheme, and to make arrangements with a view to transactions in 
investments.
Caledonian
Caledonian was the trading name of MMG Associates, which was registered in the British 
Virgin Islands. Caledonian was not authorised in the UK to undertake regulated activities and 
it does not (and did not at the time of the events subject to complaint here) appear on the 
FCAs Financial Services Register. And there is no evidence it was authorised to carry out 
regulated activities (where there was any relevant legislation) in any other jurisdiction.
Business C
Business C is an investment manager. The evidence is that Business C agreed to manage 
or provide oversight of some of the investments taken out by Caledonians customers after 
they had transferred their pensions. I shall call the individual representing Business C, who 
was involved in some of Caledonians general dealings with Options, Mr P.
Friends Provident International
Friends Provident International (FPI) is registered in the Isle of Man. It provided a bond (i.e. 
life assurance) wrapper which allows investment in a number of funds with a number of fund 
providers. Mr F invested in a number of investments within a FPI bond.
What happened
Mr F has explained that a Caledonian representative approached him at an airport while he 
was working abroad and advised him that he could make his Armed Forces Pension 
Scheme pension (AFPS) "work harder". He says the representative told him his AFPS 
pension was just "sat there", but that he could "triple" or "quadruple" his pension pot before 
retirement by moving it. Mr F has said that he was not informed about the benefits he would 
lose by transferring his AFPS pension and no other pension products were explained or 
offered to him. He says he was not interested in transferring his pension prior to being 
approached by Caledonian; but he understood the representative to be an expert who could 
transfer his AFPS pension and that by doing so he would be better off. So, he agreed to 
transfer out of the AFPS, open an Options SIPP and invest in an FPI bond.
The Options SIPP Application Form For Direct Clients was signed by Mr F on 10 August 
2012 and sent to Options by Caledonian. In summary, on the application form Mr F 
confirmed his UK address, age, occupation, annual earnings and selected retirement age 
(55). He also confirmed that the transferring pension (ceding) scheme was the AFPS, gave 
an approximate pension value of Â£57,851, detailed that hed be investing 100% of his fund 
with FPI and nominated his death benefit beneficiary.
The selected retirement age, details of transferring scheme and details of the investment 
were pre-populated, rather than handwritten like the rest of the form. And the box waiving 
cancellation rights was ticked.
The final page of the application form  headed 12. Declaration included, amongst other 
statements, the following:
I understand that Carey Pensions UK LLP and Carey Pension Trustees UK Ltd are 
not in anyway [sic] able to provide me with any advice
Options says a separate page-long indemnity form known as a Member Declaration was 
provided to Mr F when he signed up for his SIPP. Ive not seen a copy of the Member 
Declaration Mr F signed, but Ive no reason to believe the content was different to the 
content of the examples Ive seen in other, similar, cases where Caledonian was involved.
The Member Declaration had a table at the start which detailed the Member Name, Address, 
Occupational Scheme name, Occupational Scheme Type and Adviser. This was signed by 
both the applicant and the Caledonian representative. The Caledonian representative was 
named as Adviser and the representatives signature was made in the space for Adviser 
Name in the signature box. The declaration included, amongst other statements, the 
following:
I confirm that I have received full and appropriate advice from Caledonian 
International and following this advice I wish to proceed with the transfer.
The declaration concluded with the statement:
I fully indemnify both Carey Pensions UK LLP and Carey Pension Trustees Ltd at all 
times against any and all liability arising from this transaction.
Mr Fs application was received by Options on 7 September 2012 and his SIPP was 
established. The funds from his AFPS pension were then invested with FPI in November 
2012.In November 2019 Mr F transferred out of his SIPP to a new pension scheme. My 
understanding is that he transferred the total transfer value at that time, and the SIPP was 
then closed.
Mr Fs complaint
Mr F complained to Options in December 2019, via a Claims Management Company (CMC). 
The CMC said Mr F was neither a sophisticated nor wealthy investor, and he could not afford 
to risk his final salary pension. The CMC highlighted the responsibility SIPP providers have 
for the quality of the business they administer and said Options had failed in its duties to 
Mr F by failing to identify issues likely to cause detriment to him. The CMC said Caledonian 
was not regulated to give advice to Mr F and Options should have not allowed the transfer 
from the final salary scheme.
Options response to Mr Fs complaint
Options investigated Mr Fs complaint and gave its final response in February 2020, rejecting 
it. In summary, it said:
As Caledonian was not a firm of regulated advisers and acted only as Mr Fs 
introducer he was classified as a direct client of Options.
Options provides execution only (i.e. non-advised) SIPP administration services and 
this was explained to Mr F in the documents he signed in 2012.
Options would have been in breach of COBS 11.2.19 if it had not executed Mr Fs 
specific instructions to make the FPI investment  by virtue of this rule Options are 
not liable to Mr F.
Options is not permitted to provide advice nor comment on the suitability of a SIPP, 
the underlying investment or the introducer the customer has chosen to use.
Options undertook due diligence on Caledonian on a number of occasions and had 
no reason to believe that it should not accept introductions from this source, at the 
time it accepted the introduction of Mr F.
By signing the documents Mr F confirmed that he understood the risks associated 
with his choices and that Options was not responsible for any of those decisions.
Options did not act inappropriately in dealing with Caledonian  Options is not 
restricted to dealing only with regulated brokers.
Caledonian was at all times treated as an unregulated introducer  Options followed 
its processes for dealing with unregulated introducers and accepting introductions.
Caledonian are not advisers and Options was not aware if they did hold themselves 
out to be so. Options documentation, provided to Mr F, recommended that he seek 
independent financial advice.
Options relationship was with Mr F only and all correspondence regarding his 
decisions and instructions came directly from him.
Mr F read and signed documentation which made clear he was a direct client, that he 
hadnt received any advice, and that his investment choices were his sole responsibility, and which guided him to seek financial advice, but he chose not to do 
so.
If Mr F believed he had received advice he did not raise the fact that the application 
form he was completing was not accurate to his situation.
Mr F signed a declaration at the end of the application form which evidences he was 
aware at all times that he was not receiving financial advice, and that Options was 
acting on an execution only basis.
It was reasonable for Options to accept Mr Fs signature confirming his 
understanding of the various documents, at face value. If he did not agree to or 
understand the documents Options provided to him then he should not have signed 
them.
As SIPP administrator Options is not responsible for assessing the suitability of an 
investment for an individuals personal situation.
Overall, Options said it had complied with its regulatory and contractual obligations to Mr F 
and was not liable to him for his loss.
Caledonian and Options
Ive set out the background to Mr Fs complaint and his dealings with Caledonian and 
Options above. But alongside those events its important to understand the underlying 
relationship between Caledonian and Options.
Options has said that it carried out due diligence checks on Caledonian and has provided 
supporting evidence of the checks it made.
I have set out below a summary of what I consider to be the key events and/or actions 
during the relationship between Options and Caledonian, which I have observed from the 
available evidence (this includes evidence from Mr Fs case file and submissions Options 
has made to us about its due diligence on, and its relationship with, Caledonian).
In March 2012 a business profile was completed which recorded Options first meeting with 
Mr C of Caledonian where he set out their proposed business model. This detailed that Mr C 
was preferred adviser (my emphasis) for the Armed Forces occupational pension scheme 
for clients who were described as:
30 to 50 year olds
Had been in the armed forces for between 6 to 10 years
Had left the armed forces and wanted to transfer their pension arrangements They 
had no expectation of long-life expectancy
They were living today so wanted to access funds earlier then they could if their 
pension stayed in the armed forces pension scheme
They were generally still resident in UK but some were now living abroad in various 
countries such as Thailand, Germany, Spain etc.They were now earning quite large salaries circa Â£70k plus
The business profile detailed that clients were referred to Mr C from his armed forces 
pensions contact or by other clients, and that he was currently putting them into an 
international Friends Provident Bond, the underlying investments were regulated. It went on:
[Mr C] himself was not a regulated adviser, he was a consultant to these clients and 
advised (my emphasis) them on their armed forces transfers only, he was a qualified 
accountant and was a member of the Chartered Institute of Accountants 
He was developing a relationship with [Mr P], and may consider [Business C] as an 
alternative investment provider in due course. Although he was currently wanting a 
relationship with a SIPP provider.
[Mr C] was looking at volume business in the region of 50 schemes a month.
On 16 March 2012 Mr C signed and dated Options Non-Regulated Introducer Profile. The 
form began:
As an FSA regulated pensions company we are required to carry out due diligence 
as best practice on unregulated introducer firms looking to introduce clients to us to 
gain some insight into the business they carry out 
In the company information section Mr C explained that Caledonian had been trading since 
1997 and had branches in Chile, Peru, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil and Switzerland. He 
went on to detail that they dealt with the following products:
Offshore savings plans + investment bonds  Friends Provident International + 
Generali
And indicated that these products had been accepted by other SIPP providers, including 
Options, and hadnt been declined by any pension scheme operators.
Under the heading Sales and Marketing Approach the document detailed that clients would 
be obtained by referral and that the sales process would be:
Referral  Visit  Analysis  Visit
A question on the form about typical commission structure was answered:
7% up front from bond  0.5% trail
Under the heading Training and Information Mr C explained that agents were provided with 
ongoing product training and accompanied meetings and that their pensions training was 
delivered through visits to providers directly. He went on to say that the business produced 
by agents was monitored by:
Full administrative structure  Caledonian, Careys  compliance, FPI  compliance
Under the heading Legal and Regulatory Information Mr C confirmed that Caledonian didnt 
work with any Financial Services Authority (FSA) regulated company or adviser, wasnt a 
member of any professional or industry body, had no professional indemnity insurance, and 
hadnt been subject to any FSA supervisory visits or censure.In response to the question: What measures are in place to ensure the Firm engage legal 
advice on the activities it carries out to ensure regulated activities are not carried out? the 
response read:
Majority of business carried out in unregulated jurisdictions but where regulations 
apply we are licensed to carry out our activities.
To the question: How does the firm demonstrate it is treating its customers fairly? the 
response read:
Compliance & Procedures in current alignment with FSA TCF.
Mr Cs other responses on the form were that Caledonians business objective was to 
continue to develop a fully compliant business of PT to HM Forces and that with regards to 
member-directed pension scheme business they were looking to achieve compliant 
business in a regulated structure.
On 23 March 2012 Options asked Mr C by email for a copy of Caledonians latest company 
accounts and a certified copy of each directors/principals passport. Options chased a 
response to this email on 3 April. A Senior Consultant at Caledonian then supplied a copy of 
Mr Cs passport (uncertified) and said theyd ask Mr C about the accounts when he returned 
from a trip. On 4 April Mr C emailed Options:
 my apologies for not having replied before now  I am back tomorrow Thursday 
and will have te [sic] appropriate documents over to you early next week 
On 27 April 2012 Options started to receive introductions from Caledonian (Options has 
confirmed there were 509 introductions to it made by Caledonian between 27 April 2012 and 
20 May 2013).
On 1 August 2012, ahead of a compliance audit, a Team Leader at Options contacted 
Caledonian to ask again for the certified passports and annual accounts. In an internal email 
the Team Leader confirmed shed spoken with Mr C and hed be sending an urgent request 
for the documentation we require.
In or around August 2012 Options had sight of a Certificate of Non-Solicitation signed by 
Mr C on behalf of Caledonian and addressed to FPI. This certificate related not to Mr Fs 
investment with FPI, but that of another client (if there was such a certificate relating to Mr 
Fs application its not something either party has provided a copy of). The certificate read:
 The company is not authorised to conduct investment business in the United 
Kingdom. We acknowledge that this means that you are only able to accept the 
introduction from us if we have not been carrying on investment business in the 
United Kingdom.
We therefore certify that:
i. We do not have a permanent place of business in the United 
Kingdom; and
ii. We did not approach the above named client
iii. The advice was given in Jordaniv.The client approached us directly and requested us to give him 
advice
On 4 September 2012 a Non-regulated Introducer Agreement Terms of Business 
document between Options and MMG Associates Ltd T/A Caledonian International 
Associates was signed and dated by Mr C and Options CEO. That agreement included, 
amongst other terms, the following undertaking:
The Business Introducer undertakes that they will not provide advice as defined by 
the Act in relation to the SIPP  for the avoidance of doubt this includes reference to 
advice on the selection of The SIPP Operator, contributions, transfer of benefits, 
taking benefits and HMRC rules;
On that agreement document Mr C gave an address in Switzerland as the business address.
Options has said that these terms of business were received by Caledonian in March 2012 - 
and so it seems there was a delay in Mr C signing and returning them.
On 1 November 2012 Options conducted a World Check (a risk intelligence tool which 
allows subscribers to conduct background checks on businesses and individuals) on two 
Caledonian employees  one of which was Mr C. This check did not reveal any issues.
Options has said that in early 2013, it appointed a dedicated in-house compliance officer 
and they enhanced the compliance framework within the firm, compliance monitoring 
programme and risk assessment.
On 7 March 2013 an internal email was sent by an Options Manager to several other 
Options employees summarising a call shed held with Mr C. The summary included these 
key points:
Options had explained that following recent FSA reviews and guidance SIPP 
providers were being asked to look at business received from their introducers 
against expectations of type and profile.
Options explained that several applications received recently had moved away from 
the expected profile of client and queried whether the profile was 
changing/extending.
Mr C explained that predominantly the members were in the close protection 
industry which as @5 years ago they all went into. He said that foreign operatives 
were now coming in in a more organised structure. Some were getting promoted into 
senior positions. Many were previously divers in the military and so going into Diving 
elsewhere.
Options asked Mr C to put together a note for its CEO to update Caledonians 
business profile and expectations.
On 20 March 2013 the Options Manager sent Mr C an email following up on their 
conversation. Options asked again for an update as to the changes in profile, and 
highlighted that a further two applications had been received for individuals outside of the 
expected profile.
Options has provided a document titled Overseas Introducer Assessment Proforma. This 
document is undated but, given that it refers to recently received business outside of profile and also the World Check completed in November 2012 I think its likely to have been 
completed around the end of March 2013, and certainly no earlier than November 2012.
I have set out below what I consider to be the most relevant parts of the form recorded, and 
the level of risk that was noted:

At the end of the Company Assessment section the overall result was recorded as Amber, 
a result described as Queries to raise. The wording against this result read:
Company details are a mixture of Green and Amber raise with technical review 
committee before proceeding.
The overall result at the end of the Advice/Client Profile/Investment section was recorded 
as Red, a result described as Decline.
On 26 April 2013 an Options Compliance Officer sent an email to several other Options 
employees titled Review of relationship with Caledonian. It began:
We have a responsibility to proactively monitor our distribution channels to ensure 
our products do not end up with customers for whom it is not suitable. Based on 
recent correspondence with Caledonian I am increasingly concerned by their 
business practices and therefore believe we should review our relationship with them 
and the business they have introduced. I will arrange a meeting for next week to 
discuss. In the meantime we need to determine the answers to the questions below 
to help facilitate our discussions.
The Options Compliance Officer then set out 18 questions and statements about Caledonian 
and the relationship with Options and invited recipients of the email to please provide 
answers to the following where you can.
On 30 April 2013 another member of the compliance team inserted her answers and 
comments:

A further reply was made later on 30 April 2013 by Options CEO. She wrote:
To add to [Options employees] information. I attach a business profile which details 
how the relationship emerged with Caledonian which provides background 
information, also the process notes that were agreed at a meeting held in our old MK 
offices which was a workshop to present our SIPP proposition and understand their

How did we establish their knowledge of UK Pension and SIPP marketplace? By 
meeting with them twice and by running a workshop for them output from which is 
attached
Based on our contact with Caledonian and reviewing the illustrations they provide to 
clients, do we have concerns that Caledonian is providing poor advice/ information? I 
am not sure it is our place to comment on this maybe on the information but not on 
advice, if we commented on whether we thought even our regulated advisers were 
providing poor advice I would probably think we would say yes. Think we need to be 
careful what questions we are looking to answer comfortable on the information piece 
but not on the advice piece
Do Caledonian provide advice on investments within the SIPP? No they don't, they 
consult with the client on the feasibility of transferring their Armed Forces Pension 
Scheme into a SIPP and their partner to manage the investment is [Business C] 
On 10 May 2013 Options CEO sent Caledonian an email requesting further information. The 
email confirmed Options was reviewing its terms of business in light of recent 
announcements from the FCA and our internal compliance reviews.
Options made clear it was keen to continue doing business with Caledonian but must do so 
in a framework that is robust and compliant and will satisfy the regulators. The email 
continued, so we must start with ensuring we understand each stage of the process, to 
enable us to develop a robust and compliant process for this business moving forward. 
Options said that as a starting point it would like Caledonian to clarify a number of issues. 
The email read:
1. Can you provide your organisational structure and the jurisdiction in which each is 
registered and the regulation/regulator that each company operates within. If you are 
relying on any exemptions please state which exemptions and the reasons you 
believe you can operate within those exemptions
2. Are you giving advice and if so in what capacity and under what regulatory 
environment are you providing this advice.
3. What offices do you have and where, do the jurisdictions in which you have offices 
have a regulatory regime, if so can you provide details of the regulators in those 
jurisdictions.
4. On what basis are you providing illustrations and the reasons for this basis
5. Do you meet all your clients in Jordan, if not why do your Non Solicitation forms 
signed by yourself confirm the advice was given in Jordan
6. Please confirm the profile of your clients
7. Please confirm how you receive introductions to your clients
8. Can you update information about your team their background, expertise in dealing 
with pensions9. On the Non Solicitation letters you note that Caledonian does not have a 
permanent place of business in the UK. However, you request correspondence to 
be sent to The Pensions Service Centre, [UK city]. Please can you clarify 
Caledonian's presence in the UK and the nature of the office in [UK city].
The email closed with a reminder to Caledonian that from 1 May 2013 Options had 
implemented some changes to its requirements and must have a UK FCA regulated adviser 
providing the TVAS and the sign off for the suitability of transfers from occupational schemes 
of any values.
On 15 May 2013 Options sent an internal email which was a summary of a telephone 
conversation with Mr P of Business C. The summary recorded that:
Mr P confirmed that an FCA Regulated Adviser would be providing the TVAS reports 
on all Caledonian introduced clients. This adviser would produce TVAS reports on 
the back book of business with Caledonian. 
On this understanding Options had agreed they would continue to process 
applications where the TVAS report was currently being issued by Mr P.
Options says that the last introduction made to it by Caledonian was on 20 May 2013.
On 23 May 2013 Options met with Mr P of Business C and Mr C of Caledonian. In the 
handwritten summary of that meeting the following was noted:
Mr C was a consultant to armed forces and not an adviser in the FCA sense.
The [UK City] address was a postal address and not a working office.
Mr C met with clients in the UK but initial contact was abroad. The client contacts 
Caledonian if they want to transfer their pension (it was noted that the documents 
said that he met them in Jordan and that FPI need a letter about where advice was 
given).
Caledonians website didnt mention that it would give advice, and their documents 
made it clear no advice was given and clients should take advice from a regulated 
adviser.
Mr P explained that the reason for lots of transfers was the market and their 
relationship with the providers.
The proposal going forward involved an appointed representative of a Manchester 
IFA (Business A) being a pension specialist of Business C  it had the necessary 
qualifications. Going forward the Manchester IFA would deal with business.
Options agreed to allow Caledonian a four-week window to put the proposal in place.
The question about advice was irrelevant to Options as no advice is given  FPI want 
a letter about advice but no advice is given.
Caledonian said its illustrations were provided to facilitate the business. Options 
queried whether this was advice.
A question was noted  is there a terms of business for Caledonian with client?I have not seen evidence that any of the agreed actions were completed. As noted, Options 
did not accept any further business from Caledonian after 20 May 2013.
Options decided to review its relationship with Caledonian. Options has provided a copy of 
its document headed, Caledonian Relationship Review 2013. I have reviewed the 
document in full, but have only quoted below what I consider to be the key part:
  Following a detailed review of the process and documentation concerns were 
raised regarding whether the clients could be deemed to be receiving advice through 
an unregulated entity.
Following a request for further clarification on these points we have not been able to 
satisfy ourselves that this is not the case.
We have insisted that they move to a model that all cases are fully advised by an 
FCA regulated firm/individual, which has been accepted 
Following a meeting in the Milton Keynes office  where [Mr C] from Caledonian, 
and [Mr P] of [Business C] explained their current process and documentation and 
described their future process, [and] further discussions  it was decided that they 
had not satisfied us enough with their current processes for us to continue to allow 
taking on new business in the interim without the use of a UK regulated firm or 
individual who was suitably qualified.
[Options] has instructed the team of this decision so from week beginning 28th May 
any new business received will be rejected unless it comes through an FCA 
regulated firm.
It set out a detailed process by which Caledonian proposed to move to a model where all 
clients would be fully advised by an FCA regulated firm/individual, and it highlighted the 
benefits of this new approach as being:
All schemes are coming in on an advised basis
Brings the process and clients into the UK regulated process
Brings the clients into the FSCS and FOS protections
Ensures all occupational schemes undergo analysis and advice
I have not seen evidence that this approach was ever enacted  again, as noted, no further 
business introduced by Caledonian was accepted by Options after 20 May 2013.
Our Investigators view
Mr F brought his complaint to this service, and it was considered by an Investigator. The 
Investigator thought the complaint should be upheld. In summary they:
Acknowledged that Options wasnt responsible for assessing the suitability of any 
advice Mr F may have received.
Accepted that the FPI investment may not itself have given cause for concern.Acknowledged that Options did take some steps which amounted to good practice 
consistent with its regulatory obligations but considered Options ought to have done 
more at the outset of its relationship with Caledonian, and in any case by the time of 
Mr Fs application and investment, identified issues with Caledonians business 
model and concluded that it should not accept Mr Fs application.
Said Options ought to have concluded at the outset of its relationship with 
Caledonian, and before the conclusion of Mr Fs application, that Caledonian would 
be giving advice  not least because Caledonians business model meant there was 
a risk that advice would be given on the merits of transferring out of the defined 
benefits occupational pension scheme, to the SIPP and on the investments to be 
made within that SIPP.
Concluded that the evidence shows advice was given by Caledonian to Mr F.
Said Options ought to have asked the questions it asked of Caledonian in May 2013 
at the outset of, or very early in, its relationship with Caledonian.
Said Options was not in a position to know whether Caledonian was following any 
applicable regulations and laws as it simply didnt know where it was carrying out its 
activities, and it wasnt clear how Caledonians business model worked logistically  
Caledonians business model should have given Options cause for concern at the 
outset.
Said Options should have been particularly concerned about whether advice was 
being given (or any other regulated activity carried on) in the UK as Caledonian was 
not authorised by the FSA or later the FCA.
Said it was likely Caledonians typical client would be reliant on Caledonians advice 
 Options should have satisfied itself that Caledonian had the appropriate 
qualifications to give advice on the complex subject of pensions transfers.
Concluded any steps taken to ascertain whether any qualifications were held would 
more likely than not have revealed they were not.
Said Options should have identified there was a clear risk of consumer detriment and 
checked that there was a reasonable process in place to fully inform consumers of 
the risks. The conclusion it reached in May 2013  that what was in place wasnt 
sufficient  should have been reached before Mr Fs application and investment.
Said Options should have declined to accept Mr Fs application because there was 
no evidence Caledonian was meeting any relevant regulations or laws, no evidence 
Caledonians staff had the necessary expertise, and no evidence of a proper advice 
process being in place.
Said Options ought also to have been concerned by the high volume of business 
brought about by Caledonian, the level of commission it was taking, and that 
Caledonian had failed to provide its company accounts despite repeated requests  
and these issues, considered alongside those about advice, should have caused 
Options to draw the conclusion it should decline to accept Mr Fs application.
Acknowledged that Mr F signed declarations but didnt think that demonstrated 
Options had acted fairly and reasonably when proceeding with his instructions 
because, ultimately, Mr Fs application should not have been accepted in the first 
place.Said she was satisfied that, if it werent for Options acceptance of the application, Mr 
Fs business would not have been able to proceed.
Finally, our Investigator set out how Options should put things right by comparing the current 
position to the position Mr F would have been in if he had not transferred from his defined 
benefit occupational pension scheme, and paying him compensation. Our Investigator also 
recommended Options pay Mr F Â£500 for the distress and inconvenience caused by its 
failings.
Options did not respond to the Investigators view. So, the complaint was passed to me to 
decide.
Prior to my consideration of the complaint, and the evidence both parties have provided, our 
Investigator wrote to both parties to address a number of outstanding issues. In summary, 
the Investigators further letter:
Acknowledged that Mr F applied for his SIPP more than six years before he made his 
complaint to Options in December 2019, but explained the Investigator had seen no 
evidence to suggest Mr F became aware (or ought reasonably to have become 
aware) that he had cause for complaint more than three years before he complained.
Updated the considerations relevant to deciding the complaint to include reference to 
both the judgment of the High Court in Adams v Options SIPP [2020] EWHC 1229 
(Ch) and the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Adams v Options UK Personal 
Pensions LLP [2021] EWCA Civ 474. They also explained that these judgements do 
not mean the Principles should not be taken into account in deciding this case, and 
highlighted the differences between Mr Fs complaint and the issues pleaded in the 
Adams cases.
Reiterated the Investigators findings that Mr F was advised by Caledonian to transfer 
out of his existing pension and into the Options SIPP, and that the steps which 
Caledonian took can fairly be said to have been such as to bring about the transfer 
from the Armed Forces Pension scheme into the Options SIPP.
The Investigator also reiterated, having taken into account the Court of Appeals 
supplementary judgment in Adams ([2021] EWCA Civ 1188), insofar as that judgment deals 
with restitution/ compensation, their view that it would not be fair to say Mr Fs actions mean 
he should bear the loss arising as a result of Options failings. And, finally, they set out some 
additional information about how redress for unsuitable defined benefit pension transfers 
should be calculated.
Mr F accepted the Investigators further view. Options did not reply. So, Ive proceeded to set 
out my final decision on Mr Fs complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive reached the same conclusion as our Investigator did and for broadly the 
same reasons, Im upholding Mr Fs complaint. Ill explain why.
Relevant considerationsIm required to determine this complaint by reference to what I consider to be fair and 
reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. When considering what is fair and 
reasonable, I am required to take into account: relevant law and regulations; regulators' 
rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to 
have been good industry practice at the relevant time.
With that in mind Ill start by setting out what I have identified as the relevant considerations 
to deciding what is fair and reasonable in this case.
The Principles
In my view, the FCAs Principles for Businesses are of particular relevance to my decision. 
The Principles for Businesses, which are set out in the FCAs handbook are a general 
statement of the fundamental obligations of firms under the regulatory system (PRIN 
1.1.2G). And, I consider that the Principles relevant to this complaint include Principles 2, 3 
and 6 which say:
Principle 2  Skill, care and diligence  A firm must conduct its business with due 
skill, care and diligence.
Principle 3  Management and control  A firm must take reasonable care to 
organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk 
management systems.
Principle 6  Customers interests  A firm must pay due regard to the interests of its 
customers and treat them fairly.
I have carefully considered the relevant law and what this says about the application of the 
FCAs Principles. In R (British Bankers Association) v Financial Services Authority [2011] 
EWHC 999 (Admin) (BBA) Ouseley J said at paragraph 162:
The Principles are best understood as the ever present substrata to which the 
specific rules are added. The Principles always have to be complied with. The 
Specific rules do not supplant them and cannot be used to contradict them. They are 
but specific applications of them to the particular requirement they cover. The general 
notion that the specific rules can exhaust the application of the Principles is 
inappropriate. It cannot be an error of law for the Principles to augment specific 
rules.
And at paragraph 77 of BBA Ouseley J said:
Indeed, it is my view that it would be a breach of statutory duty for the Ombudsman 
to reach a view on a case without taking the Principles into account in deciding what 
would be fair and reasonable and what redress to afford. Even if no Principles had 
been produced by the FSA, the FOS would find it hard to fulfil its particular statutory 
duty without having regard to the sort of high level Principles which find expression in 
the Principles, whoever formulated them. They are of the essence of what is fair and 
reasonable, subject to the argument about their relationship to specific rules.
In (R (Berkeley Burke SIPP Administration Ltd) v Financial Ombudsman Service [2018] 
EWHC 2878) (BBSAL), Berkeley Burke brought a judicial review claim challenging the 
decision of an ombudsman who had upheld a consumers complaint against it. The 
ombudsman considered the FCA Principles and good industry practice at the relevant time. 
He concluded that it was fair and reasonable for Berkeley Burke to have undertaken due diligence in respect of the investment before allowing it into the SIPP wrapper, and that if it 
had done so, it would have refused to accept the investment. The ombudsman found 
Berkeley Burke had therefore not complied with its regulatory obligations and had not treated 
its client fairly.
Jacobs J, having set out some paragraphs of BBA including paragraph 162 set out above, 
said (at paragraph 104 of BBSAL):
These passages explain the overarching nature of the Principles. As the FCA 
correctly submitted in their written argument, the role of the Principles is not merely to 
cater for new or unforeseen circumstances. The judgment in BBA shows that they 
are, and indeed were always intended to be, of general application. The aim of the 
Principles based regulation described by Ouseley J. was precisely not to attempt to 
formulate a code covering all possible circumstances, but instead to impose general 
duties such as those set out in Principles 2 and 6.
The BBSAL judgment also considers section 228 FSMA and the approach an ombudsman is 
to take when deciding a complaint. The judgment of Jacobs J in BBSAL upheld the 
lawfulness of the approach taken by the ombudsman in that complaint, which I have 
described above, and included the Principles and good industry practice at the relevant time 
as relevant considerations that were required to be taken into account.
As outlined above, Ouseley J in the BBA case held that it would be a breach of statutory 
duty if I were to reach a view on a complaint without taking the Principles into account in 
deciding what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of a case. And, Jacobs J 
adopted a similar approach to the application of the Principles in BBSAL. So, the Principles 
are a relevant consideration here and I will consider them in the specific circumstances of 
this complaint.
The Adams court cases and COBS 2.1.1R
I confirm I have taken account of the judgment of the High Court in the case of Adams v 
Options SIPP [2020] EWHC 1229 (Ch) and the Court of Appeal judgment in Adams v 
Options UK Personal Pensions LLP [2021] EWCA Civ 474. I note the Supreme Court 
refused Options permission to appeal the Court of Appeal judgment.
Ive considered whether these judgments mean that the Principles should not be taken into 
account in deciding this case. And, I am of the view they do not. In the High Court case, HHJ 
Dight did not consider the application of the Principles and they did not form part of the 
pleadings submitted by Mr Adams. One of the main reasons why HHJ Dight found that the 
judgment of Jacobs J in BBSAL was not of direct relevance to the case before him was 
because the specific regulatory provisions which the learned judge in Berkeley Burke was 
asked to consider are not those which have formed the basis of the claimants case before 
me.
Likewise, the Principles were not considered by the Court of Appeal. So, the Adams 
judgments say nothing about the application of the FCAs Principles to the ombudsmans 
consideration of a complaint.
I acknowledge that COBS 2.1.1R (A firm must act honestly, fairly and professionally in 
accordance with the best interests of its client) overlaps with certain of the Principles and 
that this rule was considered by HHJ Dight in the High Court case. Mr Adams pleaded that 
Options SIPP owed him a duty to comply with COBS 2.1.1R, a breach of which, he argued, 
was actionable pursuant to section 138(D) of FSMA (the COBS claim). HHJ Dight rejected this claim and found that Options SIPP had complied with the best interests rule on the facts 
of Mr Adams case.
Although the Court of Appeal ultimately overturned HHJ Dights judgment, it rejected that 
part of Mr Adams appeal that related to HHJ Dights dismissal of the COBS claim on the 
basis that Mr Adams was seeking to advance a case that was radically different to that found 
in his initial pleadings. The Court found that this part of Mr Adams appeal did not so much 
represent a challenge to the grounds on which HHJ Dight had dismissed the COBS claim, 
but rather was an attempt to put forward an entirely new case.
I note that HHJ Dight found that the factual context of a case would inform the extent of the 
duty imposed by COBS 2.1.1R. HHJ Dight said at para 148:
In my judgment in order to identify the extent of the duty imposed by Rule 2.1.1 one 
has to identify the relevant factual context, because it is apparent from the 
submissions of each of the parties that the context has an impact on the 
ascertainment of the extent of the duty. The key fact, perhaps composite fact, in the 
context is the agreement into which the parties entered, which defined their roles and 
functions in the transaction.
The facts in Mr Fs case are very different from those in Adams. There are also significant 
differences between the breaches of COBS 2.1.1R alleged by Mr Adams and the issues in 
Mr Fs complaint. The breaches were summarised in paragraph 120 of the Court of Appeal 
judgment. In particular, HHJ Dight considered the contractual relationship between the 
parties in the context of Mr Adams pleaded breaches of COBS 2.1.1R that happened after 
the contract was entered into. In Mr Fs complaint, I am considering whether Options ought 
to have identified that the introductions from Caledonian involved a risk of consumer 
detriment and, if so, whether it ought to have ceased accepting introductions from 
Caledonian prior to entering into a contract with Mr F.
On this point, I think it is also important to emphasise that I must determine this complaint by 
reference to what is, in my opinion, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. 
And, in doing that, I am required to take into account relevant considerations which include: 
law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, 
where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time. 
This is a clear and relevant point of difference between this complaint and the judgments in 
both Adams cases. That was a legal claim which was defined by the formal pleadings in 
Mr Adams statement of case.
To be clear, I have proceeded on the understanding Options was not obliged  and not able 
 to give advice to Mr F on the suitability of its SIPP or the FPI investment for him personally. 
But I am satisfied Options obligations included deciding whether to accept particular 
investments into its SIPP and/or whether to accept introductions of business from particular 
businesses. And this is consistent with Options own understanding of its obligations at the 
relevant time. As noted above, the Options Non-Regulated Introducer Profile completed at 
the start of Options relationship with Caledonian began:
As an FSA regulated pensions company we are required to carry out due diligence 
as best practice on unregulated introducer firms looking to introduce clients to us to 
gain some insight into the business they carry out 
Sections 27/28 of FSMAThe Court of Appeal overturned the High Court judgment on the basis of the claim pursuant 
to section 27 of FSMA. Section 27 of FSMA provides that an agreement between an 
authorised person and another party, which is otherwise properly made in the course of the 
authorised persons regulated activity, is unenforceable as against that other party if it is 
made:
in consequence of something said or done by another person (the third party) in 
the course of a regulated activity carried on by the third party in contravention of the 
general prohibition.
Section 27(2) provides that the other party is entitled to recover:
(a) any money or other property paid or transferred by him under the agreement; and
(b) compensation for any loss sustained by him as a result of having parted with it.
Section 28(3) of FSMA provides that:
If the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable in the circumstances of the case, it 
may allow 
(a) the agreement to be enforced; or
(b) money and property paid or transferred under the agreement to be retained.
The General Prohibition is set out in section 19 of FSMA. It stipulates that:
No person may carry on a regulated activity in the United Kingdom, or purport to do 
so, unless he is 
a) an authorised person; or
b) an exempt person.
In Adams, the Court of Appeal concluded that the unauthorised introducer of the SIPP had 
carried out activities in contravention of the General Prohibition, and so section 27 of FSMA 
applied. It further concluded that it would not be just and equitable to nonetheless allow the 
agreement to be enforced (or the money retained) under the discretion afforded to it by 
section 28(3) of FSMA.
At paragraph 115 of the judgment the Court set out five reasons for reaching this conclusion. 
The first two of these were:
i) A key aim of FSMA is consumer protection. It proceeds on the basis that, while 
consumers can to an extent be expected to bear responsibility for their own 
decisions, there is a need for regulation, among other things to safeguard consumers 
from their own folly.
ii) While SIPP providers were not barred from accepting introductions from 
unregulated sources, section 27 of FSMA was designed to throw risks associated 
with doing so onto the providers. Authorised persons are at risk of being unable to 
enforce agreements and being required to return money and other property and to 
pay compensation regardless of whether they had had knowledge of third parties 
contraventions of the general prohibition;
The other three reasons, in summary, were:
The volume and nature of business being introduced by the introducer was such as 
to put Options on notice of the danger that the introducer was recommending clients 
to invest in the investments and set up Options SIPPs to that end. There was thus 
reason for Options to be concerned about the possibility of the introducer advising on 
investments within the meaning of article 53 of the Financial Services and Markets 
Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (the RAO).Options was aware that: contrary to what the introducer had previously said, it was 
receiving high commission from the investment provider, there were indications that 
the introducer was offering consumers cashback and one of those running the 
introducer was subject to a FCA warning notice.
The investment did not proceed until after the time by which Options had reasons for 
concern and so it was open to Options to decline the investment, or at least explore 
the position with Mr Adams, but it did not do so.
Regulatory publications
The FCA (and its predecessor, the FSA) has issued a number of publications which remind 
SIPP operators of their obligations and set out how they might achieve the outcomes 
envisaged by the Principles, namely:
The 2009 and 2012 thematic review reports.
The October 2013 finalised SIPP operator guidance.
The July 2014 Dear CEO letter.
The 2009 Thematic Review Report
The 2009 report included the following statement:
We are very clear that SIPP operators, regardless of whether they provide advice, 
are bound by Principle 6 of the Principles for Businesses (a firm must pay due 
regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly) insofar as they are 
obliged to ensure the fair treatment of their customers. COBS 3.2.3(2) states that a 
member of a pension scheme is a client for COBS purposes, and Customer in 
terms of Principle 6 includes clients.
It is the responsibility of SIPP operators to continuously analyse the individual risks to 
themselves and their clients, with reference to the six TCF consumer outcomes.
We agree that firms acting purely as SIPP operators are not responsible for the SIPP 
advice given by third parties such as IFAs. However, we are also clear that SIPP 
operators cannot absolve themselves of any responsibility, and we would expect 
them to have procedures and controls, and to be gathering and analysing 
management information, enabling them to identify possible instances of financial 
crime and consumer detriment such as unsuitable SIPPs. Such instances could then 
be addressed in an appropriate way, for example by contacting the member to 
confirm the position, or by contacting the firm giving advice and asking for 
clarification. Moreover, while they are not responsible for the advice, there is a 
reputational risk to SIPP operators that facilitate the SIPPs that are unsuitable or 
detrimental to clients.
Of particular concern were firms whose systems and controls were weak and 
inadequate to the extent that they had not identified obvious potential instances of 
poor advice and/or potential financial crime. Depending on the facts and 
circumstances of individual cases, we may take enforcement action against SIPP 
operators who do not safeguard their clients interests in this respect, with reference 
to Principle 3 of the Principles for Business (a firm must take reasonable care to 
organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems).
The following are examples of measures that SIPP operators could consider, taken 
from examples of good practice that we observed and suggestions we have made to 
firms:
Confirming, both initially and on an ongoing basis, that intermediaries that 
advise clients are authorised and regulated by the FSA, that they have the 
appropriate permissions to give the advice they are providing to the firms 
clients, and that they do not appear on the FSA website listing warning 
notices.
Having Terms of Business agreements governing relationships, and clarifying 
respective responsibilities, with intermediaries introducing SIPP business.
Routinely recording and reviewing the type (i.e. the nature of the SIPP 
investment) and size of investments recommended by intermediaries that 
give advice and introduce clients to the firm, so that potentially unsuitable 
SIPPs can be identified.
Being able to identify anomalous investments, e.g. unusually small or large 
transactions or more esoteric investments such as unquoted shares, 
together with the intermediary that introduced the business. This would 
enable the firm to seek appropriate clarification, e.g. from the client or their 
adviser, if it is concerned about the suitability of what was recommended.
Requesting copies of the suitability reports provided to clients by the 
intermediary giving advice. While SIPP operators are not responsible for 
advice, having this information would enhance the firms understanding of its 
clients, making the facilitation of unsuitable SIPPs less likely.
Routinely identifying instances of execution-only clients who have signed 
disclaimers taking responsibility for their investment decisions, and gathering 
and analysing data regarding the aggregate volume of such business.
Identifying instances of clients waiving their cancellation rights, and the 
reasons for this.
The later publications
In the October 2013 finalised SIPP operator guidance, the FCA states:
This guide, originally published in September 2009, has been updated to give firms 
further guidance to help meet the regulatory requirements. These are not new or 
amended requirements, but a reminder of regulatory responsibilities that became a 
requirement in April 2007.
All firms, regardless of whether they do or do not provide advice must meet Principle 
6 and treat customers fairly. COBS 3.2.3(2) is clear that a member of a pension 
scheme is a client for SIPP operators and so is a customer under Principle 6. It is a 
SIPP operators responsibility to assess its business with reference to our six TCF 
consumer outcomes.
The October 2013 finalised SIPP operator guidance also set out the following:Relationships between firms that advise and introduce prospective members and 
SIPP operators
Examples of good practice we observed during our work with SIPP operators include 
the following:
Confirming, both initially and on an ongoing basis, that: introducers that 
advise clients are authorised and regulated by the FCA; that they have the 
appropriate permissions to give the advice they are providing; neither the firm, 
nor its approved persons are on the list of prohibited individuals or cancelled 
firms and have a clear disciplinary history; and that the firm does not appear 
on the FCA website listings for unauthorised business warnings.
Having terms of business agreements that govern relationships and clarify the 
responsibilities of those introducers providing SIPP business to a firm.
Understanding the nature of the introducers work to establish the nature of 
the firm, what their business objectives are, the types of clients they deal with, 
the levels of business they conduct and expect to introduce, the types of 
investments they recommend and whether they use other SIPP operators. 
Being satisfied that they are appropriate to deal with.
Being able to identify irregular investments, often indicated by unusually small 
or large transactions; or higher risk investments such as unquoted shares 
which may be illiquid. This would enable the firm to seek appropriate 
clarification, for example from the prospective member or their adviser, if it 
has any concerns.
Identifying instances when prospective members waive their cancellation 
rights and the reasons for this.
Although the members advisers are responsible for the SIPP investment 
advice given, as a SIPP operator the firm has a responsibility for the quality of 
the SIPP business it administers.
Examples of good practice we have identified include:
conducting independent verification checks on members to ensure the 
information they are being supplied with, or that they are providing the firm 
with, is authentic and meets the firms procedures and are not being used to 
launder money
having clear terms of business agreements in place which govern 
relationships and clarify responsibilities for relationships with other 
professional bodies such as solicitors and accountants, and
using non-regulated introducer checklists which demonstrate the SIPP 
operators have considered the additional risks involved in accepting business 
from nonregulated introducers
In relation to due diligence the October 2013 finalised SIPP operator guidance said:
Due diligencePrinciple 2 of the FCAs Principles for Businesses requires all firms to conduct their business 
with due skill, care and diligence. All firms should ensure that they conduct and retain 
appropriate and sufficient due diligence (for example, checking and monitoring introducers 
as well as assessing that investments are appropriate for personal pension schemes) to help 
them justify their business decisions. In doing this SIPP operators should consider:
ensuring that all investments permitted by the scheme are permitted by 
HMRC, or where a tax charge is incurred, that charge is identifiable, HMRC is 
informed and the tax charge paid
periodically reviewing the due diligence the firm undertakes in respect of the 
introducers that use their scheme and, where appropriate enhancing the 
processes that are in place in order to identify and mitigate any risks to the 
members and the scheme
having checks which may include, but are not limited to:
oensuring that introducers have the appropriate permissions, 
qualifications and skills to introduce different types of business to the 
firm, and
oundertaking additional checks such as viewing Companies House 
records, identifying connected parties and visiting introducers
ensuring all third-party due diligence that the firm uses or relies on has been 
independently produced and verified
good practices we have identified in firms include having a set of 
benchmarks, or minimum standards, with the purpose of setting the minimum 
standard the firm is prepared to accept to either deal with introducers or 
accept investments, and
ensuring these benchmarks clearly identify those instances that would lead a 
firm to decline the proposed business, or to undertake further investigations 
such as instances of potential pension liberation, investments that may 
breach HMRC tax relievable investments and non-standard investments that 
have not been approved by the firm
The July 2014 Dear CEO letter provides a further reminder that the Principles apply and an 
indication of the FCAs expectations about the kinds of practical steps a SIPP operator might 
reasonably take to achieve the outcomes envisaged by the Principles.
The Dear CEO letter also sets out how a SIPP operator might meet its obligations in 
relation to investment due diligence. It says those obligations could be met by:
Correctly establishing and understanding the nature of an investment
Ensuring that an investment is genuine and not a scam, or linked to fraudulent 
activity, money-laundering or pensions liberation
Ensuring that an investment is safe/secure (meaning that custody of assets is 
through a reputable arrangement, and any contractual agreements are correctly 
drawn-up and legally enforceable)Ensuring that an investment can be independently valued, both at point of purchase 
and subsequently
Ensuring that an investment is not impaired (for example that previous investors have 
received income if expected, or that any investment providers are credit worthy etc)
Although Ive referred to selected parts of the publications, to illustrate their relevance, I have 
considered them in their entirety.
I acknowledge that the 2009 and 2012 reports and the Dear CEO letter are not formal 
guidance (whereas the 2013 finalised guidance is). However, the fact that the reports and 
Dear CEO letter did not constitute formal guidance does not mean their importance should 
be underestimated. They provide a reminder that the Principles for Businesses apply and 
are an indication of the kinds of things a SIPP operator might do to ensure it is treating its 
customers fairly and produce the outcomes envisaged by the Principles. In that respect the 
publications, which set out the regulators expectations of what SIPP operators should be 
doing, also goes some way to indicate what I consider amounts to good industry practice 
and I am, therefore, satisfied it is appropriate to take them into account.
It is relevant that when deciding what amounted to have been good industry practice in the 
BBSAL case, the ombudsman found that the regulators reports, guidance and letter go a 
long way to clarify what should be regarded as good practice and what should not. And the 
judge in BBSAL endorsed the lawfulness of the approach taken by the Ombudsman.
Like the Ombudsman in the BBSAL case, I do not think the fact the publications, (other than 
the 2009 Thematic Review Report), post-date the events that took place in relation to Mr Fs 
complaint, mean that the examples of good practice they provide were not good practice at 
the time of the relevant events. Although the later publications were published after the 
events subject to this complaint, the Principles that underpin them existed throughout, as did 
the obligation to act in accordance with the Principles.
It is also clear from the text of the 2009 and 2012 reports (and the Dear CEO letter in 2014) 
that the regulator expected SIPP operators to have incorporated the recommended good 
practices into the conduct of their business already. So, whilst the regulators comments 
suggest some industry participants understanding of how the good practice standards 
shaped what was expected of SIPP operators changed over time, it is clear the standards 
themselves had not changed.
I note that HHJ Dight in the Adams case did not consider the 2012 thematic review, 2013 
SIPP operator guidance and 2014 Dear CEO letter to be of relevance to his consideration 
of Mr Adams claim. But it does not follow that those publications are irrelevant to my 
consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I am 
required to take into account good industry practice at the relevant time. And, as mentioned, 
the publications indicate what I consider amounts to good industry practice at the relevant 
time.
That doesnt mean that, in considering what is fair and reasonable, I will only consider 
Options actions with these documents in mind. The reports, Dear CEO letter and guidance 
gave non-exhaustive examples of good industry practice. They did not say the suggestions 
given were the limit of what a SIPP operator should do. As the annex to the Dear CEO 
letter notes, what should be done to meet regulatory obligations will depend on the 
circumstances.
To be clear, I do not say the Principles or the publications obliged Options to ensure the pension transfer was suitable for Mr F. It is accepted Options was not required to give advice 
to Mr F, and could not give advice. And I accept the publications do not alter the meaning of, 
or the scope of, the Principles. But they are evidence of what I consider to have been good 
industry practice at the relevant time, which would bring about the outcomes envisaged by 
the Principles.
What did Options obligations mean in practice?
In this case, the business Options was conducting was its operation of SIPPs. I am satisfied 
that meeting its regulatory obligations when conducting this business would include deciding 
whether to accept or reject particular investments and/or referrals of business. The 
regulatory publications provided some examples of good industry practice observed by the 
FSA and FCA during their work with SIPP operators including being satisfied that a particular 
introducer is appropriate to deal with.
As noted above, it is clear from Options Non-Regulated Introducer Profile, that it 
understood and accepted its obligations meant that it had a responsibility to carry out due 
diligence on Caledonian.
I am satisfied that, to meet its regulatory obligations, when conducting its business, Options 
was required to consider whether to accept or reject particular referrals of business, with the 
Principles in mind. This seems consistent with Options own understanding  as Options 
Compliance Officer noted in their email of 26 April 2013, We have a responsibility to 
proactively monitor our distribution channels to ensure our products do not end up with 
customers for whom it is not suitable. And I note in submissions on other complaints 
Options has told us that adherence to TCF is something it had in mind when considering its 
approach to introducer due diligence i.e. the question of whether it should accept business 
from a particular introducer.
All in all, I am satisfied that, in order to meet the appropriate standards of good industry 
practice and the obligations set by the regulators rules and regulations, Options should have 
carried out due diligence on Caledonian which was consistent with good industry practice 
and its regulatory obligations at the time. And in my opinion, Options should have used the 
knowledge it gained from its due diligence to decide whether to accept or reject a referral of 
business or particular investment.
Summary of my decision
As set out above, the 2009 Thematic Review Report deals specifically with the relationships 
between SIPP operators and introducers or intermediaries. And it gives non-exhaustive 
examples of good practice. In my view, to meet these standards, and its regulatory 
obligations, set by the Principles, Options ought to have identified a significant risk of 
consumer detriment arising from the business model Caledonian described to it at the 
outset. And so, Options ought to have ensured it thought very carefully about accepting 
applications from Caledonian.
I acknowledge Options did take some steps  initially and on an ongoing basis  which did 
amount to good practice consistent with its regulatory obligations. But I think, acting fairly 
and reasonably to meet its regulatory obligations and good industry practice, Options had 
reason at the outset  and certainly by the time of Mr Fs application  to have significant 
concerns about the business Caledonian would be introducing. And it ought to have taken 
the sort of action it took in April and May 2013  which effectively ended its relationship with 
Caledonian  before the relationship with Caledonian began.Acting fairly and reasonably, Options should have:
Been aware  or at least concluded there was a significant risk  at the outset of its 
relationship with Caledonian, that Caledonian was giving advice on the transfer out of 
consumers existing defined benefit schemes to the SIPP and the investment in the 
FPI bond.
Been aware that Caledonian was arranging the transfer out of consumers existing 
defined benefit schemes to the SIPP and the investment in the FPI bond too.
Sought clarification on where these activities were taking place.
Concluded Caledonian was, in at least some instances, carrying out regulated 
activities in the UK.
Further, Options should have recognised, and promptly reacted to, the following risks of 
consumer detriment:
Caledonians staff did not have the qualifications  and therefore expertise  to give 
advice on defined benefit pension transfers.
There was no evidence to show a proper advice process had been followed and 
consumers such as Mr F were therefore unable to make fully informed decisions 
about the transfer to the SIPP and investment in the FPI bond.
The high volume of business being proposed/brought about by Caledonian.
The high level of commission Caledonian was taking.
That Caledonian had failed to provide its company accounts, despite repeated 
requests for copies of them by Options.
I think these points  individually and cumulatively  should have led Options, acting fairly 
and reasonably, to have concluded at the outset  and certainly by the time of Mr Fs 
application (in or around August 2012)  that it should not accept business from Caledonian. 
And so, Mr Fs application should not have proceeded.
It follows that it is fair and reasonable to uphold Mr Fs complaint.
I have set out my view in more detail below.
What activities did Caledonian undertake and what should Options have concluded?
Advice
I note that in its response to this Services findings in other similar cases involving business 
introduced by Caledonian, Options says it did not at any point become aware that 
Caledonian were providing advice. This is a surprising assertion, given Options recorded in 
March 2013, when assessing Caledonian, under the heading Advice:
No details of how advice given. No regulatory bodies / permissions seen. Although 
suggested on email that advice given in Jordan?Advice possibly given in Jordan, although not sure if true for UK based clients.
And so, it seems Options understood at this point that advice was being given. To ask 
questions about how and where advice was being given, the conclusion must first have been 
reached that advice was being given. There is nothing to suggest this was a view it had 
recently reached  rather it seems that it was an existing understanding which was being 
flagged as an issue for the first time.
When further action on this point was eventually taken by Options a member of its staff said, 
on 30 April 2013 No they [Caledonian] don't [give advice], they consult with the client on the 
feasibility of transferring their [occupational pension scheme] into a SIPP.
This seems to be an effort to back-track on the earlier answers given to the questions in the 
26 April 2013 email, which appear to accept Caledonian was giving advice, although much 
else was unknown. But, to my mind, describing Caledonians role as consulting on the 
feasibility of doing something is simply another way of describing an advisory role. It would 
also have been clear to Options that Caledonians role was not limited to advice on the 
transfer out of the consumers existing scheme  it was declared on the FPI applications that 
Caledonian was giving advice on the bond too, and so any consulting was not solely limited 
to the transfer out from the existing scheme. This was clearly not viewed by Options as a 
satisfactory answer to this point in any event as its enquiries continued and, on 10 May 
2013, Options asked Caledonian:
Are you giving advice and if so in what capacity and under what regulatory 
environment are you providing this advice.
This shows Options was clearly of the view at this point that, at the very least, Caledonian 
might be giving advice as there is no other basis on which it could have sought clarification 
from Caledonian as to whether advice was being given.
It seems this was a view Options maintained. As set out above, it later noted:
Following a detailed review of the process and documentation concerns were raised 
regarding whether the clients could be deemed to be receiving advice through an 
unregulated entity.
Following a request for further clarification on these points we have not been able to 
satisfy ourselves that this is not the case.
And it ultimately concluded all business should come to it through a UK IFA with permissions 
to give pension transfer advice  an unusual step to take if it did not remain of the view there 
was at least a risk Caledonian was giving advice.
The above suggests to me that Options knew  or suspected  advice was being given from 
the outset but took a reactive, piecemeal approach to addressing this obvious risk.
Furthermore, from the information available to Options at the very outset of its relationship 
with Caledonian there was a clear identifiable risk that advice was being given by 
Caledonian. Caledonian said, at the outset, it was:
preferred adviser for the Armed Forces occupational pension scheme
a consultant to these clients and advised them on their armed forces transfers onlycurrently putting them into an international Friends Provident Bond
And Caledonians sales process was described as:
Referral  Visit  Analysis  Visit
Finally, as mentioned, many of the FPI applications I have seen, confirm Caledonian was 
giving advice (in Jordan  a point Ill turn to below) and Options would have been privy to 
many of these forms from an early stage in its relationship with Caledonian.
I note it was recorded that Caledonian advised on the transfer only, but it was also recorded 
that it was selecting the investment vehicle (the FPI bond). And it is also very difficult to see 
how advice on a transfer out did not encompass advice on where to transfer to (i.e. the 
SIPP)  particularly when it was clearly anticipated that all consumers would be transferring 
to an Options SIPP. It is not clear how this could happen without those consumers being 
advised to take this course of action.
Furthermore, the Referral  Visit  Analysis  Visit process Caledonian describes is a 
typical advice process involving an initial meeting, information gathering and analysis, and a 
further meeting.
Options should also have been aware that it is not usual for pension transfers to happen 
without the consumer receiving advice or a recommendation  and very unusual for this to 
happen at a rate of 50 a month, which Caledonian was proposing. Options should have 
concluded that it was simply implausible that such a large volume of consumers were 
deciding to transfer out of their existing schemes, open a SIPP with Options, and make the 
same FPI investments within the SIPP without being advised to do so.
I note Options terms of business with Caledonian, signed September 2012 (but, Options 
says, in place since March 2012) said:
The Business Introducer undertakes that they will not provide advice as defined by 
the Act in relation to the SIPP  for the avoidance of doubt this includes reference to 
advice on the selection of The SIPP Operator, contributions, transfer of benefits, 
taking benefits and HMRC rules;
I also note the SIPP application form which was signed by Mr F said:
This Form should be used if you are a client establishing a SIPP without advice. You 
have made this decision independently and are aware of the implications of this 
decision.
And:
As you do not have a Financial Adviser, your investment choices are your sole 
responsibility. You will instruct us and we will act on those instructions as long as it is 
an accepted investment in the Carey Pension Scheme.
But Options Member Declarations included the following:
I confirm that I have received full and appropriate advice from Caledonian 
International and following this advice I wish to proceed with the transfer.So, I do not think the application documents in this case gave Options any basis to conclude 
advice had not been given  particularly given what I say above. They present a confused, 
inconsistent, picture.
Taking account of the available evidence I consider that, in this case, Caledonian did provide 
advice to Mr F on the merits of transferring his pension to the SIPP and investing in the FPI 
bond. Mr Fs own account of events is that Caledonian advised him hed be better off and 
convinced him to transfer out, open the Options SIPP and invest with FPI. And Mr F was 
under the impression the Caledonian representative was an expert. A transfer wasnt 
something hed previously been considering until he was approached by Caledonian, and he 
wasnt offered a range of other pension products; Caledonian recommended the FPI 
investment. Indeed, the FPI investment details were typed/pre-populated on the SIPP 
application form by Caledonian for Mr Fs signature.
The evidence is that the Caledonian representative presented themselves as an Adviser to 
Mr F. As Ive highlighted above, the Caledonian representatives signature was made in the 
space for Adviser Name on the Member Declaration accompanying the SIPP application 
form.
So, I am satisfied advice was given to Mr F by Caledonian in this case, and that, from the 
outset of its relationship with Caledonian, Options was (or at the very least ought to have 
been) aware, generally, that Caledonian was offering advice to consumers, or there was a 
significant risk it might be doing so.
Arranging
It is also clear from what Options was told by Caledonian at the outset  and from the 
available evidence in this complaint and others  that Caledonian was heavily involved in the 
arrangement of the transfer out of Mr Fs existing pension scheme to the SIPP and the 
investment of the cash transferred to the SIPP in the FPI bond. It clearly was not simply 
introducing Mr F to Options and leaving it to him to proceed with the application. It was 
involved in the setting up of the SIPP and in arranging the FPI bond and associated 
investments. It was involved in gathering all the information and documents needed for 
things to proceed. And it seems it partly completed the SIPP application form for Mr F, and 
sent all the required information, forms, documents etc to all the parties involved, and dealt 
with any queries arising from these.
I think Options ought to have been aware of this. The extent of Caledonians involvement 
was clear from the application documentation Caledonian sent to Options.
Where were the activities taking place?
I have not seen any evidence that, prior to May 2013, Options established where Caledonian 
was carrying out its activities in relation to each application  including Mr Fs.
As set out above, Caledonian told Options at the outset that They [the consumers] were 
generally still resident in UK but some were now living abroad in various countries such as 
Thailand, Germany, Spain etc. It was also recorded that Caledonian had branches in Chile, 
Peru, Columbia, Argentina, Brazil and Switzerland. And, as Options later noted, Caledonian 
also used a UK address.
Caledonian also told Options at the outset the Majority of business carried out in 
unregulated jurisdictions but where regulations apply we are licensed to carry out our 
activities.And, as mentioned, the sales process adopted by Caledonian was set out as Referral  
Visit  Analysis  Visit. So, it was clear Caledonian was meeting consumers in person.
Furthermore, the Certificate of Non-Solicitation signed by Caledonian for FPI  to which 
Options was privy  said in each instance (as far as Im aware) The advice was given in 
Jordan.
Caledonian therefore gave what appears to be conflicting information. But Options ought to 
have been aware, from what was said by Caledonian, that it was possible Caledonian might 
be dealing with a UK resident consumer in the UK, or dealing with a consumer in any one of 
a number of different countries, all of which might have different financial services regulatory 
regimes (or no such regime).
It is fair to say the picture was far from clear  and Options should have been aware it was 
unlikely all of the information provided by Caledonian could be correct. It is not, for example, 
clear how the advice in every instance could have been given in Jordan when, by 
Caledonians own account, it had a number of offices around the world (none of which were 
in Jordan), was dealing with consumers who were generally still resident in UK or living 
abroad in various countries and said elsewhere that it was carrying out business in various 
jurisdictions.
Options did not, however, check any of this at the outset. It was therefore in no position to 
know what, if any, regulatory regimes applied, and whether Caledonian required any 
authorisations to conduct the activities it did. Caledonian itself appears to have suggested it 
needed licences in some jurisdictions, but I have seen no evidence of it having given 
details of any such licences.
I think Options should have been particularly concerned  given that, as mentioned, 
Caledonian told Options the consumers it dealt with were generally still resident in UK  
about whether advice was being given (or any other regulated activity carried on) in the UK, 
as Caledonian was not authorised by the FSA nor, later, the FCA. There was reason, as Ive 
explained, to think Caledonian might be breaching the General Prohibition against persons 
carrying on a regulated activity in the UK without authorisation. Despite this, I have seen no 
evidence to show Options identified this risk until March 2013 when, as set out above, it was 
noted:
No details of how advice given. No regulatory bodies / permissions seen. Although 
suggested on email that advice given in Jordan?
Advice possibly given in Jordan, although not sure if true for UK based clients.
Then no further action appears to have been taken until 26 April 2013 when, in a further 
internal email exchange at Options, the following questions were asked, and answers were 
received on 30 April 2013 (the below, in bold, are the first set of answers provided on this 
date):
Do they have a business address in the UK? They confirm that they do not have 
a permanent place of business in the UK, however they have a business 
address for correspondence and [Mr C] is based in the UK.
Where do they meet with clients, i.e. in the UK? Unknown.
What is Caledonian's regulatory status, i.e. are they regulated in their home 
jurisdiction? [Mr C] - The Chartered Insurance Institute  ID Number XXXXX. [Mr C] certifies all ID and signs the investment Application Form.
Are they regulated to provide advice in their home jurisdiction? Unknown
They have confirmed that they provide advice in Jordan. How does this work? Do 
they have a place of business in Jordan? Do they need to be regulated in Jordan to 
provide advice?
Unknown - Caledonian provide a Non Solicitation Letter which is sent to 
Friends Provident with the investment App. A copy of a Non Solicitation Letter 
is attached
Despite the uncertainty it was not until 10 May 2013, when Options finally challenged 
Caledonian on this point (amongst others):
Can you provide your organisational structure and the jurisdiction in which each is 
registered and the regulation/regulator that each company operates within. If you are 
relying on any exemptions please state which exemptions and the reasons you 
believe you can operate within those exemptions
What offices do you have and where, do the jurisdictions in which you have offices 
have a regulatory regime, if so can you provide details of the regulators in those 
jurisdictions.
Do you meet all your clients in Jordan, if not why do your Non Solicitation forms 
signed by yourself confirm the advice was given in Jordan
On the Non Solicitation letters you note that Caledonian does not have a permanent 
place of business in the UK. However, you request correspondence to be sent to The 
Pensions Service Centre, [UK City]. Please can you clarify Caledonian's presence in 
the UK and the nature of the office in [UK City].
Given what I say above, acting fairly and reasonably, Options should have made these 
enquiries at the outset. And as set out in the background, these enquiries (along with the 
other points of query put to Caledonian and then discussed with it) led to Options quickly 
concluding it should not accept further applications from Caledonian unless they came 
through a UK IFA with permissions to give pension transfer advice  a restriction which it 
seems had the effect of no further business being introduced by Caledonian. I think it fair to 
say that Options would have reached the same conclusion had it taken this action at the 
outset of its relationship with Caledonian. And it certainly should have done so, to act fairly 
and reasonably to meet its regulatory obligations and standards of good practice.
In Mr Fs case, although his permanent address was in the UK in 2012, hes told us he met 
with the Caledonian representative abroad; at an airport in the Country he was working in. 
So, it seems unlikely that Caledonian carried out regulated activities in the UK in relation to 
Mr Fs case. However, that does not mean that, in the interests of its customer, Options 
shouldnt have taken steps to establish the regulatory regime or regimes Caledonian were 
operating under. I think its also fair to say that in relation to other applications, from 
customers other than Mr F, Options ought to have been aware that regulated activities were 
taking place in the UK. And if Options had developed that awareness, as I believe it should 
have, through taking appropriate steps at the start of its relationship with Caledonian, then 
Options should have declined to enter into a relationship with Caledonian at all or at least 
ended its relationship with Caledonian before accepting Mr Fs application. I think this was 
the only fair and reasonable step it could take in the circumstances.Caledonians expertise
Caledonians proposed business model, as documented at Options first meeting with its 
representative, involved former members of the armed forces who, it said, worked in security 
related jobs in dangerous areas. The business model was not one involving, say, former 
financial advisers or other finance professionals.
There was therefore no reason to think that the typical client Caledonian was proposing to 
introduce to Options had a good level of understanding of pensions or was in a position to 
work out for themselves if a pension transfer was in their best interests. They would be 
reliant on Caledonians advice.
The introductions involved transfers out of a defined benefit pension scheme into a UK SIPP 
for investment in several investments within an FPI bond. The transfers of defined benefit 
(final salary) pensions are usually not in the customers best interests, are complex and 
present a variety of consequences and matters which the ordinary individual would be hard 
pressed to understand without professional financial advice. Those giving such advice in the 
UK are required by the FCA to pass specialist exams, reflecting the risks and complexities 
involved. Options, as a provider of SIPPs, would or ought to have been aware of this.
Not only did Caledonians advisers not have the qualifications required by the FCA (or FSA 
as it then was) to give advice on pension transfers, there is no evidence they had any 
relevant qualifications. The only qualification of any kind which is mentioned is that Mr C of 
Caledonian is a qualified accountant.
I have seen no evidence to show Options noted this obvious risk until March 2013 when it 
reviewed its relationship with Caledonian and Professional Qualification was assessed as 
high risk. The reason for this assessment was No qualifications documented other than 
meeting note from March 2012 where [Mr C] stated he was a qualified accountant and 
member of Chartered Institute of Accountants.
And, despite this high risk flag, I have seen no evidence Options took any action until 
26 April 2013 when it was asked How did we establish Caledonians knowledge of SIPPs 
and UK pension rules? The answer to this was initially recorded on 30 April as unknown. 
The later answer on 30 April was, By meeting with them twice and by running a workshop 
for them output from which is attached". But I do not think this is enough to show Options 
had sufficiently addressed this risk  it does nothing to show Caledonian's staff had 
adequate professional qualifications.
Indeed, this (along with the other points of query raised at the time) was a point which led to 
Options quickly concluding it should not accept further applications from Caledonian unless 
they came through a UK IFA with permissions to give pension transfer advice  a restriction 
which had the effect of no further business being introduced by Caledonian. And I think it fair 
to say Options would have reached the same conclusion had it taken this action at the outset 
of its relationship with Caledonian. And it certainly should have done so to meet its 
regulatory obligations and standards of good practice.
The transfer process
As mentioned above, a defined benefit transfer is a complex transaction. It also involves 
many risks, and potentially the loss of significant guaranteed benefits. For this reason, 
advice on such transactions is tightly regulated in the UK and there are standards of good 
practice that those giving the advice are expected to follow. This means several steps need 
to be taken as part of the advice process and documentation such as fact-finds, suitability reports, transfer analysis reports (TVAS), and illustrations generally feature in the advice 
process. The purpose is to ensure any advice given takes into account all relevant factors, is 
suitable, and the recipient of the advice is in a fully informed position, where they understand 
the benefits they are giving up and the risks associated with the transfer.
I have seen no evidence to show Caledonian followed such a process. In my opinion it would 
have been fair and reasonable for Options to have identified this as a clear risk of consumer 
detriment  particularly given that Caledonians starting point appears to have been that the 
consumers it dealt with would be transferring out of the defined benefit scheme (i.e. it seems 
to have taken the view a transfer was suitable for all).
Had Options taken steps to ascertain if a reasonable process was in place, it would have 
become aware no such process was in place, and consumers were not therefore fully 
informed before agreeing to make the transfer to the SIPP and the associated FPI bond 
investments.
Options reference to Illustrations in the list of questions in the 26 April 2013 email, and the 
initial answers to those questions, appears to be a further acknowledgement of the risk:
Based on our contact with Caledonian and reviewing the illustrations they provide to 
clients, do we have concerns that Caledonian is providing poor advice/ information? 
Yes due to illustrations
Again, this (along with the other points of query raised at the time) appears to be a point 
which led to Options quickly concluding it should not accept further applications from 
Caledonian unless they came through a UK IFA with permissions to give pension transfer 
advice  a restriction which had the effect of no further business being introduced by 
Caledonian. And I think it fair to say Options would have reached the same conclusion had it 
taken this action at the outset of its relationship with Caledonian. And it certainly should have 
done so, on a fair and reasonable basis to meet its regulatory obligations and standards of 
good practice.
Volume of business
At the outset of the relationship between Options and Caledonian, Options was told that 
Caledonian would be introducing about 50 applications a month (and I note a similar volume 
was introduced once the relationship began).
I think on a fair and reasonable basis, Options should have been concerned that Caledonian 
intended to (and did) make such a high volume of introductions, relating only to occupational 
pension schemes. In my view this was a further reason for Options to conclude there was a 
significant risk of consumer detriment  particularly when considered alongside the other 
points I have set out here.
Firstly, it is not clear how Caledonian would be, or was, bringing about such a high volume of 
applications without giving advice. It was simply implausible it could bring about this number 
of applications without influencing consumers actions through a positive recommendation.
Options also ought to have considered Caledonians competence to deal with this volume of 
transfers  there is no evidence to show it had the significant resources this would require. 
Further, Options should have been aware of the very low likelihood the transfers would all be 
suitable. At the outset of Options relationship with Caledonian (and the time of Mr Fs 
application) COBS 19.1.6 G said:When advising a retail client who is, or eligible to be, a member of a defined benefits 
occupational pension scheme whether to transfer or opt out, a firm should start by 
assuming that a transfer or opt out will not be suitable (my emphasis). A firm should 
only then consider a transfer or opt out to be suitable if it can clearly demonstrate, on 
contemporary evidence that the transfer or opt out is in the clients best interest.
I accept this aims to define the expectation of a regulated financial adviser when determining 
suitability of a pension transfer, but Id expect Options, as a pensions provider, to have been 
aware of this and to have taken account of it.
Finally, Options had cause to question the motivations of Caledonian, if it were bringing 
about such a high volume of applications. There was a clear risk that Caledonian was putting 
its own interests above those of Mr F.
Commission
I also think the level of commission that was being paid to Caledonian should have given 
Options cause for concern.
It appears Caledonian was typically taking around 7% of the transfer amount in commission, 
and Options was told this was the case at the outset of its relationship. There is no evidence 
to show Caledonian carried out any of the usual work associated with a defined benefit 
transfer that would justify such a fee. Nor have I seen any other evidence to show there was 
any justification for such a high level of commission in the circumstances. I think this level of 
commission ought to have been another cause for Options to be concerned that Caledonian 
was putting its own interests ahead of the interests of consumers, including Mr F. And, of 
course, it was further reason to consider Caledonian might be giving advice, as commission 
at this level would have been very likely to motivate it to encourage consumers to proceed, 
through a positive recommendation.
Overall, when considered alongside the high volumes of near identical introductions of 
business being made by Caledonian, I think this level of commission raises questions about 
the motives and role of Caledonian.
Caledonians Accounts
I note that Options made repeated requests for Caledonian's accounts. It sent several emails 
to Caledonian between March and August 2012. Options also explained in its email of 
23 March 2012 that in order to comply with its own compliance procedures this was needed.
Nevertheless, on 27 April 2012 Options started accepting introductions from Caledonian 
having not received the accounts  seemingly in breach of its own procedures. Acting fairly 
and reasonably, Options should have met its own standards and should have checked 
Caledonians accounts at the outset before accepting any business from it. And, based on 
Caledonians conduct, it seems very unlikely accounts would ever have been forthcoming.
Caledonians reluctance to provide basic information should also have been a further factor 
which ought to have led Options to question whether it should enter into or continue a 
relationship with Caledonian. This again calls into question the competence and motivations 
of Caledonian and it also calls into question the ability of Caledonian to organise its affairs. It 
also meant Options was missing information which might be critical to the decision as to 
whether to enter into business with Caledonian, such as, for example, information about the 
nature, volume and location of Caledonians business, and its resources to carry on that 
business.It is notable that Options accepted and set up Mr Fs SIPP when it was still waiting for this 
information from Caledonian.
In conclusion
Taking all of the above into consideration  individually and cumulatively  I think in the 
circumstances it is fair and reasonable for me to conclude that Options ought reasonably to 
have concluded, had it complied with its regulatory obligations which required it to conduct 
sufficient due diligence on Caledonian and draw fair and reasonable conclusions from what it 
discovered, that it should not accept business from Caledonian, including Mr Fs application. 
I therefore conclude that it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances to say that Options 
should not have accepted Mr Fs application from Caledonian.
Did Options act fairly and reasonably in proceeding with Mr Fs instructions?
In my view, for the reasons given, Options simply should have refused to accept Mr Fs 
application. So, things should not have got beyond that. However, for completeness, I have 
considered whether it was fair and reasonable for Options to proceed with Mr Fs application.
I acknowledge Mr F signed an Options declaration. I note this document does give warnings 
about the loss of benefits that would result in the transfer to the SIPP. And the indemnities 
sought to confirm that Mr F would not hold Options responsible for any losses resulting from 
the investments. However, I dont think this document demonstrates Options acted fairly and 
reasonably by proceeding with Mr Fs instructions.
Asking Mr F to sign a declaration absolving Options of all its responsibilities when it ought to 
have known that Mr Fs dealings with Caledonian were putting him at significant risk was not 
the fair and reasonable thing to do. I also note that the declaration was based on Mr F 
having received full and appropriate advice from Caledonian International where, for the 
reasons I have given, Options ought to have been aware Caledonian did not have the 
competency to give such advice and there were questions about its motivations and 
integrity.
Asking Mr F to sign declarations was not an effective way for Options to meet its regulatory 
obligations, given the concerns Options ought to have identified about his introduction. So, it 
was not fair and reasonable to proceed, on the basis of these. I make this point only for 
completeness  the primary point is Mr F should simply not have been able to proceed, as 
his application should simply not have been accepted.
Fair compensation
I note Options has said, in response to this Services findings in similar cases, that its 
evident consumers such as Mr F wished to transfer their pensions, whether through Options 
or another provider and would therefore have suffered the same losses as they did even if it 
had rejected their applications.
I have seen no evidence to show that Mr F would have proceeded even if Options had 
rejected his application. The way Mr F became involved with Caledonian was consistent with 
Caledonians business model of approaching ex-servicemen and encouraging them to 
consider transferring out of their pensions. And on meeting with Caledonian, he was 
encouraged to transfer out of his existing pension on the understanding that Caledonian 
would increase the value of his pension. Ive seen nothing to suggest he was looking to 
make a transfer prior to Caledonian contacting him.I have not, in any event, seen any evidence that any other SIPP operator dealt with 
Caledonian. And any operator acting fairly and reasonably should have reached the 
conclusion it should not deal with Caledonian. I do not think it would be fair to say Mr F 
should not be compensated based on speculation that another SIPP operator might have 
made the same mistakes as Options.
For similar reasons, I am not persuaded Mr F should not be compensated by Options, or his 
compensation should be reduced, because I have not made the finding that the FPI bond 
investment, in itself, was not something Options should have accepted. Or because the 
benefits from Mr Fs existing pension were lost once the transfer request was made. If 
Options had acted fairly and reasonably to meet its regulatory obligations and good industry 
practice, the application would not have proceeded at all. So, no transfer request or FPI 
bond investment would have been made.
So, I am satisfied that Options failure to comply with its regulatory obligations and industry 
best practice at the relevant time have led to Mr F suffering a significant loss to his pension. 
And my aim is therefore to return Mr F to the position he would likely now be in but for 
Options failings.
When considering this Ive taken into account the Court of Appeals supplementary judgment 
in Adams ([2021] EWCA Civ 1188), insofar as that judgment deals with restitution/ 
compensation.
Putting things right
In light of my above findings, in my view Options should calculate fair compensation by 
comparing the current position to the position Mr F would be in if he had not transferred from 
his existing pension. In summary, Options should:
1. Calculate the loss Mr F has suffered as a result of making the transfer.
2. Take ownership of any investments which cant be surrendered, if possible.
3. Pay compensation for the loss into Mr Fs pension. If that is not possible pay 
compensation for the loss to Mr F direct. In either case the payment should take into 
account necessary adjustments set out below.
4. Pay Mr F Â£500 for the distress and inconvenience caused by its failure to act fairly 
and reasonably.
Ill explain how Options should carry out the calculation set out at 1-3 above in further detail 
below:
Calculate the loss Mr F has suffered as a result of making the transfer (the loss calculation)
On 2 August 2022, the FCA launched a consultation on new defined benefit (DB) transfer 
redress guidance and set out its proposals in a consultation document - 
https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp22-15.pdf
In this consultation, the FCA said that it considers that the current redress methodology in 
Finalised Guidance (FG) 17/9 (Guidance for firms on how to calculate redress for unsuitable 
defined benefit pension transfers) remains appropriate and fundamental changes are not 
necessary. However, its review has identified some areas where the FCA considers it could 
improve or clarify the methodology to ensure it continues to provide appropriate redress.A policy statement was published on 28 November 2022 which set out the new rules and 
guidance- https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps22-13.pdf. The new rules will come into 
effect on 1 April 2023.
The FCA has said that it expects firms to continue to calculate and offer compensation to 
their customers using the existing guidance in FG 17/9 for the time being. But until changes 
take effect firms should give customers the option of waiting for their compensation to be 
calculated in line with the new rules and guidance.
Weve previously asked Mr F whether he preferred any redress to be calculated now in line 
with current guidance or wait for the new guidance/rules to come into effect.
He would like his complaint to be settled in line with new guidance / rules. I consider its fair 
that Options calculates Mr Fs redress in line with new guidance and rules when they come 
into effect.
A fair and reasonable outcome would be for the business to put Mr F, as far as possible, into 
the position he would now be in but for Options failure to carry out adequate due diligence 
checks before accepting his SIPP application. I consider he would have remained in the 
occupational scheme.
The basic objective of the amendments to the redress methodology still remains to put a 
consumer, as far as possible, into the position they would be in if theyd remained in their 
occupational scheme. Having reviewed the FCAs consultation and policy statement, Im 
satisfied that the changes still reflect a fair way to compensate Mr F.
Options must undertake a redress calculation in line with the updated methodology as soon 
as any new rules and/or guidance come into effect (rather than to calculate and pay any due 
compensation now in line with FG 17/9).
In accordance with the regulators expectations, this should be undertaken or submitted to 
an appropriate provider promptly once any new guidance/rules come into effect.
I note that it appears that investments held within Mr Fs SIPP were disinvested back in 2019 
and transferred to another pension provider. When calculating Mr Fs loss, the current value 
of any assets transferred should be obtained from Mr Fs new provider and be taken into 
account in any loss calculation done in accordance with the FCAs new rules/guidance. If 
any investments remain within the Options SIPP/the Options SIPP is still open, that situation 
should be dealt with in accordance with the following section.
Take ownership of any investments held within the SIPP which cannot be surrendered
In order for the SIPP to be closed (if it is not already) and further SIPP fees to be prevented, 
the investment(s) need(s) to be removed from the SIPP. To do this, Options should calculate 
an amount it is willing to accept as a commercial value for any investments that cannot be 
surrendered and pay that sum into the SIPP and take ownership of the relevant investments. 
This amount should be taken into account for the loss calculation.
If Options is unwilling or unable to purchase the investment(s) the value of them should be 
assumed to be nil for the purposes of the loss calculation if the investments are not readily 
realisable (or for any portion of the investments which is not readily realisable).
I appreciate such investments may have a realisable value in the future. So, for any investments assumed to be nil value Options may ask Mr F to provide an undertaking to 
account to it for the net amount of any payment the SIPP may receive from those 
investment(s) in the future. That undertaking should allow for the effect of any tax and 
charges on the amount Mr F may receive from the investment(s) and any eventual sums he 
would be able to access. Options should meet any costs in drawing up the undertaking.
If Options does not take ownership of the investment(s), and it/they continue to be held in Mr 
Fs SIPP, there will be ongoing fees in relation to the administration of that SIPP. Mr F would 
not be responsible for those fees if Options had not accepted the transfer of his occupational 
pension into the SIPP. So, I think it is fair and reasonable for Options to waive any SIPP fees 
until such a time as Mr F can dispose of the investment(s) and close the SIPP.
Pay compensation to Mr F for loss he has suffered calculated in (1).
Since the loss Mr F has suffered is within his pension it is right that I try to restore the value 
of his pension provision if that is possible. So, if possible, the compensation for the loss 
should be paid into his SIPP. The compensation shouldnt be paid into the pension if it would 
conflict with any existing protection or allowance. Payment into the pension should allow for 
the effect of charges and any available tax relief. This may mean the compensation should 
be increased to cover the charges and reduced to notionally allow for the income tax relief 
Mr F could claim. The notional allowance should be calculated using Mr Fs marginal rate of 
tax.
On the other hand, Options may not be able to pay the compensation into the SIPP. If so 
compensation for the loss should be paid to Mr F direct. But had it been possible to pay the 
compensation into the pension, it would have provided a taxable income.
Therefore, the compensation for the loss paid to Mr F should be reduced to notionally allow 
for any income tax that would otherwise have been paid. The notional allowance should be 
calculated using Mr Fs marginal rate of tax in retirement. For example, if Mr F is likely to be 
a basic rate taxpayer in retirement, the notional allowance would equate to a reduction in the 
total amount equivalent to the current basic rate of tax. However, if Mr F would have been 
able to take a tax-free lump sum, the notional allowance should be applied to 75% of the 
total amount.
Pay Mr F Â£500 for the distress and inconvenience caused by Options failure to act fairly and 
reasonably
Mr F transferred his pension away from a valuable defined benefits pension scheme to a 
SIPP and had to suffer the loss of those benefits. This is money Mr F cannot afford to lose 
and it has caused him uncertainty about his future retirement plans. I think its fair to say this 
would have caused Mr F some distress and inconvenience. So, I consider that a payment of 
Â£500 is appropriate to compensate for that.
The compensation resulting from the loss assessment must where possible be paid to Mr F 
within 90 days of the date Options receives notification of his acceptance of my final 
decision. Further interest must be added to the compensation amount at the rate of 8% per 
year simple from the date of my final decision to the date of settlement for any time, in 
excess of 90 days, that it takes Options to pay Mr F this compensation.
Its possible that data gathering for a SERPS adjustment may mean that the actual time 
taken to settle goes beyond the 90-day period allowed for settlement above  and so any 
period of time where the only outstanding item required to undertake the calculation is data 
from DWP may be added to the 90-day period in which interest wont apply.Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If Options deducts income tax from the 
interest, it should tell Mr F how much has been taken off. Options should give Mr F a tax 
deduction certificate in respect of interest if Mr F asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax on 
interest from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Reassignment of rights
If Options believes other parties to be wholly or partly responsible for the loss, it is free to 
pursue those other parties. So, compensation payable to Mr F should be contingent on the 
assignment by him to Options of any rights of action he may have against other parties in 
relation to his transfer to the SIPP and the investments. The assignment should be given in 
terms that ensure any amount recovered by Options up to the balance due to Mr F is paid to 
him. Options should only benefit from the assignment once Mr F has been fully 
compensated for his loss.
Where I uphold a complaint, I can award fair compensation to be paid by a financial 
business of up to Â£160,000, plus any interest and/or costs/interest on costs that I think are 
appropriate. If I think that fair compensation is more than Â£160,000, I may recommend that 
the business pays the balance.
I do not know what award the above calculation might produce. So, whilst I acknowledge 
that the value of Mr Fs original investment was within our award limit, for completeness I 
have included information below about what ought to happen if fair compensation amounted 
to more than our award limit.
Decision and award: I uphold the complaint. I think that fair compensation should be 
calculated as shown above. My decision is that Options UK Personal Pensions LLP should 
pay Mr F the amount produced by that calculation  up to a maximum of Â£160,000 (including 
the Â£500 to compensate for the distress and inconvenience Options actions caused) plus 
interest at the rate of 8% per year simple from the date of my final decision to the date of 
settlement for any time, in excess of 90 days, that it takes Options to pay Mr F this 
compensation.
Recommendation: If the amount produced by the calculation of fair compensation is more 
than Â£160,000, I recommend that Options pays Mr F the balance. This recommendation is 
not part of my determination or award. Options doesnt have to do what I recommend. Its 
unlikely that Mr F can accept my decision and go to court to ask for the balance. Mr F may 
want to get independent legal advice before deciding whether to accept this decision.
If Options UK Personal Pensions LLP agrees to pay the full calculated redress, and elects to 
take an assignment of rights before paying compensation, it must first provide a draft of the 
assignment to Mr F for his consideration and agreement. Any expenses incurred for the 
drafting of the assignment should be met by Options UK Personal Pensions LLP.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. To put things right Options UK Personal 
Pensions LLP must calculate and pay Mr F the award set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 April 2023.
