The complaint
Mr and Mrs P are unhappy because National Westminster Bank Plc declined their claim 
under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.
What happened
In May 1998 Mr and Mrs P attended a presentation and decided to purchase a timeshare. 
They paid a deposit of £2000 using a NatWest credit card and paid the balance of £3150 by 
bank transfer.
Mr and Mrs P experienced difficulties in booking holidays. They feel that the timeshare was 
misrepresented to them and made a claim to NatWest seeking a refund.
NatWest declined the claim. It said the claim had been brought outside of the time limit and 
that there wasnt enough evidence to support it.
Mr and Mrs P remained unhappy and complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He said there wasnt enough evidence to show 
that the deposit had been paid with a NatWest credit card and he didnt think NatWest had 
acted unfairly in declining the claim.
Mr and Mrs P didnt agree. They said that NatWest should hold a record of all payments they 
had made on their credit card account.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In certain circumstances section 75 gives a consumer a right to claim against a supplier of 
goods or a provider of credit where theres been a breach of contract or a misrepresentation. 
In order to uphold Mr and Mrs Ps complaint, I would need to be satisfied that theres been a  
misrepresentation and that NatWests response to the section 75 claim wasnt fair or 
reasonable.
In order to satisfy the requirements for bringing a section 75 claim, there has to be a debtor-
creditor-supplier relationship. In this case, Mr and Mrs P said that they paid the deposit using 
a NatWest credit card. If that was the case, NatWest would be the creditor in the debtor-
creditor-supplier chain.
Mr and Mrs P havent been able to provide evidence that they paid the deposit using a 
NatWest credit card. NatWest has said that it carried out a thorough investigation but has 
been unable to locate a credit card account in the name of Mr and Mrs P.
Ive looked at the evidence provided by Mr and Mrs P. This includes a copy of a NatWest 
paying in slip which evidence the transfer of the balance payment of £3150. However, Mr 
and Mrs P havent provided any evidence to show that any part of the payment was paid 
using a NatWest credit card.
Its a requirement of any section 75 claim that the goods or services were paid for in part or 
full using a credit card or credit facility such as a loan. The evidence supplied by Mr and Mrs 
P doesnt show that they paid in full or part using a credit card or loan from NatWest.
Because theres no evidence to show that the transaction was funded by a NatWest credit 
card either in full or in part, Im of the view that the requirements for bringing a section 75 
claim arent met. In the circumstances  and irrespective of the question of whether the claim 
was brought in time  Im unable to say that NatWest has acted unfairly in declining the 
claim.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P and Mr P to 
accept or reject my decision before 4 October 2021.
