The complaint
Mrs B complains about the way that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as 
Barclays Partner Finance, has dealt with the fixed sum loan agreement that she entered into 
to pay for a kitchen.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances - although we do take account of applicable law and 
regulations we also consider the overall situation, so its possible that a court would 
reach a different outcome to the decision that Ive made;
Mrs B signed a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in January 
2014 to pay for a kitchen to be supplied and fitted;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that there were issues with the kitchen  it was 
inspected in February 2016 and the report identified a number of issues that are 
consistent with the issues that Mrs B had reported;
the loan agreement was activated in February 2019 but Mrs B says that shed written 
to Barclays Partner Finance in September and October 2018 to say that she was 
withdrawing from the agreement  so it shouldnt have been activated;
Mrs B has sold the house in which the kitchen was installed so further inspection of it 
or remedial work isnt possible;
the kitchen supplier offered to pay £1,000 to Mrs B (which she didnt accept) and 
then offered to pay her £2,500 (but she says that she didnt receive that offer and the 
kitchen supplier says that the offer was withdrawn because Mrs B didnt accept it - 
but Barclays Partner Finance wasnt aware that the offer hadnt been received by 
Mrs B or had been withdrawn) - and Barclays Partner Finance paid £100 
compensation to Mrs B because of the poor service that shed received;
our investigator said that the offer to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan by 
£2,500 and the payment of £100 was enough to put matters right but Mrs B doesnt 
agree and has responded to the investigators recommendations in detail;
Ive considered all of the detailed evidence that Mrs B has submitted and I 
sympathise with her for the issues that she had with the kitchen and I can understand 
the frustration that she clearly feels about the loan being activated when shed told 
Barclays Partner Finance that she wanted to withdraw from the agreement before the 
loan was activated in February 2019;
the kitchen was installed in February 2014 and, although there were issues with it, 
Mrs B had the use and benefit of the kitchen until she sold the house but shes made 
no payment for it (other than the advance payment of £1,270);
Mrs B had made no payment for the kitchen in the five years since it was fitted and I 
consider that it was fair and reasonable for the kitchen supplier and Barclays Partner 
Finance to activate the loan in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance has paid £100 compensation to Mrs B and has offered to 
reduce the outstanding balance of the loan by £2,500  and I consider that to be fair 
and reasonable compensation for the issues that Mrs B has had with the kitchen;
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to write-off 
all, or a larger part of the loan, or to pay a higher amount of compensation to Mrs B 
for the issues that shes had with the kitchen; and
Barclays Partner Finance has paid £100 compensation to Mrs B and Im not 
persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it pay her any other 
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, should reduce the outstanding balance of Mrs Bs loan by £2,500.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2020.
