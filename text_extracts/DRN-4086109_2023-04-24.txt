The complaint
The estate of Mr W complain that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) closed its accounts.
What happened
The estate of Mr W had accounts with HSBC. HSBC wrote to one of the executors several 
times between August 2020 and October 2021. HSBC wanted to conduct various regulatory 
checks. There wasnt any response and HSBC closed the accounts in September 2021. A 
cheque for the balance of £20,723.63 was sent to the co-executor on 27 October 2021.
The co-executors at the time were Mr W and Mrs M  under a Grant of Probate dated 19 
March 2008. On 19 January 2023, a court order removed Mr W as an executor, leaving Mrs 
M as sole executor. So  it is Mrs M who has brought this complaint to us, as sole executor.
The estate of Mr W complained. It said that HSBC had closed the account unreasonably. It 
wanted access to the funds in the accounts, and for the executors account to be reopened  
so Mrs M can deal with the winding up of the estate. The estate said theyd called HSBC 
several times but were passed between call handlers and couldnt get a response about its 
situation.
HSBC said it had written to the estate several times to ask it to complete various checks on 
the accounts, and how they were being used  in connection with HSBCs regulatory 
obligations. But they didnt get any response and so closed the accounts. Because Mrs M 
had had problems in contacting HSBC, and had been passed between call handlers, HSBC 
offered compensation of £100.
The estate of Mr W didnt agree and brought its complaint to us. Our investigator said HSBC 
acted reasonably. Theyd written to the named co-executor many times but hadnt had a 
response. HSBC were entitled to carry out its regulatory checks, and they could close an 
account if they wished  this was in the terms and conditions. He said a cheque for 
£20,723.63 to close the accounts was sent to the named co-executor on 27 October 2021.
Mrs M (who was sole executor from January 2023) asked that an ombudsman look at the 
estates complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
HSBC, like all banks, have an obligation to carry out regulatory checks on customers 
accounts. This is in connection with banks efforts to fight financial crime and money 
laundering. So  HSBC were entitled to ask the estate of Mr W for certain information about 
the accounts.
Ive seen HSBCs records, and they wrote to the co-executors several times  on  13 August 
2020, 20 October 2020, 16 and 18 November 2020; 6 January 2021, 8 April 2021, 15 June 
2021, 13 July 2021, 19 August 2021, 10 September 2021 and finally on 27 October 2021. 
HSBC also tried to call the co-executor, without success. 
Because there wasnt any response, HSBC decided to close the accounts. This was in line 
with the terms and conditions of the account which included: We may close your account 
immediately and without notice. We can do this if you: .havent given us adequate 
information that weve requested.
Therefore, in June 2021, HSBC gave notice they were to close the accounts on 17 August 
2021. So  HSBC gave two months notice of the closure, which was reasonable. A cheque 
for £20,723.63 was sent to the co-executor on 27 October 2021.
Im satisfied that HSBC tried to contact the named co-executor in line with the contact details 
they had on file at the time; and sent to him the cheque for the closing balance.
When HSBC took the actions Ive set out, it pre-dated the court order dated January 2023  
which removed the co-executor from the Grant of Probate. So  HSBC didnt do anything 
wrong, as they were acting in line with the Grant of Probate then in operation.
HSBC told us that the estate can apply to open an executors account if it wishes  and they 
would look at this, subject to their account opening criteria. 
HSBC apologised for some of the service issues that the estate experienced and offered 
compensation of £100 - which I think is reasonable. But other than that, I am not asking 
HSBC to do anymore here.  Mrs M should contact HSBC directly if she now wishes to accept 
the offer.
My final decision
I dont think HSBC needs to do anything to settle the complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr W 
to accept or reject my decision before 22 May 2023.
