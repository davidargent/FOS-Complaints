The complaint
Mr K complains that TransUnion International UK Limited recorded the wrong address on his 
credit file. 
What happened
Mr K contacted TransUnion after a verification process used by HMRC failed. Mr K also says 
he was unable to open a bank account. Mr K complained that TransUnion had the wrong 
address recorded for him. As a result, Mr K says he was unable to claim back tax. 
TransUnion issued two responses to Mr Ks complaint but didnt agree it had made any 
mistakes. TransUnion said it had taken steps to remove a number of addresses linked to Mr 
K by various businesses. TransUnion also said it would send Mr K a copy of his credit report. 
Mr K referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. The 
investigator noted Mr K had confirmed the information now shown on his credit file was 
correct. The investigator thought TransUnion had dealt with Mr Ks complaint fairly and didnt 
ask it to do anything else. Mr K didnt agree with the investigator and said it shouldve been 
clear to TransUnion that it had incorrect information on file.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our investigator asked TransUnion to explain why a similar but unrelated address was linked 
to his credit file. TransUnion has confirmed two separate businesses reported the address 
Mr K has disputed. So whilst I dont doubt that the address in question was wrong, it wasnt 
something that TransUnion input. Im satisfied the incorrect address was linked to Mr Ks 
credit file by third parties. 
TransUnion cant amend information without first checking with the business thats reported 
it. Mr K says it shouldve been clear to TransUnion that the address was wrong so shouldve 
taken that step without his involvement. But I think its reasonable to note that providing 
credit references is a largely automated process and relies on information provided by a 
range of sources. TransUnion says it will take steps to rectify a mistake thats brought to its 
attention and I think thats fair and reasonable in the circumstances. I can see that after Mr K 
raised his concerns with TransUnion it arranged for the address in question to be amended 
and updated. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr K but I havent found that TransUnion made errors or treated him 
unfairly. Once the issue was identified, TransUnion was able to ensure the address was 
checked and updated. As Im satisfied that TransUnion dealt with Mr Ks complaint fairly, Im 
not telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 February 2022.
