September 2017 and November 2018. Mr Gs borrowing  history  is as follows:

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Gs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given as they thought Mr G wouldnt be able to make his repayments  
sustainably without borrowing more  and the pattern of borrowing indicated Mr G was reliant 
on short-term loans.  
Money Platform disagreed and said it had done  robust checks before lending to Mr G and 
these showed  the loans  to be affordable. It also said that Mr G repaid some of his loans 
early  which showed he was managing his finances. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Money Platform needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure     
Mr G could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much  was being lent, the 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Money Platform should  fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
Ref: DRN07192532the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Money Platform  was required to 
establish whether  Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint. Having done  so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Money Platform needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 
3. Mr G didnt  respond to the view. As there  is no dispute with the adjudicators opinion about  
these loans, I wont be making any findings  on them.
Money Platform says it carried out checks before it lent loan 4 to Mr G and the results of 
these checks didnt  raise  any concerns. Part of these checks  involved gathering information 
about Mr Gs income and expenditure. For loan 4 (which was to be repaid in one instalment 
the following  month), Mr Gs declared  income was £1,660 and he said his outgoings were  
around £960. This would  have left him with a disposable income  of just over £700  to cover 
his loan 4 repayment of £647, as well as any other expenditures. 
Given his income and expenditure, I think its unlikely that Mr G would have been able to 
sustain his loan repayments without having  to borrow again.  This was proven when Mr G 
borrowed the same amount again  the month  after he repaid loan 4 but this time spread the 
payments over three  instalments. 
Ive noted Money  Platforms comments about  Mr G repaying his loans early. I think the fact 
he repaid his loans much  earlier  than planned  should have caused some concern to 
Money Platform. While it would have  saved Mr G interest charges it might  equally be the sort 
Ref: DRN07192533of behaviour that would  indicate someone was facing problems managing their money and 
needing to refinance loans on a regular basis. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Money Platforms lending  history with Mr G, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Money  Platform should  reasonably  have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And Money Platform  should  
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Gs case, like the adjudicator, I think  that this point was 
reached by loan 7. I say this because:  
At this point Money Platform  ought to have  realised Mr G was not managing  to repay  
his loans sustainably.  Mr G had taken out seven  loans  within  less than a year.  So, 
Money Platform ought to have realised  it was more  likely  that Mr Gs indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably. 
Mr Gs first loan was for £250 and loan 7 was for the same amount but spread over 
two instalments instead of one. At this point, Money Platform ought to have known it 
was unlikely Mr G was borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall in his income,  but 
more to meet an ongoing need. 
He also wasnt really  making any inroads to the amount he owed Money  Platform. 
Loan 8 was taken out 14 months after Mr Gs first and was for the same amount. The 
amount Mr G was borrowing wasnt decreasing significantly.  In effect, Mr G had paid 
large amounts  of interest to service a debt to Money Platform  over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr G lost out because Money Platform provided borrowing for loan 7 onwards 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Gs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Gs complaint about  loan 4 onwards. 
putting things right  what Money Platform needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 4 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 to 6 from Mr Gs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about these loans is adverse. So, all entries  about loans 7 and 8 should  be removed 
from Mr Gs credit  file.
Ref: DRN07192534 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Money Platform to take off tax from this interest. Money  Platform 
must give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. Gracombex Ltd 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 June  2020.
