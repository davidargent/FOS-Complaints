The complaint
Mr P complains that Capital One (Europe) plc wont refund to him the money that he paid for 
a shed. 
What happened
Mr P used his Capital One credit card in May 2021 to pay Â£517.50 for a plastic shed. He 
claimed a refund of that amount from Capital One in April 2022 and said that the shed was 
set up as instructed but rainwater leaks in from all sides and he believes that it wasnt fit for 
purpose. 
Capital One said that it was out of time to make a chargeback claim to the supplier but it 
considered his claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It asked Mr P to 
provide an independent report to establish whether the supplier had breached its terms and 
conditions and said that it was unable to process his claim without a report. It said that, if his 
claim was accepted, the cost of the report would be reimbursed but Mr P wanted to be 
reimbursed for the cost of the report even if his claim wasnt successful. Mr P wasnt 
satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that 
Capital One was wrong by not raising a chargeback as Mr P had raised the dispute outside 
of the time limits for a chargeback claim. She couldnt say that the shed was faulty from the 
start or that there had been a breach of contract so she said that she couldnt ask Capital 
One to do any more. 
Mr P has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr P bought the shed in May 2021 and he contacted Capital One about a refund in 
April 2022  nearly a year later  I consider that the time limit in which it could make 
a chargeback claim to the supplier for the payment would have expired then so Im 
not persuaded that Capital One acted incorrectly by not making a chargeback claim 
and considering his claim under section 75;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ps complaint about Capital Ones response to his section 75 
claim, I must be satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation 
by the supplier of the shed and that Capital Ones response to his claim under 
section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ps 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr P says that the shed was set up as instructed but rainwater leaks in from all sides 
and he believes that it wasnt fit for purpose  he says that a piece of the wall 
cracked and fell out in hot weather and the suppliers video portrays the shed to be 
indestructible - hes provided photos showing the issues with the shed;
Capital One asked Mr P to provide an independent report to establish whether the 
supplier had breached its terms and conditions and said that it was unable to process 
his claim without a report  it also said that, if his claim was accepted, the cost of the 
report would be reimbursed;
as Mr Ps claim was made to Capital One nearly a year after the shed had been 
supplied to him, I consider that it was fair and reasonable for it to require Mr P to 
provide evidence to show that there had been a breach of contract by the supplier;
I consider that it was fair and reasonable for it to offer to refund the cost of the report 
if Mr Ps claim was accepted and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable for it to be expected to reimburse Mr P for the cost of the report if the 
claim wasnt successful;
Mr P didnt provide Capital One with an independent report and I dont consider that 
the description of the issues that hes had with the shed and the photos that hes 
provided are enough to show that the shed wasnt fit for purpose or of satisfactory 
quality when it was supplied to him, or that theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier;
I sympathise with Mr P for the issues that he has with his shed but Im not persuaded 
that hes provided enough evidence to show that Capital One has acted incorrectly 
and I consider that its response to his section 75 claim was fair and reasonable in 
these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Capital One to refund to 
Mr P the money that he paid for the shed, to pay him any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 December 2022.
