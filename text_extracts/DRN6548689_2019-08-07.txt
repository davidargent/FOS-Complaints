K821x#15complaint
Mr G says Active Securities Limited trading as 247Moneybox irresponsibly lent to him. He 
says that 247Moneybox  didnt check if he could afford the loans before lending.  He says he 
was in financial difficulty and 247Moneybox  shouldve seen this and not lent to him.

Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Gs complaint and thought  loans 2 to 16 shouldnt have been 
given. 247Moneybox disagreed and the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Gs case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Gs complaint  in part and have explained why below.
247Moneybox needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
Ref: DRN65486892These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Gs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  indicate  that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done  more 
to establish that any lending  was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number or higher  frequency  of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer and business have a lending  relationship  
is long
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Gs complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did 247Moneybox, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  
to satisfy itself that Mr G would be able to repay  in a sustainable way?  If not, would  
those checks have  shown that Mr G would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Gs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did 247Moneybox  act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Gs complaint.
did 247Moneybox,  each  time it lent, complete  reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr G would be able to repay in a sustainable way?  If not, would 
those checks  have shown  that Mr G would  have been able to do so?
Ive carefully thought  about what 247Moneybox  and Mr G have provided and what both 
sides have said. 
Mr G didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loan 1. Because of this I dont think  
there is any ongoing disagreement about this loan. So I wont be making a decision about 
this lending. But it was part of the borrowing relationship Mr G had with 247Moneybox. So it 
is something I will take into account  when considering the other  loans he took.
As shown  in my table  there were  two chains of lending. One started at loan 1 and the other, 
because of a significant gap between  loans 12 and 13, started  at loan 13. So it was 
reasonable to treat Mr G as a new consumer  at loan 13. So I wouldve expected lower 
checks at the start of both of these lending  chains. But Mr G continued to borrow higher 
amounts over a longer  period of time in both of these chains. So I wouldve expected greater 
checks after the first few loans both times.  
Ref: DRN65486893247Moneybox cant  show what  information it used to assess the lending  applications for 
loans 2 to 7 and loans  13 to 16. So, even though its likely  it wouldve found out some 
information before lending,  I cant  reasonably say that it made proportionate checks before 
approving these loans. So I need to think about  what 247Moneybox wouldve seen if it had 
carried out proportionate checks.
Mr G has provided  some  information about his financial  circumstances. This includes his 
bank statements and a recent credit  report. I accept that this isnt exactly  what  247Moneybox 
wouldve seen at the time. But I think  it wouldve  found out similar information if it had made 
proportionate checks, so I think  its reasonable to rely on it.
This shows that, as our adjudicator said, in the early  part of the first loan chain Mr Gs 
income was very low. And so the loan repayments  were a very high proportion  of this, over 
half of his income for loans 2 to 4. So I dont think its likely Mr G wouldve been able to 
sustainably repay  these loans.  
And whilst he was earning a greater  amount  for loans 13 to 16, his normal living  costs   were 
only a few hundred  pounds  short of his income  over this period at best. For example his 
income was around  £1,400 when he took loan 13. But his expenditure was around £1,100. 
So he had about £300 left, but the repayment  on loan 13 was around £450. This continued  
over the remainder of the lending, although his income was lower at times.  So again I dont 
think its likely Mr G wouldve been  able to sustainably repay these loans. 
I think that 247Moneybox  wouldve found  out this information if it had made proportionate 
checks. And I think 247Moneybox wouldve seen Mr G wouldnt have been able repay  the 
loans in a sustainable way. So I think that 247Moneybox shouldnt have given loans 2 to 4 
and loans 13 to 16 to Mr G and I think hes lost out as a result of this. So Im upholding 
Mr Gs complaint about loans 2 to 4 and loans  13 to 16. 
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 5 to 12 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided,  did the overall 
pattern of lending increase  Mr Gs indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which 247Moneybox should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so 247Moneybox should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further lending. Given the particular circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that 
this point was reached  by loan 5. I say this because:
the amounts  Mr G was borrowing had generally increased and they continued to do 
so going forward  until the break in lending. So 247Moneybox ought to have realised it 
was more likely than not Mr G was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loans were leaving in his finances. And 247Moneybox ought to 
have realised it was likely his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably
Mr G wasnt  making  really reducing  the amount he owed 247Moneybox. He was in 
effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended  period
I think that Mr G lost out because 247Moneybox  approved loans 5 to 12 because:
Ref: DRN65486894these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Gs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im also upholding  Mr Gs complaint about loans  5 to 12 because the overall pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and hes lost out as a result.
did 247Moneybox  act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude 247Moneybox  acted unfairly or unreasonably  towards  Mr G in 
some other way.  
putting things right  what 247Moneybox needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 2 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 2 to 4 and 13 to 16 from Mr Gs credit 
file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 to 12 means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  5 to 12 should be removed from Mr Gs 
credit file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 247Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 
247Moneybox must give Mr G a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Gs complaint.
Active Securities Limited should put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 September 2019.
