The complaint
Mr and Mrs V have complained about an increase in their monthly mortgage repayment 
when they switched their Yorkshire Building Society (YBS) mortgage onto a new product. To 
settle the complaint Mr and Mrs V want YBS to correct the monthly mortgage payment to the 
correct amount.
What happened
Mr and Mrs V have a mortgage with YBS originally taken out in 2007. They took out a further 
advance in 2011, so the mortgage was operated as two sub-accounts, Parts 1 and 2 Their 
existing fixed rate product of 1.94% was due to end on 30 June 2018. Before the end of the 
fixed rate product Mr V contacted YBS to discuss a new rate and on 2 May 2018 attended 
an appointment with YBS. 
A new fixed rate product of 2.16% fixed to 31 July 2021 was recommended and YBS issued 
a product transfer offer. The offer was calculated on the assumption that the product would 
be transferred on 1 June 2018, and that monthly payments would be made on the 17th day 
of each month. The monthly repayment quoted was £350.18 per month.
Mr and Mrs V accepted the offer and on 16 May 2018 YBS confirmed this in writing, but the 
letter stated that the monthly payment would be £358.15 with effect from July 2018.
Mr and Mrs V queried this with YBS. After looking into this, YBS identified a system fault. 
YBS has told us that what happened was this:
Their monthly mortgage payment was due on 17 May 2018, and the product transfer offer 
was issued on 3 May 2018. The monthly payment of £350.18 quoted in the product transfer 
offer was based on a predicted account balance as at 31 May 2018 over a term of 3 years 
and 7 months for Part 1 and 3 years and 8 moths for Part 2, taking into account the future 
expected payment due on 17 May 2018 (£356.79).
But due to the system error, the computer didnt register the fact that the term would have 
reduced by 1 month once the May 2018 payment had been received.
So the payment quoted in the offer was based on a lower balance (taking into account the 
payment due on 17 May 2018) but a longer term by 1 month. This resulted in an incorrect 
lower monthly payment being produced. The system should have reduced the term by 1 
month to 3 years and 6 months for Part 1 and 3 years and 7 months for Part 2. This would 
have produced a slightly higher monthly mortgage payment.
YBS has acknowledged that, once it had identified the reason for the difference in payments, 
it should have explained about the system error to Mr and Mrs V and confirmed that the new 
monthly payment was, in fact, £358.15, not £350.18. 
But instead, YBS assumed an error had been made in quoting a higher payment and so the 
lower payment of £350.18 was forced onto the system. YBS wrote to Mr and Mrs V telling 
them their payment would be £350.18 from July 2018, which was, in fact, incorrect. Mr and Mrs V made these payments until March 2019. At that point YBS told Mr and Mrs V 
that their monthly repayment would be increasing. As they are on a fixed rate of interest, 
they were unhappy about this and complained to YBS, 
At this point YBS identified the error that had happened in May 2018. It was explained to Mr 
and Mrs V that their payment had increased because theyd been underpaying since July 
2018. As a result, YBS had to increase their payment to ensure the capital balance was paid 
off by the end of the mortgage term.
YBS offered Mr and Mrs V compensation of £65 by way of apology. Mr and Mrs V didnt 
think this was sufficient and complained to us.
An investigator looked at the complaint and thought it should be upheld. He noted that YBS 
had accepted it had made a mistake, but he didnt think it had gone far enough to put it right.
The investigator asked YBS to refund the difference between the original monthly payment 
of £350.18 and what the correct monthly payment should have been (£358.15) for the period 
1 July 2018 to 28 February 2019. He also asked YBS to refund the difference between the 
increased monthly payment of £358.15 and £359.54 from 1 March 2019 until the point where 
the mortgage balance has reduced to where the payments are once again at £358.15.
The investigator also asked YBS to increase its offer of compensation by £35, making a total 
payment for trouble and upset of £100.
YBS agreed to the investigators recommendations. It said it would rework the mortgage 
from July 2018 to February 2019, assuming that the monthly payment of £358.15 had been 
received. The appropriate refund would be applied to the account and any interest 
adjustment made. 
YBS said it would then review the account to establish what the payment would have been, 
assuming the monthly payments of £358.15 had been made from July 2018 to February 
2019. Any refund would be made from March 2019 to date and the necessary interest 
adjustment made.
YBS also clarified that the mortgage is a fixed interest rate, which does not mean a fixed 
payment. Thats because the terms and conditions provide for an annual review each year 
on 31 December and so payments are subject to slight change.
Mr and Mrs V did not agree with the investigators findings and asked for an ombudsman to 
review the complaint.
What Ive decided and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
YBS has acknowledged that it made an error when it forced through the incorrect, lower, 
payment on their mortgage account, rather than explaining to them why the higher payment 
was correct.  So I dont need to decide whats gone wrong or who is at fault, because YBS 
has accepted that this was its mistake. What I have to decide is what should be done to put 
this mistake right.
The consequences of the error are that Mr and Mrs V inadvertently underpaid their mortgage 
for several months, and were then told that their repayments would be increasing to make up the shortfall. As they are on a fixed rate,  they were unhappy with this. I agree that this was 
not acceptable and that YBS should put it right.
Im satisfied that the redress which the investigator asked YBS to pay (as detailed above,  
and which YBS has agreed to pay) is fair and reasonable. It puts Mr and Mrs Vs mortgage 
account back in the position it would have been in if YBS had not forced through the 
incorrect lower payment in July 2018, but without Mr and Mrs V having to make up the 
account shortfall themselves.
Im also satisfied that a total payment for trouble and upset of £100 is fair, given that Mr and 
Mrs V are also benefitting from YBS making up the shortfall on the account.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement Yorkshire Building 
Society must rework the mortgage account in order to do the following:
rework the mortgage from 1 July 2018 to 28 February 2019, assuming that the 
monthly payment of £358.15 had been received, apply the refund to the account and 
adjust the interest;
review the account as at 31 December 2018 (the date of the annual review) to 
establish what the payment would have been from 1 March 2019, assuming the 
monthly payments of £358.15 had been made from 1 July 2018 to 28 February 2019. 
Any refund due would be made from 1 March 2019 to the date of acceptance of this 
final decision and any necessary interest adjustment made to the account;
pay compensation totalling £100 for trouble and upset (to include the £65 already 
offered to Mr and Mrs V).
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs V to 
accept or reject my decision before 26 June 2020.
