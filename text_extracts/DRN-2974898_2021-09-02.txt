The complaint
Miss H is unhappy with the service that shes received from National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) surrounding a reimbursement from a cancelled holiday.   
What happened
Miss H purchased a holiday for approximately £643 using an account with an electronic 
payment services provider (EPSP) with whom her NatWest debit card was registered. The 
holiday was later cancelled by the merchant and the £643 was reimbursed to Miss Hs 
EPSPs account. 
Following this, the £643 was returned by the EPSP to the originating account  Miss Hs 
NatWest account. However, in the interim, Miss H had closed that NatWest account, so 
NatWest returned the money back to the EPSP. Unfortunately, the EPSP didnt receive the 
returned money, and neither the EPSP or NatWest have any record of where Miss Hs £643 
now is. Miss H wasnt happy about this, so she raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Miss Hs complaint, but they felt that they could evidence that the money 
had been returned to the EPSP, so they advised Miss H to pursue the matter with EPSP and 
didnt uphold the complaint. 
Miss H wasnt happy with NatWests response, especially as the EPS
PE were saying that they could evidence that the money hadnt been returned to them and 
were advising Miss H to pursue the matter with NatWest. So, she referred her complaint to 
this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that NatWest and the EPSP had 
equally compelling evidence to suggest that the other party was at fault. So, our investigator 
recommended that NatWest reimburse to Miss H half of the money that was missed - 
£321.50  along with 8% simple interest calculated from 21 May 2020, which was the date 
our investigator felt that Miss H ought reasonably to have received the reimbursement in the 
first instance. Our investigator also recommended that NatWest should make a further 
payment of £75 to Miss H to compensate her for any trouble and upset she may have 
incurred.
NatWest didnt agree to the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.      
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, it seems apparent to me that both NatWest and the EPSP have equally 
compelling claims that Miss Hs money must reside with the other party. What is certain is 
that Miss H has expended a great deal of time and energy into tying to recover the £643 
that, I can only conclude at this point, given the evidence that Ive seen, has been effectively 
lost. 
This doesnt feel fair to me, so I will be upholding this complaint against NatWest and 
instructing them to make a payment to Miss H of £321.50  half of £643  along with 8% 
simple interest calculated from 21 May 2020 - which I accept as being the date that Miss H 
ought reasonably to have received the reimbursement in the first instance  to the date that 
the payment to Miss H is made. 
I will also be instructing NatWest to make a further payment of £75 to Miss H to compensate 
her for any trouble and upset that shes incurred here.
Putting things right
NatWest must make a payment to Miss H of £321.50 along with 8% simple interest 
calculated from 21 May 2020 to the date that the payment to Miss H is made. 
NatWest must also make a further payment to Miss H of £75  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NatWest on the basis explained 
above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 September 2021.
