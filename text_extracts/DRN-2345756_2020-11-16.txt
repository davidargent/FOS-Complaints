The complaint
Miss B complains about credit card lending made to her by NewDay Ltd. She said that
NewDay let her take out a second card, although she was already clearly struggling with the
first card.
What happened
Miss B said she took out a credit card with NewDay in January 2016 with a credit limit of
£300, and then another one, with a different brand name and a credit limit of £450, in
September 2016. Miss B said she couldnt afford both cards, and she got into trouble. She
said the debts are now with a debt collection agency, and shes paying them off. But she
said NewDay doesnt let people take out two cards within a year. She didnt think it shouldve
let her do this, and said that if it hadnt she wouldve been able to maintain the first card.
She also told us about her personal situation including that her health is suffering. She
wanted an apology, her credit file corrected, and compensation.
NewDay said it now has a policy that people cant take out a second card within a year of
taking out the first one. But it didnt have that policy when Miss B took out her second card.
And it had done a credit check each time it agreed to lend her money, which she had
passed.
Both Miss Bs accounts have now been closed, and they were sold to a third party debt
collector at the end of June 2017. NewDay didnt think it had made a mistake with the
accounts, but it had failed to mention to her possible sources of support if she was having
financial difficulties now, so it paid her £35 for that.
At first, our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. But then Miss B said
that he should look at how she was managing the first card she took with NewDay. She said
she had late fees and was over her limit on the first card, when NewDay let her take out a
second card. If she wasnt offered an increase on her limit on the first card, why was she
able to take out a second card?
Miss B sent us evidence of the late fees and overlimit charges on her first card, before she
successfully applied for a second. And our investigator changed his mind. He said that the
late payment charges and overlimit fees on her first card shouldve been an indication to
NewDay that Miss B couldnt afford the second card. And she had a significant outstanding
balance on payday loans at the time of the second application. So our investigator said
NewDay should refund all the interest and charges that Miss B had paid on the second card,
pay 8% simple interest per year on the refund, and remove any negative information about
the second card from Miss Bs credit file.
NewDay didnt agree. It repeated that Miss B had passed its credit checks. And it said that
8% interest was only appropriate when someone had been deprived of money, and Miss B
hadnt because she never paid the interest and charges on the second card. Miss B had only
ever made one payment of £40. Her account balance when the account was sold was
£588.04, of which £118.90 was interest and charges. Because NewDay didnt agree, this
case was then passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
I do think its important to look at how Miss B was managing her first credit card, 
when she applied for the second. Thats information that NewDay had, when it 
decided whether to lend Miss B more money.
Miss B got her first card at the start of February, but only just over a month later she 
was already over her £300 credit limit. She was charged a fee in May, because her 
payment was late. In August, she was charged again for being over her limit.
Most worryingly, in September, when Miss B applied for the second card, she hadnt 
made the minimum payment required on her first card. Shed paid less than the 
minimum, and what she had paid was about two weeks overdue. She remained over 
her credit limit.
Only a few days after NewDay issued a statement telling Miss B this, it also approved 
her application for a second card.
Like our investigator, I think that this should have been a warning to NewDay that 
Miss B wasnt managing her card well.
I also note that her short term borrowing, on payday loans, was about twice what it 
had been at the start of the year.
NewDay knew that Miss B wasnt managing the card she had well. I dont think it 
shouldve agreed to give her a second card.
I think NewDay should refund onto the debt arising from Miss Bs card, all the interest 
and fees that she was charged for borrowing on that card. If NewDay isnt able to do 
that without buying back the debt from the third party debt collector that it sold this 
debt to, then it must buy this debt back in order to achieve this reduction in what Miss 
B owes.
I also agree with our investigators suggestion that NewDay should remove any 
negative information about the second card from Miss Bs credit file. Thats because I 
dont think this lending shouldve been made to her.
I dont think NewDay has to pay Miss B interest on what it charged onto her card 
though. I dont think thats appropriate in these circumstances, because, as NewDay 
has pointed out, Miss B didnt make payments onto her card at the time. I do, 
however, think that NewDay has clearly made an already difficult situation worse for 
Miss B, so I think it should pay Miss B £100 in compensation for the additional 
distress that this lending caused Miss B.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Miss B said she was happy with the decision, but wanted to make sure we knew that shed 
made payments to a different company, as NewDay had sold the debt. I allowed for this in 
my provisional decision. NewDay said it had nothing to add. 
What Ive decided  and whyIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the award I originally proposed. 
My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd must refund onto the debt arising from Miss Bs card, all 
the interest and fees that she was charged for borrowing on that card. If NewDay Ltd isnt 
able to do that without buying back the debt from the third party debt collector that it sold this 
debt to, then it must buy this debt back.
NewDay Ltd must also remove any negative information about the second card from Miss 
Bs credit file.
And NewDay Ltd must pay Miss B £100 in compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 14 December 2020.
