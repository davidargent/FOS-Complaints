The complaint
Miss P complains about a loan Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) provided 
to her. She says the loan was irresponsibly lent. 
What happened
118 118 Money provided Miss P with a loan for £1000 in November 2021. The loan was 
repayable over 80 months by instalments of £32.77.
Miss P complained that the loan was lent irresponsibly.
Our investigator reviewed what Miss P and 118 118 Money had told us and said she didnt 
think the loan shouldve been approved. 118 118 Money disagreed and asked for an 
ombudsman to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on 
our website. Ive had regard to this approach to help me decide Miss Ps complaint.
118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
in that 118 118 Money needed to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to make 
sure that Miss P could sustainably repay the loan. 
Our website sets out what we think about when deciding whether checks were proportionate. 
Generally, we think its reasonable for checks to be less thorough in the early stages of a 
lending relationship. But we might think that a lender needed to do more if, for example, a 
borrowers income was low or the amount lent was high.
118 118 Money has argued that the monthly loan repayments were low, and that Miss P had 
sufficient disposable income each month.
Ive looked at the information gathered by 118 118 Money. The credit check shows clear 
signs that Miss P was already significantly indebted and experiencing some financial stress. 
118 118 Money could see that Miss P was already committed to 6 credit card accounts, 3 
unsecured loans ad 3 mail order accounts before she applied for the loan. And 118 118 
Money could see that the balances on some of these accounts had been increasing in the 
months leading up to the loan, and that Miss P had been making minimum repayments.
I think the information 118 118 Money gathered from these checks shouldve given it cause 
for concern that the lending might not be affordable for Miss P. Because of this, I think 118 
118 Money shouldve taken steps to find out more about Miss Ps financial circumstances 
before determining that the loan was affordable.
I think further checks shouldve been carried out by 118 118 Money to find out more about 
Miss Ps expenditure. If it had done this, Im persuaded it wouldve seen that Miss P was 
already in a difficult financial position. 
Based on what Ive seen, I dont think 118 118 Money carried out reasonable and 
proportionate checks. Miss P has ended up paying interest, fees and charges on a loan 
which shouldnt have been provided.
Putting things right
To put things right, 118 118 Money must:
(A) Remove all interest, fees and charges applied to the loan from the outset. The 
payments Miss P has made should be deducted from the new starting balance 
(£1000). If Miss P has already repaid more than £1000, then 118 118 Money should 
treat any extra as an overpayment. Any overpayment should be refunded to Miss P 
together with 8% simple interest from the date of payment to the date of settlement. *
(B) If there is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts calculate at (A) should be 
used to repay any balance on the loan. Any surplus should be repaid to Miss P. if, 
however, there is still an outstanding balance, 118 118 Money must try to agree am 
affordable repayment plan with Miss P.
(C) Any adverse information recorded on Miss Ps credit file in relation to this loan should 
be removed.
*If HMRC require 118 118 Money to deduct tax from the interest, it should give Miss P a 
certificate showing how much tax has been deducted if Miss P asks for one
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. Madison CF UK Limited must take the steps 
Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 February 2023.
