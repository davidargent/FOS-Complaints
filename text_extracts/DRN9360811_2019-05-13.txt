QuickQuid didnt think that it had lent irresponsibly for most of the loans. But it said that there  
was a detriment  in Mrs Ws lending  history for loans 4, 5 and 6. It offered to refund  the 
interest and fees Mrs W paid for these loans (plus interest). It said it would reduce the 
amount Mrs W owed  on her final loan by this compensation. Mrs W didnt accept this offer 
and it has since been withdrawn. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She thought Mrs W should  receive  
compensation in respect of loans 7 to 12. QuickQuid  disagreed  with the adjudicators opinion 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mrs Ws case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mrs Ws complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Ref: DRN93608112QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs W 
could repay  her loans  in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mrs Ws income and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  indicate  that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done  more 
to establish that any lending  was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number or higher  frequency  of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer and business have a lending  relationship  
is long
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mrs Ws complaint. These questions are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mrs W would  be able to repay in a sustainable way?  If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mrs W would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mrs Ws indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mrs Ws 
complaint.
Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mrs W would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks 
have shown that Mrs W would have been able to do so?
QuickQuid says that all of checks it made before  lending were  proportionate. And it said that 
these checks showed that Mrs W could afford the loan repayments. Its provided detailed  
information about its lending process  to support what it says. 
Our adjudicator thought that the checks QuickQuid made before approving loans 1 to 4 were 
proportionate. She thought QuickQuid couldve done  more before approving loans 5 and 6. 
But she didnt have  sufficient information to say that Mrs W wouldnt have been able to 
sustainably repay  them.   
Ref: DRN93608113Mrs W didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 6. Because of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing  dispute  about these loans. So, given all of the above  Im not 
considering whether QuickQuid made  proportionate  checks before approving loans 1 to 6. 
But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mrs W had with QuickQuid. So they are 
something I will take into account when considering the other  loans she took.
And I havent recreated individual,  proportionate affordability checks  for loans 7 to 12 
because I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next 
section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mrs Ws indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise 
harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which QuickQuid should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Ws case, I think  that this point 
was reached by loan 7. I say this because:
the amounts  Mrs W borrowed were generally  increasing. Mrs W borrowed £100 for 
the first few loans,  this increased  to £300 at loan 4 and for loan 7 she borrowed  £700. 
Because of this QuickQuid ought  to have realised  it was likely her indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably
after the break in lending  between  loans 3 and 4, Mrs W wasnt  really  reducing the 
amount she owed QuickQuid. There werent  any significant gaps between  loans 7 to 
12. She was in effect paying large amounts of interest to service  this debt over an 
extended period.  QuickQuids  own records show that it lent for 3.72 years in total (it 
looks like this included the break)
Mrs W was demonstrating  repayment  difficulties from loan 4 onwards. And in 
particular she had significant problems repaying  loan 6. QuickQuid still continued to 
lend despite this 
I think that Mrs W lost out because QuickQuid continued to approve loans from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ws indebtedness  by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period of time
the sheer number  of loans, and repayment  problems,  was likely to have  had negative  
implications on Mrs Ws ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans
So Im upholding  Mrs Ws complaint about loans 7 to 12 because the overall pattern of 
lending increased  her indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and shes lost out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mrs W in some 
other way.  
Ref: DRN93608114putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs W paid on loans 7 to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 12 means any information  recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  loans 7 to 12 should be removed from Mrs Ws credit 
file
If Mrs W still owes QuickQuid any of the principal balance  she borrowed on her final loan 
QuickQuid should  remove all the interest  and charges applied  to the outstanding balance. 
QuickQuid should  then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Mrs W went to 
towards the principal.  But importantly, QuickQuid needs to make  sure that Mrs W doesnt 
repay more  than the principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Mrs W hasnt repaid the principal she borrowed  QuickQuid  can deduct this 
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mrs W has already paid enough to repay  the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to her with 8% simple* interest from the 
date of payment  to the date of settlement. 
And if QuickQuid no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the 
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Mrs W.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mrs W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mrs Ws complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs W to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 June 2019.
