K821x#15complaint
Mr F says that Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Sunny approved 8 instalment loans for Mr F between July 2016  and March 2017. Mr F said 
that he was in financial difficulty and the lending made his difficulties worse.
Our adjudicator considered the complaint and thought that Sunny  shouldnt have continued to 
lend to Mr F from loan 4 onwards as he was reliant on this type of credit and essentially using 
the loans to supplement his income.  The adjudicator  thought  that by this point Sunny should 
have realised that further borrowing wasnt sustainable. Our adjudicator  recommended  that 
Sunny put things  right for Mr F by refunding all interest and charges incurred on loans 4 to 8. 
Sunny didnt agree with the adjudicators  opinion  and in particular said that Mr F was 
required to repay only a small amount of his declared income towards  his repayments. It 
said that there was no evidence  that Mr F was struggling to manage  his money. Sunny 
asked for the complaint to be passed to an ombudsman for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr F could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure.
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny 
should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending  was sustainable 
for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN30118722I think its important for me to start by saying that Sunny  was required to establish whether 
Mr F could  sustainably repay his loans   not just whether the loan payments were affordable 
on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook defines sustainable as being  
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow
to meet  the repayments.
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
consumer wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint. 
Sunny has told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr F. It asked Mr F for details of 
his income and normal expenditure. And Sunny carried out checks  on Mr Fs credit file.
I agree  with the adjudicator that it wasnt wrong  for Sunny to give Mr F loans 1 to 3 on the 
basis of the information he gave about  his income  and outgoings.  It was early in the lending  
relationship and so I think  the checks were enough  for Sunny to agree to lend. As Mr F 
hasnt raised any objection to the adjudicators recommendation in relation to loans one to 
three, I dont  think that I need to say more  about  them.
At the point of loan 4 I agree with the adjudicator that Mr Fs borrowing pattern was a cause 
for concern. Mr F had taken out loans in July, September and October which  had not been 
fully repaid. He asked  to borrow again 9 days  after taking out loan 3. Taking out this many 
loans within  such a short time frame should  have prompted Sunny to consider whether this 
lending was sustainable for Mr F. His pattern  of borrowing suggested  that he was reliant on 
short term credit  and not managing his money responsibly. I think that Sunny shouldnt have 
given Mr F loans 4 and 5.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Mr Fs lending  with Sunny to see if there was a point at 
which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny shouldve realised that it wasnt reasonable to lend more 
money to Mr F.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Fs case,  I agree with the conclusions of the 
adjudicator and I think that this point was reached  by loan six. I say this because:
when Mr F took out loan six, hed been borrowing  almost  continually and wasnt making 
any inroads in to the amount that he owed. The loans were instalment loans, each with 
six month  terms. But Mr F took overlapping loans. I think  this pattern of lending 
shouldve alerted Sunny to the likelihood that Mr F was having problems managing  his 
money. 
I think that Mr F lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan six 
onwards. This is because:
Ref: DRN30118723the number of loans  that Mr F had taken  from Sunny was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream  credit.  This kept Mr F in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Fs complaint about loans 4 to 8.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges that Mr F paid on loans 4 to 8;
add simple  interest  at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse information about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Fs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information recorded  
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 to 8 should  be removed from Mr Fs 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Fs complaint in part and direct Elevate Credit
International Limited (trading as Sunny) to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 February  2020.
