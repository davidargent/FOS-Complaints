The complaint
Mrs C complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (NewDay) acted irresponsibly when they 
provided her a credit card in February 2017. Mrs C also complains that NewDay didnt 
consider her gambling addiction when offering her the card.
What happened
Mrs C applied for a credit card with NewDay and it was approved in February 2017. The 
statements from April, June and July 2017 show the account had exceeded its limits, and the 
next statement that showed the closing balance was below the limit was December 2018. 
In July 2017 Mrs C told NewDay she was struggling to manage her account and a debt 
management company had suggested she tell NewDay. NewDay obtained an income and 
expenditure form from Mrs C and considered Mrs C had enough disposable income to meet 
the minimum monthly repayment. However, NewDay agreed to refund a late payment fee 
they had charged. 
Mrs C continued to use the card up to its limit and incurred further late payment charges and 
interest.  
Mrs C complained to NewDay in March 2020. She said she had multiple pay day loans, 
other debts and a very poor credit rating when she applied for the card. Mrs C also said she 
had a gambling addiction when she applied for the card. She asked for all the interest and 
fees NewDay had charged to the account to be refunded.
NewDay provided a final response in April 2020. They said they used information from Mrs 
Cs application form and information held by credit reference agencies and decided Mrs C 
met their criteria for a card. NewDay said they couldnt reasonably have known about Mrs 
Cs gambling addiction at the time and said she hadnt mentioned it to them until 2020. They 
also said that they hadnt been able to put in place a payment plan in July 2017, as the 
income and expenditure form Mrs C provided showed that she could afford the minimum 
payment.
As a gesture of goodwill, NewDay refunded two £12 fees they charged when the account 
went over its limit and one late payment charge of £12.
Mrs C didnt agree with what NewDay said and brought her complaint to this service.
Our investigator considered the complaint and thought NewDay hadnt acted irresponsibly 
when they provided Mrs C with the card. The investigator said NewDay had carried out 
proportionate checks, and that they couldnt reasonably have been aware of Mrs Cs 
gambling addition as she hadnt told them of this until March 2020. 
However, the investigator said that NewDay shouldve realised Mrs C was in financial 
difficulties in July 2017. Their records showed that Mrs Cs borrowing had increased 
significantly around this time. The investigator thought it wouldve been reasonable for 
NewDay to have suspended the card at this time and stopped adding interest and charges. 
The investigator thought NewDay should refund all charges and interest from July 2017 and 
pay 8% interest on this amount.
Mrs C agreed this would be a fair and reasonable outcome. NewDay didnt agree with the 
investigator and asked for an ombudsman to decide the case.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
irresponsible and unaffordable lending 
When Mrs C applied for the credit card, NewDay needed to check whether she would be 
able to repay it in a way which was sustainable. They needed to carry out checks which 
were proportionate. And to consider things like the amount of credit being applied for and the 
information Mrs C provided about her financial situation. There isnt a set list of checks, but 
the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Handbook explains what it considers to be 
reasonable credit worthiness checks (CONC 5.2A), and proportionate checks (CONC 
5.2A.20R).  
NewDay say their decision to offer credit was based on information supplied by Mrs C, data 
from the credit reference agencies and their own risk strategies. NewDay says they 
completed various checks including affordability and indebtedness checks before approving 
Mrs Cs application. NewDay say that Mrs C met their eligibility criteria and her declared 
income was more than enough to service their minimum repayment, in addition to the credit 
cards and debts she had when she applied. NewDay is entitled to rely on the declaration by 
Mrs C.
Its for NewDay to decide who they give credit to and on what basis. What Id expect is for 
NewDay to carry out enough checks before they do so. So, based on the information I have 
seen, it was reasonable for NewDay to form the impression Mrs C could afford the credit 
they provided. 
financial difficulties
The crux of Mrs Cs complaint here is whether NewDay shouldve reasonably have been 
aware that the card was being used for Mrs Cs gambling addiction or that she was 
experiencing financial difficulties. And whether they shouldve supported her in July 2017 
when she says her financial difficulties would have been apparent.
Mrs C may not have told NewDay she had a problem with gambling until March 2020, but by 
July 2017 NewDay had information about how she had managed her account. And they 
have provided information about accounts she held with other providers. So, although 
NewDay thought Mrs C could still afford the minimum repayments on her account, I would 
expect them to consider all the information it held, rather than rely solely on the income and 
expenditure form she provided at this time.
In the first month Mrs C had the card, NewDays records show she made cash transactions 
of £365. In the period up until July 2017, Mrs C spent only about £140 on retail products, or 
services. In the same period, NewDays records show Mrs C had taken on several more pay 
day loans and that her overall debt had doubled since the card was approved. In respect of 
the credit card with NewDay, Mrs C had exceeded the credit limit three times in the first five 
months.
Although NewDay is unable to provide a copy of the call it had with Mrs C on 5 July 2017, 
the notes record that Mrs C told them a debt management company had advised her to tell NewDay she was experiencing financial difficulties. I understand that NewDay may not have 
been aware Mrs C had a gambling addiction in July 2017, but the spending on the account 
shouldve raised concerns that this may be a possibility. The overall data NewDay held 
about Mrs Cs other accounts, and the telephone call on 5 July 2017, shouldve reasonably 
alerted them that Mrs C was in financial difficulties at the time. For example, the income and 
expenditure form showed Mrs Cs total debt as £6,500, but NewDays own data shows it was 
about £10,000. And this should have been picked up by NewDay at the time.
I have considered NewDays view that in subsequent calls in September and December 
2017, Mrs C didnt give any indication she needed any help. However, NewDay shouldve 
already been reasonably aware in July 2017 that Mrs C was experiencing financial 
difficulties. 
NewDay has also said they werent aware the account was being used for gambling and 
pointed out that the card was being used for retail purposes. I have already explained that 
NewDays own data confirmed that only about one third of the expenditure on the card up 
until July 2017 was retail spending. And although I accept NewDay may not have been 
aware of a gambling addiction, this sort of spending shouldve prompted NewDay to 
investigate this further. I cant see NewDay considered this.
NewDay doesnt think they shouldve suspended the card in July 2017. They say if they had 
done this, this may have had a greater impact on Mrs Cs financial situation. I dont agree 
with this point of view. The data NewDay have provided shows that from July 2017, the card 
was over the limit 11 times until December 2019. Mrs C incurred eight late payment charges 
in this time, and significant interest was added. And the balance of the card remained at or 
above the limit for over two years. 
I dont think NewDay did enough to help Mrs C in July 2017. Considering the data NewDay 
held, it wouldve been reasonable for them to have suspended the card and stopped the 
interest they were charging. Instead, NewDay allowed interest and late payment charges to 
accrue as Mrs Cs overall financial position became worse and her overall debt doubled over 
the next two years.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I will be asking NewDay Ltd trading as 
Aqua to:
Refund all interest and charges on the account from 5 July 2017; and
pay 8% annual interest on the refunds and charges for the period. * 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, to take off tax from this 
interest. It must give Mrs C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for 
one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2020.
