K820x#14complaint
Mrs R says Lloyds Bank  PLC (Lloyds) mis-sold her a Premier packaged bank account. 
Shes used  a Claims Management  Company  (CMC) to make  her complaint.
background
Lloyds agreed  that it mis-sold the Premier  account and offered the difference in fees 
between it and the cheaper  Platinum account,  plus interest, in order to put things  right. Our 
adjudicators looked at Mrs Rs complaint and didnt think Lloyds had treated her unfairly. The 
CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mrs Rs complaint. 
Having carefully looked  at everything  provided,  Im not upholding Mrs Rs complaint. Id like 
to explain the reasons  for my decision.  I think Mrs R chose to take the Premier account.  She 
also appears to have had identifiable  needs for the main benefits on the cheaper Platinum 
account and Ive seen no reason why she couldnt have used the benefits too. Indeed  she 
did do so. 
So overall I dont  think that Lloyds decision to offer the difference in fees between the 
Premier and Platinum account, plus interest,  is unfair given the particular circumstances of 
Mrs Rs complaint. And, in these  circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mrs Rs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs R to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 February  2019.
