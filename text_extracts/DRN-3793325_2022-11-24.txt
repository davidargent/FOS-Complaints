The complaint
Mr C complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA unfairly placed a limitation on his 
account. He wants PayPal to reinstate his account. 
What happened
In late 2020, PayPal placed a limitation on Mr Cs account and decided to look into how Mr C 
was operating his account. Following its review PayPal told Mr C that a restriction had been 
applied to his account due to a breach of its user agreement.
 
Mr C complained to PayPal, but they said it wasnt prepared to reinstate Mr Cs account. So, 
Mr C brought his complaint to our service. He explained that the restriction on his account 
was causing him significant stress and that PayPal had made a mistake.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Cs complaint. She explained why she didnt think 
PayPal had done anything wrong. Mr C disagreed. He says he hasnt done anything wrong 
and hadnt breached the terms of his account. 
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the terms of Mr Cs PayPal user agreement which Mr C would have agreed to 
when he opened his account with PayPal and whether PayPal treated Mr C fairly when it 
decided to place a limitation on his account. PayPals user agreement states it can limit an 
account in certain circumstances. These circumstances include a breach of the user 
agreement.
PayPal reviewed the use of Mr Cs account and identified an issue with the use of it. And it 
decided to permanently limit the use of the account. This meant Mr C wasnt able to use the 
account. Ive reviewed the evidence provided by PayPal and having done so Im satisfied 
that PayPal acted in line with the user agreement when they decided to place a limitation on 
Mr Cs account.
I know Mr C is frustrated that he hasnt been given a detailed reason as to why PayPal has 
done this. But its not obliged to do so. So, I cant say it has done anything wrong in not 
giving him this information as much as hed like to know. Having said that I can see that 
when PayPal wrote to Mr C to let him know it had limited his account, it did provide Mr C with 
an explanation for its actions and referred him to its terms and conditions. So, I think its likely 
Mr C had some understanding of the reason behind PayPals decision.  
Mr C says not having a functioning PayPal account has caused him a good deal of stress 
and he wants his account reinstated. Ive no doubt that having his PayPal account limited 
was inconvenient and upsetting for Mr C, but based on the information Ive seen I cant say 
PayPal has acted unreasonably and treated Mr C unfairly. Im satisfied that PayPal has 
followed its processes and the terms of its user agreement here. So, I dont think its done 
anything wrong by limiting Mr Cs account. And I wont be asking PayPal to reinstate Mr Cs 
account.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 December 2022.
