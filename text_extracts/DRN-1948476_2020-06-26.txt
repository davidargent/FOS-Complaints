The complaint
Mr W complains about a decision made by PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) to 
refund £200 to someone hed sold a camera to. Hes unhappy at the way PayPal made their 
decision, and their responses to him when he raised his issues.
I looked at this complaint in April and reached a different view to our investigator whod been 
dealing with it. I sent out a provisional decision explaining my views, and asked Mr W and 
PayPal to let me know their thoughts. Im now going to make a final decision. 
Im not going to repeat everything that was in my provisional decision, just the bits that are 
needed to understand the complaint and my reasoning about it.
What happened
Mr W sold a camera online, receiving payment through PayPal. Mr W says he sent the 
camera out, but the buyer told PayPal theyd received an empty box. PayPal opened a 
dispute.
In my provisional decision, I described how PayPal decided to give the buyer back their 
money back, even though Mr W had told them hed had problems responding to the dispute 
on their systems. PayPal say in response to my provisional decision that they dont have a 
record of customers at the time having a problem with the system they used. 
But Ive seen at least one customer contacted PayPal about it  Mr W. The issue may not 
have been widespread, but it affected Mr W, and I cant see PayPal did anything about it 
before making their decision. 
I also described how PayPal defended their decision when Mr W appealed by saying he 
hadnt given them proof of delivery for the item. When Mr W sent this, noting he hadnt been 
asked to send it before the decision was made, PayPal said a signed statement from the 
buyer saying they were telling the truth supported the decision theyd made. Mr W wrote 
back and pointed out again that PayPal hadnt asked him for a similar statement, and he 
questioned how the statement proved what had happened.
Mr Ws further contact about the matter resulted in repeated responses from PayPal simply 
saying theyd decided to give the buyer back their money based on the evidence theyd 
seen. They also suggested Mr W could appeal the decision, despite his already having done 
so. 
When the matter came to me for a decision, I found PayPal hadnt treated Mr W fairly in the 
dispute. Theyd made their decision without giving him a chance to put his side of the matter 
to them. And their contact with him afterwards was then unreasonable, because it didnt 
appear to listen to the valid points he raised about PayPals decision-making process. 
DRN-1948476I saw how upset and frustrated this made Mr W. I decided not to do anything about the value 
of the disputed transaction, reasoning a fair decision-making process might still have gone 
against Mr W in the dispute. But to recognise the emotional impact on Mr W of the unfair 
treatment he received, I said PayPal should pay him £300. 
I cant see that Mr W responded to my provisional decision, but PayPal didnt agree with it. 
Ill touch on the points theyve raised below before confirming my final decision for this case.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal have noted their arbitration policy is a voluntary scheme, and the final decision about 
whether to side with a buyer or a seller is their discretion. I have no disagreement with that, 
and I noted as much in my provisional decision. 
The question for me is whether the service PayPal gave Mr W was fair and reasonable. The 
issue in this case was that the investigation PayPal carried out before making their decision 
wasnt fair. 
To carry out a fair investigation of the dispute, PayPal should have given both Mr W and the 
buyer an equal chance to put forward their versions of events before they made a decision. 
PayPal didnt do that. Mr W told PayPal he had problems accessing their resolution centre to 
give them his side of the matter. But PayPal made their decision without fixing that. Their 
decision was based on evidence gathered from only one side of the dispute  the buyer. 
Its also not fair that PayPals decision initially relied on not having something from Mr W that 
they hadnt asked him to provide. Particularly as PayPal then changed their reasoning so the 
item didnt play a part in their decision once they had it.
Putting things right
PayPal have also noted that their decision could have gone against Mr W. I recognised this 
in my provisional decision though, and explained this was part of my reasoning when 
deciding £300 was the right figure to recognise the emotional impact on Mr W in this case. 
I accept PayPals decision after a fairer investigation might still have been to refund the 
money to the buyer. That would mean some disappointment for Mr W, like what he feels 
now. But it would have been significantly less frustrating and upsetting for him if hed been 
listened to and a fair process had been followed to get to that decision.
But the process PayPal used here was unfair to Mr W. I can see that left him frustrated and 
upset with the decision PayPal made. Their contact with him about it didnt do enough to 
recognise the failings in the investigation process, or give answers to the valid questions 
Mr W asked. That made the frustration much worse.
Putting a financial amount on an emotional impact is always going to be a matter of opinion. 
But balancing the factors above, Im still of the view £300 suitably reflects the significant 
level of upset caused for Mr W by the way PayPal treated him in this dispute.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ws complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA. To recognise the upset 
caused to him, they should pay Mr W £300 compensation.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 July 2020.
