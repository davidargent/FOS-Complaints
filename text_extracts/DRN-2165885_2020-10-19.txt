The complaint
Mr and Mrs B complain that Simplyhealth Access has refused to reimburse them for 
treatment under a dental insurance policy.
What happened
In December 2018, Mrs B submitted a claim for dental treatment shed had. Simplyhealth 
turned down the claim, as Mrs B had exceeded her annual limit for dental treatment. 
Unhappy about this, Mr and Mrs B brought a complaint to this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. She thought Simplyhealth was 
entitled to turn down the claim, as Mrs B had used up her annual allowance. 
Mr and Mrs B didnt accept our investigators findings and so the matter has been passed to 
me for a decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The policy says:
We will pay you up to the maximum amount of your chosen level shown in the table of cover 
for each benefit, every claiming year.
Based on the level of cover held by Mr and Mrs B, the table of cover confirms that dental 
treatment under the policy has an annual limit of £120 for each insured person. The claiming 
year ran from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019.
Mrs B made claims for dental treatment in June and October 2018, which took her over her 
annual limit. The maximum limit of £120 was paid for those claims. That meant she didnt 
have any entitlement left when she submitted her claim in December 2018. 
Im satisfied that Simplyhealth was entitled to turn down the claim for further dental 
treatment, as it had already paid Mrs B her maximum allowance for dental treatment in that 
claiming year.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B and Mr B to 
accept or reject my decision before 16 November 2020.
