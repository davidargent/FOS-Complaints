The complaint
Miss R complains that J D Williams & Company Limited increased the rate of interest 
charged on her catalogue account.
What happened
Miss R opened an account with Williams in July 2017 with a monthly interest rate of 59.9%. 
In September 2018 it increased this 65%. Williams says it wrote to Miss R on 30 August 
2018 to notify her of the change. It has explained to this service that it was entitled to make 
this increase within the rules applicable at the time.
Miss Rs complaint was rejected by Williams and she brought the matter to this service 
where it was considered by one of our investigators who didnt recommend it be upheld after 
further information was provided.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate my decision will come as a disappointment to Miss R, but Williams was entitled 
to increase the rate of interest it charged so long as it gave due notice. I appreciate Miss R 
does not recollect receiving the letter Williams issued, but I am satisfied from seeing its 
records that the letter was sent.
The rules relating to interest rates were amended after the increase was introduced and 
Williams has explained that it continually assessed lenders accounts and were the level of 
risk was deemed to have increased it would increase interest rates. This is what it did and I 
can see from the account history that Miss R built up balances in excess of Â£1,000 which 
she subsequently reduced. However, that means Williams had grounds to make the 
increase.
I can fully understand Miss Rs frustration, but I cannot safely conclude that Williams did 
anything wrong.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 December 2021.
