K820x#14complaint
Mr S, as a director of company S, complains that LeasePlan UK Limited (LeasePlan) 
wouldnt take into account reduced mileage  in its early settlement figure (ESF).  He would 
like this to be taken  into account. And the ESF reduced accordingly.
background
Mr S he entered into a Hire Agreement with LeasePlan that was to run for 60 months in 
December 2015.   He says when he asked  about  withdrawing early from the agreement  in 
February 2019 - LeasePlan gave  him an ESF of Â£2,188.45.
Mr S says he queried why LeasePlan wouldnt reduce  the ESF to take into account he had 
used the car for less than the agreed mileage.  
LeasePlan said there was no provision in the agreement Mr S signed  to reduce the ESF to 
reflect the mileage  actually used. It noted it had made an overall loss when it subsequently 
sold the car. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. She didnt  find that LeasePlan had done 
anything wrong. There  was no allowance in the contract Mr S signed for the ESF to reflect 
reduced mileage on early withdrawal from the agreement. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand Mr Ss frustration. As he says if he had done excess  mileage LeasePlan 
would have charged for this. So he feels its unfair  as he did less than the agreed mileage 
when he ended his agreement that this isnt taken into account  in the ESF.
I have looked  closely at the agreement  Mr S signed. Unfortunately there is no allowance in 
the contract  for this. And so, however unfair  Mr S feels this is, I dont think that LeasePlan 
has done anything  wrong in not taking this into account when it put together  its ESF figures.
I have seen the early  termination letter LeasePlan sent Mr S. In this it clearly states what  the 
ESF would be. And also what LeasePlan took into account in arriving at its ESF. It makes  no 
reference to less than agreed mileage.  So I think Mr S would have known this wasnt 
included in LeasePlans calculation  but he went ahead and signed the agreement.  He 
didnt have to do so if he wasnt happy  with the figures. 
So on the basis of all I have seen I dont think I can reasonably ask LeasePlan to reduce the 
ESF to take into account Mr Ss actual  mileage.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 July 2019.
