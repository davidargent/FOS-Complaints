K820x#14complaint
Mr N complains that Barclays  Bank  UK PLC unfairly  placed a Credit  Industry  Fraud 
Avoidance System (CIFAS) marker against his name. He wants  Barclays  to remove the 
marker.  
background
Mr N had a current and savings account  with Barclays.
On 10 October 2017, £900.00 was credited to Mr Ns current  account. Following this the 
money was withdrawn from the account using a cash machine. The withdrawal was made  
using Mr Ns genuine card and PIN.
Shortly after the withdrawal, on 10 October  2017,  Barclays were contacted by another  bank, 
which I will refer to as bank B. It said Mr N wasnt entitled to the £900.00 payment made to 
his current account.
Mr N says that three fraudulent withdrawals, which included the £900.00  withdrawal, totalling 
£1,165.43 were made from his current account  between 25 September and 10 October 
2017.

Mr N said he last used his card on 22 September 2017. And that he hadnt  realised  his card 
and banking details  were missing until Barclays wrote to him on 14 October 2017 to let him 
know it was closing his accounts. 
On 26 June 2018 Mr N contacted Barclays to say he didnt make the disputed transactions.  
And that hed lost his card on a bus. Mr N says he tried logging into his online banking  
between 10 and 15 October 2017,  but wasnt able to do so. And he thought  hed simply 
entered the wrong details.
Barclays investigated and didnt accept Mr Ns disputed transaction claim.  It said there was 
no evidence of fraudulent activity and that Mr N had authorised the transactions  or made 
them himself  because:
Mr Ns genuine card and PIN was used for all of the disputed transactions 
Mr N hadnt provided a plausible explanation as to how his bank card and PIN were 
compromised
additional identification was required for the £900.00 ASD withdrawal, which  would 
have been Mr Ns day or year of birth
balance enquires  were carried out before  and after the disputed  transactions 
the disputed  transactions  wouldve affected Mr Ns available  balance 
Mr N wouldve been aware  of the difference  in his available  balance  upon checking 
his balance
Mr N didnt report his bank card as lost or stolen
Mr N didnt get in touch to ask why his bank accounts were being  closed 
Mr N was using his online banking  to make undisputed transactions
Mr Ns PIN had been the same since 2014
Mr N didnt report the fraudulent transactions until June 2018
In October  2018 Barclays closed Mr Ns account  and recorded a CIFAS marker  against his 
name. Mr N didnt agree with Barclayss decision.  So he contacted  us and asked us to look 
into the disputed  transactions and the recording  of the CIFAS marker. 
An investigator looked into Mr Ns complaint  and asked Mr N some additional questions 
about the £900.00 payment made to his account  on 10 October  2017.  And how someone 
else would  have been able to gain possession of his bank card,  PIN and online banking  
details to make the transactions he disputes.  
Ref: DRN61870673Mr N told the investigator that he kept his online banking details in a wallet  separately to his 
bank card and PIN. But he couldnt  pinpoint when they all went missing.  Mr N told the 
investigator that someone at his college, who I will refer to as Mr T had tricked him into 
revealing his PIN number.  And he was suspected of stealing bank  cards. Mr N told the 
investigator that he believes Mr T took his card, PIN and online banking details from his bag 
whilst he was at college. And then used the details and card to transfer £900.00 into his 
account and then withdraw the money.
Mr N told the investigator that he had opened a savings account  with Barclays on 9 October 
2017 and transferred money into the account  from his current account.  He said hed opened 
the account because he was looking for a job and wanted to save up. Mr N also confirmed 
that hed received a new PINSentry  device  from Barclays  in September  2017. And he said 
that he understood that hed need to use the device to check his online balance. 
Overall having looked  at the sequence of events, and Mr Ns online activity, the investigator 
said it was more likely than not Mr N authorised  the disputed transactions  which  were  made  
after 22 September 2017 including the withdrawal of the fraudulent funds. So the investigator 
said Barclays hadnt done anything wrong  when it applied the CIFAS marker. 
Mr N didnt agree with the investigators view. He said he hadnt carried  out the transactions 
and he wants Barclays to remove  the marker. As no agreement could be reached the 
complaint has come  to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive decided not to 
uphold the complaint, for broadly the same reasons as the investigator.
disputed transactions
Mr N says he didnt make the point of sale transactions  and cash  withdrawals between 25 
September and 10 October 2017. So my primary concern is to come to a view about 
whether or not I think Mr N authorised the payments. 
Im satisfied from looking at Barclayss technical evidence that Mr Ns genuine  card and PIN 
were used to make  the disputed transactions between 25 September  and 10 October 2017. 
Barclays has also provided records showing Mr Ns online banking activity.  This shows that 
Mr N was still logging onto his online banking after 25 September 2017. From looking at the 
evidence this is based on two things: the cookies used to logon and the IP address or 
location used.  
A cookie  is a small file which is sent from a website and stored on a users computer. These 
are unique to the device  accessing the website and cant be duplicated.  The only way a 
cookie can change is by logging on from a different computer or device, or by clearing the 
cache on the computer or device. The next time a user logs onto the computer or device, a 
new cookie is generated. 
Mr Ns online activity report shows the cookie  which was created at 19:57 on 26 September  
2017, was used to upgrade Mr Ns account  to PINSentry and apply for the savings account 
Ref: DRN61870674on 9 October 2017. It was also used to carry out a balance enquiry  on 10 October  2017  at 
12:36 after the fraudulent  funds were paid into Mr Ns account.
Mr N has confirmed that he opened the savings  account online. And that he received a 
PINSentry device from Barclays. So, I think its more likely than not it was Mr Ns device or 
computer that was used to access  online banking  on 10 October 2017 after the fraudulent 
funds had been paid into the account  minutes earlier.  
From looking  at the evidence, I dont  think  its unreasonable for Barclays to conclude  that 
Mr N authorised the transactions hes disputed. I say this because:
Mr Ns genuine card and PIN was used for all of the disputed transactions 
Mr N hasnt provided a plausible explanation about how his card was lost or stolen or 
how somebody else wouldve known  his PIN and online  banking details
additional identification was used to make the £900.00 withdrawal on 10 October 
2017 which would have been Mr Ns day or year of birth.  And Mr N hasnt provided a 
convincing explanation as to how someone else would know this information
Mr N hasnt disputed opening  a savings account with Barclays  on 9 October 2017 
and transferring money from his current account into the savings account
the same  cookie was used to check Mr Ns account balance on 10 October 2017, to 
order a PINSentry device on 26 September 2017 and open Mr Ns savings account 
on 9 October 2017
Mr N didnt report the disputed transactions until June 2018 yet I can see from Mr Ns 
account activity  that he carried out balance enquires after the disputed transactions.  
So I find it unusual that he didnt report the issue sooner
Mr N was using his online banking  to make undisputed transactions
balance enquires  were carried out before  and after the disputed  transactions 
the disputed  transactions  wouldve affected Mr Ns available  balance significantly 
reducing from £269.08 to £3.65  on 25 September 2017. And significantly increasing it 
from £2.65 to £902.65  on 10 October 2017
Mr N wouldve been aware  of the difference  in his available  balance  upon checking 
his balance yet didnt report this to Barclays
the transactions occurred over a period of two weeks which is unusual given thered 
be a risk Mr N mightve reported  his card as lost or stolen during this time
Mr N didnt report his bank card as lost or stolen
Mr N didnt get in touch with Barclays to ask why his bank accounts were being  
closed 
So when I weigh everything up, I think its more  likely than not that Mr N authorised the 
transactions. 
CIFAS marker
Barclays says it applied  the CIFAS marker  because Mr N received  fraudulent  funds into his 
account and retained a wrongful credit. So Ive looked at whether Barclays was fair to apply 
the marker,  based  on the evidence it had, and the investigation it carried out. And what the 
rules say about applying such markers.
Ref: DRN61870675Having reviewed Mr Ns account  of events and the evidence Barclays provided,  Im satisfied 
that Barclays have  sufficient evidence for the CIFAS marker to be recorded against Mr Ns 
name. In coming to this view, Ive taken into account the following reasons:
Barclays have provided  evidence to show the inward payment received  on 
10 October 2017 was fraudulent
Mr N had an opportunity to alert Barclays hed received fraudulent  funds. But he 
benefited from the funds by making  cash withdrawals
Mr N didnt dispute the funds were  fraudulent  when he spoke to Barclays  in June 
2018 about the marker
Mr N provided  a different explanation to our investigator about  the source of the 
funds. But he hasnt  provided any evidence to support  this
Taking everything into account,  I find that Barclays have met the burden of proof required by 
CIFAS to add the marker.  So I think its fair that it reported Mr N to CIFAS. And Im not going 
to ask Barclays to remove  the marker. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint. Under  the rules of the Financial  
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or reject  my decision before 
4 November 2019.
