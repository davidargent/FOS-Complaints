The complaint
Mr Z has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc has not renewed his credit card 
and that it gave conflicting reasons for doing so. 
What happened
Mr Z has had his credit card with NatWest since 1987 and it has been renewed regularly in 
that time. In May 2019 NatWest did not reissue the card. Mr Z contacted NatWest to find out 
why the card had not been renewed. Mr Z was told that since the bank could not locate the 
terms and conditions of the credit agreement it was unable to enforce the debt on the card. 
As a result NatWest had decided not to reissue the card. It invited Mr Z to apply for a 
different credit card if he wished to do so. 
Mr Z contacted NatWest again to explain that he was due to clear the credit card balance 
shortly and asked that NatWest reconsider its decision not to renew the card. NatWest 
refused to reissue the card citing Mr Zs management of the card during the period 2013 to 
2014 as the reason. Mr Z queried this reasoning since the card had been renewed since 
2014 up until 2019. 
Mr Z complained to NatWest that it did not inform him that it was not going to be renewing 
his card and that its reasons for not doing so were unclear. Mr Z felt he was left at a 
disadvantage since in applying for a new card he would have higher interest rates due to his 
credit file. 
NatWest apologised to Mr Z for the confusing messages he received regarding the card. 
NatWest said that it would have sent Mr Z a letter confirming that the card would not be 
renewed six to eight weeks before expiry of the card. Mr Z did not receive this letter. 
NatWest told Mr Z that the reason that the bank did not renew the credit card was because it 
was unable to locate the original credit agreement and requested that Mr Z apply for a new 
card. Mr Z was assured that the management of his credit card had no bearing on the 
decision made. Mr Z requested details of all information NatWest held on him. NatWest 
therefore arranged for a Subject Access Request on behalf of Mr Z.
Mr Z was not happy with the response received from NatWest and referred his complaint to 
this service. Our investigator concluded that NatWests level of customer service was less 
than satisfactory and upheld Mr Zs complaint. The investigator said that NatWest should 
pay Mr Z £125 to recognise the trouble and upset caused. 
NatWest agreed with the investigators finding. Mr Z agreed with the level of trouble and 
upset but felt that the investigator had not taken all of the issues into account and wanted 
NatWest to reconsider its decision not to renew the credit card. The complaint has been 
passed to me for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think at this stage it is important to explain that whilst I empathise with Mr Zs position, its 
not inherently unfair for a business to cease providing a credit facility to a customer. 
Provided it exercises its commercial judgement fairly, NatWest is entitled to decide to whom 
it wishes to lend. Where this is the case, its not for me to compel NatWest to renew 
someones credit card.
On review of the evidence it is clear that Mr Z received conflicting reasons for the credit card 
not being renewed and this led to some confusion. This was further compounded when after 
being told that the credit card would not be renewed Mr Z received a letter saying that he 
had an option to clear the balance of the card in six months to keep the card open. This 
letter led Mr Z to believe that there was a chance that he would still be able to keep his credit 
card but that was not case. NatWest explained that this letter was sent in error and 
apologised for the confusion. 
I have looked at the relevant regulations here. Section 98A(4) of the Consumer Credit Act 
(CCA) is relevant, given that not reissuing a card effectively terminates or suspends the 
customers right to draw on credit. S98A(4) has the effect that NatWest should not only notify 
the customer of its decision to decline to reissue the card, but give its reasons for the 
decision and have objective justification for the reason.
NatWest has confirmed that the reason it did not reissue Mr Zs credit card is because it 
could not locate the terms and conditions of the credit agreement and so it was unable to 
enforce the debt on the card. I am satisfied that this is an objective justification for its 
decision not to renew the card. However NatWest has not fully complied with s98A CCA 
since it failed to serve timely notice to Mr Z (and by extension, didnt provide him with its 
reasons).
NatWest told Mr Z that it would have sent him a letter six to eight weeks before the expiry of 
the card to explain that the card would not be renewed. NatWest have been unable to 
provide me with a copy of that letter and Mr Z has confirmed that he did not receive it. I 
further note that in addition to the CCA requirement, NatWests terms and conditions also 
say it should notify customers in writing, in advance, that a card is not going to be issued. On 
this occasion there is no evidence that this happened and therefore NatWests service has 
fallen short of what I would have expected and is not in line with the banks own terms and 
conditions.
Im aware Mr Z feels that there may be other reasons behind NatWests decision not to 
renew the card but I can see no evidence of this. 
I understand the position that Mr Z now finds himself in, and NatWests service has fallen 
short of what I would have expected. He would like NatWest to reconsider its decision 
regarding his credit card. But I do not consider that it would be an appropriate remedy for me 
to require in settlement of his complaint. The banks shortcomings here dont suggest to me 
it should be compelled to renew Mr Zs credit card, though I appreciate Mr Z will be 
disappointed by this.
Putting things right
I believe £125 is a fair offer to reflect the trouble and upset caused to Mr Z following the 
issues identified above. 
My final decisionFor the reasons detailed above I am upholding Mr Zs complaint.
I require National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mr Z £125 in compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 November 2020.
