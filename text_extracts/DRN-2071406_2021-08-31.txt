The complaint
Mr Y complains Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) lent to him irresponsibly
What happened
In December 2014 Mr Y applied for, and was given a loan for £2,000, which was repayable 
over a period of 24 months. The repayments were around £113 a month, and in total Mr Y 
agreed to pay back just over £2,700 over the two years, once interest was added. The loan 
was repaid early in February 2015.
Mr Y says 118 118 Money shouldnt have given him the loan because it wasnt affordable. 
He says as a result of being given the loan he ended up with defaults being registered on his 
credit file and eventually entered into an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA). This has 
caused him stress and anxiety.
118 118 Money says it did check whether the loan was affordable, and Mr Y did have 
enough disposable income to make the loan repayments. It says it also checked Mr Ys 
credit file before agreeing to lend the money to him and this showed all his accounts were 
well paid.
Our investigator didnt think Mr Ys complaint should be upheld. Mr Y didnt agree so this 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on 
our website. And Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr Ys complaint.
118 118 Money needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend to Mr Y 
irresponsibly. It should have completed reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that Mr Y would be able to pay the loan in a sustainable way.
118 118 Money did complete some checks to see if the loan was affordable. But I agree with 
the investigator that given the amount of money Mr Y was borrowing, the information he had 
provided about his income and expenditure, together with the information on his credit file, 
118 118 Moneys checks werent good enough. 
I appreciate that Mr Y thinks that because Ive found there were shortcomings in 118 118 
Moneys checks, it follows that his complaint should succeed. But I need to go on to consider 
what position Mr Y is likely to have been in, if 118 118 Money had done what they should 
have  ie would proportionate checks have shown 118 118 Money shouldnt have given 
Mr Y the loan? 
Weve asked Mr Y for further information about his financial situation in 2014, specifically his 
bank statements from this time. These would have given us a good understanding of what 
proportionate checks would have shown. Unfortunately, Mr Y hasnt been able to provide 
these or any other documents to show his financial situation. So the only information I have 
about Mr Ys financial position in 2014 is the information 118 118 Money gathered before it 
gave him the loan.
The available information does raise questions such as: why did Mr Y need to borrow £2,000 
if he had a disposable income of at least £500 a month? And why had he opened several 
new credit card accounts in the twelve months before taking out this loan? 
But while these questions, and others, should have led 118 118 Money to do further checks, 
there isnt enough in the available information to say its likely these further checks would 
have shown 118 118 Money shouldnt have given the loan to Mr Y. After all, as 118 118 
Money has pointed out, the checks it did do showed Mr Y had enough disposable income to 
make the repayments, and the credit file showed his accounts were well paid. So I cant say 
118 118 Money unfairly provided Mr Y with the loan.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2021.
