The complaint
Mr H complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and the way they handled the claim 
he made under their Buyer Protection Policy (BPP).
What happened
On 10 December 2021, Mr H made a purchase from an online retailer, who Ill refer to as 
X, for $1262.02 USD. He made this purchase through his account with PayPal.
On 15 January 2022, Mr H made a claim on PayPals Buyer Protection Policy, saying the 
item(s) he purchased from X were significantly not as described (SNAD). 
On 22 March, PayPal requested proof from Mr H that hed returned the item(s) to X. And on 
the same day, Mr H supplied a tracking number. But when PayPal reviewed this information, 
they found that the item(s) had been returned to Mr H, as X had changed address and so 
delivery couldnt be completed. So, PayPal advised they were unable to close the claim in 
Mr Hs favour until the return of the items had been completed. To assist with the cost of this, 
PayPal provided Mr H with a £40 voucher.
On 7 April, PayPal requested evidence from Mr H that the return had been completed 
correctly. But they didnt receive this and so, they declined Mr Hs claim the following day. 
Later that month, PayPal received notification that Mr H has raised a chargeback with his 
bank account provider, which they believe was successful. As Mr H raised a chargeback, 
PayPal have said a claim can no longer be made under their BPP. Mr H was unhappy, so he 
raised a complaint.
Mr H didnt think PayPal were fair to expect him to cover the postage costs of the delivery, 
as hed already done this once before unsuccessfully. He didnt think it was his fault X had 
changed address and he didnt think PayPal made him aware of this and gave the correct 
address information. So, he thought PayPal should uphold the claim he made under their 
BPP and refund him the amount he paid to X.
PayPal didnt agree. They thought theyd declined the claim fairly, under the terms of the 
BPP. And they didnt think they were responsible for the costs of the return, or the difficulty 
Mr H faced regarding this. They explained they were under the impression Mr H had 
received a refund via the chargeback he raised with his bank. And as a chargeback was 
raised, a claim could no longer be made under the BPP. So, they didnt think they needed to 
do anything more. Mr H remained unhappy with this response, so he referred his complaint 
to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. They thought PayPals 
request for proof of the return was reasonable, and in line with the terms of the BPP. And as 
the item(s) hadnt been returned, they didnt think PayPal acted unfairly when declining the 
claim. Because of this, they didnt think PayPal needed to do anything more.
Mr H didnt agree, and he provided evidence to show his chargeback claim hadnt been 
successful as well as a quote for postage which he thought was too expensive and 
unreasonable to expect. Our investigators recommendation remained the same and Mr H 
continued to disagree. So, the complaint has been passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr H. I understand he was 
unhappy with the item(s) he received from X. And I appreciate Mr H spent a significant 
amount and so, would rightly be disappointed about this. I can also understand why Mr H 
would be left feeling frustrated at the need to cover the cost of the item(s) return, which were 
substantial due to X trading from abroad. Despite this cost, Mr H attempted to ensure the 
return was completed, incurring the costs of this, only to discover X had moved address 
which I appreciate wasnt his fault. So, when PayPal made Mr H aware hed need to arrange 
a second return, bearing the costs of this again, for a claim to be upheld, I can why 
understand he'd be upset about this. And I can understand why Mr H may feel PayPal acted 
unfairly when declining the claim when he decided it was too much of a risk, and financial 
burden, to return the item(s) to X again.
But for me to say PayPal have done something wrong, Id need to be satisfied that PayPal 
failed to act in line with the terms of the BPP when declining the claim. Or, if I think they did 
act within these, that it was unfair of them to do so. And in this situation, I dont think thats 
the case.
Before I explain why Ive reached my decision, I think it would be useful for me to explain 
exactly what Ive been able to consider. I appreciate Mr H is unhappy with the item(s) he 
received from X, as well as Xs decision to move address without any notification. Both 
issues are the responsibility of X themselves, and not the responsibility of PayPal. So, I 
havent considered these further.
I appreciate Mr H feels PayPal shouldve provided him with an up to date address for X, but I 
wouldnt expect PayPal to do so. Mr H was the customer of X, not PayPal. PayPal merely 
processed Mr Hs payment to X. So, when Mr H was arranging for the return and its 
associated delivery, I think it was up to Mr H and X to ensure the details held were correct.
So, my decision has instead focused on PayPals decision to decline the claim and their 
reasoning for this.
Ive seen the terms of the BPP, which states clear that if a customer is making an SNAD 
claim, which Mr H was, that PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back 
to the sellerand to provide proof of delivery. So, I think PayPal acted within the terms of 
the BPP when requesting Mr H to do so and that they were able to make this stipulation.
I appreciate Mr H doesnt think this is fair. And I recognise the shipping costs to process the 
return were significant. But I dont think PayPal should be responsible for this cost, as it was 
Mr Hs own decision to purchase the item(s) from X, who were located abroad. And it wasnt 
PayPals fault that the item(s) received didnt meet Mr Hs expectations.
Despite this, I can see PayPal offered Mr H a £40 voucher to assist with these costs, which is more than Id expect them to do. I have seen a quote of the shipping costs from Mr H, and 
I understand it would be a financial risk to pay this again in case he encountered the same 
issue with the return itself. But this was Mr Hs own decision on whether he deemed the risk 
to be worth taking. And I think PayPal were fair to decline the claim when they did, as the 
item(s) hadnt been returned. I think this was a fair stipulation to make as I wouldnt expect 
Mr H to be placed in a position where he had both the funds and the item he originally 
ordered. So, I dont think I can say PayPal have acted unfairly.
Since PayPal declined the claim, Mr H raised a chargeback with his bank account provider. 
This isnt disputed. Mr H says this chargeback wasnt successful whereas PayPal believe 
they were told by Mr Hs bank that it was. Ive seen evidence from Mr H to show the 
chargeback wasnt successful and so I can understand why Mr H sees PayPal as his only 
route to obtaining a refund. But I can see within the terms of the BPP that it states, if you 
pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later. And 
this term isnt impacted by the success or failure of the chargeback claim. So, I dont think 
PayPal have acted unfairly, or outside of the terms of the BPP, when stating Mr H is no 
longer able to make a claim under their BPP on this occasion. Mr H did have the opportunity 
of attempting to return the items to X a second time and it was his own decision to decide 
the postage costs were too substantial to attempt this.
Because of this, I dont think PayPal have acted unfairly and so, I dont think they need to do 
anything more.
I understand this isnt the outcome Mr H was hoping for. And I appreciate this does little to 
address the financial loss Mr H feels hes incurred, as he paid a significant amount of money 
for item(s) he isnt happy with. But as Ive explained above, PayPal arent responsible for the 
quality of the item(s) X provided, or the issues Mr H has faced when trying to return them to 
X. PayPal are only responsible for ensuring the claim Mr H made has been processed fairly, 
and in the line with terms of the BPP. And I think it has been on this occasion. 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 August 2022.
