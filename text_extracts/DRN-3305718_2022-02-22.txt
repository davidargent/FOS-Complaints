DRN-3305718
The complaint
Mr D complains that NewDay Ltd unfairly recorded adverse information on his credit file.
What happened
Mr D says he agreed a repayment plan with NewDay in 2014 and it recorded late payment 
markers on his credit file. He says those markers were recorded until 2018 when he 
completed the payment plan. Mr D says that was unfair and NewDay ought to have either 
registered a default on his credit file or recorded the payments as being on time.
NewDay says it agreed a number of payment plans with Mr D from 2014. It says it reported 
the correct information to the Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs) that there were late 
payments as Mr D was repaying less than he was required to do. NewDay says it didnt 
register a default as Mr Ds account didnt reach 180 days of arrears. It says it agreed a 
partial settlement with Mr D in 2018.
Mr D brought his complaint to us and our investigator upheld the complaint. The investigator 
thought the late payment markers had a serious impact on Mr Ds credit file and NewDay 
ought to have recorded a default on it. The investigator also thought the information had a 
negative not positive impact on the credit file.
NewDay doesnt accept that view and maintains it has obligation to record accurate 
information on a credit file.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and said I provisionally didnt uphold it.
I said I was satisfied that NewDay was obliged to report accurate information to the CRAs 
and doesnt have a discretion in doing so. And the importance of that information is to allow 
lenders to assess for example the affordability of a loan or credit. 
I looked carefully at NewDays records and I didnt think there was any dispute that Mr D was 
in financial difficulties from at least 2014 on. I could see that NewDay tried to help Mr D by 
agreeing a number of repayment plans with him and that it didnt default his account. I 
thought that had NewDay registered a default on Mr Ds account then that would have had a 
more significant impact than the recording of late markers. I didnt think NewDay made a 
mistake by recording those late payment markers as I was satisfied Mr D was making 
payments less than the contractual required amounts. And I made clear that NewDay was 
obliged to reflect the agreement on Mr Ds credit file. I could see that one CRA has recorded 
the arrangement as a plan whereas others have recorded late payments markers. I thought 
the overall outcome was the same and in any event its up to individual CRAs how they 
record this type of information.
I appreciated Mr D says NewDay ought to have registered a default on his credit file as that 
would now have expired. The Information Commissioners Office says a default should be 
recorded where a relationship has broken down and says that would be within 3 to 6 months 
of arrears.
I looked at NewDays records and was satisfied that Mr D made regular payments that 
meant his account didnt ever reach 180 days of arrears and that it was clear the relationship 
between him and NewDay hadnt broken down. I said that as NewDay agreed a plan with Mr 
D and he kept making regular payments. So, I didnt think NewDay ought to have registered 
a default in those circumstances.
Overall, I was satisfied NewDay tried to help Mr D avoid a default in 2014 by agreeing 
repayment plans with him. I was satisfied that the test is not if information on a credit file had 
a negative or positive affect on a credit file but if its accurate. I made clear that I 
provisionally found the information NewDay reported to the CRAs was accurate and 
reflected its agreement with Mr D. And if NewDay hadnt reported the late payments or the 
existence of a debt repayment plan then I didnt think other lenders would be able to make a 
fair assessment of Mr Ds credit worthiness.
Mr D has replied to my provisional view and says his account was in arrears for far longer 
than 180 days and closer to 20 months. He says NewDay either should have registered a 
default or has recorded inaccurate late payment markers.
NewDay says Mr Ds agreement meant that he made close to the required payment amount 
which had to be reported to the CRAs. It says as a result of him making the payments then 
his account didnt reach the 180-day arrears which would have led to a default being 
registered. It also confirms the account was settled.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the same overall view that I reached in my provisional 
decision and for the same reasons.
I think it possible that there is some confusion here about account arrears and appreciate 
why Mr D says his account was in arrears for 20 months. Im satisfied that his account was 
subject to an agreement which meant it had to be reported to the CRAs as late payments. 
And that agreement was in place for the 20 months or so. I have made clear that accurate 
information has to be provided to the CRAs. The arrears are a separate issue and I can see 
from NewDays records that as Mr D made payments under the plan close to the minimum 
required amount that the arrears didnt exceed 180 days in total. The effect of that was that 
NewDay didnt register a default on Mr Ds account.
So, I dont think Mr Ds account was in arrears for 180 days and was not in arrears for over 
20 months as he says. A plan was in place for well over 20 months which is a separate 
issue.
Overall, Im satisfied that NewDay hasnt made a mistake by correctly reporting to the CRAs 
that Mr D wasnt making the full payments and also didnt make a mistake by not registering 
a default as the account didnt justify such action.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or reject my decision before 22 March 2022.
