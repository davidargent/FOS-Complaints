The complaint
Mr G complains that National Westminster Bank plc didnt automatically replace his debit 
card when it had reached its expiry date. He also complains that National Westminster Bank 
plc took too long to reply to his complaint.
What happened
Mr G had a current account with NatWest. A debit card was issued with the account. Mr G 
lives abroad but he says he uses the account when he visits the UK. He says the account 
was operated in credit and he frequently logged into his online banking with NatWest to view 
the account.
Mr G says that NatWest refused to automatically replace the debit card when it reached its 
expiry date. He says NatWest told him this was because he used the card infrequently, but 
Mr G says this is not a valid reason. 
He complained to our service and we asked NatWest to respond to his complaint. NatWest 
said that Mr Gs card had expired at the end of March 2018. It said he hadnt used the card 
in the 13 month period prior to that date and in these circumstances its policy was not to 
automatically replace the debit card. But it said it would order a replacement card for him if 
he wanted it. 
NatWest issued a replacement card to Mr G on 23 March 2020.
Mr G wasnt satisfied with this response. And, he said NatWest had taken too long to 
respond to his complaint. So, he asked our service to investigate his complaint. 
Our investigator looked into his complaint. He said that NatWest had applied its own policy 
correctly. He thought the policy was probably in place for security reasons. He also said that 
our service couldnt investigate complaint handling in isolation. But he said that NatWest had 
received the complaint from us on 3 March 2020 and had responded on 12 March 2020. So, 
he didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr G didnt agree. He said that NatWests process was misguided and was designed to deny 
or interrupt basic banking services to customers.
Because Mr G didnt agree the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr G was issued with a debit card for his current account. This was one of the ways he could 
access his account. And, as he says, it meant he could access the account when using 
merchant terminals at locations all over the world. 
A debit card is a payment instrument which has an expiry date. NatWest says that the expiry 
date on the card it issued to Mr G was the end of March 2018. After that date the card was 
no longer valid.
Mr G says NatWest should have automatically issued a new card at the expiry date. And, he 
says it ought to have done this even though he hadnt used the card since August 2015. 
It is the case that if Mr G had either used the card in the 13 month period prior to the expiry 
date or if he had contacted NatWest to request a replacement card, NatWest says it would 
have issued a new card.
Having considered NatWests policy not to automatically reissue debit cards in certain 
circumstances, I can understand there wouldve been some inconvenience when Mr G had 
to contact it when his card was about to expire. But I dont think it was unreasonable or 
unfair for NatWest to require him to do that in circumstances where he hadnt used his debit 
card for several years. 
Ive also considered what Mr G has said about how this process denies or interrupts the 
provision of basic banking services. 
Mr G says he only uses the card when hes in the UK. He hasnt been in the UK for some 
time. And, if he does decide to come to the UK it appears that NatWest has a relatively 
straightforward process which enables Mr G to request a new card. It says he just needs to 
contact it to request a replacement card.
There is a delay between the date when the card is requested and the date it arrives. But 
part of the reason for that is because Mr G lives abroad and so the post service takes longer. 
Despite the delay, any interruption to the use of Mr Gs debit card would be temporary. And, 
any such interruption could be avoided if Mr G either uses the card in the year before it 
expires or if he contacts NatWest to ask for a replacement.
Ive also noted that NatWest didnt close Mr Gs account or remove any of the other services 
associated with the account. So, its decision not to automatically renew his debit card didnt 
prevent him from accessing his account in other ways such as online banking. And, although 
he didnt get an automatic replacement for his expired debit card, Im satisfied that the 
provision of basic banking services was not denied or interrupted in a way which was unfair 
or unreasonable. 
Mr G has also raised issues about how NatWest handled his complaint and the length of 
time that passed before it responded. As our investigator said, this service cannot look into 
Mr Gs concerns about NatWests complaint handling process because that is not a 
regulated financial activity. So, Ive made no findings about this part of his complaint.
Having considered everything here, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons given above I do not uphold this complaint about National Westminster 
Bank plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 November 2020.
