Complaint
Mr W has complained about a personal loan Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) provided to him. He says the loan was unaffordable and was therefore irresponsibly 
lent to him.
Background
118 118 Money provided Mr W with a loan for £1,000.00 in May 2023. This loan had an APR 
of 79.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total amount to be repaid of 
£1,787.04, including interest, fees and charges of £787.04, was due to be repaid in 24 
monthly instalments of just under £75. 
One of our investigators reviewed Mr Ws complaint and she thought that 118 118 Money 
ought to have realised that it shouldnt have provided Mr W with his loan. So she thought 
that Mr Ws complaint should be upheld. 
118 118 Money didnt respond to our investigators assessment. So the case was passed to 
an ombudsman for a final decision as per the next step of our dispute resolution process. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr Ws complaint. 
Having carefully considered everything Ive decided to uphold Mr Ws complaint. Ill explain 
why in a little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
is 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Mr W could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
118 118 Money says it agreed to Mr Ws application after he provided details of his monthly 
income. It says it cross-checked this against information on a credit search it carried out and 
also estimated Mr Ws living costs. In its view, all of this information showed Mr W could 
afford to make the repayments he was committing to. On the other hand, Mr W has said he 
shouldnt have been lent to.
Ive carefully thought about what Mr W and 118 118 Money have said. 
I can to some extent understand why 118 118 Money might argue that the relatively low 
monthly payments on this loan meant that a lighter touch affordability assessment was 
reasonable and proportionate here. 
However, while I do acknowledge that the monthly payments here were low, Im concerned 
that 118 118 Moneys own checks showed that Mr W was significantly indebted (with 
balances close to his existing credit limits). In my view, this called into question the 
disposable income amount, of over £1,200.00 a month, it concluded Mr W had left after the 
repayments to this £1,000.00 loan. Indeed 118 118 Moneys checks also shows that Mr W 
was regularly only ever making the minimum repayments to his commitments too.
Furthermore, Im also mindful that the notes provided and what Mr W has said both indicate 
that Mr Ws application was initially declined. Its unclear to me why Mr Ws application was 
then later accepted. But, in these circumstances, I think that 118 118 Money needed to find 
out more about Mr Ws actual income and expenditure before determining that the payments 
for this loan were affordable for him.
Im satisfied that if 118 118 Money had found out more about Mr W it would have seen that 
he was struggling to manage his existing commitments and why this was the case. So I think 
that proportionate checks would have shown 118 118 Money that Mr W was already 
struggling and this meant that he was unlikely to be able to repay this loan without borrowing 
further or suffering significant adverse consequences.
As this is the case, I do think that Mr Ws existing financial position meant that he was 
unlikely to be able to afford the repayments to this loan, without undue difficulty or borrowing 
further. And Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would more like than not 
have shown 118 118 Money that it shouldnt have provided this loan to Mr W. 
As 118 118 Money provided Mr W with this loan, notwithstanding this, Im satisfied it failed to 
act fairly and reasonably towards him. Mr W ended up paying and is still being expected to 
pay interest, fees and charges on a loan he shouldnt have been provided with. So Im 
satisfied that Mr W lost out because of what 118 118 Money did wrong and that it should put 
things right.
I understand that Mr W now has a further dispute regarding what 118 118 Money has 
reported to credit reference agencies. The investigator has already told Mr W what he needs 
to do in relation to this matter and my direction below relates solely to putting things right in 
relation to, what Ive found to be, 118 118 Moneys unfair decision to provide Mr W with his 
loan in May 2023.
Fair compensation  what 118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Mr W
Having thought about everything, 118 118 Money should put things right for Mr W by:
removing all interest, fees and charges applied to Mr Ws loan from the outset. The 
payments Mr W made, whether to 118 118 Money or any third-party debt purchaser, 
should be deducted from the new starting balance  the £1,000.00 originally lent. If Mr W paid more than £1,000.00 then 118 118 Money should treat any extra as 
overpayments. And any overpayments should be refunded to Mr W;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any overpayments, if any, from the date 
they were made by Mr W to the date of settlement
if no outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, 118 118 
Money should remove any adverse information it recorded about this loan from       
Mr Ws credit file.
If an outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, 118 118 
Money should agree a suitable plan with Mr W for this amount to be repaid. Mr W is 
encouraged to get in touch with and cooperate with 118 118 Money for this to be 
done.   
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Ws complaint. Madison CF UK Limited 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 January 2024.
