The complaint
Ms E complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) has used compensation from 
two mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) policies to reduce an outstanding debt it 
says Ms E still  owes following completion of an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA).
What happened
Ms E complained to RBS about PPI policies sold with loans ending 2465 and 7487.
In November 2019 RBS wrote to Ms E. In its letters RBS agreed to uphold Ms Es 
complaints. RBS offered compensation of £2,727.18 for loan ending 2465 and £1,054.17 for 
loan ending 7487.
But RBS said Ms E owed it £10,29178. So RBS used the compensation to reduce the debt 
owed by Ms E.
Ms E had been in an IVA which ended in 2016, and RBS was a party to the IVA.
Ms E says that as the IVA has been completed, her debts had been written off so RBS 
should pay the compensation directly to her.
Our adjudicator thought RBS had acted fairly. Ms E disagreed with the adjudicators 
findings so the complaints been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold Ms Es complaint and Ill explain why.
Ive looked at the letters RBS sent to Ms E in November 2019. I can see that on page one 
the letters mention the offers of £2,727.18 and £1,054.17.
On page two the letters mention that if Ms E had been party to an IVA any payment would 
be made to the relevant account and would be managed by the Groups Insolvency 
Team.
And on the form which Ms E needed to sign to accept the offers it was again stated that if     
Ms E had been in an IVA then any payment will be made to the relevant account. 
So I think RBS offers made it clear that it intended to use the compensation to offset any 
outstanding debt.
But Ms E believes there is no outstanding debt as all her debt with RBS was written off 
and does not exist following the completion of the IVA.
Ive thought carefully about this.
The two loans ending 7487 and 2465 were fully repaid before Ms E entered the IVA. 
But when Ms E entered the IVA RBS made a claim of £14,946.91. This was made up of 
outstanding debt from a third loan ending 3103 and a current account ending 8650.
During the IVA, RBS received dividends which reduced the outstanding debt £10,291.78.
When Ms E entered into the IVA, the debts she owed RBS werent cancelled. And they 
werent cancelled when she completed the IVA in 2016. Ms E couldnt be chased for the 
debts. However, the debt she had with RBS still existed.
RBS has shown us evidence that on completion of the IVA there remained a debt of
£10,291.78. I think RBS can use the compensation to reduce this balance. 
In effect Ms E owes RBS the outstanding debt, and RBS owes Ms E a smaller amount of 
compensation for the mis-sold PPI policies. I dont think it would be fair for me to direct 
RBS to pay Ms E compensation for the PPI mis-sales when Ms E owes RBS a larger debt.
My final decision
My final decision is that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc has acted fairly when using the 
compensation from mis-sold PPI to reduce Ms Es outstanding debt. So I make no further 
award against The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms E to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2021.
