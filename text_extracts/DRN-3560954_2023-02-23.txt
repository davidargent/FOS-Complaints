The complaint
Mr C complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr C and his wife entered into an acquisition agreement to buy some holiday club 
membership points in October 2009. The purchase price of the points was £12,384.02 and 
Mr C entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan to 
pay for the points. He agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £195.03 to Barclays 
Partner Finance. 
Mr C and his wife entered into another acquisition agreement to buy some more holiday club 
membership points in September 2010. The purchase price of those points was £5,809 and 
Mr C entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for another 
loan to pay for them. He agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £87.59 to Barclays 
Partner Finance. 
Mr C and his wife bought more holiday club points in April 2012 but the loan that he entered 
into to pay for those points was with another finance provider so isnt included in this 
complaint. Mr C repaid both of his loans from Barclays Partner Finance in June 2012. 
Mr Cs representative complained to Barclays Partner Finance in November 2016 that the 
holiday company was in breach of the contract, it didnt conduct a proper assessment of 
Mr Cs financial position and ability to repay the loans, it applied considerable pressure to 
him to procure his agreement to the loans and breached EU Law. Barclays Partner Finance 
said that the complaint was time barred under the Limitation Act 1980. Mr Cs representative 
then made a complaint to this service in April 2017 about those issues and it also said that 
Barclays Partner Finance had paid undisclosed commissions to the holiday company. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Cs complaint should be upheld. She thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of Mr Cs misrepresentation and 
breach of contract claims to turn them down. She said that she hadnt seen enough to 
suggest that the relationship between Mr C and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and 
she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was 
unfair. She didnt think that the level of commission normally paid in situations like this was 
high enough to put Barclays Partner Finance on notice that not disclosing commission to 
Mr C risked making the relationship unfair. She also said that she hadnt seen anything 
persuasive to suggest that the lending in question was unaffordable for Mr C.
Mr Cs representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, 
that:
Mr C and his wife are retired and two loans were made to Mr C within twelve months;
the holiday company was required to make sure that the loan went through a sound 
and proper credit assessment;
the product is illegal because it lasts for a period of more than 50 years, theres no 
fixed accommodation and no fixed time when Mr C and his wife can use it; and
the contract is null and void and Mr C and his wife are entitled to rescind it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Cs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Cs complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that hed 
made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to his 
claims;
Mr Cs claims were made under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974 but Im not determining the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a 
court would be able to do that - Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner 
Finances response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Cs claim under section 75 is that the membership points were misrepresented to 
him and his wife (and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them) and that theres been a breach of contract - if the criteria for 
a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would be expected to 
consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time limits set out in 
the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and 
to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr C could have made a misrepresentation claim to the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says 
induced him and his wife into buying the membership points in September 2010 as 
that was the latest time that any misrepresentations would have been made and any 
loss would have been incurred as that was when he also entered into second loan 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made under section 75 
until November 2016, which was more than six years after September 2010 and 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that his 
misrepresentation claim is now time-barred;
the time limit for a breach of contract claim in these circumstances is also six years 
from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which is when everything 
needed to make a claim had occurred);
Mr Cs representative says that an overseas court has declared that any contract 
signed in perpetuity should be considered null and void but I dont consider that that 
declaration applies to the membership points that were bought by Mr C and his wife 
and Im not persuaded that the acquisition agreements are null and void;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract by the holiday company or that theres been any breach of any applicable 
laws and regulations for which Barclays Partner Finance would be liable;
Mr Cs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr C and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that both of the loans were repaid in June 2012 and 
Mr Cs representative complained to Barclays Partner Finance in November 2016, 
less than six years after the loan agreements ended, so I dont consider that Mr Cs 
claim under section 140A is time-barred;
Mr Cs representative says that Mr C and his wife are retired and that Barclays 
Partner Finance didnt conduct a proper assessment of Mr Cs financial position and 
ability to repay the loans;
Barclays Partner Finance hasnt provided evidence to show what, if any assessments 
of the affordability of the loans were conducted before the loans were made to Mr C 
but, even if no assessments were made, I would still need to be persuaded that the 
loans werent affordable for Mr C at the time that they were made to him to be able to 
uphold his complaint;
Mr C has provided evidence of his net monthly income and average monthly 
outgoings for the tax years 2009/10 and 2010/11 and Ive considered that 
information;
the loans were repaid in June 2012, less than two years after the September 2010 
loan was made to Mr C, and Ive seen no other evidence to show that the loans 
werent affordable for him when they were made to him or that hes experienced any 
financial difficulties since then;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr C asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its affordability assessments before November 2016  as the loans 
were made to him in October 2009 and September 2010 I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him to have raised any concerns about the affordability of the 
loans before then and I consider it to be more likely than not that any complaint about 
the affordability of the loans would now also be time-barred;Mr Cs representative says that the holiday company applied considerable pressure 
to Mr C to procure his agreement to the loans but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that Mr C and his wife were unduly pressurised into 
entering into the acquisition agreements or that Mr C was unduly pressurised into 
entering into the loan agreements or that it used unacceptable sales practices 
against them;
the acquisition agreements and loan agreements all set out the right of withdrawal 
so, if Mr C and his wife felt that the holiday company had applied excessive pressure 
to them and they didnt want to be bound by the agreements, I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect them to have exercised their rights to withdraw from them  
but Ive seen no evidence to show that either Mr C or his wife contacted the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance to try to withdraw from any of those 
agreements;
Mr C and his wife had entered into an acquisition agreement and Mr C had entered 
into a loan agreement in October 2009  if the holiday company had applied 
excessive pressure to them I dont consider it to be likely that they would then have 
entered into another acquisition agreement and another loan agreement in 
September 2010  less than a year later  and then to have bought more holiday 
club membership points in April 2012;
Mr C didnt complain to Barclays Partner Finance about the pressure that had been 
applied to him and his wife until November 2016  more than six years after theyd 
entered into the agreements - and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
him to have complained to Barclays Partner Finance about any such issues before 
then;
Mr Cs representative says that Barclays Partner Finance paid undisclosed 
commissions to the holiday company for arranging the loans  but Ive not been 
provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by Barclays 
Partner Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payments  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was normally 
paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays Partner 
Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr C risked 
the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Barclays Partner Finance issued its response to Mr Cs claims in December 2016 
and I consider that its response was fair and reasonable in the circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr C for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership points but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr C any of 
the money that he paid under the loan agreements, to pay him any compensation or 
to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 March 2023.
