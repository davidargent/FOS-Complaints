K820x#14complaint
N Ltd complains that the Royal Bank  of Scotland Plc (RBS) lent money irresponsibly to the 
company.
background
In 2011, RBS provided a loan to N Ltd. It was not additional company  lending, but an 
alternative to the overdraft  N Ltd already had with RBS. In contrast to the overdraft, the loan 
was secured by virtue  of personal guarantees already provided by the then company 
directors, Mr V and Mr C1, who in turn, had an all monies charge on his family home, 
named K.
This complaint originally  arose in relation  to another complaint, which was about the manner 
in which  RBS sought recovery of the debt. When the complaint came  to me, I separated the 
two complaints.
This complaint, brought by the company, was about  looking  at what happened  at the 
beginning; that is, were  RBS irresponsible to have given the loan in the first place. Looking 
at the two complaints (though related) in their component parts, I decided that RBS had not 
been irresponsible and so I would not require them to do anything, in so far as this complaint 
was concerned.
Since the complaints had not been  separate beforehand, I wrote  a provisional decision to 
give the parties opportunity to provide me with any more evidence  or information.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Following my provisional decision, the parties  accepted what I said and, consistent with that, 
did not provide  any additional information for me to consider.
My findings  and decision remain as set out in my provisional decision,  which  I attach to this, 
my final decision; I refer the reader to it.
In short,  I do not think that RBS were irresponsible to provide the loan to N Ltd.
my final decision
To resolve  this complaint,  I do not require the Royal Bank of Scotland  plc to do anything  
further.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask N Ltd to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 March 2019.

Text of my Provisional Decision, dated 25 October 2018
(amended slightly to anonymise the parties )
_______________________________________________________
Ive considered the relevant information about  N Ltds complaint. Based on what Ive seen so 
far, Im not intending to uphold  the complaint. 
Ill look at any more  comments  and evidence that I receive by 25 November 2018. But 
unless the information changes my mind, my final decision is likely to be along the following 
lines. Because final decisions are published  on our website, and so the company cant be 
identified, Ill call it N Ltd. Ill also refer to the other people involved in this complaint by their 
initials.
Although the complaint is brought by a representative, to avoid confusion,  I will write as 
though the information  has come directly from Mr C2.
complaint
N Ltd complains that the Royal Bank  of Scotland Plc lent money irresponsibly  to the 
company.
background
In 2010, N Ltd applied  for a loan from RBS. The loan was to re-finance borrowing. N Ltd had 
an overdraft of about £35,000. The loan matched  that sum.
In 2011, RBS granted the loan which was secured by personal  guarantees given by the then 
Directors  Mr C1 and Mr V - of N Ltd, which they had provided in 1999. Mr C1s guarantee 
was further supported by a legal charge in favour of the bank  over Mr C1s family home  he 
owned with Mrs C. That charge was executed in 1991.
The loan was repaid until May 2013. As it happened,  by then both Mr C1 and Mrs C had 
sadly died (Mr C1 died in December 2012  and Mrs C died in late April 2013).
Thereafter, RBS informed  the personal  representatives of Mr C1 that, unfortunately, they 
were going  to have  to seek  recovery  of the loan pursuant the personal  guarantee of Mr C1. 
Eventually, that meant pursuing Mrs Cs estate pursuant to the legal charge on the family  
home.
Mrs Cs estate has brought a separate complaint about the pursuit of the loan.
This decision, therefore, is focussed purely  on whether RBS acted responsibly when giving 
the loan to N Ltd in 2011.
Ref: DRN30075913In bringing this complaint, the present Director of N Ltd, Mr C2, says the company at the time 
could not afford the loan and, therefore, the lending  was irresponsible.  He says the company 
was effectively insolvent. And that RBS didnt  insist upon life insurance, it was inconsistent 
with good financial  planning.
RBS thought it had done  the right thing by the company at the time;  they didnt think they 
had been irresponsible.
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also born in mind the relevant 
Lending Code  (2009). Having done so I dont think that RBS were irresponsible. Ill explain 
why.
I can see from N Ltds financial statements, that it was balance sheet insolvent at the time 
of the lending; that is, its asset position was less than the amount it owed to its creditors. 
I note, though, that the company turnover in 2009  was significantly more than it was in 2010 
and it seems that the Directors would  be able to trade their way out of the imbalance. 
Reference is made to them obtaining  some work in Europe in 2010.
I also dont detect that N Ltd was reckless as to its creditors. Far from it. Indeed  it was RBS 
which was its biggest creditor.
It seems  that N Ltd wanted to organise  itself - to call on its debtors and reduce its liabilities  
which, in the next couple  of years, it did.
Against, this was the acknowledgement of  Mr C1 that he did want to slow down and draw 
on his pension. The pension  fund,  which RBS had also variously supported, was in a strong 
position and, consisting of land and property, was worth about £1m.
RBS had worked with Mr C1 over many years and seen how he had conducted himself in 
business and how he had made  financial decisions. That conduct included making loan 
repayments in the past.
RBS were entitled to use that information in their decision.
Be that as it may, however, the key point here is that RBS were not adding to N Ltds  
liabilities  the company already owed the bank money in the form of an overdraft. The loan,  
by contrast, was much more manageable, had a lower interest rate and contained a 
provision that it could be repaid at any time.
From a commercial point of view,  the loan suited  RBS, too, as the personal guarantees and 
the charge Mr C1 had executed turned them from unsecured to secured creditors.
Using the same Lending  Code, I think that is an example of bank and business  working  
together. And I think  it would have been  treating  the company unfairly  if RBS had called  in 
the overdraft in circumstances where  a viable alternative was available.
Ref: DRN30075914Ive seen no evidence  of RBS asking either Director about life insurance   I invite  RBS to 
make any comment  about this in particular. I appreciate Mr C2s concerns but the important 
point is that the bank  needed to be clear  about  repayment. RBS did that. 
Insurance is only one option and may not be the right option. Here, given the age and health  
of Mr C1 it may have been  prohibitively expensive  which goes to the heart of this complaint 
that finance was unaffordable. Since  banks need  to be careful about offering financial  
planning and products,  I dont think it was incumbent  upon RBS to insist on life insurance.
my provisional decision
For the reasons  Ive set out above,  I dont think that The Royal Bank  of Scotland  Plc was 
irresponsible to provide N Ltd the loan in 2011 and so I dont propose upholding this 
complaint.
As I say, Ill consider any other information and comments from either party. Id like to 
receive any such submission by 25 November 2018.
