The complaint
Mrs C complains (through a solicitor) that Aviva Insurance Limited mishandled her claim on 
her motor insurance policy.
What happened
Mrs C had her car insured on a policy under which Aviva was responsible for dealing with 
claims. The policy covered theft and total loss up to the market value of the vehicle before 
the loss (less an excess of £300.00). 
On 6 June 2020, someone took Mrs Cs vehicle for use in criminal activity. It was later found 
burnt out.
On 6 July 2020, Aviva emailed Mrs C with a valuation of £18,090.00. Mrs Cs solicitor 
emailed Aviva on 10 July 2020 asking it to increase the valuation and to pay legal expenses. 
Mrs C complained to Aviva that it had over-stated the mileage of the vehicle and under-
stated its value before the loss. She also complained about delay. 
Aviva wrote a final response dated 27 July 2020. It said it had increased the valuation to 
£19,100.00. On 21 August 2020 Aviva sent a further final response. Aviva offered to pay the 
following:
compensation £175.00
interest £271.96
belongings £150.00
total £596.96
Unhappy with that, Mrs C brought her complaint to us in late August 2020.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that 
Aviva acted unfairly or unreasonably when responding to Mrs Cs complaint about the 
valuation and legal fee.
Mrs C disagreed with the investigators opinion. She asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. Through her solicitor, she says, in summary, that:
Aviva was unwilling to increase the valuation. So Mrs C had no other viable option 
than to engage the solicitor to assist her. She did that after warning Aviva that if she 
were forced to so, the costs would be visited upon them.
It was not until after she engaged the solicitor that Aviva increased the valuation by 
£1.001. She believes that this would not have occurred otherwise; and therefore 
proves that engaging the solicitor was perfectly justified in the circumstances.
She refutes the suggestion that she engaged the solicitor to just assist with her 
complaint to us. She did not intend at the outset to make a complaint to us against 
Aviva. It was not until after Aviva refused to increase its offer of £19,100 and/or 
insisted that £19,100 is its final offer, that Mrs C requested further assistance from 
the solicitor. This also was because she was still feeling very emotional. traumatized 
and distressed due to the sudden death of her husband in a ghastly motor accident 
just less than a year before the vehicle loss incident occurred.
Aviva tried to unreasonably inflate the mileage of her vehicle from 45,500 to 70,000 
to unfairly reduce its market value. In addition, Aviva tried to deny the fact that her 
vehicle's MOT was still valid and not expired at the time when the loss occurred. All 
of these show how cunning and desperate Aviva is or was; and that Aviva actually 
never dealt with Mrs C in good faith. Besides, it took a very long time before Aviva 
responded to Mrs C positively on her claim, and which left her frustrated and also 
subjected her to further unwarranted inconveniences, stress and distress.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In April 2019 the vehicle Mrs C later bought passed an MOT test. 
Im sorry to hear that Mrs C lost her husband in a road accident in June 2019.
I accept Mrs Cs statement that she bought the car in December 2019 and the price was 
£26,000.00. 
In normal times, the car wouldve needed an MOT in about April 2020. But I think that was 
extended due to Covid-19, so it still had a valid MOT at the time of the theft.
After the theft, Mrs C told Aviva she could not recall the mileage but estimated it to be 
around 60,000. The vehicle odometer was unreadable after the fire damage. Mrs C later told 
Aviva in a phone call that the mileage had been 45,000 when she bought the car. On 28 
June 2020, Mrs C sent an email to Aviva saying that the mileage had been 45,500 at the 
time of the theft.
I will consider whether Aviva has applied the terms of the policy and valued the vehicle
fairly. 
I dont accept that Aviva exaggerated the mileage. In assessing the valuation Aviva accepted 
Mrs Cs mileage figure of 45,500.
Ive noted the make, model, specification, age and mileage of Mrs Cs car before the theft. 
Ive assumed it to be in good condition.
Im satisfied that Aviva used the valuation guides as I would expect it to. For a car like Mrs 
Cs in June 2020, the guides contain the following valuations: 
CAP £17,900.00
Cazana £19,149.00
Glasss £19,900.00
So I dont consider that Avivas valuation of £19,100.00 was unfair.
Mrs C lost her car at an already difficult time for her. And there were instances when she 
considered Aviva wasnt communicating properly with her. But Aviva was faced with quite a 
high value claim and I consider that it was entitled to investigate it. I dont share the view of Mrs C and her solicitor that Aviva dealt with her claim unfairly. In 
any event, Im satisfied that Avivas final response dated 21 August 2020 was fair and 
reasonable.
I havent seen enough reason why Mrs C needed legal help to deal with Aviva or with us. 
And I havent upheld her complaint. So I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Aviva to 
pay her legal fees.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Aviva Insurance Limited to do any more in response to this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 March 2021.
