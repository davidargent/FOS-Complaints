The complaint
Mr S complains that TransUnion International UK Limited included information on his credit 
file about a third-party. Mr S wants TransUnion to compensate him.
What happened
In 2021, Mr S became aware that his credit file contained information about a third-party 
after his mortgage applications were declined. 
Mr S complained to TransUnion. It apologised and removed the third-party data. TransUnion 
offered to compensate Mr S if he gave it evidence of any direct financial loss.
The investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ss complaint be upheld. She agreed that 
TransUnion made a mistake but without further evidence from Mr S, she couldnt ask 
TransUnion to pay him compensation.
Mr S is unhappy with the investigators recommendation. He says TransUnions mistake 
meant he had to apply for a mortgage with a higher rate of interest. Mr S says hes given us 
evidence of a payment he made to the mortgage advisor which includes a rejected 
application. Mr S says TransUnion hasnt given him proof that the third-partys details have 
been removed.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im very sorry to hear about the difficulties that Mr S has faced, and I can appreciate his 
frustration with the situation. I dont think theres any dispute that TransUnion made a 
mistake as part of its data matching process. But this service doesnt regulate or supervise 
the businesses that we cover. And its not my role to punish TransUnion for the error. 
Instead I focus on the impact the mistake had on Mr S and whether TransUnion should do 
more to put things right.
Mr S told this service that many credit applications, including a mortgage application, were 
declined because of the third-party data on his credit file. But despite the investigator asking 
Mr S for evidence of this, he hasnt been able to give this to us. Although I understand Mr Ss 
reluctance to pay for a copy of his credit report, the investigator told him that its possible to 
obtain a free one from the credit reference agencies  including TransUnion. As Mr S hasnt 
given us a copy of his report, I cant see any of his credit history to conclude that 
TransUnions data-matching error caused Mr S a financial loss.
The investigator did ask the lender that Mr S told us had declined his mortgage application 
for further information. But the lender told this service it didnt have a record of Mr Ss 
application. It said it would look again if Mr S was able to provide the mortgage application 
number, but Mr S hasnt given this to us. Again, this makes it hard for me find that 
TransUnions mistake led directly to Mr S being refused a mortgage.
Mr S says that he was able to secure a mortgage but at a slightly higher rate. I dont intend 
any disrespect to Mr S, but many factors affect a lenders decision. He hasnt given us copy 
of his credit report so I dont know whether there might be other information on the report 
which wouldve affected his mortgage applications. 
I should also say that different lenders can use different credit reference agencies to carry 
out checks. So, without knowing which credit reference agency a particular lender used to 
assess Mr Ss credit applications, it would be difficult to say that TransUnions data-matching 
mistake was always the reason for any refusal to provide credit.
Although Mr S has given us a copy of the mortgage broker fee that he paid, I cant find that 
he only had to engage the services of a broker because of the third-party data on his credit 
file. It seems logical that Mr S would have paid this fee regardless of the data-matching 
mistake. I havent for example seen evidence that the fee was higher than it shouldve been 
had the mistake not been made. And Ive not seen evidence of any declined mortgage 
applications. This means I cant reasonably require TransUnion to compensate Mr S for 
some or all the fee.
I acknowledge Mr Ss concern about what he calls a massive breach of data but as I 
explained above, this service doesnt regulate TransUnion. The breach really relates to the 
third party. Despite Mr Ss understandable concerns, theres been no suggestion that his 
data appears on the third-partys credit file. I cant award compensation for something that 
hasnt happened. If Mr S were to find evidence of a breach by TransUnion that impacted him 
in the future, he can raise a fresh complaint.
Although I agree that the mistake shouldnt have happened, Im satisfied that TransUnion 
dealt with it promptly. Mr S told TransUnion about the problem on or around 20 April 2021. 
And TransUnion sent him a final response on 29 April 2021. It says that the third-party data 
has been removed and Ive no reason to doubt this. If Mr S can show this hasnt happened, 
he can always complain again. 
I understand that Mr S wanted TransUnion to call him to discuss his complaint further, but 
complaints handling isnt a regulated activity and therefore something this service doesnt 
usually have the power to consider. In any case, as TransUnion sent a final response with 
referral rights to this service, I cant criticise if for not calling Mr S to discuss his complaint 
further. It also gave Mr S the option to provide evidence of his financial loss which, as I 
understand, he didnt do. I consider that TransUnion responded fairly and reasonably to     
Mr Ss concerns.
I appreciate Mr S wants to know how long the problem with his credit file had been going on 
for. But again, without evidence that the appearance of third-party data on his credit file led 
directly to Mr S being declined credit, I dont consider it would make a difference to the 
outcome of his complaint.
For all the reasons Ive outlined above, I dont have enough evidence to conclude that Mr S 
lost out financially because of the data matching problem. Particularly as Mr S was still able 
to secure a mortgage. Im satisfied that once Mr S made TransUnion aware of the mistake, it 
responded quickly. This means I dont consider that Mr S was put to a great deal of trouble 
to get his credit file corrected. So, I dont require TransUnion to do more than it already has 
done to put things right. 
My final decisionMy decision is that I dont uphold this complaint in the sense that I find TransUnion has 
already done enough to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 February 2022.
