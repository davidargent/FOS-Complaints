The complaint
Mr H complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money (118) misled him 
over a refinanced loan.
What happened
In February 2020, Mr H borrowed £3,500 on a loan from 118. It was payable over 24 
months. The interest rate was an APR of 99.9%. The total payable, including interest, was
£6,616.56. Payments were £275.69 each month.
In April 2020, Mr H contacted 118 as he and his wife were struggling because of the 
effects of the pandemic. 118 agreed to a payment holiday of three months from April 2020 
to June 2020. The payments for July 2020, and August 2020 were then made. At the end 
of August 2020, Mr H called 118 and said he couldnt pay the next instalment due on 1 
September 2020. 118 agreed to a 30-day hold  whereby the September 2020 payment 
wasnt made. So  there was then one-month arrears on the loan. The October 2020 
payment was made.
At the start of November 2020, Mr H called 118 again and said that the familys income was 
still being affected by Covid-19 and asked for a further three-month payment holiday. 118 
agreed to this. To do that, 118 repaid the old loan and provided a new loan over 22 months 
 with the first three months payments not to be made (because of the payment holiday). So 
 the loan was payable in 19 instalments. The new loan was for £3,068.67 with an APR of 
99.9%. The total payable including interest was £6,147.83.
Mr H complained. He said that the new loan didnt take account of the payments hed 
already made. And because the new loan was for a similar amount as the old loan, 118 
had effectively swallowed the payments he had made in 2020 before the old loan was 
refinanced. He said this was the case as both loans, including interest were for the same 
amount  about £6,000.
118 said that Mr H had been sent the loan documentation for the new loan and this spelt 
out its terms. He had been told that if he took a payment holiday, extra interest would be 
charged which would cost him more. He was given guidance as to what this might be. 118 
said Mr H had signed the loan documentation and he was now outside the 14-day cooling 
off period. 118 felt theyd been supportive  theyd provided a payment holiday and theyd 
also given him other options if he was struggling to make repayments.
Mr H brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said 118 hadnt acted fairly. When Mr H 
called 118, he had said he was in financial difficulty and 118 should therefore not have 
given him a payment holiday, but instead shouldve asked more questions about Mr Hs 
income and expenditure and put in place a longer term forbearance plan, including an 
interest  free arrangement or reduced monthly payments  rather than giving him another 
loan at a high interest rate. He said the interest on Mr Hs loan should be refunded and 
compensation of £250 paid, and a suitable repayment plan agreed.
118 didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at Mr Hs complaint.
I reached a provisional decision where I said:
The crux of Mr Hs complaint is that he says 118 didnt treat him fairly when he asked for 
a second payment holiday in November 2020. He says that he ended up paying £1,000 
more than he should have  as when the refinancing loan was put in place, it didnt take 
account of the payments he had made on the first loan.
In April 2020, The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced guidance to lenders in 
response to the effects on customers of the COVID-19 pandemic. All lenders, including 118, 
had to put in place payment holidays on many credit agreements, including personal loans
 to help customers who were affected. Customers could ask for a total of two payment 
holidays each of three months  whereby payments could be suspended. Missed payments 
would not be reported to credit reference agencies, although interest would still be debited 
to the accounts. This support was provided by firms up to the end of October 2020.
The intention was to provide short term support  usually in cases where customers would 
be returning to work within a short period of time. And so  where a customers situation 
was that they were in longer term difficulty, then payment holidays under this scheme 
werent normally agreed.
In September 2020, the FCA announced that the support scheme would change from the 
end of October 2020. From then, firms could continue to support customers in difficulty  
but it was down to their discretion and customers circumstances. And so  Mr Hs second 
payment holiday request was made in this period  so 118 could tailor a support package 
for him.
Ive looked what happened in the light of this. Ive listened to the calls between Mr H and
118. On the first call  on 29 August 2020, Mr H explained that he needed to miss the next 
loan payment due on 1 September 2020. This was because he and his wife had a 
temporary drop in income due to Covid-19. Mr H told 118 that this was temporary and was 
just for this month and income would then return to normal. The call handler said 118 
could consider a further payment holiday extension  but this would mean Mr H would pay 
more interest in the long run. Instead, 118 agreed a 30-day hold  whereby the 
September 2020 payment wasnt made and Mr H could then consider his situation.
The payment for 1 October 2020 was then made. And then Mr H called 118 again on 2
November 2020. He said that income was still being affected by Covid-19 and his wife had 
also been ill. Importantly, he said that his wife was due to get some furlough payments 
soon and he was also due to resume normal hours working shortly. 118 offered a further 
three- month payment holiday. 118 stated that the extension would mean that Mr H would 
pay more interest over the term of the new loan; and payments may increase by up to 25% 
as a result. By example, they said that his payments could go up to £344.61 a month if they 
went up by 25%. That was if the new loan was payable over 19 months (after the payment 
holiday of three months). Mr H agreed to the new loan and went through a brief affordability 
check  when he was asked are you at risk of redundancy?. Mr H replied: no. Is the 
new loan unaffordable?. Mr H: no. Are the increased payments affordable?. Mr H:yes. 
118 then told Mr H to go online and look at the loan documentation and sign it if he was 
happy to do so.
Mr H called again on 4 November 2020. He set out his concerns  he said the payments 
he had already made on the original loan hadnt been taken into account and so all those 
payments had been lost. 118s call handler said the loan terms were set out for Mr H to 
see - and he had signed the loan agreement. Having listened to the call, I think it wouldve 
been helpful if 118s call handler had listened to Mr Hs points  and answered his concerns on the call. If that had happened, I think its likely that Mr H wouldnt have 
continued to think he had been treated unreasonably and wouldnt have complained.
And so  Ive thought about whether 118 shouldve considered Mr H to be in long term 
financial difficulty - in which case 118 shouldve thought about options other than a 
payment holiday. For me, its clear that Mr H said, and demonstrated, that his financial 
pressures were short term  he said he and his wife would return to normal work and 
earnings soon. And so  he wasnt saying he was in long term difficulty, and therefore a 
payment holiday was the right option for 118 to offer. So  I disagree with our investigator 
here.
Looking at the refinanced loan. I can see that the original loan was for £3,500 and after the 
addition of interest, £6,616.56 was payable over 24 months - payments were £275.69.
Between the start of the loan in February 2020 and when it was repaid in November 2020 - 
I can see there were four payments made (as there was the three month payment holiday 
between April 2020 and June 2020, and the September 2020 payment wasnt made). So, 
in all, £1,102.76 was paid by Mr H in loan payments.
The new loan was for £3,068.67, plus interest of £3079.16  a total of £6,147.83. And so, I 
can see that this is Mr Hs argument  he is saying that the new loan should be of a lower 
amount than it was because of the payments he had made during the previous months.
Our service doesnt provide an audit /checking service but from my experience, the figures 
quoted look reasonable to me. I say that because of the way in which this type of loan 
works. It was a fixed sum loan. And each payment (of £275.69) comprised of some capital 
repayment and some interest. And  its a fact that in the early months of such a loan, each 
payment comprises of mostly interest and only a small amount of capital repayment. So, in 
the early stages of repayment, mostly interest is paid. So  Mr H wouldnt see the capital 
amount of his loan reduce very much. And I can see thats whats happened here. The 
difference in the amount of the two loans was £431.33  that is, the original loan of £3,500 
less the new loan of £3,068.67. So  Mr H had paid off capital of £431.33. Mr H had made 
total payments between February 2020 and October 2020 of £1,102.76 (four payments of
£275.69)  but the capital amount didnt go down by that amount because the four 
payments comprised more interest than capital.
Turning to the monthly repayments. They went up from £275.69 to £323.57. But thats 
largely because Mr Hs original loan was payable over 24 months, and the new loan was
payable over 19 months  so each payment was bound to be higher.
I agree that 118 did set out the figures, as they were required to do so under the consumer 
credit regulations, and Mr H had the opportunity to review them before he signed. But I 
hope that my explanation goes some way to helping Mr H understand what happened.
So  what Im saying is that 118 didnt make any mistakes here. And in that respect, I 
disagree with our investigator. I noted that 118s final response said that all documentation 
was sent to Mr H  and he signed it. While I accept that was correct, I think it wouldve 
been helpful, and wouldve answered Mr Hs complaint  if 118s response had gone 
further and set out more helpfully  and in simple terms - the answer to Mr Hs complaint. I 
also listened to the third call between 118 and Mr H on 4 November 2020  this was when 
he set out his complaint that he felt his payments had been taken by 118 and lost. 118 
had the opportunity to deal with that then, on the call  but simply pointed to the fact that 
he had signed the documents. I can appreciate that since that time, Mr H has been worried 
that he was misled by 118  and has been paying too much for his loan - when that wasnt 
the case.And for that  I think its reasonable that 118 pay an amount of compensation  of £100.
Responses to the provisional decision:
118 accepted the findings. Mr H didnt respond.
I now need to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As 118 accepted the provisional decision, and Mr H didnt respond, I wont be departing from 
it. And my final decision is therefore the same as set out in the provisional decision.
My final decision
I  uphold this complaint. Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money must:
 Pay compensation of £100 to Mr H for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 August 2022.
