K820x#14complaint
Mr E complains that an HGV driving course,  that he paid for using a fixed  sum loan 
agreement with Omni Capital Retail Finance Limited, was mis-sold to him.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr E used  a fixed sum loan agreement with Omni Capital, that he electronically 
signed in January  2018, to pay for an HGV driving course   the cost of the course  
was £2,399, he paid a deposit of £239  and agreed to make a payment of £64.11 and 
then 47 monthly payments of £63.74 for the course  he also signed a supply of 
service agreement with the course  provider;
he complained  to Omni Capital in September 2018 that the course had been mis-sold 
to him because hed told the course provider  that he had six penalty points on his 
driving licence  and he says that he was told that that wouldnt be a problem  but 
when he applied for a provisional  HGV  licence  his application was refused;
it didnt uphold his complaint and said that the DVLA had advised that six penalty 
points wouldnt necessarily preclude somebody  from obtaining a provisional  licence 
and that the DVLA  had written  to Mr E in June 2018 to say:
You may re-apply for LGV/PCV driving  entitlement at any time, and any 
application will be considered on its merits. However I would inform you that 
the Traffic Commissioner has indicated that providing no further motoring 
offences or relevant convictions are recorded  against you, he/she  will 
consider favourably  an application on or after [specified date in July 2018]; 
Mr E complained to this service and said that hed stopped  making the loan 
repayments to Omni Capital so his account  was in arrears  and he wanted it to either 
refund all of his loan repayments or to take no further payments from him for the 
course;
our investigator wasnt satisfied that the penalty  points  prevented  Mr E from 
completing the course and she said that there was no evidence to show that hed 
made another application for a provisional licence or was prevented from doing so  
so she wasnt recommending that Omni  Capital should take any further action 
regarding his complaint;
Mr E says that the penalty points are still on his licence and he wasnt allowed to get 
a provisional HGV licence  for six months  and until his penalty  points had expired;
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that the penalty  points on 
Mr Es driving licence prevent him from getting an HGV licence  the Office of the 
Traffic Commissioner wrote to him in June 2018 about its refusal of his application for 
Ref: DRN23375542a provisional licence but said that it was likely that an application made after a date 
specified in the following month would be considered favourably;
Mr E hadnt responded to the Office of the Traffic Commissioners  notice of refusal of 
his application  by providing a written explanation of his penalty  points or to request a 
hearing  as hed been told he was entitled to do  and Ive seen no evidence to 
show that he applied  for a provisional licence after the date specified in the letter;
Mr E didnt  complain to Omni Capital until after that date and it seems from his 
discussions with Omni  Capital that he no longer wanted to proceed with the course;
I consider it to be clear from the evidence that there would have been a delay of a 
few months in his application for a provisional  licence being  accepted  but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the penalty points would have 
prevented him from obtaining a provisional HGV  licence;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that the course, or the loan 
agreement, was mis-sold to Mr E; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Omni Capital to end the loan agreement, to waive  or reduce the arrears  that Mr E 
owes it, to refund any of his loan repayments,  to pay him any compensation or to 
take any other action  in response  to his complaint.
I suggest that Mr E contacts Omni  Capital  about the arrears on his account and tries to 
agree an affordable repayment arrangement for the amount that he owes  it. Its required to 
respond to any financial  difficulties that hes experiencing positively and sympathetically.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold Mr Es complaint .
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 February  2021.
