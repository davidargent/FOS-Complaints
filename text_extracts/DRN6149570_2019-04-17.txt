K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mr W was given twelve loans by QuickQuid  between April 2014 and April 2017. Mr W 
topped-up some of his loans by taking  additional borrowing shortly after his original loan. 
All of Mr Ws loans  have been successfully repaid  and a summary of his borrowing from 
QuickQuid is as follows;

Mr Ws complaint  has been assessed  by one of our adjudicators. She thought  that 
QuickQuid shouldnt have  given the last two loans to Mr W. So she asked QuickQuid to pay 
some compensation to Mr W.
QuickQuid didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mr W accepts  my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN61495702QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr W could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account  
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
There were two significant breaks in Mr Ws borrowing from QuickQuid. There  was a break 
of around eight months between loans 2 and 3. And there  was a gap of a similar length 
between loans 6 and 7. I think it would have  been  reasonable  for QuickQuid to have seen 
those gaps as an indication that Mr Ws finances  had moved on from whatever situation  had 
required his previous loans. And so I will consider  Mr Ws borrowing in those three distinct  
chains.
Ref: DRN61495703The first chain comprised  loans 1 and 2. Both these  loans were small in comparison to the 
income Mr W declared to the lender. I havent  seen anything to make  me think  QuickQuid 
should have been aware of any adverse information  on Mr Ws credit file. So given Mr Ws 
loan amounts, what was apparent about  his circumstances at the time, and his history with 
the lender, I dont  think it wouldve been  proportionate for QuickQuid to ask him for the 
amount of information  that would be needed  to show the lending  was unsustainable.  
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr W provided or the information QuickQuid 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying.  
And I think the same applies  to the second  chain of lending. That comprised loans 3 to 6. 
Once more each of those  loans was relatively modest compared to the income Mr W 
declared, and there was nothing to indicate to QuickQuid that his finances were under 
significant pressure.  So I dont think QuickQuid was wrong to give these loans to Mr W 
either.
The final chain comprised six loans and lasted for just over a year.  At the start of this chain 
of borrowing  the amounts  Mr W was asking  to borrow were again relatively modest. And so it 
was reasonable,  based on the information it was aware of, for QuickQuid to agree to lend to 
Mr W. But Mr W wasnt able to repay loan 10 on time  he needed to extend it by around a 
month. And his borrowing  escalated rapidly when he took loan 11 and topped it up three  
times in the next four days.  By that time he was borrowing  almost  half his declared income 
from QuickQuid.
So I think by that stage QuickQuid should have realised that it was likely Mr Ws finances  
were under stain,  and that he was most  likely borrowing to support his day to day living costs 
and debt repayments rather than for a one-off emergency. I dont think  it was reasonable for 
QuickQuid to conclude  here that Mr W would  be able to repay his loan in a sustainable 
manner. 
And I think the same thing  applies to the final loan.  Mr W took that loan within just a few days 
of repaying his previous borrowing  and that repayment was several  months later than his 
original agreement. And although the initial  loan was relatively  small, Mr W took a substantial 
top-up just a few days later.  I dont think QuickQuid should have given this loan to Mr W 
either. QuickQuid needs to pay him some  compensation.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Mr W after,  and including, the loan that 
he took on 17 September 2017 (loan  11). So for both of those loans QuickQuid should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Ws credit file in relation to the loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN61495704my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mr Ws complaint and direct CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
to put things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 May 2019.
