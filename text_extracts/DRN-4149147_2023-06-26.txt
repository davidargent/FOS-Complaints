The complaint
Mrs S has complained about the way MetLife Europe d.a.c (MetLife) has settled her claims.
What happened
Mrs S has a health insurance policy underwritten by MetLife. This provides a hospitalisation 
benefit for each 24-hour period. This is capped at 90 days per sickness. 
Mrs S has said MetLife hasnt paid her claims properly where she has been admitted for 
more than one condition. So she feels it has unfairly capped her benefit when it shouldnt 
have.
Mrs S complained to MetLife and it looked into her complaint. But it didnt think it had made 
an error or acted unfairly. 
Unhappy, Mrs S referred her complaint to this Service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt uphold the complaint as he didnt think 
MetLife had done anything wrong. 
Mrs S disagreed and in summary, has made the following comments:
MetLife should allocate 50% of the benefit to each condition when there are two 
conditions that cause the hospital admission.
She would like me to consider the stays where there was more than one cause for 
her admission.
And so the case has been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont think this complaint should be upheld. Ill explain why. 
The relevant rules and industry guidelines say an insurer should handle claims promptly and 
fairly. And shouldnt unreasonably reject a claim. 
The terms pay a benefit if Mrs S is admitted into hospital as an inpatient for each 24 hours 
caused by sickness with a maximum of 90 days per insured event. If the admission relates to 
the same accident or illness, then this is considered a continuation of the previous admission 
when calculating the 90 days. 
Mrs S admissions have related to asthma and pneumonia. Where the admission has related 
to more than one illness, Mrs S says MetLife hasnt fairly calculated her maximum benefit. 
In February 2022, Mrs S was admitted for both pneumonia and asthma. As pneumonia was 
listed on the hospital letter first, MetLife paid the claim with the cause of admittance being 
pneumonia. 
In March 2022, Mrs S was admitted again for both pneumonia and asthma. This time the 
claim was paid with the cause of admittance being asthma. Mrs S says her stay was 
extended due to swollen legs and so this should have been considered a separate cause.  
But MetLife confirmed the hospital discharge letter was referred to a clinical adviser who said 
the admission predominantly related to asthma and the other conditions were investigated 
incidentally. 
As MetLife referred Mrs S query to a clinical adviser, I think it acted reasonably in 
investigating the cause of Mrs S admission. If Mrs S can provide further evidence that her 
stay was extended due to other conditions, then I would expect MetLife to consider this. But 
based on the medical evidence MetLife had at the time, I dont think it acted unfairly or 
unreasonably. 
In response to our investigator, Mrs S has suggested that MetLife should attribute a 
percentage if more than one condition is the cause for hospital admission. The policy isnt 
designed to work in this way and so I cant ask MetLife to do this. 
Ive considered all of the available medical evidence and the stays which had been 
considered by MetLife at the time of complaint. I cant review further or ongoing stays which 
took place after MetLife issued its final response. 
Mrs S asked my decision to be deferred until she receives a review of MetLifes further 
decision. That is not our process. I have to make my decision based on the complaint made 
to MetLife and the evidence available to it, at the time the complaint was made. If Mrs S 
remains unhappy about MetLifes review or any admissions which MetLife hadnt considered 
before the start of our investigation, that is a new complaint which would need to be looked 
at separately. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 July 2023.
