The complaint
Mr A, complaining as the director of Company I, is unhappy National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) closed Company Is business account without providing any reasons for doing so.
 
What happened
NatWest sent Company I a letter on 19 January 2021 giving it 60 days notice that it would 
be closing its business account. 
Mr A was away at the time so didnt receive the letter. It wasnt until he started to receive text 
messages about his Direct Debits being cancelled that he became aware of the closure. He 
called NatWest at that point, but it wouldnt tell him why it had taken the decision to close the 
account and said the decision was final.
Mr A says the closure is unfair as Company I is a genuine business, with genuine 
transactions going through the account. The closure caused inconvenience as he had to call 
from abroad to arrange for Company Is direct debits to be moved. He doesnt feel NatWest 
had any reason to close the account and he would like to know why it did so. 
NatWest has said it was a commercial decision to close Company Is account and it has 
been done in line with the terms and conditions. It said it doesnt have to provide a reason to 
Company I for its decision. 
Mr A referred Company Is complaint to our service. Our investigator didnt uphold the 
complaint. She said NatWest was entitled to close its account and did so in line with the 
terms and conditions and moreover she didnt believe its decision was unfair. She also 
explained that NatWest didnt have to provide a reason for the closure to Company I. 
Mr A disagreed and asked for Company Is complaint to be referred for a decision. He 
reiterated that its fair for a bank to close an account if the account holder has done 
something wrong, but Company I is a legitimate business and hasnt done anything wrong. 
Because Mr A, on behalf of Company I, disagreed, the complaint has been passed to me to 
decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, I can understand why Mr A is so frustrated with the account closure and not knowing 
the reason as to why. I appreciate he feels Company I has been treated unfairly and that 
NatWests actions have had an impact on Company I and him as the director. Id like to 
assure him I have thoroughly looked into why Company Is account was closed to check 
NatWest did this correctly and fairly. And whilst he is going to be disappointed, Im satisfied it 
did. 
NatWest has commercial discretion and can choose who it does business with, just as 
Company I can choose who to bank with. Of course, we expect NatWest to use its 
commercial discretion to make decisions free of prejudice and discrimination. And having 
reviewed the reasons for the closure, Im satisfied in Company Is case it did this. So, despite 
the way it feels to Mr A, Ive also seen nothing to suggest NatWest treated Company I 
unfairly. 
Im satisfied NatWest followed the terms and conditions of the account which say it can be 
closed by giving 60 days notice. I appreciate Mr A was out of the country at the time so 
didnt receive the notice, which ultimately led to the inconvenience of having to rush to 
change Company Is Direct Debits. However, this isnt something I can hold NatWest 
responsible for. 
So, for these reasons I dont think NatWest made an error in closing Company Is account. 
Mr A would like NatWest to tell him the reason for the closure, but it has no obligation to do 
so. This information is often commercially sensitive. So, it wouldnt be appropriate for me to 
require it to do so or disclose the reasons myself. But as Ive said above, I can assure Mr A 
Ive considered everything. 
So, whilst I appreciate this will come as a disappointment to Mr A, I dont believe NatWest 
made any errors in closing the account. It follows that I dont direct it to compensate 
Company I for any inconvenience caused. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Company Is complaint against National Westminster 
Bank Plc. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask I to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 February 2023.
