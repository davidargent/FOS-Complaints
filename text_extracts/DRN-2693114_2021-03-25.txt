The complaint
Mr H complains that John Lewis Financial Services Limited wont refund to him the money 
that he paid for a holiday. 
What happened
Mr H used his John Lewis Financial Services credit card in October 2018 to pay £562 for a 
holiday for his wife and himself that was to be taken later that month. The check-in gate for 
the outbound flight had closed when he tried to check-in so he was unable to go on the 
holiday. He complained to the holiday company and then claimed a refund from John Lewis 
Financial Services under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
It said that the service was available, there was no fault from the holiday company and no 
breach of the terms and conditions so it was unable to accept his claim under section 75. But 
it did offer a 25% gesture of goodwill due to the waiting period for his claim to be resolved 
and the experience that hed had with the holiday company. 
Mr H didnt accept its offer and complained to this service. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He was satisfied that there hadnt been a 
breach of contract by the holiday company and he believed that John Lewis Financial 
Services offer to refund 25% of the cost of the holiday was fair for the way that it had 
handled his claim and complaint.
Mr H has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. Hes responded to 
our investigators recommendations in detail and says, in conclusion, that this isnt a fair 
outcome as the holiday company was in breach of contract as he arrived on time before the 
check-in and gates had closed and should have been allowed to board. He says that he 
should be refunded in full because of the breach of contract and John Lewis Financial 
Services has procrastinated and dealt with his claim very unprofessionally.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Hs complaint about John Lewis Financial Services, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday 
company and that John Lewis Financial Services response to his claim under 
section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Hs 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr H and his wife arrived at the airport later than theyd intended because of issues 
with a tyre and traffic and he dropped-off his wife so that she could check-in while he 
parked  hes provided a parking ticket that was issued at 14:59 and the flight was 
due to depart at 15:40;
his wife wasnt able to check them in until Mr H had arrived and by then the check-in 
had been closed  Mr H says that they should have been allowed to check-in and it 
was a breach of contract that the check-in desk was closed and that they werent 
allowed to check-in;
I sympathise with Mr H for the difficulties that he experienced and for the holiday that 
was missed - but it was his responsibility to check-in on time and Im not persuaded 
that hes provided enough evidence to show that the check-in desk was closed 
earlier than it should have been or that he should have been allowed to check-in after 
the check-in desk had closed;
Im not persuaded that theres been a breach of contract (or misrepresentation) by 
the holiday company in these circumstances so I dont consider that it would be fair 
or reasonable for me to require John Lewis Financial Services to refund to Mr H the 
money that he paid for the holiday; 
Mr H says that an alternative could have been provided, which would have allowed 
him to claim on his insurance so that no money would have been lost  but Im not 
persuaded that the holiday company acted incorrectly in the way that it recorded that 
Mr H and his wife had missed the flight or that it was required to provide any different 
information so that he could recover the cost of the holiday from his insurer;
John Lewis Financial Services isnt liable under section 75 for any issues with the 
holiday companys customer service in dealing with his complaint;
John Lewis Financial Services accepted that there were some issues with the way 
that it had responded to Mr Hs claim  and it offered to refund to him 25% of the cost 
of the holiday as a gesture of goodwill due to the waiting period for his claim to be 
resolved and the experience that hed had with the holiday company;
I consider that to have been a fair and reasonable response by John Lewis Financial 
Services and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it 
to pay a higher amount of compensation to Mr H for those customer service issues; 
and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
John Lewis Financial Services to refund to Mr H the £562 that he paid for the holiday, 
to pay him any other compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
If Mr H now wants to accept John Lewis Financial Services offer of a 25% refund I suggest 
that he contacts it to see if the offer remains available to him.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 April 2021.
