The complaint
Mr D complains that TransUnion International UK Limited trading as TransUnion Information 
Group isnt correctly reporting his electoral roll information.   
What happened
Mr D registered on the electoral roll at his current address in February 2020. In March 2020 
Mr Ds local authority confirmed he was registered and that the information would be 
reported to the credit reference agencies. 
In March 2021 Mr D complained to TransUnion as its app said he wasnt registered on the 
electoral roll. TransUnion responded and said the information it recorded was correct. 
TransUnion also sent Mr D a copy of his credit file. 
The credit file said Mr D was recorded at his address from April 2020. The credit report also 
said Annual Electoral Roll. 
Mr D referred his complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. Last month, 
Mr D forwarded a screen shot showing TransUnions app still said he isnt registered on the 
electoral roll. The investigator upheld Mr Ds complaint and said TransUnion should amend 
its records to correctly report Mr Ds registration on the electoral roll. They also asked 
TransUnion to pay Mr D £150 for the trouble and upset caused.  
TransUnion asked to appeal but didnt say why. As TransUnion asked to appeal, Mr Ds 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
TransUnion sent Mr D a copy of his credit file that says hes been resident at his address 
since April 2020. However, Mr D has sent in a screen shot from TransUnions app that was 
taken after it sent him a copy of his credit report. That says Mr D isnt registered on the 
electoral roll which may be impacting his credit score. 
Im satisfied theres a disparity between the information provided by the local authority and 
what Mr D sees when he looks at his TransUnion app. Its not clear whether Mr Ds report is 
wrong or whether its an issue with the app itself. But I think Mr D makes a reasonable point 
when he says the information reported by TransUnion doesnt appear to be correct. So to 
resolve this complaint, I agree with the investigator that TransUnion needs to take steps to 
update its records to correctly report Mr Ds electoral roll status. 
Im also satisfied the situation has caused Mr D a degree of trouble and upset to Mr D. Our 
investigator recommended TransUnion pay him £150 to reflect that, and I agree thats a fair 
level of compensation that reflects the impact of the issues raised on Mr D. So Im also going 
to tell TransUnion to pay Mr D £150 for the trouble and upset caused. 
  
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct TransUnion International UK Limited 
trading as TransUnion Information Group to amend its records to correctly record Mr D as 
being registered on the electoral roll from March 2020. TransUnion International UK Limited 
trading as TransUnion Information Group should also ensure its app details are in line with 
its credit report. In addition, I direct TransUnion Limited to pay Mr D £150. 
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 October 2021.
