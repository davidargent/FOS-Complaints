The complaint
Mr P complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA refuses to close his account and 
delete his personal information.
What happened
Mr P opened an account with PayPal. He used the name of a fictional character which I will 
refer to as R to open the account and linked his bank account with a bank to his PayPal 
account.
Mr P decided he wanted to change the name on the PayPal account from R to Mr Ps name. 
PayPal didnt agree to do this and so Mr P decided to close the account and tried to do this 
online. As he wasnt able to do so, he contacted PayPal to instruct them to close the account 
and delete his personal data.
PayPal refused to comply with Mr Ps instructions. They said they couldnt verify that R was 
Mr P and the account they had was in the name of R. They stated the account couldnt be 
closed.
Mr P complained to our service. One of the investigators looked into the complaint. He 
thought the case was one we couldnt look at and we should dismiss the complaint. PayPal 
were not willing to give us information regarding the complaint as they said they couldnt 
identify the customer.
Mr P was unhappy with the view. He said he had provided us with evidence that he owned 
the account and PayPal and our service were able to see that the account belonged to him.
My provisional decision 
In my provisional decision I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive decided this complaint is one we can consider, and Ill explain why.
Can we look at Mr Ps complaint?
In the original view the investigator thought the case was one we shouldnt look at. When 
dismissing a case as a service we are saying that although we have the power to decide a 
case, we think we shouldnt consider the merits because it would be inappropriate to do so.
Because of the consequences on the complainant, there are very limited grounds for a 
complaint to be dismissed. These are set out in the rules that govern our service, the 
Dispute resolution rules (DISP) 3.3.4.
I have considered the grounds for dismissing a complaint as set out in the DISP rules. 
Complaints cant generally be dismissed unless they have already been decided by a court 
or another ombudsman scheme. Or the complaint is already being considered by a court. Or 
if dealing with the complaint would seriously impair the effective operation of this service.
The types of things which are considered might seriously impair the effective operation of the 
service relate to the merits of a case having been considered by a court or other 
ombudsman scheme or this service previously.
None of the above apply to the circumstances of this complaint. I appreciate this list isnt 
designed to be exhaustive but considering the circumstances I dont agree any of the 
potential grounds for dismissing the complaint apply in this case and it follows I dont think 
this case should be dismissed.
Having said that, there are certain difficulties in dealing with the case. The first concerns 
whether the Financial Ombudsman service can be satisfied Mr P is who he says he is and is 
the same person as the person who called themselves R. I have looked at the address R 
provided to PayPal and the email address R used and it is the same address and email 
address as Mr P has provided this service when he brought the complaint to us. The date of 
birth also matches so I think on a balance of probability it is more likely than not that Mr P 
and R are one and the same and, on that basis, I am satisfied this service is able to consider 
this complaint and that Mr P is also an eligible complainant.
So, having reviewed the information before me I am persuaded to consider the merits of the 
case.
Although we have requested information from PayPal, they havent provided us with 
information. Our dispute resolution rules allow us to reach a decision on the information we 
have available. So, despite PayPal not providing us with information I can proceed to 
consider the merits of this complaint.
Mr Ps request to close the account and have his personal data removed.
Mr P asked PayPal to close his account as they were unwilling to change the account name 
to Mr P. As I have mentioned PayPal have said they are unwilling to carry out Mr Ps 
instructions as they cant verify he is the same person as R.
And I can understand the concerns PayPal have. PayPal like other financial institutions have 
extensive legal and regulatory obligations which they must comply with. These obligations 
mean they must monitor customers accounts and the origin of funds. They must also have 
in place ways of carrying out customer due diligence.
I can see that PayPal removed Mr Ps bank account as the funding source of the PayPal 
account. I would expect them to do this as a way to comply with their legal and regulatory 
obligations.
PayPal have said they cannot verify the customer and they have never allowed customers to 
open accounts in fictitious names or aliases. Mr P has said this isnt the case and PayPal 
previously allowed customers to open accounts in other names.
It isnt possible for me to verify whether this is the case. But Mr P managed to open an 
account in the name of a fictional character. It isnt clear to me the purpose or reason for 
such an action. But I can understand the situation from PayPals point of view. As a financial 
institution, it makes it difficult to comply with their legal and regulatory obligations to have a 
customer who they cannot verify. I am sure Mr P doesnt have any identity documents in the 
name of R which he can show to PayPal. And if he had, this complaint likely wouldnt have 
arisen.I appreciate Mr P may be thinking that since we have accepted Mr P and R are the same 
person, then PayPal should too.
But PayPal have a different verification process. The process has been designed by PayPal 
to ensure it complies with its legal and regulatory obligations. As a service we cannot dictate 
the processes that a financial institution follows and how they chose to comply with their 
legal and regulatory obligations. So, although this service can accept the information Mr P 
has provided us and I am happy to deal with his complaint on that basis, PayPal have 
obligations that this service isnt subject to and they are entitled to put their own processes in 
place to comply with their legal and regulatory obligations. The process is an internal 
process, and we cant ask them to change it.
Mr P has said he wanted the account closed but I can see why PayPal havent followed his 
instructions and for the reasons I have mentioned above I cant say they have done anything 
wrong here.
I will now move on to Mr Ps complaint about his personal data. Mr P says he wants his 
personal data removed  he says he wants his name, address, email and phone number 
removed. Personal data means data relating to a living individual who is or can be identified 
from the data.
Firstly, the role of our service isnt to decide whether or not a business has breached data 
protection laws  thats the role of the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). But I can 
look at whether a business has treated the consumer fairly and reasonably when applying 
those regulations in their course of business. If Mr P has concerns over whether or not 
PayPal has fully complied with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) he can raise 
these directly with the ICO.
PayPal have refused to take instruction from Mr P and carry out his request. Mr P says he 
hasnt given his consent to store that data.
Mr P has requested the removal of data and I have gone on to consider what is known as 
the right to be forgotten. This is the right of personal data to be erased without undue delay 
which is found in the GDPR.
There are a number of reasons an individual has the right to have their personal data erased 
the relevant ones are:
The personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose an organization originally 
collected or processed it.
An organization is relying on an individuals consent as the lawful basis for 
processing the data and that individual withdraws their consent.
An organization is relying on legitimate interests as its justification for processing an 
individuals data, the individual objects to this processing, and there is no overriding 
legitimate interest for the organization to continue with the processing.
Mr Ps argument is that PayPal no longer need to store his data as he wants the account 
closed and he has now withdrawn his consent to them holding his data. I dare say he also 
believes there is no legitimate interest to PayPal holding this data.
Having considered the situation I am satisfied that PayPal are acting fairly in not removing 
the data. I say this because:PayPal cannot be certain that the data they hold is Mr Ps own data- as far as PayPal 
is concerned this is Rs data and not Mr Ps so I can understand why they are 
unwilling to remove it.
The data PayPal holds doesnt identify Mr P as its in the name of R so I cant see 
how this is personal data that identifies Mr P as Mr P.
Consent was given by R to store and keep the data and its for R to ask PayPal to 
remove the data. PayPal are entitled to verify that they are dealing with R and not 
someone impersonating R. As they arent able to verify R they cannot remove the 
data.
Even if PayPal were to agree that Mr P and R are one and the same, PayPal would still be 
able to hold on to the information they have. Because even though the GDPR sets out the 
right to be forgotten, the regulations also specify this is not an absolute right, and only 
applies in certain circumstances. The regulations say the right to be forgotten doesnt apply if 
processing by a business is necessary for several specific reasons, and these include legal 
obligations. In other words, PayPal would be entitled to continue processing Mr Ps data if it 
needs to do so in order to comply with its legal obligations. PayPal have a legitimate interest 
in retaining the data in order to make sure that there is no abuse of their service as there has 
been a clear misuse of the account by R and Mr P.
In summary I appreciate that for Mr P the information PayPal holds is his personal 
information. But as I have mentioned, for PayPal, the data concerned is Rs personal data as 
its in Rs name.
For all those reasons, I dont think it would be right to uphold this complaint. I know that Mr P 
will be disappointed but with the evidence before me I dont think PayPal have acted unfairly 
here.
Responses to my provisional decision
PayPal have not responded to my provisional decision. Mr P hasnt responded to my 
provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Although Mr P and PayPal have not provided any further comments I have nevertheless re 
considered all the available evidence and the arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I have seen nothing to change my mind, 
so my provisional findings stand. 
My final decision
My decision is that for the reasons stated above and in my provisional decision I dont 
uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 March 2023.
