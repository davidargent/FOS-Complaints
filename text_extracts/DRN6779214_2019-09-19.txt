K821x#15complaint
Mr C says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to him and didnt 
carry out proper  affordability checks.  
background
Mr C took 7 loans  from QuickQuid between May 2008 and April 2009.  Although  all the loans 
have been repaid, it seems that Mr C had some  difficulties repaying his final two loans.
A summary  of Mr Cs borrowing,  based  on the information provided to us from QuickQuid, 
can be found in the table  below:
loan number loan amount received date repayment datenumber  of 
repayments
1 £100.00 30/05/2008 23/06/2008 1
2 £250.00 26/06/2008 23/07/2008 1
3 £300.00 28/07/2008 22/08/2008 1
4 £400.00 28/08/2008 24/09/2008 1
5 £300.00 26/09/2008 23/10/2008 1
6 £300.00 28/10/2008 27/03/2009 1
7 £400.00 17/04/2009 17/03/2011 2
Our adjudicator didnt  think that QuickQuid should have given Mr C loan 4, or any of the 
following loans because  the repayment  due for this loan represented  a significant portion of 
his declared income.  The adjudicator also felt that by loan 7 a pattern of lending had been 
established which shouldve  indicated to QuickQuid that Mr C wasnt able to sustainably 
repay this loan.  
QuickQuid didnt accept  the adjudicators findings.  But it did accept that loans 4 and 7 
shouldnt have been given, so it made an offer to settle these loans.  Mr C didnt accept this 
offer. And as no agreement could be reached, the case has been passed  to me for a final 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks in order to figure out 
whether Mr C could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN67792142But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So QuickQuid was required to establish  whether Mr C could sustainably  repay  his loans   
not just whether the loan payments were  affordable  on a strict pounds  and pence 
calculation. The loan payments being affordable  on this basis might  be an indication Mr C 
could sustainably make  his repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the 
case. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, proportionate checks for loans 4 - 6 would most likely have 
shown that:
Mr Cs loan repayment represented  a significant proportion  of his monthly income. In 
these circumstances,  there was a significant  risk that Mr C wouldnt have been able 
to repay  this loan or any further loan without undue difficulty  or without the need  to 
borrow again. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 - 6 and QuickQuid should put things right as 
detailed below.
Having Ive also looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr C, I also 
think that QuickQuid  should reasonably have seen that Mr C was unlikely  to have been able 
to make his loan repayments in a sustainable manner by the time it provided loan seven. I 
say this because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 1 - 6 of Mr C taking new loans shortly 
after repaying previous ones. I think that by loan 7, QuickQuid ought  fairly and 
reasonably to have  regarded  that pattern as established. By the seventh loan Mr C 
had been indebted  to QuickQuid for just over ten months.
 
Mr C had significant problems repaying loan 6. Mr C deferred repayment on loan 6 
on four occasions.  I think this was a very clear signal that he was having financial 
difficulties, and should have alerted QuickQuid that loan 7 couldnt be repaid in a 
sustainably manner.
Ref: DRN67792143Mr C wasnt  reducing the amounts he owed to QuickQuid. For example, loan 7 was 
taken out over 10 months after Mr Cs first loan was approved, and the value of this 
loan was for more  than four times the sum of his first loan. 
I think that Mr C lost out because QuickQuid provided loan 7 because:
the loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time;  
and
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Cs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im partly upholding Mr Cs complaint and QuickQuid should put things right as set out 
below.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 4 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 to 6 from Mr Cs credit file
remove all entries about  loan 7 from Mr Cs credit file. The period of time Mr C owed 
QuickQuid money  means that any information still recorded about loan 7 is adverse..
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet UK LLC to take off tax from this interest. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC must  give Mr C a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he 
asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Cs complaint.  
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right for Mr C as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 October  2019.
