The complaint was reviewed by two of our adjudicators. The first adjudicator upheld from 
loan 7 onwards. Sunny disagreed but offered to uphold Ms Ps complaint from loan 15 
onwards. The offer was put to Ms P, but she rejected it. 
In the most recent assessment, the adjudicator partially upheld Ms Ps complaint and 
thought the loans from loan 6 onwards shouldnt have been given because the behaviour of 
her borrowing indicated Ms P was suffering from financial difficulties and was reliant on 
these types of loans. Sunny didnt respond to this assessment.  
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms P could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing 
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms P could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Ms Ps complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
In the most recent assessment, our adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to do more when 
it approved loans 1 to 5. Ms P didnt respond to the view. As there no longer appears to be a 
dispute with these loans, I wont be making any further findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before it lent loan 6 to Ms P and the results of these checks 
didnt raise any concerns. But as this was Ms Ps fifth instalment loan in four months, I think 
Sunny should have been looking to build a clearer picture about Ms Ps finances before 
lending her this loan. 
I say this because Ms Ps borrowing behaviour ought to have indicated she was someone 
who was facing financial problems. She had several loans outstanding  which Im aware is 
a facility Sunny allowed  but she was also repaying loans and then taking out more loans 
shortly afterwards. For example, she took out loan 5 the day after she repaid loan 2, she 
then repaid loan 4 six days later. But then the following day she took out loan 6 and repaid 
loan 3.
Had Sunny verified what Ms P was telling them  by checking her bank statements and/or 
bills and payslips  its likely to have found that Ms Ps income was much lower than she had 
declared and was struggling to manage her money. And this all meant it was unlikely Ms P 
would be able to repay her loans sustainably without borrowing again. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Ms P, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. Given the circumstances of Ms Ps case, I think that this point was reached by loan 9. I say 
this because: 
at this point Sunny ought to have realised Ms P was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Ms P had taken out nine instalment loans in nearly 18 months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely that Ms Ps indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably. 
she also wasnt really making any inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 26 
was taken out four and a half years after Ms Ps first loan. Ms P had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Ms P lost out because Sunny provided borrowing for loan 6 onwards because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ps indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The length of time over which Ms P borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Ms Ps ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding Ms Ps complaint about loans 6 to 26. 
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Ms P paid on loans 6 to 26;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loan 6, 7 and 8 from Ms Ps credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 9 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 9 to 26 should be removed from 
Ms Ps credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Ms P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Ms Ps complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 June 2020.
