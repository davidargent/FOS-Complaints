K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that Santander UK Plc mis-sold him a 123 Credit Card  because its unable  
to give him a list of retailers  where he could get cashback on the card.
background
Mr Bs had a 123 MasterCard  credit card with Santander since 2013. In early 2019 he 
contacted Santander to ask for a full list of retailers where he could get cashback on the 
card. But Santander told him it didnt have a definitive list though he could check whether a 
retailer gave cashback  through their online checker. Mr B wasnt  satisfied  with this so he 
complained. Santander rejected his complaint so he came to this service. Our investigator  
didnt think the complaint  should be upheld so Mr B asked for review by an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Based on what Ive seen, I dont think the 
complaint should  succeed  and Ill explain why.
Mr Bs had the 123 account since 2013  and has been able to get cashback on numerous 
card purchases since he took the card out. Therefore I dont think  the card was mis-sold as 
hes benefited from the cashback  feature.
Although I understand Mr Bs frustrated  that Santander cant  provide a definitive list of 
retailers, it does make the information  available online. As the list may be constantly 
changing as stores open and close and it depends on categorisation of a retailer  by 
MasterCard, I think this is reasonable.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, its my final decision that this complaint  is not upheld.  Under  
the rules of the Financial Ombudsman  Service, Im required  to ask Mr B to accept  or reject 
my decision  before 30 May 2019.
