The complaint
Mr S complains that AWP Assistance UK Ltd (AWP) have unfairly increased the 
premiums for his vehicle warranty plan.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them 
again here. Instead, I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these 
reasons:
Insurers constantly update how they rate the risk of consumers or, in this case, 
particular vehicles. And their rates continually change. AWP has provided me 
with confirmation that the price increase of Mr Ss policy was calculated 
according to the car model he had. So, Im satisfied the price he was quoted has 
been calculated correctly and all of AWPs customers in his position would have 
been charged a similar premium. So there is nothing to suggest that Mr S has 
been treated unfairly due to his individual circumstances, for example. 
Im also satisfied that Mr S was given prior notice of the premium increase upon 
renewal, as he complained about it before the renewal date of 9 December 2019.
I appreciate this will come as a disappointment to Mr S but, for the reasons given above, Ive 
not seen enough evidence to persuade me that AWP have acted unfairly in these 
circumstances.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 September 2020.
