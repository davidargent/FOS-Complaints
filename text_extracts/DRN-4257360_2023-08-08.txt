The complaint
Miss M complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA lent to her irresponsibly. 
What happened
In March 2018, Miss M opened a PayPal Credit account and was given a limit of £1,500. In 
November 2019 PayPal increased her limit to £2,500. Miss M says if PayPal had properly 
assessed her application, it ought to have refused to open the account and shouldnt have 
increased her limit. She complained to PayPal saying it had acted irresponsibly by lending to 
her. 
PayPal looked into her complaint. It said it had followed its normal procedures in assessing 
her application for credit. It used the information she provided on the application form along 
with evidence obtained from credit reference agencies, and details it held for Miss Ms 
existing PayPal account. None of the information it obtained gave it any concerns and 
PayPal felt it had lent to her responsibly. PayPal rejected Miss Ms complaint. 
Miss M didnt accept what PayPal said, so she referred her complaint to our service and one 
of our investigators looked into it. She felt that PayPal had carried out reasonable and 
proportionate checks and acted fairly by opening the account with a £1,500 limit. She said 
PayPal ought to have carried out more checks prior to offering the limit increase, as Miss M 
had missed payments and already exceeded the initial limit. After obtaining further evidence 
from Miss M however, she felt even if PayPal had carried out further checks, it would have 
still been likely to agree the limit. Our investigator didnt uphold Miss Ms complaint.
PayPal accepted what our investigator said, but Miss M didnt. As there was no agreement, 
the complaint has been passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to complaints about irresponsible and unaffordable lending 
on our website  including the key relevant rules, guidance, good industry practice and 
law. Ive considered this approach when deciding this complaint.
PayPal needed to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to ensure that it didnt 
lend to Miss M irresponsibly. I think there are key questions I need to consider in order to 
decide what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint:
Did PayPal carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Miss M was in a position to sustainably repay the credit?
oIf not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown at the 
time?
Did PayPal make a fair lending decision?
Did PayPal act unfairly or unreasonably towards Miss M in some other way?
PayPal had to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Miss M 
would be able to repay the loan sustainably. Its not about PayPal assessing the likelihood of 
it being repaid, but it had to consider the impact of the repayments on her. 
Did PayPal carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Miss M was in 
a position to sustainably repay the credit?
Initial lending decision
PayPal gathered information from Miss M from her application for credit. She told it she 
earned between £1,500 - £2,000 per month and was living with her parents. She declared 
monthly expenses of up to £500 per month. PayPal then checked Miss Ms credit file and its 
own credit scoring system which reflects the data found on credit reference agencies. It also 
looked at how shed used her existing PayPal Wallet account.
PayPal had no concerns about what it found as a result of the checks it carried out and was 
happy to accept the application with a limit of £1,500. I think the checks it carried out were a 
reasonable and proportionate way for PayPal to assess Miss Ms initial application for credit.
Limit increase
Around 18 months later, Miss M was offered an increase in her limit to £2,500 which she 
accepted. But at the time, her balance was already in excess of the lower agreed limit by 
some £600 and she was only paying minimum payments to the account. Shed also been 
late with 5 payments over the period too. PayPal was satisfied Miss M had passed the 
criteria for a limit increase, but it seems a strange decision to be made without further 
checks, given the circumstances Ive just outlined. 
Before granting an increase of £1,000, I think PayPal ought to have asked more questions to 
check Miss M would be able to sustainably repay it. She appeared to be struggling to stay 
within the current limit and keep up with payments. It follows that I dont think it carried out 
reasonable and proportionate checks for the limit increase. 
Ive thought about what PayPal might have found if it had carried out further checks before 
offering the limit increase. There is no set list of checks businesses have to do, but it might, 
for example, have asked to see Miss Ms bank statements to obtain a better understanding 
of her financial circumstances. 
Miss M provided us with bank statements and Ive carefully reviewed them. They show her 
monthly income is in line with that which she disclosed to PayPal at the outset. There is no 
evidence of priority bills such as rent, mortgage, council tax etc, and that is in line with her 
declaration that she was living at home with her parents. Miss M did make some payments 
to other creditors, but the vast majority of Miss Ms spending appears to be discretionary. 
In my view, if PayPal had asked further questions of Miss M before offering the limit 
increase, it would have been unlikely to conclude the repayments would have been 
unsustainable for her. I think it most likely, it would have reached the same lending decision.
Did PayPal make a fair lending decision?
Ive already said that I think the initial decision to lend was fair. And, while Ive explained it 
ought to have done more in terms of checks, I dont think doing so would have led to PayPal 
reaching a different decision regarding the increase. Overall, taking into account all the circumstances, I think PayPal has reached fair decisions to lend. 
Did PayPal act unfairly or unreasonably towards Miss M in some other way?
Ive carefully read, listened to and thought about all the evidence provided by each party to 
this complaint. Having done so, I dont think PayPal has acted unfairly or unreasonably 
towards Miss M in some other way.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 September 2023.
