The complaint
Mr S complains NewDay Ltd (NewDay) incorrectly recorded an incorrect surname and 
address on his credit file 
What happened
Mr S says following an initial issue over goods purchased, he discovered that NewDay had 
amended his records and notified credit reference agencies of an incorrect surname and the 
house number of his address. Mr S says that despite promises from NewDay to amend this 
error on their part they failed to promptly correct this, meaning his credit file was affected 
over a period of several months. Mr S says while NewDay have corrected his credit file, this 
would have caused issues with anyone looking at his credit file and he wants NewDay to 
have a note placed on his credit file to show the error was made by them and he has no 
association with this other surname. Mr S says that the compensation offered by NewDay 
isnt sufficient for the time he has spent on this matter and the stress he has gone through 
and he will face legal costs as he needed to involve solicitors before any action was taken by 
NewDay. 
NewDay have apologised and accepted mistakes were made, but say they corrected their 
error once it was brought to their attention by Mr S. NewDay say they offered compensation 
of £75 to Mr S for the inconvenience caused by their mistake in registering the incorrect 
surname with the credit reference agencies. NewDay believe this is fair considering there is 
no evidence to show Mr S was financially disadvantaged because of their mistake. 
Mr S wasnt happy with NewDays response and referred the matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold Mr Ss complaint. 
The investigator felt while NewDay had made a mistake, they did act promptly in rectifying 
this once they had been notified that their initial mistake hadnt been fully corrected. The 
investigator says NewDays offer of redress fairly reflected the inconvenience caused, and it 
wasnt for her to penalise the business for this mistake, given no evidence was provided to 
show Mr S had suffered any financial loss as a result. 
Mr S wasnt happy with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision. 
I can understand it would have both stressful and frustrating for Mr S to have incorrect 
details registered against him on his credit file and then only to find NewDay failed to correct 
this as initially promised. The first thing to say here is NewDay have accepted they made a 
mistake when incorrectly registering the wrong surname on Mr Ss records with them and 
with credit reference agencies. 
So, when coming to a full and impartial decision here, I will consider if NewDays actions 
have caused any financial problems or loss to Mr S and if the level of compensation offered 
fairly reflects the inconvenience caused here. 
Mr S says he wants NewDay to correct his credit file with a note making it clear that it was 
NewDays error in registering the wrong house number and surname.  Its worth mentioning 
that NewDay have told this service they never reported the house number change to the 
credit agencies, that was an internal record error, but accept they did report an incorrect 
surname. I have seen no evidence to show the incorrect address was reported to the credit 
agencies or any post sent to that address and on balance, I am satisfied this mistake was in 
all probability an internal error created by NewDay. 
Its clear theres no dispute NewDay did make an error in registering an incorrect surname 
on their files and with credit reference agencies and, like the investigator, I am satisfied they 
could have dealt with this better. What happened here was, after responding to Mr Ss 
issues, NewDay agreed to rectify their mistake on registering an incorrect surname but 
didnt, and it was Mr S who notified them of this in October 2020. While Mr S feels NewDay 
took no action to correct their mistake, I have been provided with internal emails that show 
NewDay did put in place instructions to ask the credit agencies to remove the incorrect 
surname in November 2020, a few weeks after they were made aware of this by Mr S. Mr S 
has told this service one of those agencies didnt remove the information from his credit file 
until January 2021 and no action was actually taken by NewDay until he involved his 
solicitors, who wrote to NewDay and this created further demands on his time and costs for 
him. 
While I can see this has been a frustrating time for Mr S, from the information I have seen, 
although NewDay did miss the opportunity to correct their initial mistake and exacerbated 
matters by not following out what they had promised, once they were informed of this by Mr 
S they did act promptly to ensure the correction was made to the appropriate credit agencies 
and if any of the agencies didnt act upon those requests, I cant say that NewDay can be 
held responsible for that. Its also fair to say the decision to employ solicitors was one taken 
by Mr S, and he may well have thought that was necessary, but NewDay had informed him 
of his right to refer the matter to this service. I cant say with any certainty it was the 
employment of those solicitors writing to NewDay that prompted the corrective action, as 
from the information I have seen they were already committed to putting matters right. So, it 
follows I cant hold NewDay responsible for any resulting costs that might be incurred by Mr 
S employing those solicitors.  
Thats not to say Mr S hasnt been inconvenienced here and put to some trouble - he has, 
but like the investigator, my role isnt to penalise businesses like NewDay when mistakes are 
made, but ensure that they apologise, put right their mistakes and ensure consumers like Mr 
S havent been financially disadvantaged. I am satisfied this is what has happened here, and 
I say this as there is no evidence to show that during the time Mr Ss credit file had an 
incorrect surname registered it had a material financial impact on him then or will have in the 
future. Mr Ss credit file has been corrected albeit later than Mr S wanted. While Mr S may 
not agree, its not possible for a note to be registered by NewDay with credit agencies to 
show what he wants, that is the mistake wasnt of his doing, and while I understand he might 
want this, I cant ask NewDay to do something they cant. As the investigator has pointed out 
it may be possible for Mr S to lodge a notice of correction with the credit agencies if he feels 
that is necessary. That said, Mr S does have a final response letter from NewDay which 
gives a clear explanation of what happened and that could be used in the future, should Mr 
S ever need it. Mr S has made clear that he doesnt feel the level of compensation offered by NewDay of 
£75 is sufficient. While I can see this was a frustrating time for Mr S, any redress should 
reflect the inconvenience caused and not to be seen as a way of punishing businesses - 
NewDay have accepted their mistake, put matters right and apologised I am satisfied this 
level of redress does that. 
I understand that this compensation payment is still available to Mr S if he wishes to accept it 
from NewDay and I will leave it with him to contact them if he so wishes. 
It follows, while Mr S will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking anymore of 
NewDay here.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 September 2021.
