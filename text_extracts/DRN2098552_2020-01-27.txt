K821x#15complaint
Miss R has complained about a number of loans  she took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Miss R says she was lent 
to irresponsibly and the loans caused her financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny.
background
We now know that Miss R took out 13 instalment loans  from Sunny between July 2017  and 
August 2018.  Ive enclosed a summary  of Miss Rs borrowing with Sunny, based  on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan 4 onwards. Sunny doesnt  agree with this although it says it is 
prepared to settle from the point of loan number 10 onwards. The complaint  has therefore 
come to me for an ombudsmans final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Miss Rs 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Miss R could repay all the loans  she was given in a sustainable  manner.  These checks  
ought to have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being  
lent, the total repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN20985522There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss R could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Miss R could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Miss R. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern of lending history 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loans 1, 2, and 3 ought  not to be 
upheld as they appeared affordable. Ive looked  carefully at these and taken  note of Miss Rs 
declared income. Ive also looked at what she said about her monthly  expenditure. 
With this information,  and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks which Sunny most likely carried  out appear to have  
been proportionate for loans 1  3. And I think these  levels  of checks,  together  with the 
income and expenditure details provided  by Miss R, would have made  those particular loans 
appear affordable  for her. 
However, I think from the point of loan 4 onwards in this case  things would have  looked  
different and therefore required  a more thorough and responsible approach. For loan 4, for 
example, Sunny ought to have been aware  this was her fourth  such  loan in less than 2 
months. Previous Sunny  loan instalments shed taken out were also still outstanding at the 
time. Loan 5 then saw an increase in the amount Miss R borrowed so she didnt  seem  to be 
making any inroads  into her indebtedness.
Theres no evidence Sunny altered its approach at the point of loan 4 to look more 
thoroughly at Miss Rs financial situation. I think if it had done  this it would have shown she 
was having trouble managing her money  and was probably borrowing to meet normal 
ongoing commitments  and those of other  borrowing. So I think it was irresponsible to lend to 
Miss R at the point  of loan 4 onwards.
In addition to the above,  from the point of loan 6 onwards,  there was an additional and clear 
pattern of repeated lending evident  in my view. Loan  6 directly followed loan 5 by just 3 
weeks, but again, it was whilst some of her other  loans  remained outstanding and the 
amount she asked for increased significantly. So there was an obvious  dependency on high-
interest, short-term lending evidenced  by this, her sixth loan in less than 5 months.  
So Im also upholding  Miss Rs complaint in respect of loans 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 as 
well. Sunny repeatedly  lent to Miss R in an unsustainable manner because:
 
Ref: DRN20985523these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Miss R borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss R paid on loans 4 - 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges on these from 
the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement;
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loans 10, 11, 12 and 13 and 
treat any payments  Miss R made towards  these  loans as payments  towards  the 
capital;
if reworking Miss Rs loans 10, 11, 12 and 13 accounts as Ive directed results in her 
effectively having made payments above the original capital borrowed, then Sunny 
should refund these  overpayments  with 8% simple  interest  calculated  on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of 
settlement. 
If reworking Miss Rs loans 10, 11, 12 and 13 accounts leaves an amount of capital 
still to be paid,  then Sunny  can use the total refund  for the other upheld loans to 
offset this. And if there is still an outstanding capital balance then I would remind  
Sunny that it should take a sympathetic view when  seeking  to agree an affordable  
repayment plan with Miss R for the remaining capital.
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Miss Rs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 should  
be completely removed from Miss Rs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Miss R a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Miss Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  International 
Limited should put things right for Miss R as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 February  2020.
