The complaint
Mrs K complains about how NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles dealt with her request for a 
payment plan and the service it provided around this.
What happened
In August 2020, Mrs K sent NewDay a letter explaining that she was experiencing financial 
difficulties and wanted a plan to pay less than her usual payments to her credit card. 
NewDay sent her a form to complete which detailed her income and expenditure so it could 
understand what it could do to help her. Mrs K returned this but didnt tell NewDay what she 
was offering to pay. NewDay needed to know this and tried to call her on a number of 
occasions to clarify this and also sent letters asking her to call it.
Mrs K says that telephone calls make her anxious and so she didnt call NewDay. But in 
October 2020, she sent NewDay a letter offering to pay £25 a month towards her card. 
NewDay asked her to call and give income and expenditure information to support this but 
Mrs K didnt because of her concerns around using the phone. Mrs K started making 
payments of £25 a month in November 2020. But by this point NewDay had issued a default 
notice because of the arrears and lack of agreed payments on the account.
In December 2020, NewDay received a letter from Mrs K in which she explained why she 
didnt want to speak over the phone and again offered £25 a month as a payment. NewDay 
put a hold on the account for three months and asked her to submit an income and 
expenditure form to see what it could do to help. Mrs K didnt submit that and in April 2021 
her account was closed and a default registered.
Mrs K then complained to NewDay about how it had handled this. NewDay acknowledged 
that it shouldnt have asked Mrs K to contact it by telephone. It offered to compensate her 
£50 for this. But it said that in terms of the actions it had taken in relation to her account, that 
it had acted correctly.
Mrs K disagreed and asked this service to look at her complaint. When we got in touch with 
NewDay about the complaint  it offered a further £25 in terms of the compensation  
bringing the total to £75. Our investigator agreed that NewDay was entitled to take the 
actions it did on the account and that it did so fairly. But they didnt feel that the 
compensation NewDay offered was enough, given the impact this would have had on Mrs K. 
She felt that NewDay should pay £150 for this. NewDay disagreed and so the complaint was 
passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Dealing with this situation must have been upsetting and confusing for Mrs K. Shes told us 
and NewDay why she prefers not to use the phone for matters like this. So it must have 
been very frustrating to keep being told that she needed to call it in order to get the help she 
wanted. But I dont think that itd be fair to now tell NewDay to remove what its recorded 
about this account on her credit file in the way she wants.
I say this because there isnt anything to suggest that Mrs K told NewDay that she didnt 
want to speak on the phone before December 2020. By that point, NewDay had already 
issued a default notice asking her to repay what was owed in full before it took further action 
to close the account for use and transfer it to a recovery agent. I think it was entitled to issue 
that notice  where the arrears had accrued for several months and there hadnt been any 
mutually agreed payments on the account. I realise that Mrs K was making payments of £25 
a month  but this had never been agreed with NewDay. It was entitled to ask for more 
information to make sure that was a proportionate and affordable amount for her that itd be 
willing to accept.
After receiving Mrs Ks letter in December 2020, NewDay put the account on hold for a few 
months, in effect giving Mrs K a final chance to see if she could avoid NewDay taking the 
actions it outlined in the default notice. At this point, given what had happened up to this 
point, I think it would have been clear to Mrs K that she needed to submit an up to date 
income and expenditure form, along with a clear offer of what she could afford. 
By April 2021 though, NewDay hadnt heard from Mrs K with any further income and 
expenditure details or payment proposals. So it closed the account and transferred it to an 
agent to recover  in line with the default notice. I think it was fair for NewDay to give Mrs K 
this further breathing space, but where no further proposals were made or contact received, I 
think it was entitled to take further action to recover the debt.
I realise the impact this will have on Mrs K in terms of the information thats recorded about 
this with credit reference agencies, but I think it was entitled to take this action when it did 
given what the relevant guidance says. A default accurately reflects what happened to the 
account. Its also worth saying that this will also usually mean that interest and charges are 
suspended  meaning she can repay what she owes in an affordable way without what she 
owes increasing.
So in terms of how NewDay dealt with the account and Mrs Ks financial difficulties, I think it 
acted fairly. But NewDay could have done more to communicate with Mrs K fairly and 
appropriately. She told NewDay she didnt want to discuss her situation over the phone and 
while I realise the letters sent after this were automated, it must have been frustrating to 
receive more letters asking that Mrs K contacted NewDay on the phone when shed already 
told it that she didnt want to do this.
For that I think NewDay should compensate Mrs K  and I think £150 as suggested by our 
investigator is fair. Mrs K has detailed the impact this had on her in her circumstances and 
while NewDay has suggested £75, I think £150 is a fairer amount to recognise the impact 
this had on her. So its this that NewDay should pay her.
My final decision
NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles should pay Mrs K £150 in total for the distress and upset 
caused here.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2023.
