The complaint
Mr J is unhappy with how MotoNovo Finance Limited dealt with his request for assistance as 
a result of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
What happened
In February 2018, Mr J was supplied with a used car through a hire purchase agreement 
with MotoNovo. The agreement was for £8,775.69 over 48 months; with an initial payment of 
£468.39, 46 monthly repayments of £269.39 and a final payment of £468.39.
Mr Js income was affected by Covid-19 and, in June 2020, he applied for a payment 
deferral. Which MotoNovo accepted. The payment deferral covered the payments due in 
July, August, and September 2020. Mr J was unhappy that MotoNovo didnt reactivate his 
direct debit, which meant the payments for October and November 2020 werent collected. 
And MotoNovo reported this to the credit reference agencies as arrears.
MotoNovo said that Mr J had been correctly informed about the payment deferral process, 
and what he needed to do once this ended. So, they didnt think theyd done anything wrong. 
Mr J wasnt happy with this response, and he brought his complaint to us for investigation.
In an email dared 23 June 2020, MotoNovo said at the end of the deferral period, your 
normal repayments will start again. Our investigator said this implied that the payments 
would automatically recommence, and he didnt think it was reasonable for Mr J to conclude 
it meant that he needed to contact MotoNovo to set up a new direct debit  which is what 
MotoNovo said was their process. So, he didnt think MotoNovo made their process clear.
MotoNovo agreed that the missed payments for October and November 2020 would be 
added to the end of the agreement  which is also what happened with the deferred 
payments for July to September 2020. And the guidance issued by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) about customers whose income was affected by Covid-19 allowed 
MotoNovo to offer up to six-months payment deferral. So, the investigator said that, as 
MotoNovo had essentially treated the October and November 2020 payments as part of the 
payment deferral, then they shouldnt have reported them as missed payments.
Given all of this, the investigator said that MotoNovo should remove the missed payments 
from Mr Js credit file and pay him an additional £200 for the trouble and upset hed been 
caused.
MotoNovo didnt agree with the investigator. They said they spoke to Mr J when they set up 
the payment deferral and told him he would need to call them back when the payment 
deferral ended, to set up the payments again. And they confirmed this in an email dated 23 
June 2020. They also said that Mr J shouldve contacted them when the payment for 
October 2020 didnt go through. Because of this, they think they correctly reported the 
arrears on Mr Js account.
Because MotoNovo didnt agree with the investigator, this matter has been passed to me to 
make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same overall conclusions as the investigator, and for 
broadly the same reasons. If I havent commented on any specific point, its because I dont 
believe its affected what I think is the right outcome.
In considering this complaint Ive had regard to the relevant law and regulations; any 
regulators rules, guidance and standards, codes of practice, and (if appropriate) what I 
consider was good industry practice at the time. Mr J was supplied with a car under a hire 
purchase agreement. This is a regulated consumer credit agreement which means were 
able to look into complaints about it. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued temporary guidance on 24 April 2020, that 
came into effect on 27 April 2020, about customers who were faced with payment difficulties 
as a result of Covid-19. This allowed financial businesses such as MotoNovo to grant a 
three-month payment deferral to people like Mr J. The guidance said that a firm should 
grant the customer a payment deferral for 3 months unless the firm determines (acting 
reasonably) that it is obviously not in the customers interests to do so. The guidance also 
said that firms should not report a worsening arrears status on the customers credit file 
during the payment deferral period.
The FCA issued updated guidance on 15 July 2020. This guidance said that, Where, after 
an initial payment deferral, and at any time before their first payment is due, a customer 
indicates they remain in temporary payment difficulties and cannot resume full payments 
immediately, a firm should offer a full or partial payment deferral to reduce payments for a 
period of 3 months to a level the customer indicates they can afford. If the customer is in 
temporary payment difficulties but is unable to afford any payments, the firm should offer 
them a full payment deferral where this is in the customers interests.
MotoNovo have said they told Mr J, in a call on 23 June 2020, that he would need to contact 
them at the end of the payment deferral period, to arrange to restart the payments. Theyve 
also said they confirmed all of this in a follow up email sent then same day.
MotoNovo havent been able to provide a copy of the call they had with Mr J. But I have 
seen a copy of the email they sent on 23 June 2020. In this email MotoNovo said we are 
pleased to confirm that your request for a three month repayment deferral has been 
approved  your next three monthly repayments have been put on hold, not cancelled  at 
the end of the deferral period, your normal repayment will start again.
Theres nothing in this email which explains Mr J would need to contact MotoNovo to restart 
the payments at the end of the payment deferral period. Instead the email says that the 
payment collection is on hold, not cancelled, and normal repayments would restart once the 
deferral period had ended.
Im not satisfied that this email clearly says what MotoNovo thinks it does. And, instead, it 
implies that payments will be collected as normal, without the need to Mr J to take any 
further action, at the end of the payment deferral period. Whats more, if this email accurately 
reflects what Mr J was told by MotoNovo, then Im not satisfied what he was told on the 
phone call wouldve been clear either, especially as MotoNovos case notes for the call refer 
to Mr Js direct debit being suppressed and not cancelled, which is what Id expect if the 
direct debit needed to be set up again.Mr J has also provided a screenshot of an email he received from MotoNovo. This email 
says your Payment Deferral arrangement on your vehicle finance agreement with us is due 
to come to an end soon but dont worry, were here to help you decide on your next steps. 
When your Payment Deferral ends your normal monthly payments will restart. The date of 
this email is unknown, and it doesnt appear in MotoNovos case notes. However, from the 
content of this email, I think its likely this was sent to Mr J in September 2020.
MotoNovo have also referred to text messages they sent to Mr J about the payment deferral. 
In a text message dated 23 July 2020  a month into the three month payment deferral  
they told Mr J your Payment Deferral is coming to an end soon, you need to choose how 
youd like to make up your Deferred Payments. And Mr J was provided with a link to 
MotoNovos website.
Four days later, on 27 July 2020, MotoNovo sent Mr J a further text message, saying your 
Payment Deferral is coming to an end soon and providing the same link to chose how to 
repay the deferred payments.
MotoNovo sent Mr J a third text message on 26 October 2020  about a month after the 
payment deferral had ended, saying your Payment Deferral is coming to an end soon, you 
need to choose how youd like to make up your Deferred Payments. And Mr J was provided 
with a further link to MotoNovos website.
None of these text messages make it clear that Mr J needed to contact MotoNovo to set up 
a new direct debit. Given this, Im satisfied that Mr J acted reasonably by expecting 
MotoNovo to restart payment collection, and by not contacting them to arrange for this.
MotoNovos case notes also show that Mr J contacted them on 9 November 2020, to let 
them know that his income was still being affected by Covid-19. And he followed this up with 
an email the same day saying, Im willing to go back to my normal payments in December. 
Under the FCA guidance, its clear that MotoNovo shouldve offered Mr J a payment deferral 
extension to cover the payments for October and November 2020. And these payments 
shouldnt have been recorded as arrears on his credit file. But, MotoNovo didnt do this. 
Even though they added the missed payments to the end of the agreement, they still 
reported two months arrears. So MotoNovo need to do something to put things right.
Putting things right
MotoNovo have reported arrears on Mr Js credit file, and this needs to be corrected. Mr J 
has also provided evidence that he was unable to get a mortgage with a 10% deposit due to 
adverse entries on his credit file, and that a 15% deposit would be needed. While I havent 
seen anything to show me that Mr J went ahead with this mortgage, Im satisfied that 
MotoNovo should compensate Mr J for the inconvenience and upset this caused.
So, MotoNovo should:
remove any adverse entries relating to the payments due from July to November 
2020 from Mr Js credit file, and
pay Mr J an additional £200 for the inconvenience and upset the incorrect recording 
of arrears has caused.My final decision
For the reasons explained, I uphold Mr Js complaint and MotoNovo Finance Limited need to 
follow my directions above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2022.
