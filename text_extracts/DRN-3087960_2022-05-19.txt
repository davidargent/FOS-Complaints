The complaint
Mr C and Ms C have complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-sold 
them a packaged bank account, called a Select Platinum account.
NatWest charged Mr C and Ms C a monthly fee for the Select Platinum account and 
provided several potential benefits in return. Mr C and Ms C think that NatWest should 
refund them all the fees they paid, plus interest. 
What happened
Mr C and Ms C have banked with NatWest for a long time. NatWest has sent us 
information about their account history, which shows that:
in 1981, they opened a fee-free account,
in April 2003, NatWest sold them an Advantage Gold account, which replaced 
their fee-free account and for which it charged a monthly fee,
in July 2015, NatWest switched them to the Select Platinum Account and 
continued to charge a monthly fee,
in November 2019, they switched back to a fee-free account.
This account history is not in dispute and I have taken it to be accurate.
When Mr C and Ms C made their original complaint, they said that NatWest had mis-sold 
them the Advantage Gold account as well as the Select Platinum account. NatWest said that 
they had brought this part of their complaint to us too late and it fell outside the time limits 
that determine which complaints we can consider. One of our adjudicators looked into this 
and agreed with NatWest. The adjudicator wrote to Mr C and Ms C accordingly. Mr C and 
Ms C said they were disappointed but accepted the adjudicators findings on this point. In 
this decision, I have not considered the way NatWest sold the Advantage Gold account to Mr 
C and Ms C.
Turning to the Select Platinum account, the adjudicator thought that NatWest had treated Mr 
C and Ms C fairly when it switched them to this account. Mr C and Ms C didnt agree with the 
adjudicators findings about this and asked for an ombudsman to review their case. So, it 
has come to me to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked into everything that Mr C and Ms C and NatWest have told us or sent us about 
the part of their complaint about the Select Platinum account and I have decided not to 
uphold it. Ive explained why below. 
During 2015, NatWest decided to withdraw Advantage Gold accounts from its customers. It 
did this for commercial reasons. It is allowed to make changes like this. However, to treat 
Mr C and Ms C fairly, I would have expected it to tell them what was happening, give them 
fair notice and allow them reasonable choices if they werent happy with its intentions.
NatWest has told us that in 2015 it wrote to all customers about the changes it was 
making and has sent us an example letter from the time.
The letter:
explained that NatWest was moving Mr C and Ms C to the Select Platinum account, 
explained that the Select Platinum and Advantage Gold accounts were similar, 
described the main differences in the benefits the two accounts could provide,
told Mr C and Ms C about the monthly fees for the Select Platinum account. 
The letter also explained to Mr C and Ms C that if they didnt think the Select Platinum 
account was right for them, they could visit one of NatWests branches or ring NatWest 
to discuss other accounts, including some without a monthly fee. 
NatWest does not have a copy of the exact letter it says it sent to Mr C and Ms C. Mr C 
and Ms C have said that they dont remember receiving such a letter and that NatWest 
has  no proof that it sent one. I accept that NatWest does not have definitive proof. 
However, Im confident that it had a reliable mailing system and that it had the correct 
address for Mr C and Ms C. I therefore think its extremely likely that NatWest did send 
such a letter to Mr C and Ms C.
It seems to me that the content of the letter told Mr C and Ms C what was happening, 
gave them fair notice and allowed them reasonable choices. I therefore think NatWest 
treated Mr C and Ms C fairly when it switched them to the Select Platinum account. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have set out above, I am not upholding Mr C and Ms Cs complaint that 
National Westminster Bank Plc mis-sold them a Select Platinum account. I am not going to 
tell it to give them any money back. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C and Ms C to 
accept or reject my decision before 16 June 2022.
