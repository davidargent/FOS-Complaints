K820x#14complaint
Mr L complains  that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal)  settled  a dispute in favour of 
the buyer and refunded £580. 
background
Mr L sold a gift card on an online auction website for £580. The buyer  paid Mr L £580  on 
12 March 2019.  Mr L says he sent the gift card to the buyer on 21 March 2019.  
On 28 March 2019 the buyer raised  a dispute  with PayPal  and said the transaction was 
unauthorised. PayPal  looked at the transaction and on 7 April 2019 told Mr L it had decided 
to refund the buyer.  It then charged Mr L the disputed £580. 
Mr L complained and referred his case to our service. PayPal responded on 26 May 2019 
and advised the gift card Mr L sold wasnt covered by its seller protection and it didnt agree 
to return the funds.
An investigator at our service then looked at the complaint. He agreed PayPals terms meant  
the transaction wasnt covered by its seller protection. He said PayPal had acted  in line with 
its terms and conditions.  The investigator didnt uphold the complaint. Mr L asked to appeal  
so his case has been passed  to me to make a decision. 
 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate Mr L is upset that PayPal refunded the money he received from the buyer. 
However, PayPals terms set out the limits for seller protection. PayPal excludes certain 
items, including gift cards. Section 11.10 gives examples  of items that arent  eligible  for 
seller protection.  It specifically lists Items  equivalent  to cash  (including, without limitation,  
stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid  card).
Im sorry  to disappoint Mr L but the terms here are clear in explaining PayPals seller 
protection doesnt extend to gift cards. PayPal looked at the transaction and took the 
decision to refund the buyer after a dispute was raised. PayPal is entitled to make that 
decision. Whilst I appreciate Mr Ls concerns, I havent found grounds  to uphold his 
complaint or tell PayPal to return the payment. As a result,  Im unable  to uphold this 
complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 August 2019.
