K822xcomplaint
Miss W complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) gave her incorrect  advice 
which meant she missed a loan repayment  and resulted in an overdraft agreement  being 
broken.
background 
Miss W says she spoke  to NatWest in December  2018 about  her loan repayment and was 
told by it to miss a payment and that her account  would  be passed to collections. She says 
NatWest went on to tell her an agreement could then be reached but was later told that 
wasnt the case. Miss W says she made a number of calls to NatWest  about this and was 
given incorrect information  and advice. She says she decided to move her account  which  
took some  time and says this has had an affect  on her credit  file.
Miss W would like NatWest to honour  the reduced  payment  proposal  on the loan and 
reinstate her overdraft  as well as pay compensation.
NatWest agrees that it gave incorrect advice to Miss W and has apologised and paid £75 
compensation. It says it has also agreed  to clear Miss Ws overdraft balance of about  £325 
and has removed adverse data from her credit file.
Miss W brought her complaint to us and our adjudicator thought  NatWest  should pay £150 
compensation which its agreed  to do. The adjudicator accepted that mistakes  had been 
made. But said he couldnt fairly ask NatWest to reinstate an overdraft or agree  a reduced 
payment amount as they were decisions for NatWest to make when exercising its 
commercial judgement.
Miss W doesnt  accept that view and has asked that an ombudsman review  it.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall conclusions  as the adjudicator  for largely the same reasons.
There is no dispute here that NatWest gave Miss W incorrect information that was 
misleading and resulted  in her not making  a required loan repayment. Im satisfied that Miss 
W then spent some considerable  time trying  to sort matters out and in speaking  to various 
NatWest staff members about  what had happened. So I have no doubt Miss W was caused 
distress and inconvenience and that she felt she needed to move her account  to a different 
bank.
I have considered the question of compensation and I agree with the adjudicator that 
NatWest should  pay a further  £100  to make  a total of £175. Im satisfied that award would be 
fair and reasonable and fairly reflects what has taken  place  here and the impact on Miss W. I 
can also see that NatWest has fairly  cleared Miss Ws overdraft of about £325  in addition to 
the compensation already  paid.  And that NatWest has removed the adverse data from Miss 
Ws credit file.
Overall Im satisfied that NatWest has acted fairly here in its offer to put matters  right.  I 
appreciate that Miss W would like NatWest  to go further and reinstate her overdraft and 
Ref: DRN42601602agree a reduction in her repayments.  But as the adjudicator has said I think  these are 
commercial decisions for NatWest to make  when exercising its business  judgement  and not 
matters I can fairly interfere in. I cant see that Miss W has provided up to date information 
about the loan or if she has spoken  to NatWest about her options. But I hope  she considers 
doing so if she is in financial difficulties.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and order National Westminster  Bank  
Plc to pay Miss W a further £100 compensation. Miss Ws acceptance of that award would 
be in full and final settlement  of this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 January 2020.
