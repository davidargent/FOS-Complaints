One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and in his first view he thought that Morses 
should put things right for Ms T in relation to loans 6 to 10. Morses agreed and sent to us, 
and to Ms Ts representative, an outline of what that redress sum would be.
At around the same time that our adjudicator received some additional information from 
Ms T  her bank account statements  it appears that either Ms T or her representative 
agreed to the loan 6 to 10 outcome.
Our adjudicator reviewed the new evidence to see if it made a difference to his opinion on 
loans 1 to 5. He thought that Ms Ts new evidence indicated that she was having trouble 
managing her money around that time and so he wrote again to both complaint parties to 
say that he felt that Morses should put things right for Ms T in relation to loans 4 and 5 
(approved on the same day in August 2016) as well as loans 6 to 10.
Ms Ts representative confirmed that it had agreed with Morses about loans 6 to 10 already 
and would agree about the additional uphold on loans 4 and 5 as well.
Morses disagreed with the additional outcome in relation to loans 4 and 5.
The complaint remained unresolved and was passed to me to decide and I issued a 
provisional decision on 15 December 2021 in which I gave reasons why I did not plan to 
uphold the complaint in relation to loans 4 and 5. 
I gave time for both parties to respond to me. Both Morses and Ms T have replied 
immediately to say that they agree. So, here I have set out my provisional decision findings 
(in smaller type face to differentiate it). 
The provisional decision dated 15 December 2021
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-
term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In practice this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms T could repay the loans 
in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure.
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.
Morses was required to establish whether Ms T could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether 
the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is because 
the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being the ability to repay without 
undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet the repayments.
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower 
will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further in order to do that. 
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context and 
what this all means for Ms Ts complaint.
Loans 4 and 5
Our adjudicator had been sent the additional evidence after sending his first view. These were Ms Ts 
bank statements and he reviewed them and thought that Ms T had at least one other home credit loan 
and another loan as well as the Morses debt. So, he felt that Morses ought to have recognised at that 
point in the lending relationship, Ms T was not managing her money and so Morses ought not to have 
approved her applications for loans 4 and 5.
I do not agree. My initial point is that I do not think that a full financial review would have been a 
proportionate check for Morses to have caried out for the August 2016 loan applications. And my 
second point is that I have had the benefit of being able to review the July 2016 bank statements 
leading up to August 2016  the month in which Loans 4 and 5 were approved  to discover what a 
full financial review may have revealed even if Morses had carried one out. And having looked 
carefully at all of Ms Ts income and outgoings for July 2016 then Ive arrived at a different view.
I have seen that Ms T received around £1,187 income. I have seen that she was paying every two 
weeks to an estate agency business, likely her rental payments. That amounted to £416 every 
4 weeks.Added to which I have seen that Ms T had several regular outgoings such as TV licence, phone costs, 
utility bills and council tax and one insurance. These added up to around £147 for that July 2016 
month. I have seen from the transactions on her statements that she withdrew cash and spent money 
on food which, combined, came to around £256. And although I have seen some payments going to 
another home credit provider of £24.50 a week, I cannot see any other payments for other loans.
I have a copy of Ms Ts credit file and having reviewed it Ms T did not have any other loans open in or 
around July/August 2016 other than the second home credit loan to which I have referred already.
So, my conclusion after subtracting all her outgoings for July 2016 from her income, is that Ms T had 
around £190 left over, even after repaying the existing Morses loans and the other home credit 
provider payments.
So, even if I did think that a full financial review was required to have been undertaken by Morses still 
I do not consider it was irresponsible to approve loans 4 and 5. I am planning not to uphold Ms Ts 
complaint about loans 4 and 5.
Loans 6 to 10
In relation to loans 6 to 10, my understanding is that these have been agreed and Morses has paid to 
Ms T or her representative the agreed redress sums.
Considering the finality of that resolution relating to those loans I have not considered them at all. And 
I see no need to include in this decision the usual redress section for the calculations of the money 
due on loans 6 to 10 as they have been paid over.
For completeness, I endorse the adjudicators view in relation to loans 6 to 10 but as these have been 
resolved already I say no more about them.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I repeat all of my provisional decision and my findings here. Both parties have agreed to the 
outcome and so I see no reason to delay issuing this final decision and theres no reason to 
depart from those provisional findings.  
Putting things right
As loans 6 to 10 have been resolved and the monies due to Ms T paid over then there is 
nothing else for me to say here.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I endorse the resolution for loans 6 to 10.  Morses Club PLC is 
directed to carry out the agreed resolution actions if its not already done so. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms T to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 January 2022.
