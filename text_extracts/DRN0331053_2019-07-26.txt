K820x#14complaint
Mr C says Financial  Insurance  Company Limited (FICL) mis-sold him a payment protection 
insurance (PPI)  policy.  
background
Mr C bought the policy in 1996 at the same  time as taking out a credit card in store. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr C disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Cs case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Cs complaint because:
 Mr C ticked  and initialled on the credit  agreement to indicate  he wanted the PPI, 
separate to where he signed  for the credit card. So I think  FICL made Mr C aware  that 
he had a choice  about buying the PPI, and that he chose to take it. 
 FICL  didnt recommend the PPI to Mr C so it didnt have to check if it was right for him. 
 Its possible the information FICL gave Mr C about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Mr C doesnt appear  to have been affected by any of the main 
things the policy  didnt cover  and based on what I know about  his circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been  useful to him. So I dont think  better  information  
wouldve stopped  him buying it. 
Ive taken into account Mr Cs comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 August 2019.
