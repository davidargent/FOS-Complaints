K820x#14complaint
Mr Ls unhappy with the service  he received  from Barclays Bank UK PLC.
background
Mr L says he visited  a branch of Barclays in November 2018 to make an appointment. He 
says he was approached by the branch manager in a rude and menacing way. He says he 
was made  to feel as though his custom wasnt wanted and felt embarrassed by the way he 
was treated in front of other Barclays customers.
Mr L would  like compensation for trouble  and upset along with a personal apology  from the 
branch manager.
Our investigator didnt  uphold Mr Ls complaint.  He disagrees so his complaint has been 
passed to me to look at everything  afresh.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I dont uphold  it.
I know Mr L feels very strongly about the way he was treated by the branch manager.  But 
the branch manager denies  being  rude to Mr L, and says that it was Mr L who was getting 
annoyed with, and swearing at, her.
With two conflicting  accounts, and without  anything more, I cant say on the balance of 
probabilities that the branch manager  was rude, or acted  in a menacing  way towards Mr L.
I note Barclays has said that if any actions of the branch manager caused Mr L to be upset 
in any way, it apologises. I think thats  reasonable and Im not going to ask it to do anything 
more. 
my final decision
I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 March 2019.
