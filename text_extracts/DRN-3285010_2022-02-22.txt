The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt offer support during the Covid-19 
pandemic. He says it wasted time he could have spent earning income and the experience 
was stressful and detrimental to his health. He asks for written apologies, a financial gesture 
of goodwill and a loan. 
What happened
Mr D spoke to NatWest in May 2021. Hed received an email from NatWest saying he should 
contact it for options to reduce his overdraft. Mr D also wanted to reduce his credit card debt. 
NatWest declined Mr Ds application for a personal loan. It also declined his request for 
further borrowing of £50,000 to consolidate his unsecured debts onto his mortgage. This was 
because Mr D had applied for a grant under the UK Governments Self-Employment Income 
Support Scheme (SEISS) after mid-July 2020. 
Mr D says his complaint is that:
a) the information he was given by NatWest was contrary to Government policy regarding 
the SEISS grant.
b) his time was wasted by being told to contact NatWest for options, when no options 
actually existed.
Mr D also said, regardless of (a) above, an automatic rejection of help due to Government 
help being requested 10 months previously was unfair. He said surely the only people 
applying for any type of credit/loan/help would be those who are adversely financially 
affected.
Our investigator said that NatWests policy at that time was not to offer further lending to 
customers that had applied for a SEISS grant. While NatWest referred to customers making 
a declaration about their income being affected, it wasnt reasonable to say this was 
incorrect.
Our investigator said it must have been frustrating for Mr D to receive invites to contact 
NatWest. However these were standard messages to let customers know that NatWest 
could appraise their individual circumstances. The investigator said he didnt think NatWest 
needed to take further action.
Mr D didnt agree. He said whether NatWest was right to decline to lend is irrelevant to his 
complaint. He said a large part of his complaint is that NatWest read a statement over the 
phone and sent letters that were factually inaccurate. He says NatWest wrongly said that to 
receive the SEISS grant he had to declare that his income was adversely affected. In fact, 
he only had to declare that his business was adversely affected. This could, for instance, be 
due to the cost of buying masks or cleaning materials. 
Mr D said the other part of his complaint is that it was wrong for NatWest to send several 
communications telling him to phone for assistance when there was no further assistance it 
could offer.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr D asked NatWest for a loan, which was declined, and then for additional mortgage 
borrowing of £50,000 in May 2021. The call handler asked if hed received a SEISS grant 
after 14 July 2020, which he said he had. 
NatWests policy at that time was not to allow applications from customers that had applied 
for a SEISS grant after 14 July 2020. Mr D says his complaint isnt about the loan being 
declined. However, when Mr D brought the complaint to us, he said hed like the loan to be 
provided as part of the resolution of his complaint. So I need to address this point at least 
briefly. I think NatWest applied its policy correctly when it told Mr D he couldnt apply for 
further borrowing. I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to provide a loan. 
NatWest told Mr D his application was declined because he must have made a declaration 
that his business income had been adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. It said 
because of this it couldnt use that income to support a mortgage application. Mr D says this 
was factually incorrect and misrepresented the SEISS scheme. Mr D says the SEISS grant 
he applied for only required him to declare his business was adversely affected. He says this 
could include having to buy masks or additional cleaning supplies. 
I understand the point Mr D makes. The first SEISS grants were available to applicants that 
carried on a trade that was adversely affected. Later SEISS grants had different 
requirements. NatWests policy was not to allow customers to apply for further borrowing if 
theyd received a grant after mid-July 2020. Its likely NatWest wanted to be able to tell 
customers this without asking them too many questions about when they applied for the 
grant or what declarations they made. 
Im sorry Mr D found the lack of accuracy upsetting. But I dont think this affected the 
substance of the message  that, because hed applied for a SEISS grant after mid-July 
2020, he wasnt able to make an application for further borrowing.
Mr D also questions whether the policy was fair, as he says surely the only people applying 
for any type of credit/loan/help would be those who are adversely financially affected. I dont 
think thats necessarily the case. Customers apply for further borrowing for a variety of 
reasons, such as home improvements. But regardless of the reason for the borrowing, 
NatWest has to check the borrowing is affordable for the customer and within its own lending 
guidelines.
NatWest contacted Mr D about his overdraft. It said hed paid charges, which might be 
avoidable. It asked him to call to explore options and decide which is the best course of 
action. NatWests final response letter gave contact details for its debt management team. 
From what Mr D said, he received other communications suggesting he contact NatWest so 
it could look into options to assist him. 
Mr D was incurring charges due to his overdraft. He says payments towards his credit card 
debts were causing the overdraft. He applied for a £50,000 loan to consolidate unsecured 
debts. I appreciate that Mr Ds circumstances were difficult and it must have been 
disappointing to find that NatWest couldnt offer him options he found helpful. Mr D has 
made it clear that he isnt complaining about not being given financial assistance. His 
complaint is that he contacted NatWest, as it suggested, to discuss what options might be available, and he says his time was wasted and the experience was stressful.
Im sorry Mr D found his contact with NatWest stressful and feels his time was wasted. But I 
dont think it was unfair for NatWest to send letters or emails to him asking him to contact it 
to discuss his options. NatWest couldnt assess what support it might offer until it discussed 
Mr Ds circumstances with him.
I dont think NatWest treated Mr D unfairly. And I dont think its fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances to require it to pay compensation or take any further steps in relation to this 
complaint.
Mr D was unhappy with the way NatWest dealt with his complaint. He says it repeated the 
inaccuracy about the SEISS grant. And it didnt respond to his specific complaint points. 
Complaint handling isnt itself a regulated activity, which means this isnt something I can 
look into further here.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 March 2022.
