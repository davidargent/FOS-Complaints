K820x#14complaint
Mr L acquired a new car in September 2016,  by means of a two year hire agreement  with 
LeasePlan UK Limited (LeasePlan). He returned the car at the end of the agreement and 
LeasePlan invoiced him for damage  to the car.
Mr L complains  that he shouldnt have to pay anything because in his view the damage is 
within what LeasePlan should  (under  its own guidelines) accept as being normal  wear  and 
tear.
Where I refer to LeasePlan, this includes its agents.
background
LeasePlan initially identified (on collection of the car) £745  of damage.  However it only 
invoiced Mr L for £509 of this sum.  It then agreed  to reduce this sum by a further £293 
leaving a balance payable  by Mr L of £216. The £216 was in respect  of scratches to the 
bonnet (£143) and stains to a seat (£73).
This complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that LeasePlan 
was, in all the circumstances,  entitled to charge Mr L the sum of £216  that it did.
Mr L didnt agree and so his complaint has been  passed to me for review  and decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I can confirm that Ive 
come to the same overall outcome as the investigator, for broadly the same reasons.  There 
is also very little I can usefully add to what has already been said.
I would also point out that where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory,  I 
make my decision  on the balance of probabilities   that is, what  I consider  is most likely to 
have happened  given the evidence that is available and the wider surrounding 
circumstances. 
Its not unusual  for a finance provider like LeasePlan to check at the end of an agreement 
that the consumer  took reasonable care of the car. And the hire agreement  makes provision 
for LeasePlan to be able to charge for damage that is deemed  beyond fair wear  and tear.
The trade body  that oversees the car rental and leasing  sector  has issued  guidance which 
outlines what is considered to be fair wear and tear and what is chargeable damage. In 
looking at this type of complaint and deciding whether  LeasePlan has acted reasonably,  I 
take account of this guidance as I think its a good indicator of what  damage is fair for a 
business to charge for. 
However, where a business car return guidance  (in this case  LeasePlans) is more  
generous than the industry guidance,  I take account  of the former rather than the latter.
Mr L was charged £143 for scratches  to the bonnet.
Ref: DRN26009002The industry guidance states that in respect  of paintwork, body, bumpers and trim 
Scratches and abrasions up to 25mm are acceptable, relative to the vehicles age and 
mileage, and provided the primer or bare metal  is not showing.
LeasePlans guidance states in respect  of vehicle body and paint any chips, scratches and 
abrasions, not possible to be removed via mechanical polishing  are not acceptable.
Having regard to the photograph  provided  by LeasePlan Im satisfied that the damage to the 
bonnet has left primer or bare metal  showing. I also find LeasePlans submission that the 
damage couldnt be polished out to be both plausible  and persuasive. 
So having  thought about all the circumstances here, Im satisfied that what LeasePlan 
charged for this damage, being £143, was reasonable.
Mr L was charged £73 for staining to a seat.
The industry guidance states that in respect  of seats  headrests and trim The interior 
upholstery and trim must be clean and odourless  with no burns, scratches, tears,  dents or 
staining.
LeasePlans guidance states in respect  of interiors soiling and stains on seats, interior 
lining, floor mats or carpets,  which cannot be removed via general cleaning,  but require 
specialist cleaning  are not acceptable. 
Having regard to the photograph  provided  by LeasePlan Im satisfied that the seat was 
stained. I also find LeasePlans  submission  that the stain could only be removed by 
specialist cleaning to be both plausible and persuasive. 
So having  thought about all the circumstances here, Im satisfied that what LeasePlan 
charged for this damage, being £73, was reasonable.
I appreciate that Mr L feels the charges are excessive and that in his view the car could have 
been repaired for a lessor  sum or indeed at no cost at all. But it was open to Mr L to have 
any damage repaired himself before the car was inspected. LeasePlan are entitled  to charge 
for damage  which goes  beyond fair wear and tear and the fact that repairs  can be carried  out 
more cheaply  elsewhere doesnt mean  that LeasePlans  charges are unreasonable. 
Similarly, theres no obligation on LeasePlan to carry out the repairs. If the repairs arent 
carried out this is reflected  in the reduction of the cars value when it comes to be sold at 
auction, for which LeasePlan should be compensated.  
For the reasons  Ive explained Im satisfied  that the end of agreement  charges of £216  are 
fair and I wont be asking LeasePlan to waive them.
Ref: DRN26009003my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 May 2019.
