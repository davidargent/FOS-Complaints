The complaint
Mrs M complains that MBNA Limited (MBNA) lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
In June 2015, Mrs M applied for a credit card with MBNA on a balance transfer offer. This 
was agreed with a limit of £4200. There were two limit increases and several declined 
requests as follows:
Date Limit
June 2015 £4200 (approved)
February 2016 £6000 (approved)
May 2016 £9000 (declined)
May 2016 £7500 (declined)
May 2016 £7000 (declined)
May 2016 £6100 (declined)
May 2016 £6500 (declined)
January 2017 £6500 (approved)
January 2017 £8500 (declined)
January 2017 £7000 (declined)
Mrs M complained that she shouldnt have been given the card in the first place as she had 
several other large debts. And, the increases shouldnt have been agreed either. When she 
took the card in 2015, her total debts were the same as her annual income. She only ever 
paid the minimum monthly instalments. As a result, shes now struggling with a mountain of 
debt amounting to over £29,000  which she is struggling to repay. She went on maternity 
leave in November 2015  on a reduced income, and then had to take a lower paid job late 
in 2016. 
MBNA said Mrs M passed their credit checks in 2015  when the card was first issued. 
Overall, Mrs M applied for seven increases in limit which were declined. But theyd agreed a 
modest increase from £6000 to £6500 in January 2017  which also passed their checks.
Mrs M brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said MBNA had acted fairly. In June 
2015, Mrs M said her income was gross £28000 and household income was £70000 per 
annum. Total other debts were £12268. So, the first limit of £4200 was OK. Looking at the 
increase to £6000 in February 2016, the previous limit had not been used fully, all payments 
had been made and there werent any over limit situations or cash withdrawals  all signs of 
potential problems. Mrs M hadnt told MBNA about her reduced income. He could see that 
MBNAs credit checks were passed. More than the minimum payment had been made in 
several months prior to 2017  so MBNA wouldnt have seen a problem.
Mrs M asked that an ombudsman looks at her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
By February 2017, Mrs M told us that she had total debts of more than £29000  and her 
income had dropped to a net £1100 per month  as shed been on maternity leave and then 
had to change jobs - so by then, she was clearly in financial difficulty. But  the crux of her 
complaint is about whether MBNA shouldve given her the card in June 2015 (limit £4200), 
then increased the limit to £6000 in February 2016, and to £6500 in January 2017. Those 
were the main events here which I will consider.
All lenders have an obligation to lend money responsibly. We have to check whether MBNA 
acted in line within the Financial Conducts (FCA) rules on creditworthiness assessment as 
set out in its handbook, (CONC) section 5.2. These say that a firm must undertake a 
reasonable assessment of creditworthiness, considering both the risk to it of the customer 
not making the repayments, as well as the risk to the customer of not being able to make 
repayments. We look at:
Whether the lender completed reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that the borrower would be able to repay any credit in a sustainable way?
If reasonable and proportionate checks were completed, did the lender make a fair 
lending decision made bearing in mind the information gathered and what the lender 
knew about the borrowers circumstances?
I agree that MBNA carried out the necessary checks in June 2015  weve seen these. Mrs 
M stated her income was gross £28,000 and total household income was £70,000. There 
werent any children or mortgage. There were other debts showing of £12268  but 
payments on these were all being met. There werent any defaults showing on her credit file. 
And so, based on that information, I cant say MBNA were wrong in giving her the card. 
By the increase to £6000 in February 2016, other debts were £14992, and her income and 
circumstances were  as far as MBNA were concerned  unchanged. The previous limit of 
£4200 hadnt been used fully  and apart from the balance transfer of £2100, there were 
only 16 retail purchases in the six months since the card was issued. The balance as at 
January 2016 was only £2451. There hadnt been any cash withdrawals of over limit 
situations. So, there werent any signs of problems.
The final increase  to £6500 in January 2017 was only a small one. Mrs Ms other debts 
had, by this time, increased a lot  to over £29000. But, the increase with MBNA was small 
(£500), and I dont think this is material in the context of Mrs Ms complaint. Ive also seen 
that Mrs M was paying more than the minimum amount needed in most months in 2016  
sometimes twice what was needed. So  I dont think MBNA couldve been expected to see 
warning signs. It looks like Mrs M borrowed a lot more money from other lenders over 2016, 
as her total debts increased by about £14000. So  thats when her problems seem to have 
got worse. And  during this time, her debt with MBNA wasnt changed  as theyd declined 
to increase her limits.
Mrs M told us that her circumstances changed in late 2015  as she gave birth to a son and 
went on a years maternity leave. When she returned to work, it was in a lower paid job  but 
I cant see that she advised MBNA of this. So, they couldnt be expected to do anything 
about that. 
I also see that MBNA declined to increased Mrs Ms limit on seven occasions  when she 
requested to borrow more money. This tends to show that they were acting responsibly. Also  Mrs M was asking for the increases in her limits as opposed to MBNA offering to lend her 
more money - so its only fair that she should also bear some responsibility for her debts.
I can see that Mrs M now has a lot of debt, which is going to be difficult to repay in a short 
period of time and based on what shes told us about her circumstances. I sympathise with 
the situation shes now in. But, based on what Ive seen, I dont think MBNA acted 
irresponsibly, and I wont be asking them to do anymore here.
 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2021.
