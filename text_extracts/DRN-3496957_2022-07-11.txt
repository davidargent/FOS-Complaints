The complaint
Mr S complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mr Ss representative says that Mr S and his wife entered into a trial membership agreement 
in May 2007 with a holiday company and then entered into acquisition agreements in 
November 2007 and May and June 2008 to buy some holiday club membership points from 
that holiday company. Mr S also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance in June 2018 for a loan of Â£17,334. Mr S says that the loan was settled in 
April 2013. A claim was made to Barclays Partner Finance in February 2020 that the 
membership had been misrepresented to Mr S and his wife and that the holiday companys 
sales practices made the loan agreement unfair. The claims were made under sections 75 
and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act.
A complaint was then made to this service in April 2020. Our investigator didnt recommend 
that Mr Ss complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that Mr S was entitled to more than 
six years to make those claims so there was no reason to now ask Barclays Partner Finance 
to do anything to put things right. Mr Ss representative, on his behalf, says that it doesnt 
agree with our investigators recommendation so has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ss complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance didnt uphold his Consumer Credit 
Act claims and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether or not his claims are time-barred 
under the Limitation Act 1980;
Mr Ss claims are under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  in this 
decision Im not determining the outcome of those claims as only a court would be 
able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ss claim under section 75 is that the holiday club membership was 
misrepresented to him and his wife and that they wouldnt have entered into the 
acquisition agreement in June 2008 if it hadnt been misrepresented to them - and if 
the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would be 
expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr S could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into entering into the acquisition soon after they did so in June 2008 as that was 
when they entered into an agreement based on the alleged misrepresentations of the 
holiday company and Mr S suffered a loss as he entered into the loan agreement 
with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the membership;
I consider that Mr Ss cause of action accrued at about that time, so he would have 
had six years from then to bring a claim against either the holiday company or 
Barclays Partner Finance  but his claim wasnt made to Barclays Partner Finance 
until February 2020, more than eleven years later which was outside of the time limits 
set out in the Limitation Act and I consider that his claim is time-barred;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Mr S says that he settled the loan in April 2013 - so I consider that he would have 
needed to have made a claim against Barclays Partner Finance within six years of 
April 2013  but his claim wasnt made to it until February 2020, more than six years 
later, which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act and I consider 
that his claim is time-barred;
Ive not seen any evidence to show that Barclays Partner Finance properly 
responded to Mr Ss claims so I cant say that it acted fairly and reasonably in 
response to those claims  but if it had properly considered his claims I consider it to 
be likely that it would have said that they were time-barred under the Limitation Act; 
and
I sympathise with Mr S for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership and the difficulties that hes described but I consider that his claims 
under sections 75 and 140A are time-barred so I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to 
refund to him any of the money that he paid under the loan agreement, to pay him 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 August 2022.
