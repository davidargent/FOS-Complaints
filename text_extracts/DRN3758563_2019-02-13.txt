K820x#14complaint
Mr S is unhappy about the way National Westminster Bank Plc handled a current  account 
switch.
background
Mr S says he was encouraged to switch all his current account payments from another bank 
to a new NatWest account. He was told by NatWest this would be an easy process  and all 
his continuous  payments  with the other bank would be transferred to his new account using 
the switch process.  He was subsequently  told hed missed a payment on his NatWest credit 
card and fees were  added to his account.  He says NatWest accepts he hasnt done anything  
wrong. The problem  was that the direct debit  paying  off this NatWest  credit card every  month  
wasnt included in the list NatWest got from the other bank  and so wasnt  transferred across  
to the new account.  And he was assured NatWest would take care of everything to do with 
the switch and that shouldve included setting up a direct debit for the new credit card he 
was given. He wants NatWest to reimburse  him for the fees,  charges  and interest hes paid 
and compensation  for his trouble. He also wants confirmation his credit record hasnt been  
affected.
NatWest said in its final response that as there  was no direct debit to a credit card on the list 
it was provided with by the other  bank  it had no knowledge of this direct debit. Although  it 
appreciates what has happened is frustrating for Mr S theres  been  no error by NatWest. 
Our investigator felt this complaint  shouldnt be upheld.  She said:
A direct debit for the existing NatWest credit card wasnt on the list of payments 
provided by the other bank. And it shouldnt have been included  as it was in fact from 
an existing NatWest  account not made from the other bank. Only direct debits being  
paid from the other bank wouldve  been  switched.  
Although Mr S thinks NatWest shouldve  automatically switched over his existing  
direct debit  payment  this isnt something  it would do. The agreement  to pay the new 
NatWest credit card would be considered a new direct debit. And Mr S ought to have 
instructed NatWest to make the new payments. NatWest didnt say in the switch  
documents Mr S signed that it would set up new direct debits nor did Mr S instruct  it 
to do so. 
In addition the first statement for the new credit  card said the minimum payment 
needed to be paid and it wasnt clear that a direct  debit was set up. The second 
statement also said the payment for the previous month hadnt been paid. This was 
all confirmed by text and a letter. And its reasonable for Mr S to have  noticed  a 
payment hadnt  left his current account for the new card.  
NatWest hasnt acted  unfairly in not setting up a direct debit for the new credit  card,  
And she cant ask it to refund any interest  or charges or pay Mr S compensation.
Mr S doesnt  agree  and has asked for an ombudsman  review. He says the new credit card 
was something that was required for the new account. It was as much a part of the switch  as 
direct debits from the other bank. He was assured NatWest would take care of everything. 
And he was entitled  to rely on what NatWest said.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN37585632Mr G has provided  detailed  submissions  to support his complaint.  Ive read and considered 
them all. But my findings are expressed in considerably less detail. And they focus on what  I 
think are the main issues.
I agree  with the investigators conclusions for the same reasons.
The list of direct debits  paid out of Mr S account with the other bank didnt include one to 
pay off his existing  NatWest credit card because this payment didnt come out of the account 
with this other bank.  So, there was payment for NatWest  to switch over.
The new account  Mr S opened came  with a new credit card.  This clearly required a new 
direct debit to be set up to pay it off each month.
I accept Mr S was told by NatWest that it would take care of everything.  But that related to 
the switch process  and didnt include setting up any new direct debits.
It may well be that NatWest couldve done more to alert Mr S to the need to set up a new 
direct debit for his new credit card. But whatever  was said I think Mr S should reasonably 
have seen very quickly that a direct debit wasnt set up to pay it. 
The first statement he received for the new credit card asked for the minimum payment to be 
made by a set date and there  was no mention of this being paid by a direct debit. The 
second statement  also said the first months  payment hadnt been made. NatWest also sent 
a text and letter about this. Furthermore  if Mr S had been monitoring his bank statements he 
wouldve seen no payment was being made  from his account  for this credit card. 
Taking everything into account  I agree  with the investigator that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable to require  NatWest to refund any charges or interest Mr S has paid or to require 
it to pay him any compensation. 
But I note NatWest says it hasnt entered any adverse information about  all this on his credit 
file.
Overall, I dont  see any compelling reason to change the proposed outcome in this case.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 March  2019.
