The complaint
Mr M complains that NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibly when it approved two branded credit 
cards and went on to increase the credit limits. 
What happened
Mr M opened an Aqua credit card with NewDay in April 2018. In June 2019 Mr M 
successfully applied for a Debenhams credit card with NewDay. In his application, Mr M said 
he earned £40,000. NewDay recorded that Mr M had a net monthly income of £2,531 and 
other household income of £2,531. NewDay carried out a credit search and found Mr M 
owed £18,600 in unsecured credit as well as a mortgage. The application was approved with 
a £1,750 credit limit. 
Six months later, in January 2020, Mr M applied for a third credit card with NewDay  a Fluid 
card. In this application, Mr M gave an income of £40,500 and his partners income of £9,000 
was also recorded. A credit check found Mr M had £29,700 of unsecured credit as well as 
his mortgage. A credit limit of £900 was approved. 
In September 2020 NewDay increased the Fluid credit limit by £1,000 taking it to £1,900. In 
October 2020 NewDay increased the Debenhams credit lmit by £1,500 to £3,250. 
Last year, Mr M complained that NewDay had lent irresponsibly but it didnt agree. Mr M 
referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They said 
NewDay had lent irresponsibly and asked it to refund all interest and charges applied to Mr 
Ms credit cards. NewDay didnt agree so Mr Ms complaint has been passed to me to make 
a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say NewDay had to complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Mr M could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable way. 
These affordability checks needed to be focused on the borrowers circumstances. The 
nature of whats considered reasonable and proportionate will vary depending on various 
factors like: 
- The amount of credit;
- The total sum repayable and the size of regular repayments;
- The duration of the agreement;
- The costs of the credit; and 
- The consumers individual circumstances. 
That means theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. But lenders are required to 
consider the above points when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate. 
I think its fair to note that whilst this complaint isnt about Mr Ms Aqua card, he was an 
existing customer of NewDay when he applied for the Debenhams card in June 2019. Mr M 
had successfully applied for the Aqua card just over a year earlier and a credit search was 
completed as part of that application. NewDay has provided evidence to show it found Mr M 
had around £9,400 of unsecured credit and a mortgage of around £119,000. Whilst the Aqua 
application doesnt form part of this complaint, Im satisfied NewDay had already completed 
an assessment of Mr Ms circumstances when he applied for a second credit card and was 
aware of how much he owed at that time. 
I think Mr Ms Debenhams application shouldve caused NewDay to consider carrying out 
more comprehensive checks. When the application was processed, NewDay found Mr M 
owed £18,600 in unsecured credit and around £141,000 via a mortgage. Thats an 
unsecured credit increase of just under £9,000 and a mortgage increase of around £20,000. 
Im satisfied NewDay was aware of Mr Ms previous borrowing and shouldve seen a clear 
increase in the amount he owed. 
I also think its fair to note that NewDays application information doesnt appear to be 
reliable. I can see NewDay recorded Mr Ms monthly income as £2,531 but used the same 
for his partner. If that was input by Mr M, I think NewDay shouldve checked whether it was 
correct. In addition, I if NewDays lending decision was made on the basis of someone elses 
income, I think it shouldve carried out better checks to ensure the repayments would be 
sustainable for Mr M in the long term. 
In much the same way, when Mr M applied for the Fluid credit card his outstanding 
unsecured credit figure had gone up to £29,700, an increase of around £11,000 in about six 
months. By this time, Mr M had been a customer of NewDay for several years and a clear 
picture of increasing unsecured debt had arisen. I further note the other household income 
figure NewDay used was given as £9,000. Given the difference between the household 
income figures provided between the Debenhams and Fluid applications, I think NewDay 
ought to have asked further questions. In my view, Newday lent irresponsibly when it 
approved the Fluid credit card. 
The Debenhams credit limit went up to £3,250 in October 2020. Thats a substantial increase 
from the original credit limit. The Fluid credit limit went up to £1,900 a month later.  
NewDays risk data shows it found Mr M owed over £32,000 at this time, a further increase 
in his unsecured credit. Again, I think the level of unsecured debt shouldve caused NewDay 
to carry out more comprehensive checks before deciding whether to proceed. 
Had NewDay carried out better checks, I think it wouldve found Mr M was unable to 
sustainably manage further borrowing and declined both credit card applications. In my view, 
there were clear signs during both applications that Mr M was struggling and that his 
borrowing position was becoming unsustainable. Having considered all the available 
information, Im satisfied NewDay lent irresponsibly and am upholding Mr Ms complaint.  
It wouldnt be fair for NewDay to record adverse information on Mr Ms credit file relating to 
credit cards that were lent irresponsibly. So Im also telling NewDay to amend Mr Ms credit 
file to remove all adverse information recorded about these credit cards. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to settle as follows: 
- Refund all interest and charges applied to both the Debenhams and Fluid credit 
cards from inception to the date of settlement- If, after calculating the refund, there remains an outstanding balance NewDay should 
ensure it isnt subject to any future charges or interest going forward
- If the refund leaves a credit balance it should be refunded to Mr M adding 8% simple 
interest
- Remove and cease recording all adverse information about both accounts from 
Mr Ms credit file
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2022.
