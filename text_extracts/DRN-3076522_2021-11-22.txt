The complaint
Ms V complains that NewDay Ltd acted irresponsibly by granting her a credit card. She says 
the lending was unaffordable for her.
What happened
In 2015, NewDay granted Ms V a credit card after shed applied for one online. Ms V later 
complained that NewDay shouldnt have given her the credit card. She said, at the time, her 
credit rating was low, and she was suffering with her mental health. She was working part-
time with a small income and receiving benefits. Ms V said she was unable to keep up with 
her repayments, she fell into default and NewDay continued to add high interest and fees. 
The fear of not paying and constant contact from NewDay caused further problems with her 
mental health.
NewDay said it had considered the information Ms V had supplied on her application and the 
information held at credit reference agencies. Ms V had met its acceptance criteria and been 
granted a card with a credit limit of £450, which had not increased. It said it hadnt previously 
been aware of Ms Vs mental health issues or financial circumstances. If she had contacted 
it, NewDay would have assisted her with finding an affordable repayment plan. 
NewDay said all fees and charges had been applied in line with the terms and conditions of 
Ms Vs credit agreement. As payments werent received in line with the terms and 
conditions, the account was sold on to a third party in July 2017.
Ms V remained unhappy, so she brought her complaint to our service. Our investigator 
looked into Ms Vs concerns but didnt think her complaint should be upheld. She was 
satisfied NewDay had completed reasonable and proportionate checks, which suggested the 
repayments were affordable. 
She was also satisfied that NewDay had fairly applied interest and charges in line with the 
terms of Ms Vs credit agreement. She said there was nothing to show that NewDay had 
harassed Ms V or was aware of her financial difficulties.
Ms V disagreed with our investigators view. She said she didnt think it was fair or 
reasonable for NewDay to have lent to her when she clearly had £10,600 of outstanding 
debt with further unsecured debt of £3,600 and a £2,000 overdraft. She said it was clear 
from the £10,600 defaulted debt that she was having financial difficulties. So, the complaint 
has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Ms Vs complaint. Ill explain why.
The relevant rules, regulations and guidance required NewDay to carry out reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Ms V would be able to afford to make her credit card 
repayments in a sustainable manner.
 
The checks needed to be borrower-focused. It wasnt enough for NewDay to think only about 
the likelihood of getting its money back. It also had to ensure that she was in a position to 
repay what she borrowed in a reasonable period of time, without undue difficulty (for 
example by getting into further debt).
There isnt a set list of checks that lenders need to carry out, but they should be 
proportionate, taking a number of factors into consideration. These factors include the 
amount, type and cost of the credit as well as the personal circumstances of the consumer.
NewDay says it reviewed the information provided by credit reference agencies, as well as 
from Ms V, before approving her credit card application.
When Ms V applied for the credit card, she was asked some questions about her 
relationship status, residential status and employment. According to NewDays records,     
Ms V said she was single and a council tenant. Her employment status was contractor / 
part-time. Ms Vs gross income is showing as £24,000, with a total unsecured debt of 
£3,600.
I appreciate Ms V feels that NewDay should have done more to check the lending was 
affordable for her. But, given the credit limit was only £450, I think the checks NewDay 
carried out were proportionate and they suggested that the lending was affordable for Ms V.
Ms V feels strongly that NewDay shouldnt have granted her the credit card because she 
also had defaulted debt of £10,600. I can see that NewDay was aware of this, but the 
information it gathered showed the most recent default had occurred 26 months before. So, I 
dont think this is enough to say that NewDay should have been aware that Ms V might have 
been experiencing financial difficulty.
Ms V has commented that the interest rate on the card was extremely high. But I can see it 
is showing on the credit agreement. So, Im satisfied NewDay gave Ms V clear information 
about this when she took out the credit card. 
I dont doubt it was distressing for Ms V to be pursued by NewDay when she found she was 
unable to make her repayments. But NewDay says Ms V didnt make it aware of her financial 
circumstances or mental health issues at the time. Ms V disputes this, but NewDay has sent 
us a copy of the contact notes for the account. On two occasions its noted that Ms V was 
late with her repayments because she didnt receive her statements. But I cant see any 
reference to financial difficulties or her mental health. I also havent seen any evidence that 
the fees and charges NewDay applied to the account werent in line with those set out in the 
credit agreements terms and conditions. So, I cant say NewDay has acted unfairly.
I appreciate my answer will be disappointing for Ms V. But I hope shell understand the 
reasons for my decision and shell at least feel her concerns have been listened to. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Ms Vs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms V to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 December 2021.
