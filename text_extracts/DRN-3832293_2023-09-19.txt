The complaint
Mr and Mrs H complain that Vacation Finance Limited, trading as VFL Finance Solutions, 
wont refund to them the money that they paid to acquire a vacation week from a holiday 
company. Theyre being represented in their complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs H have had holiday products from a holiday company since 2010. They entered 
into a membership application agreement with the holiday company in August 2017 to 
acquire another vacation week. The membership application fee was £20,000. They paid 
£6,000 of that fee by bank transfer and they entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Vacation Finance for a loan of £14,000. They agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of 
£187.55 to Vacation Finance. They relinquished their occupancy rights for the additional 
vacation week for 2018 and 2019 for a relinquishment amount of £5,000 (which was 
reflected in the purchase price shown on the membership application agreement).
Mr and Mrs Hs representative made claims, on Mr and Mrs Hs behalf, to Vacation Finance 
under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in July 2020. It said that: the 
product was mis-sold and misrepresented to Mr and Mrs H; the contract between them and 
the holiday company was breached; commission was paid between Vacation Finance and 
the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr and Mrs H which created a breach of 
fiduciary duty and an unfair relationship; and the loan agreement was unaffordable. 
Vacation Finance didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so Mr and Mrs H 
complained to this service. Their complaint form says that: the holiday company and 
Vacation Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan; 
Vacation Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to them 
and the holiday company unduly pressured them into entering into the membership 
application agreement and the loan agreement; all rendering the loan agreement unfair 
pursuant to section 140A. 
Vacation Finance then provided this service with a detailed explanation as to why it didnt 
consider that Mr and Mrs Hs claims should be upheld. It said that a final response hadnt 
been provided in response to those claims because it had requested further information from 
their representative but never received a reply.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Hs complaint should be upheld. She 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation that played an important part in their 
decision to purchase the product. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the 
relationship between Mr and Mrs H and Vacation Finance was unfair and she wasnt 
persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She said 
that Mr and Mrs H still had the option to use the product and she hadnt seen anything to 
suggest that the contract was breached in any way. She also said that she hadnt seen 
anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs H. 
Mr and Mrs Hs representative, on behalf of Mr and Mrs H, says that it doesnt agree with our 
investigators recommendation and wishes for this matter to be referred to an ombudsman 
for further investigation. It says that an unregulated credit intermediary was used by Vacation 
Finance and the product was sold as an investment. It also says that non-payment of 
maintenance fees resulted in the cancellation of the membership but not the finance 
agreement and there are significant hidden charges and liabilities found within the 
documents which give rise to an unfair relationship and it has provided a generic submission 
from counsel about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses. 
It has also raised its serious concerns about the way that the finance was sold to Mr and 
Mrs H and has referred to a decision issued by this service on a complaint relating to a 
fractional holiday ownership product in which it says that the voluminous documentation for 
the product was reviewed and the debtor-creditor relationship was considered to be unfair. It 
says that the same voluminous documents and the same unfair charges exist in the product 
that was sold to Mr and Mrs H so their relationship with Vacation Finance is unfair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Hs complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
Mr and Mrs H signed the membership application agreement in August 2017 to buy 
another vacation week - they also signed other documents including the holiday 
companys terms and conditions, a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice 
that could be given, a credit application, the fixed sum loan agreement, a declaration 
of fair sales practices and a statement of compliance;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative made claims to Vacation Finance in July 2020 and Mr 
and Mrs H then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter referred to claims 
under sections 75 and 140A, including that the points were misrepresented to Mr and 
Mrs H, but their complaint form only referred to claims under section 140A and didnt 
refer to a misrepresentation made by the holiday company;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Hs claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Vacation Finances response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
the July 2020 letter said that Mr and Mrs H were advised that the product was of 
some substance, but its clear that the product is worthless and has no merit, and it 
was represented to them that the purchase would be an investment, the product 
would increase in value and, after a period of a few years, they would be able to sell 
the product at a considerable profit;
the letter said that Mr and Mrs H had provided a comprehensive witness statement 
which was enclosed with the letter but Ive not been provided with a copy of a witness 
statement and Vacation Finance says that no witness statement was enclosed with 
the claim letter that was sent to it;none of Mr and Mrs H and their representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to them;
Mr and Mrs H acquired another vacation week under the membership application 
agreement and the declaration of fair sales practices that they signed says: I/We 
understand that this is a holiday-based membership and I/we believe that I/we will be 
able to use and enjoy it; and the statement of compliance that they also signed says: 
We also understand that the membership price paid does not necessarily reflect the 
market value of our membership;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
misrepresented to Mr and Mrs H that the product was of some substance or the 
value of the product;
the declaration of fair sales practices that they signed also says: I/We agree that 
I/we have not entered into this purchase purely for financial gain; and the statement 
of compliance that they also signed says: The primary purpose of our Membership is 
to access holiday accommodation and is not a financial investment for a return; and 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
represented to Mr and Mrs H that the product was an investment;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the product was 
misrepresented to Mr and Mrs H by the holiday company or that they were induced 
into entering into the membership application agreement by any such 
misrepresentations;
the July 2020 letter also says that the holiday company has ceased to trade so has 
committed a repudiatory breach of contract  but Vacation Finance says that the 
holiday clubs are now operated by a newly appointed club manager and full use of 
their product remains available to Mr and Mrs H;
I consider that the liquidation of the holiday company would be a breach of contract 
for which Vacation Finance would be liable under section 75 - but I consider the 
appointment of the new club manager company to have been a suitable remedy for 
any breach of contract, Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Hs use of 
their vacation week has been adversely impacted by the liquidation of the holiday 
company and Im not persuaded that Mr and Mrs H would be entitled to terminate 
their agreement in these circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that commission was paid between Vacation 
Finance and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr and Mrs H which 
created a breach of fiduciary duty and an unfair relationship but Vacation Finance 
says that no commission was paid to the holiday company;
Ive not been provided with any other evidence to show that Vacation Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company and Im not persuaded that theres been a 
breach of any fiduciary duty in these circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that the loan agreement was unaffordable for Mr 
and Mrs H and their complaint form says that the holiday company and Vacation 
Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan - but 
none of Mr and Mrs H and their representative had provided detailed evidence about 
Mr and Mrs Hs financial position in August 2017 or to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for them at that time;
Mr and Mrs H signed a credit application which showed that they were homeowners 
and that Mr H was employed with a gross annual income of £51,900 and the 
statement of compliance that they signed says: Having carefully considered our financial commitments, we confirm we are able to meet the financial obligations being 
undertaken by us in respect of the Membership Application and any financial 
commitments and repayments in any related finance agreement;
Vacation Finance says that it followed its usual process and conducted an 
appropriate affordability assessment for Mr and Mrs H and it has described that 
process  it says that Mr and Mrs H advised a combined annual income of £51,900, 
they exceeded its minimum credit score requirement, they had a calculated monthly 
disposable amount of £968 (which they signed to confirm was a reasonable estimate) 
and the monthly payment for the loan of £187.55 was deemed affordable;
Vacation Finance had agreed in August 2017 that, if the balance of Mr and Mrs Hs 
loan was settled in full within twelve months, the interest payable would be waived  
it says that Mr and Mrs H maintained their monthly payments and then settled the 
balance of the loan in full in July 2018 so the interest was waived;
Im not persuaded that enough evidence has been provided to show that the loan 
wasnt affordable for Mr and Mrs H when it was made to them in August 2017 or that 
the loan was mis-sold to them;
Mr and Mrs Hs complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured Mr 
and Mrs H into entering into the membership application agreement and the loan 
agreement  but Mr and Mrs H signed the holiday companys declaration of fair sales 
practices in August 2017 which says: I/We agree that the presentation has been 
conducted in a friendly and helpful manner; and: I/We confirm that we have not 
been pressurised or coerced into agreeing to this purchase; 
Mr and Mrs H had signed the holiday companys right of withdrawal form which said 
that they had the right to withdraw from the membership application agreement within 
14 calendar days without giving any reason, so if they were concerned about the way 
that the product had been sold to them and didnt want to acquire it, I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted either the holiday company or 
Vacation Finance within the withdrawal period to withdraw from the membership 
application agreement and the loan agreement  but Ive seen no evidence to show 
that they did so;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs H were 
unduly pressured into entering into the membership application agreement and the 
loan agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptable sales practices 
against them;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative has provided a generic submission from counsel 
about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses but it would be for a court 
to determine whether or not any of the terms in those agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr and Mrs H and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs H and 
Vacation Finance;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative has referred to a decision issued by this service on a 
complaint relating to a fractional holiday ownership product in which it says the voluminous documentation for the product was reviewed and the debtor-creditor 
relationship was considered to be unfair  it says that the same voluminous 
documents and the same unfair charges exist in the product that was sold to Mr and 
Mrs H so their relationship with Vacation Finance is unfair;
that decision related to a fractional holiday ownership product which was sold as an 
investment  Mr and Mrs H bought a vacation week from the holiday company and, 
for the reasons set out above, I dont consider that it was sold to them as an 
investment;
both fractional and non-fractional products were often sold in similar ways and may 
have had similar contractual documentation but the operation and effect of the 
contractual documentation would be significantly different for a fractional product 
than for a non-fractional product;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative said in response to our investigators recommendation 
that an unregulated credit intermediary was used by Vacation Finance but that didnt 
form part of the claim that was made to Vacation Finance or the complaint that was 
made to this service so I cant make any finding on that issue in this decision  but I 
can see that the credit intermediary was identified on the loan agreement and that 
that credit intermediary was authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority as an 
appointed representative of Vacation Finance in August 2017 when Mr and Mrs H 
entered into the loan agreement;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Hs 
relationship with Vacation Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs H 
and Vacation Finance in these circumstances;
Vacation Finance didnt issue a substantive response to Mr and Mrs Hs claims 
because it says that it had requested a copy of the witness statement that was 
referred to in their representatives July 2020 letter but never received a reply - it then 
provided this service with a detailed response to those claims and I consider that the 
reasons that it gave for not upholding Mr and Mrs Hs claims were fair and 
reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs H for the issues that theyve had with their holiday 
product but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me 
to require Vacation Finance to refund to them any of the money that theyve paid to 
the holiday company, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Hs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision before 17 October 2023.
