The complaint
Mr O complains that Nationwide Building Society (Nationwide) wont refund over £27,000 
he lost to a cryptocurrency investment scam.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat everything 
again here. In brief summary. Mr O fell victim to an investment scam beginning in June 2021 
after he was contacted by someone claiming to be a trading expert from a broker (T) on 
social media. 
He was encouraged to invest and made the following payments using his Nationwide debit 
card to purchase cryptocurrency, which was then forwarded onto the scammer from his 
crypto wallets:

Mr O realised hed been scammed when he was asked to pay large amounts of money in 
order to withdraw his profits. He reported the fraud to Nationwide and asked it to reconsider 
reimbursing the money hed lost, as he said it should have done more to protect him from 
the scam.
Nationwide agreed that it should have intervened as of the £4,025.08 payment made on 
24 July 2021 (payment number nine listed in the table above) in light of the unusual account 
activity, and it conceded that any further loss wouldve likely been prevented if it had done 
so. However, Nationwide also considered Mr O to be jointly responsible for his loss due to 
his lack of due diligence and failure to question unrealistic returns that shouldve appeared 
too good to be true. As a result, it offered to refund 50% of the payments Mr O made from 
payment nine onwards. 
Mr O didnt think this was fair, so he referred the matter to our service. Our investigator 
upheld the complaint. She agreed that Nationwide should have intervened as of payment 
number nine, but she didnt think it was fair to reduce compensation by 50% as there was 
very little information Mr O couldve found on T if he had carried out further due diligence. 
She also didnt think hed been told anything that ought to have sounded too good to be true, 
so the investigator recommended that Nationwide refund 100% of the payments from 
payment nine onwards. 
Mr O agreed with the investigators recommendations, but Nationwide disagreed, so the 
matter has been escalated to me to determine. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator and have decided 
to uphold it for the following reasons:It isnt in dispute that Mr O has fallen victim to a cruel scam here, nor that he authorised 
the payments made to his crypto wallets. Nationwide has also accepted that it shouldve 
intervened when Mr O made the £4,025.08 payment made on 24 July 2021, and that it 
could have likely prevented any further loss if it had done so. As a result, Nationwide has 
agreed to refund the payments made as part of the scam from this point onwards, albeit 
with a 50% deduction. Mr O has also since accepted that its from this payment onwards 
that Nationwide should have intervened. Given these points are no longer in dispute, I do 
not intend to explore these issues any further.
What remains in dispute in this case is whether Nationwide should refund 100% of these 
payments, or whether it would be fair and reasonable for it to only refund 50% in 
recognition of Mr Os lack of due diligence and negligence. And having considered the 
arguments from both parties, Im not persuaded it would be fair and reasonable to make 
a deduction for contributory negligence in these circumstances. Ill explain why.
Nationwide believes Mr O should be held jointly liable for his loss as it says he was 
promised a ten-fold return on his investment, which should have sounded too good to be 
true. It also thinks it should have appeared unusual to see an investment opportunity 
promoted on Instagram, as well as the fact that he didnt receive any documentation. 
First, I dont think the fact that Mr O found the investment via Instagram means he ought 
to have known it was a scam. I acknowledge it may not be a traditional channel of 
advertising for investment opportunities, but it wouldnt be unusual to find information 
relating to legitimate cryptocurrency investments on a social media platform given its 
popularity. Mr O also may not have received paperwork for his investment, but again I 
dont consider this to mean he was negligent for failing to realise it was a scam. I 
appreciate these factors may be concerning to an experienced investor. But for a 
relatively inexperienced investor like Mr O, I would only expect these issues to have 
perhaps prompted him to carry our further research into T before deciding to invest.
However, after carrying out my own research, it doesnt appear that Mr O wouldve found 
anything adverse or negative about T at the time he chose to invest. So, even if he did 
fail to carry out a reasonable level of due diligence, Im not persuaded he would have 
come across any warnings or been deterred from investing if he had done further 
research. Therefore, his lack of due diligence cannot be said to have contributed towards 
his loss in this respect, meaning it wouldnt be fair to make a deduction on that basis.
In terms of the returns Mr O was expecting, hes said he doesnt ever recall being 
promised a ten-fold return on his investment as Nationwide has suggested, only that that 
broker supposedly had an algorithm that could help achieve these returns. Mr O said he 
was not expecting huge returns due to the volatility of cryptocurrency trading either. He 
said the scammer told him that if he invested larger sums more frequently that he would 
make more profit. And while this may have carried more risk, it doesnt sound overly 
unrealistic or too good to be true. And theres no evidence to suggest he was promised 
or guaranteed a 1000% return on his investment, so I dont think Mr O ought reasonably 
to have suspected he was being scammed in light of what he was told by the scammer 
either. As a result, Im satisfied its fair and reasonable in all the circumstances for 
Nationwide to refund 100% of the payments Mr O made to the scammer from the point it 
shouldve intervened.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct Nationwide Building Society 
to:Refund the payments Mr O made to the scammer from the £4,025.08 payment made 
on 24 July 2021 onwards, less any credits received.
Given this money originated from Mr Os savings account, Nationwide should pay 
interest on the payments at the rate applicable to the originating account at the time, 
from the date each payment was made until the date of settlement.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 January 2024.
