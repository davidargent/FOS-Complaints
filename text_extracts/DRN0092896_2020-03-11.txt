K822xcomplaint
Mrs C complains that NewDay Ltd blocked her credit card account.
background 
Mrs C says she tried to pay for flights with her NewDay  credit card but the transaction  was 
declined. She says she spoke to NewDay  about what had happened  and was told a block  
had been applied some  four months earlier. Mrs C says by the time she paid for the flights  
the price had increased by over £800. She also says she missed  out on NewDay 
promotional points as a result of not being able to use the credit  card.
NewDay doesnt accept  making a mistake  and says it placed  a fraud block  on the account  
that allowed  some transactions. But it says the attempted flight purchase triggered  further  
account blocks that couldnt be lifted and that is why it issued a new card.  NewDay accepts it 
didnt deal with parts of the complaint as it should  and has offered £70 compensation.
Mrs C brought her complaint to us and our investigator upheld the complaint but thought  
NewDays compensation offer fair and reasonable. The investigator didnt think NewDay was 
responsible for the flight price changes or that Mrs C didnt receive promotional spending 
points. 
Mrs C doesnt accept  that view and maintains that as a result of what  took place she spent 
significantly more on the flights. And says if NewDay had told her there  were  restrictions on 
the account card then she could have done something about that before the attempted  
transaction.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to a similar 
overall view as the investigator. I realise Mrs C will be disappointed at my decision.
I accept fraud is a major  problem for businesses and I am sure Mrs C appreciates  that fraud 
measures are important in preventing such fraud.  I think a business has a responsibility  to 
ensure it takes  such steps to protect its customers money and accounts. I accept that in 
certain circumstances  legitimate transactions are subject to fraud  measures. And I also 
appreciate that customers in such circumstances are caused inconvenience.  But we are not 
the regulator of banks  and building societies and its not our role to tell such businesses what  
its fraud policies are or how it exercises  its commercial judgement  on such  matters.
So I dont  think NewDay made a mistake or acted unfairly by blocking Mrs Cs account 
where it had such security concerns. I would not expect it to have told either  Mrs C or us 
what those concerns were  as I think such matters are commercially sensitive. But I 
appreciate Mrs Cs concerns that these security measures were applied  some months 
before and that she hadnt been  told about  them. For the reasons I have explained I cant  
fairly tell NewDay what its policies and measures should be and so it follows that I cant fairly 
conclude it made a mistake by not telling Mrs C about them.
As I dont think NewDay has made  a mistake about  the main part of Mrs Cs complaint then I 
cant fairly order it to pay for the flight price difference.  I also cant  order  NewDay to add

account.
There is no question that NewDay  didnt deal with parts  of Mrs Cs complaint  as it should. 
And I have  listened  to the calls between the parties and Im satisfied that Mrs C spent some 
time trying to find out what was happening.  But I think  NewDays offer of £70 is fair and 
reasonable for that part of the complaint.
Overall I accept Mrs C will have unanswered questions about NewDayss  decision to allow 
some account transactions but not others. I also accept  Mrs C will remain  unhappy  with my 
decision and so I will leave it to her to decide  if she wishes  to accept the compensation offer.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part but find that NewDay  Ltd has made  a 
fair and reasonable compensation offer of £70. Mrs Cs acceptance of that offer would be in 
full and final settlement  of this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 April 2020.
