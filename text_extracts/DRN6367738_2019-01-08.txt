K820x#14complaint
Mrs H complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc have  unfairly refused to pay her a 
bonus of £125 for switching her account  to it. 
background
In mid 2018  Mrs H applied to switch her savings account from another  bank  to NatWest.
At that time NatWest was offering a bonus  of £125 to customers  who opened  certain 
accounts with it  these were several of NatWests  current accounts. There  were other 
conditions of the offer relating to depositing  an amount of £1,500 into the account and 
logging into online or mobile banking by a certain date.  A customer  also had to complete a 
full switch of a non-NatWest account to a NatWest current account  using the current  account 
switch service. 
Mrs H complained to NatWest when she didnt receive the bonus, despite paying  in the 
£1,500 and logging in as required. NatWest said the offer didnt include savings accounts. It 
wrote to Mrs H a further three times  about  the conditions of the switch offer. 
Unhappy with NatWests  responses,  Mr H brought her complaint to us on Mrs Hs behalf. He 
says she was given  a document saying she could switch a savings account. And he thought 
the offer was ambiguous.  
Our adjudicator didnt  think Mrs H had satisfied the conditions for the bonus to be paid. So 
Mr H asked for a decision from an ombudsman. Mr H said that the main issue  was that the 
information sheet  given by NatWest gave  contrary instructions and it was not fair to expect a 
member of the public  to decipher such mixed messages. He thought NatWest should pay 
the bonus as a goodwill  gesture. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I can see that Mr and Mrs H feel strongly 
that Mrs H should  receive the bonus.  Thats plain because theyve brought her complaint to 
this service. But Im afraid Ill have  to disappoint her, as I agree with our adjudicator, for 
much the same reasons. 
As our adjudicator said,  in order to be eligible for the bonus,  a full switch  of a non-NatWest  
account to an eligible  NatWest account needed  to be done  using the current  account switch  
service. And only current accounts  can be switched  using that service. As Mrs H switched a 
savings account,  she didnt meet the criteria for the bonus offer.
Mr H says that Mrs H was given a document that showed savings accounts  could  be 
switched. Ive seen  the document and it does indeed say that. But it doesnt say that 
switching a savings  account will qualify for the bonus offer. 
I understand that Mr and Mrs H feel that mixed messages  were  given. I can see how they 
feel this way. But customers  do at times  switch  accounts for reasons other than to qualify for 
a bonus. It may be to qualify for different  interest  rates, or account features,  for example. 
And customers may choose  to switch savings as well as current  accounts. So I would expect 
NatWest to provide  information relating to switching in general, and not just in relation to 
Ref: DRN63677382qualifying for a bonus. As far as I am aware, NatWest doesnt offer a bonus  for switching 
accounts all year round, but it is possible to switch certain accounts at all times. So I would  
expect to see two sets of information. Im sorry if Mrs H found it confusing,  but I dont think 
NatWest did anything wrong. 
NatWest is entitled  to set terms  and conditions as to what account switches it is prepared to 
pay a bonus for. And that is what  it did. Unfortunately Mrs H didnt qualify for the bonus 
because of the type of the account  she switched. So although  I know it will disappoint  Mrs H, 
and Im sorry for that, it wouldnt be fair of me to ask NatWest to pay the bonus to her. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 February  2019.
