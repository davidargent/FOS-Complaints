K820x#14complaint
Mr W complains about scratches on a watch that he paid for using a fixed  sum loan 
agreement with Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays  Partner Finance. 
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr W has provided photos showing  the scratches on the watch  and he says that they 
werent apparent  at the point of sale  but he would have  had an opportunity to 
inspect the watch  before  he bought  it and any such  scratches would have been 
clearly visible on inspection;
hes worn  the watch and I consider that it would  be reasonable to expect  him to have 
immediately noticed any such  scratches at that time if hed not previously inspected 
it;
the supplier has quoted  Â£300 to repair the watch and Im not persuaded that its likely 
that it would  have sold the watch in that scratched  condition;
I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that those scratches were on 
the watch when  it was bought by Mr W or that theres been  a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier;
there was no requirement for Barclays Partner Finance to suspend Mr Ws 
repayments when  he made a claim to it and Im not persuaded that its response to 
his claim has been  unfair  or unreasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays  Partner Finance 
to allow  Mr W to reject the watch,  to pay for it to be repaired or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 May 2020.
