K821x#15complaint
Mr J has complained about the loans he took out with CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as 
QuickQuid). He says QuickQuid mis-sold him the loans because  he couldnt  repay  them due 
to being in a debt spiral. Mr J also says there  were  indicators in the way these loans  were  
repaid that indicated they were unaffordable  for him.  
background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  2 August 
2019. An extract from this is attached  and forms part of this final decision, so I will not repeat 
that information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to partly uphold the complaint. I invited 
both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. Both QuickQuid and Mr J 
accepted the findings.  
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr J has accepted the findings of the provisional decision, and QuickQuid also told us it 
doesnt have anything further  to add. So I see no reason to depart from the findings  I made  
in my provisional decision.  
So I still think QuickQuid was wrong to have provided Mr J with his fourth and final loan, and 
Ive outlined below - what it needs  to do to put things right. 
putting things right
for loan 4 QuickQuid  should rework  the account,  and apply all payments made  by
Mr J as if they had gone towards  the principal  sum borrowed  (£350). At the point that 
Mr J had paid enough to have repaid the principal then any overpayment needs to be 
refunded, from the date of the over payment became due to the date of settlement 
plus 8% simple interest  per year should also be added;
the number  of loans taken means  any information recorded  about loan 4 is adverse. 
So all entries about loan 4 should be removed from Mr Js credit  file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet UK LLC to take off tax from this interest. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC must  give Mr J a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he 
asks for one.
Ref: DRN72422222my final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision  Im partially upholding Mr Js 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC should  pay Mr J compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 September  2019.

background
Mr J took 4 loans from QuickQuid between October 2010 and May 2011. Based on the information  
Ive been provided, it seems Mr J had some significant problems repaying  his final loan, although this 
was ultimately fully repaid.   
A summary  of Mr Js borrowing, based on the information provided to us from QuickQuid, can be 
found below:
loan number loan amount received date repayment  datenumber  of 
instalments
1 £100.00 18/10/2010 29/10/2010 1
2 £150.00 08/11/2010 28/01/2011 1
3 £100.00 04/02/2011 09/05/2011 1
4 £350.00 19/05/2011 09/11/2012 1
Our adjudicator felt that QuickQuid hadnt done  anything  wrong by providing Mr J with his loans. She 
thought taking  into account the loan amounts  and what QuickQuid  knew about  
Mr Js circumstances  at the time each loan was approved that it had made  a reasonable  lending 
decision. She also didnt think there was any evidence to suggest the loans were unsustainable for 
him. 
QuickQuid appears to have accepted  the adjudicators  view. 
Mr J didnt agree with the adjudicators  findings. Mr J said that his credit file at the time was not in a 
good way and had QuickQuid looked at this properly or asked for bank statements it wouldve realised 
that he wasnt  in a position to take on these loans.  Mr J also said that he had problems repaying  a 
number of the loans, including  having  to pay extra  to defer repayment of the loan. 
No agreement could be reached,  so the case  has been passed to me for a decision. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks in order to reasonably conclude Mr J could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
Ref: DRN72422224the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Js complaint.
QuickQuid has told this service it carried out checks before  agreeing to lend to Mr J. It says it asked 
Mr J about  his employment status and his income. It also said it carried  out a check  of his credit file as 
well as using its own internal systems to decide  whether the loans  were affordable.  
Our adjudicator thought that QuickQuid hadnt  made an error when providing  any of the loans as she 
thought the checks that it carried out were proportionate and there was no other indication that Mr J 
wasnt able to sustainably  repay  his lending.  
Having looked at everything I dont think QuickQuid was wrong to have provided Mr J with loans 1  
3. And Ill explain why below.
Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less thorough  in terms of how much 
information it gathers and what it does to verify that information  in the early stages  of a lending 
relationship. 
The information provided by QuickQuid suggests  that Mr J was asked to provide details of his monthly  
income. I accept that Mr Js actual circumstances  were maybe not reflected  in the information  he 
provided, or the other information QuickQuid obtained. And Mr Js actual financial  position  might well 
have been apparent if further information, such as bank statements or detailed  credit checks  had 
been obtained. 
But QuickQuid could only make its decision based on the information it had available at the time.  And 
as it was in the early  stages of a lending  relationship  with Mr J, in terms of only providing three loans 
of relatively low value compared to Mr Js declared income, I dont think  it had reached the stage 
where there was a greater risk of the loan being unsustainable for Mr J. In these  circumstances, I 
dont think QuickQuid  needed to take further steps to verify the information he provided. 
QuickQuid relied  on the information it was provided  with and given the amount of the repayments 
involved, together with Mr Js declared  income, I think that this wasnt unreasonable. As this is the 
case, Im not upholding Mr Js complaint about loans  1  3.
I appreciate that Mr J deferred loan 2 on two occasions, but I dont think  that was enough for 
QuickQuid not to provide loan 3, considering the amount  being  borrowed decreased compared  to loan 
2. And while  there  were  problems repaying loan 3, including late payments and deferrals, QuickQuid 
wasnt aware that this would  happen when  the loan was granted.  So taking everything together, I 
dont think QuickQuid  was wrong to have provided  loans 1  3.  
However, by the time of loan 4 Ive also looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history 
with Mr J, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should  reasonably have seen  
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised  
that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Js case, I think that this point was reached by loan 4. I say 
this because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 1 - 3 of Mr J taking new loans shortly  after 
repaying previous ones.  I think  that by loan 4, QuickQuid  ought fairly and reasonably to have 
Ref: DRN72422225regarded that pattern  as established. By the fourth loan Mr J had been  indebted to QuickQuid  
for just over seven months, even though, given  the number of loans  and the repayment term 
he ought to have only been indebted for around three months.  
Mr J had significant problems  repaying loans  2 and 3. Mr J deferred repayment on loan 2 on 
two occasions. And for loan 3, he also deferred repayment on two occasions  as well as also 
making the final payment 11 days late and incurring  extra  fees. I think this was a very clear  
signal that he was having  financial  difficulties, and should have alerted QuickQuid to check in 
greater depth to satisfy  itself that loan 4 would be sustainably repayable for Mr J. 
Mr J wasnt reducing the amounts he owed  to QuickQuid. For example, loan 4 was taken out 
over 7 months after Mr Js first loan was approved,  and the value of this loan was for more  
than three  times  the sum of his first loan. 
I think  that Mr J lost out because  QuickQuid  provided  loan 4 because:
the loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time; and
the number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Js ability to access 
mainstream credit  and so kept him in the market for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding the complaint about loan 4 and QuickQuid  should put things right as set out below.
