Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Cs complaint in part and thought the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN07812442the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator that there was nothing to indicate  Sunny needed  to do more  
when it approved loans 1 to 4. And whilst  I dont  think it carried  out proportionate checks  for 
loan 5, I havent seen any evidence that better information would have made a difference  to 
the lending decision. So I dont think Sunny was wrong to give loans 1 to 5 to Mr C.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history  with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached at loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr C was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr C had taken out six loans within seven weeks. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr C was having  to borrow  further to cover 
the hole repaying  his previous loan (or indeed the one prior given his pattern of 
borrowing) was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Cs indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
Mr C took out loan 6 just one day after hed repaid loan 5; it was for a higher amount, 
and for the same  value as his first loan. At this point Sunny ought to have  known that 
Mr C was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet 
an ongoing need. 
The loans were  instalment loans, each  with six month terms. But Mr C frequently 
repaid his loan in the same month that hed taken it out. This isnt how instalment 
Ref: DRN07812443loans should usually work.  I think  this pattern of lending should also have alerted 
Sunny to the likelihood  that Mr C was having  problems  managing  his money. I think 
that Sunny shouldve  been concerned that Mr C might be borrowing elsewhere  to 
repay loans,  again  increasing his indebtedness unsustainably.
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. As mentioned  
his sixth loan was for the same amount as his first. Loan 11 was taken out eight 
months after Mr Cs first. And it was for a larger amount than the first. Mr C had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Cs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
I have carefully considered Sunnys  response  to our adjudicators view. In summary, it 
explained the checks it had carried out on eligibility,  affordability and credit worthiness 
setting out why it felt the loans were affordable. It highlighted that it only ever gave Mr C a 
small amount of credit relative to his income. But these points dont change my conclusion.  
As Ive explained above Sunny was required to do more than check  Mr C could afford each 
individual loan on a strict pounds and pence  basis. It had to ensure Mr Cs borrowing was 
sustainably affordable, and from loan 6 onwards the pattern and increasing value of Mr Cs 
borrowing did not suggest this was the case. Rather,  it seems  it was unfairly extending his 
use of high cost short term credit.
I note Sunnys comment that loans 10 and 11 are now settled.
It follows Im upholding the complaint about  loans  6 to 11 and Sunny should  put things right. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 6 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse, so all entries about  loans 6 to 11 should  be removed from 
Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr C a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN07812444my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should pay Mr C compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 November 2019.
