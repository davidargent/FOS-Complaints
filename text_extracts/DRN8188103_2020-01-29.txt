Mr A says that cashasap  kept accepting him for new loans and allowing him to roll over 
loans even though he was taking  on new debt shortly after repaying existing debt. He says 
proper affordability  checks werent  carried out and that had they been cashasap  would  have 
realised he had been refused credit on several occasions and that the loans werent  
affordable.
Cashasap says that there were gaps between the loans, including a break of 137 days  
between loans three and four. It says Mr A provided information that he was living  with his 
parents and that the income and expenditure information gathered at the time showed the 
loan repayments  were affordable. It says that Mr A settled all of his loans early and didnt 
contact it to say he was in financial difficulties.
Mr A initially  accepted an offer of goodwill from cashasap of £40 but then says that he 
rejected this offer before he received the money. Cashasap  accepted  that this complaint 
could be considered further by this service.
Ref: DRN81881032Our adjudicator upheld  this complaint from loan three onwards. He said he hadnt seen 
enough evidence  to say that the first two loans shouldnt have been provided. By loan three 
he thought that proportionate checks would most likely have shown Mr A was having 
problems managing his money.  He said had further checks  been carried out cashasap  would  
have realised that Mr A was making  a significant amount of gambling  transactions. He 
thought that cashasap should have realised that loans three to six werent sustainably  
affordable.
By loan seven, our adjudicator thought that Mr As pattern of borrowing  suggested  he had 
become persistently reliant on short-term loans.  Therefore he found this and subsequent 
loans were unsustainable.
Cashasap didnt accept  our adjudicators view. It said that Mr As third loan was for a smaller 
amount than the second loan and was due to be repaid on the same  date as his second 
loan. It said that Mr A repaid his larger loan early  then took out a smaller loan to be repaid on 
the same  date meaning he paid less interest.  It said the gap of 137 days between loans 
three and four was significant and that loans four, five and six were for reducing amounts. It 
said based on the small cost of credit for loans five to seven there  was no reason for 
concern regarding loan eight. 
Cashasap said that it had been accepted that it was reasonable  to provide loans one and 
two and that the interest due to be paid on these loans was higher than the total amount 
paid on all 12 loans combined. It said its approach  provided flexibility  for Mr A.
Cashasap offered to refund the interest  and charges  on loans nine to twelve. It calculated  
this as a refund of £141.66  which after reductions  for tax and the £40 already paid meant  a 
refund to Mr A of £113.68. This offer amount was put to Mr A although incorrect loan 
numbers were referenced. Mr A didnt accept the offer.
As this complaint  hasnt been resolved it has been  passed to me, an ombudsman, to issue  a 
decision.
My provisional conclusions
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. I concluded in summary:
before  the loans  were provided,  cashasap  gathered information  on Mr As income 
and expenses;
I thought the checks carried  out before the first two loans were provided  were 
sufficient. As these suggested  the loans were  affordable I didnt find that I had 
evidence to say the first two loans shouldnt have been  provided;
our adjudicator thought that further checks should have been carried out before the 
third loan was provided. But given the size of the repayments compared to Mr As 
monthly income I found the checks carried out at this stage were reasonable and I 
didnt find that I could say this loan shouldnt have been provided;
there was a gap between loan three  being  repaid and loan four being provided.  I 
didnt find that his gap was sufficient  for cashasap to conclude that Mr As 
circumstances had changed therefore I treated all the loans as part of the same 
lending chain;
Ref: DRN81881033given the repayment amounts due on loan four compared to Mr As income and also 
given he repaid his previous loans early,  I found  the checks carried out before this 
loan was provided were reasonable. These didnt raise concerns about the 
affordability of the loan and so I didnt find I could say this loan shouldnt  have been 
provided;
by loan five I thought  it would have been  reasonable  for cashasap  to carry out a 
thorough review of Mr As financial circumstances to ensure that lending  to him was 
sustainable. Had this happened, I found  that cashasap  would  have realised that Mr A 
was struggling to manage his money.  I thought  that cashasap should have realised 
that this loan wasnt sustainably affordable;
by loan six, I thought  that Mr As pattern of borrowing suggested he had become 
persistently reliant on short term borrowing. Therefore I found that loan six onwards 
shouldnt have  been provided.
I upheld this complaint  from loan five onwards.
Both parties  responded to my provisional decision saying that they had nothing further to 
add.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
As I set out in my provisional  decision, cashasap needed to take reasonable steps to ensure 
that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice this means that it should have carried  out 
proportionate checks to make sure that Mr A could repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent the repayment amounts and the consumer's income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Cashasap  should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. And there may 
even come a point where the lending history  and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
As I concluded in my provisional decision,  I think that the checks  carried out before the first 
four loans were  provided were proportionate.  As these  didnt  raise  concerns about the 
affordability of the loans  I dont find I can say these loans shouldnt  have been provided. 
However, by loan five I think further  checks should  have taken place. Had this happened,  
cashasap would have  realised that Mr A was taking out loans  with other short  term loan 
providers and was making payments to gambling  sites. Given this I think  that cashasap 
should have realised that this loan wasnt sustainably affordable. 
By loan six, I think that Mr As pattern of borrowing suggested he had become persistently 
reliant on short term borrowing. He had taken out a number of loans and the amounts he 
Ref: DRN81881034was borrowing hadnt decreased significantly.  Therefore I find that loan six onwards 
shouldnt have been provided.
As no further  information was provided  in response to my provisional decision,  my 
conclusions havent  changed and I uphold this complaint in regard  to loans five to twelve.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans  five to twelve.  Apfin  Ltd 
(trading as cashasap.co.uk) should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mr A paid on loans five to twelve  less any refunds 
already made;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan five from Mr As credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan six means any information recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  loans six to twelve should  be removed from Mr As 
credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Apfin Ltd to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mr A a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 February  2020.
