The complaint
Ms M is unhappy that NewDay Ltd wont increase her credit card account limit and she 
doesnt think its adequately explained why it wont.
What happened
Ms M recently asked NewDay Ltd to increase her credit card account limit. It refused. 
NewDay told Ms M that she doesnt meet its criteria to increase her credit limit at this time. It 
said it had considered internal factors  for example, how Ms M has managed her account 
 and external factors, like the information thats available on her credit file.
Ms M doesnt think this is fair and referred her complaint to our service.
One of our investigators didnt think NewDay had done anything wrong.
Ms M disagrees and has asked that an ombudsman make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When she first referred her complaint to our service, Ms M said she wanted to have an open 
discussion with NewDay about her finances and to know precisely why she doesnt meet its 
criteria to increase her credit limit. And, ultimately, she wanted it to increase her credit limit.
More recently, Ms M told us shes concerned that the information NewDay has about her 
may be incorrect  and she says she wont know this unless it tells her exactly why she 
doesnt meet its criteria. More broadly, shes unhappy with what she perceives to be a lack 
of transparency and she doesnt think NewDay has treated her fairly. And while shes since 
opened a credit card account with a different finance provider, she would still like NewDay to 
increase her credit limit for convenience.
I know Ms M will be very disappointed, but its for NewDay and NewDay alone to decide 
whether or not to increase her credit limit. Its explained to Ms M that she doesnt meet its 
criteria. And I dont think it needs to say more  or tell Ms M exactly what the criteria is or 
precisely why she doesnt meet it. Ultimately, its a commercial decision for NewDay to make 
 and Ive seen nothing to suggest I should interfere with its decision. If Ms M is still 
concerned about the information NewDay has about her, she can make a subject access 
request and check it herself.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2023.
