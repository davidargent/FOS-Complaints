Mr L says Elevate Credit  International  Limited,  trading as Sunny, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  a copy of my provisional  findings on 14 April 2020. A copy of my 
provisional decision is attached and it forms part of this final decision. In it I explained why 
I didnt intend  to uphold Mr Ls complaint.
I asked Mr L and Sunny to let me know  if they had anything else they wanted me to 
consider. Neither  party responded.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party responded to my provisional decision, I see no reason  to depart from my 
provisional findings. So my final decision is the same  as my provisional decision, for the 
same reasons.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I do not uphold Mr Ls 
complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 June  2020.

complaint
Mr L says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr L had six loans with Sunny, as summarised below.
Loan Date Taken Date  Repaid Amount
1 18/04/2017 21/04/2017 £100
2 10/06/2017 21/07/2017 £50
3 12/06/2017 23/11/2017 £100
4 30/06/2017 23/01/2018 £250
5 07/08/2017 21/12/2017 £100
6 17/09/2017 21/12/2017 £50
When Sunny  responded  to Mr Ls complaint, it partly upheld it in respect of loan 1. Mr L didnt  accept 
that and referred  his complaint to this service.  An adjudicator then looked at this complaint and 
thought it should be upheld but only in respect of loan 6. Sunny didnt accept  that but did make  an 
offer (as a gesture of goodwill) to refund the interest Mr L paid on loan 6. Mr L didnt accept that offer 
either and as there was no agreement, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr L could repay  the loans  
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
For each  of the six loans Sunny asked Mr L about his income and expenditure  and carried  out a credit 
check. Ive only seen  the details of the former and can see that Mr L declared a monthly  income of 
£1,500 throughout all applications. Based on the monthly expenditure 
Mr L declared, Sunny  calculated that Mr L could  afford the monthly instalments  on the loans  it 
provided.
I think  the checks Sunny  carried out were proportionate for the loans it provided. I wouldnt have 
expected Sunny to undertake a detailed  analysis  of Mr Ls financial situation for any of these six loans  
 and I think  anything  less than this would  be unlikely  to have shown these loans to be unaffordable.
I also considered  the pattern of lending.  Mr L took six loans in five months,  the last four of which 
overlapped. But I dont think the amounts borrowed or the period of time are enough  on their own to 
suggest the lending  became unsustainable.  Each of the loans were repayable in monthly instalments  
and the amounts (cumulatively)  repayable didnt increase  to obviously unsustainable levels.
Ref: DRN49244063Ive noted that Sunny  offered  to uphold  loan 1 in its final response  letter and in doing  so it suggested 
that it was wrong  to have provided it. But Ive seen no evidence that this loan caused Mr L to suffer  
any kind of financial  loss and given the trivial amount of interest  Mr L paid on that loan (£2.40) I dont 
think any financial loss is likely to have arisen  as a result of Sunnys decision  to approve this loan. I 
dont therefore intend to make any award in respect of this loan, despite what Sunny said in its final 
response letter.
I realise this will come as disappointment to Mr L but I do not intend to uphold his complaint.
