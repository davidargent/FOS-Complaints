The complaint
Mr K complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed and defaulted his loan 
without reasonable notice.
What happened
Mr K successfully applied for a loan in August 2020. The first payment was made in 
November 2020 but no payments were received in the next two months. 
NatWest sent Mr K emails, text messages and letters to advise his loan was in arrears and 
current account was overdrawn. 
Mr K made the loan payments due in February, March, April and May 2021 but it remained 
in arrears as the previously missed payments hadnt been made up. 
During the period above, NatWest sent Mr K various letters and notices asking him to get in 
touch and address the arrears on his loan. 
On 22 May 2021 NatWest sent Mr K a final demand that said a payment of £1,981.55 was 
required by 30 May 2021 to stop the account closing. 
Mr K called NatWest at the beginning of June 2021 and explained he was on holiday when 
the final demand had been delivered. The account was sold to a third party. 
Mr K complained but NatWest didnt agree it had acted unfairly by closing his loan and 
recording a default on his credit file. But NatWest apologised if Mr K was given some 
misleading information in branch and reduced the outstanding loan balance by £150.65 and 
sent him a cheque for £75. 
Mr K referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. Mr K has told 
us he didnt receive any of the emails, text messages or letters NatWest sent him about the 
arrears on his loan or its intention close it and report a default. During the investigation, 
NatWest let the investigator know it wanted to offer Mr K a further £100 to try and resolve his 
complaint. The investigator thought NatWest had dealt with Mr Ks complaint fairly and didnt 
ask it to increase its offer or remove the default from his credit file. Mr K asked to appeal, so 
his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Businesses can take the decision to close an account and record a default on the borrowers 
credit file following a sustained period of arrears. Industry guidance indicates a business can 
take that step after three to six months of arrears. In this case, Mr K made the first payment 
due under his loan agreement in November 2020. But the following two payments were 
missed and not made up. The decision to close the account and record a default took effect 
in May 2021. Given the length of time the arrears remained outstanding, I think it was 
reasonable for NatWest to close the loan. 
Mr K has told us he didnt receive the emails, text messages and letters NatWest sent him 
about the arrears on his loan. But NatWest has sent in systems evidence to show the 
correspondence it issued to Mr K. Where the parties involved dispute the circumstances of a 
complaint Ill base my decision on the balance of probabilities. That is, what I consider most 
likely to have happened based on all the available information and evidence. 
Whilst NatWest didnt keep direct copies of all the correspondence it sent Mr K, it did record 
each email, text message and letter that was sent. NatWest has also provided templates of 
the communications it sent Mr K. I also think its fair to note that its NatWests standard 
approach to contact borrowers about arrears to try and reach an agreement to repay them. 
On balance, Im satisfied NatWest contacted Mr K about the arrears on his loan and its 
intention to close it as claimed and that its text messages, emails and letters were most likely 
received. 
Mr K has told us he feels the eight day notice period given in NatWests final demand was 
too short. But, as noted above, that was the final response date NatWest provided after 
several months of attempts to engage with Mr K about the arrears. I understand Mr K was 
away when NatWests final demand was received but I havent been persuaded those are 
grounds to tell NatWest to remove the default from his credit file. 
NatWest refunded £150.65 of interest and sent Mr K a cheque for £75 to apologise for 
misleading information its branch staff mayve provided. NatWest recently offered to 
increase the settlement by a further £100. As I havent found evidence that NatWest acted 
unfairly in the way it closed Mr Ks loan, Im satisfied the existing settlement is a fair way to 
resolve his complaint. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
Mr K a total of £175 (less any compensation already paid) in addition to the refund of 
£150.65 already applied. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 June 2022.
