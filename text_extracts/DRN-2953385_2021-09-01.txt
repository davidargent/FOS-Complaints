The complaint
Mr P complains that lending made to him by NewDay Ltd wasnt affordable. He says that 
NewDay didnt do sufficient checks to make sure it wasnt lending irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr P said that NewDay didnt do enough checks when it lent to him. He said it should have 
taken steps to build a more detailed picture of his financial situation. But he said it chose not 
to ask for information on things like payslips, bills, or bank statements, which would have 
given it full details of his income and expenditure. Mr P said because NewDay chose not to 
do that, he believed that meant this was irresponsible lending.
Mr P said NewDay needed to establish if he would be in a position to sustainably repay the 
lending it made to him, without undue difficulties. In particular, he should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to 
borrow to meet the repayments. Mr P said that if NewDay had checked his credit file, then it 
wouldve seen other accounts that had been opened in recent months along with some 
balance increases, adverse data and an older default. It would also have shown other short-
term loans that had been taken and an overdraft facility constantly in use to its limit. So Mr P 
thought NewDay shouldve realised that this lending wasnt sustainable for him. 
NewDay said it considers information from credit reference agencies (CRAs) as well as the 
information Mr P supplied to it. When he applied for this card, hed told NewDay that he was 
employed with annual income of £62,000, plus access to other household income of 
£21,000. And NewDay said that the CRA data it got then showed he had unsecured debt of 
£8,400. Information from the CRAs also showed that he had no accounts in arrears, no 
county court judgments against him, no payment arrangements on any of his debts, no debt 
management programmes, and no payday loans. 
NewDay said that although Mr P had two previous defaults with a total debt of £4,900, the 
most recent was 31 months before this application, and it doesnt see defaults of this age as 
a bar to lending. 
NewDay had lent £600 to Mr P, through a credit card account opened for him in October 
2018. It said it hadnt increased this limit while Mr P held the card. 
NewDay said Mr P got in touch in January 2021 to explain that he was having difficulties 
making his payments, and NewDay put in place a payment holiday for him, for three months. 
Mr P had paid during this time, so his account was up to date when NewDay contacted us.
Mr P said hed lost his job in early 2020, and then took some time to secure work again. But 
he said hed maintained payments to NewDay and had recently cleared the balance in full.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said that although NewDay 
did have a responsibility to carry out appropriate and proportionate checks for affordability, 
there werent any set checks that NewDay needed to complete. Shed expect NewDay to 
take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend irresponsibly. But our investigator said shed 
considered the information NewDay had about Mr P, and shed checked what Mr P had told 
NewDay against what she could see on his credit file. She said that the income he declared 
matched what she could see on his statements. He had three credit cards elsewhere. These 
had relatively small limits and he didnt appear to be struggling to maintain the minimum 
payments on these. Mr P also had loans with three other companies with relatively small 
repayments. Shed also taken into account that he was using his overdraft. 
Our investigator said she had considered whether Mr Ps borrowing at the time of his 
application and his other financial commitments meant that he wouldnt have been able to 
sustainably make repayments to NewDay. But she said she couldnt see indicators that 
NewDay shouldnt have provided the credit card to Mr P. She said she wouldnt expect 
NewDay to have requested to have seen Mr Ps bank statements for the type, and amount, 
of lending it was offering. She also said that Mr Ps statements showed a high level of 
discretionary outgoings. She didnt think that NewDay lent irresponsibly or unfairly to Mr P, 
so she wouldnt ask it to do any more. 
Mr P didnt agree. He repeated that he firmly believed that NewDay should have taken steps 
to build a more detailed picture of his personal financial situation and circumstances. And he 
suggested that not having done this meant that NewDays lending was irresponsible. Mr P 
wanted an ombudsman to consider his complaint.
Our investigator didnt change her mind. She said that for the relatively small amount of 
credit that NewDay were lending to Mr P, she wouldnt expect them to take additional steps 
by requesting the sort of information Mr P thought they shouldve asked for. And she said 
shed seen no evidence that Mr P wasnt able to sustain repayments, or even pay off the full 
balance if needed. Our investigator said that at the time of Mr Ps application, she didnt 
agree that there were clear indicators that NewDay shouldnt have provided him with this 
credit card.
Because no agreement was reached, this complaint was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator.
Mr P has argued that NewDay, when it received his application, have asked him for more 
information, to make sure it was lending responsibly to him? He says that without this 
additional information, the lending it made to him must be irresponsible. 
I should stress that, even if I agreed with that, this wouldnt necessarily lead to me deciding 
that NewDay has to make the refunds Mr P has suggested. If I did agree with Mr P, I would 
need to consider what any further checks would have revealed, and whether NewDay would 
have uncovered information which would bring its lending into question. 
As our investigator set out, NewDay isnt automatically required to ask for further 
information, before it makes any lending to anyone. So I wouldnt assume that this lending 
was irresponsible, simply because NewDay didnt ask to see any wage slips or bank 
statements for Mr P. From what Mr P has told us about recent accounts hed opened, it appears that hes 
suggesting that his financial situation was becoming worse at the time when he applied for 
this card, and that NewDay shouldve realised this when it considered his application. 
Looking at his credit file, I can see some early evidence of issues emerging around October 
2018. For instance, I can see that Mr P opened a new credit card account with another 
provider on what looks to have been the same day as his NewDay account was opened. 
And his card balance on another card also significantly increased around this time. 
But it can take a considerable amount of time for a credit file to update with this information. 
So I dont think that NewDay would have seen this information at the time that Mr P made 
his application. 
Looking at the information which was available to NewDay, I can see that Mr P declared a 
relatively high personal and household income, when he made this application. The level of 
unsecured debt that he declared was relatively low, in comparison. Although Mr P said hed 
missed payments at this time, NewDay said it couldnt see any accounts in arrears, and I 
havent been able to identify missed payments on Mr Ps credit file from around this time. 
Considering the information available to NewDay, I dont think that it was clearly wrong to 
reach the lending decision that it made in October 2018, without asking for additional 
information from Mr P. And, because the problems that Mr P has told us dont seem to me to 
be things that would have showed on Mr Ps credit file at the time of his application, I think 
its likely that NewDay would have made the same decision, if it had sought further 
information from him.
I can see a number of missed payments on Mr Ps credit file, after this lending was made. So 
I understand that Mr P did experience difficult financial circumstances following this lending. 
But I dont think that NewDay ought to have realised at the time the lending was made, that 
this was likely to be the case. So, although I know that Mr P will be disappointed, I dont think 
his complaint should be upheld now. 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 September 2021.
