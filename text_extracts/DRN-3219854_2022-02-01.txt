The complaint
Ms D (through a representative) has complained that S.D. Taylor Limited trading as Loans at

Had it done proper checks it wouldve realised Ms D was in a debt spiral. 
What happened
Ms D took 24 home collected loans from LAH between August 2007 and May 2013. A

The cost per week column is the individual cost per loan per week. When loans overlapped 
the cost per week will be greater. For example, when loans 23 and 24 were being repaid,
Ms Ds weekly commitment to LAH was £35. 
Following Ms Ds complaint, LAH issued its final response letter on 19 February 2021. The 
FRL explained Ms D had made her complaint too late about all her loans  so LAH 
considered the lending to be time barred. As a result, LAH didnt investigate whether an 
error had been made when it advanced these loans.  
 
One of our adjudicators looked at Ms Ds complaint. The assessment was split into two 
parts. 
In the first part, the adjudicator concluded, this Service could investigate all of Ms Ds loans. 
This is because while the loans had been complained about more than six years after the 
event. The adjudicator hadnt seen anything to make her think Ms D had complained more 
than three years since she was or ought to have been aware, she had cause to complain.  
In the second part, the adjudicator considered whether LAH had done anything wrong when 
it advanced these loans. She hadnt seen enough to say LAH had made an error when loans 
1-5 were advanced. So, these loans werent upheld. 
But the adjudicator did uphold the complaint about loans 6  24 because in her view, the 
pattern of lending was now harmful for Ms D. 
Ms Ds representative acknowledged the adjudicators findings. 
LAH didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment. In its response to the adjudicator LAH 
didnt focus on whether it was wrong to have provided some of the loans, instead it focused 
on whether this Service had the jurisdiction to consider the loans. In summary it said:
It disagreed with the approach this Service had taken with this case.
In this case, LAH told this Service Ms D received arrears letters between 2011 and 
2014 following periods of either no payments being made, or reduced repayments 
being received. 
LAH has failed to establish contact with Ms D in order to ask her when she became 
aware, she had cause to complain. Therefore, there is insufficient information to be 
able to conclude these loans are within this Services jurisdiction. 
No evidence has been provided as to why this case is in this Services jurisdiction 
and as such, LAH hasnt given this Service approval to consider these loans.  
The adjudicator went back to LAH and explained why its comments didnt change her mind. 
She said, copies of the arrears letters LAH says were sent havent been provided and she 
reiterated shed not seen enough to suggest the case was outside of this Services 
jurisdiction.  
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
Why I can consider the complaint 
Having done so, I have reached the same conclusion as the adjudicator  that I have the 
power to consider all of Ms Ds loans. Ill explain why. 
The rules I must apply say that, where a business doesnt agree, I cant look at a complaint 
made more than six years after whats been complained about. Or if later, more than three 
years after the complaint in this case, Ms D knew, or ought to really have known they had 
reason to complain. This is set out in Dispute Resolution rule 2.8.2R and can be found online 
in the FCAs Handbook. 
Its clear all of Ms Ds loans were complained about more than six years after they were 
taken. However, Ive not seen anything to persuade me Ms D was aware or ought to have been reasonably aware more than three years before she raised this complaint, that she had 
reason to complain. 
LAH has said that when Ms D experienced repayment problems which led to arrears being 
sent to her between 2011 and 2014.  However, LAH has said, these letters ought to have 
been enough for Ms D to be aware she could complain. But, I dont think this is enough in 
this particular case to demonstrate that.
I say this because whilst experiencing repayment problems and therefore struggling to repay 
the lending would no doubt have led Ms D to realise there was a problem (in terms of her 
financial difficulty), Im not persuaded this would have (or ought to have), in itself, made her  
aware that these problems were caused by LAH doing something wrong when it agreed the 
loans. 
I appreciate LAH hasnt been able to get hold of Ms D, but in this case, but I havent seen 
anything else to persuade me that Ms D was or ought to have become aware earlier of 
cause to complain more than three years before they complained. 
So, like our adjudicator, I think all of Ms Ds loans were raised within the time limits I need to 
apply and that I do have the power to consider these loans Ms D was given. Ill now go on 
and consider whether or not I think all the loans complained about were lent responsibly. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice
at the time the loan was provided.
LAH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate and reasonable checks to make sure 
Ms D could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that LAH should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Ms D. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become or was becoming
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to say that LAH was required to establish whether Ms D 
could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all mean for Ms Ds complaint.
Loans 1 - 5
The adjudicator didnt uphold Ms Ds complaint about these loans. Neither Ms D (nor her 
representatives) disagreed with the adjudicators findings, so I no longer think these loans 
are in dispute. But I have kept in mind this loan when thinking about Ms Ds overall lending 
relationship with LAH.  
Loans 6 - 24
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 6 - 24 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. 
In addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Ms D, LAH also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Ms D.
Having looked at the overall pattern of LAHs lending history with Ms D, LAH should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the 
time it provided loan 6. I say this because:
By loan 6 it was 14 months into the lending relationship and Ms D had been indebted 
to LAH for whole time. In my view, Ms Ds loan history up until this point was a clear 
indication that her underlying financial situation didnt seem to be improving. 
Ms Ds first loan was for £200 with loan 6 being for £450 and at the time loan 6 was 
granted loans 4 and 5 were still outstanding. So, there were no signs that her 
indebtedness was decreasing at this point. 
Ms D returned for loan 6, when there were two previous loans running at the same 
time. And there was an emerging pattern of new loans being taken on the same day 
that a previous loan was repaid or example loans 3 and 4. 
From loan 6 onwards Ms Ds pattern of taking new loans shortly after a previous loan 
had been repaid continued and at times she had more than one loan running at the 
same time.   
By the point of loan 24, Ms D was making a commitment to make repayments to LAH 
for almost another year, after already being indebted for nearly six years. So, Ms D 
wasnt making any inroads into what she owed LAH. Loan 24 was also slightly larger 
than loan 1, but loan 23 was still running, so Ms Ds indebtedness was significantly 
higher. The amount of time that Ms D spent indebted to LAH meant that she was in 
effect servicing a debt to LAH over an extended period of time.
Based on the loan information provided by LAH it looks like at times Ms D had 
sustained repayment problems. For example, loans 9 to 18 were all repaid later than 
the contractual term, and some were significant late, it took Ms D up to 11 weeks 
longer to repay some of these loans than LAH had anticipated. This further reinforces 
my view that these loans were not sustainable for Ms D because despite knowing of 
repayment problems, LAH continued to lend to Ms D. 
I think that Ms D lost out when LAH provided loans 6 - 24 because:these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ds indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the number of loans and time in debt was likely to have had negative implications on 
Ms Ds ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6  24 Ive set out below what LAH 
should do to put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress LAH should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it not provided lending from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms D may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Ms D in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Ms D would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce LAHs liability in this case for what Im satisfied 
it has done wrong and should put right.
LAH shouldnt have given Ms D loans 6 - 24.
A. LAH should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms D towards interest, 
fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything LAH has already refunded.
B. LAH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms D 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms D originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. LAH should pay Ms D the total of A plus B.
D. The overall pattern of Ms Ds borrowing for loans 6  24 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so LAH should remove these loans entirely from Ms 
Ds credit file. *HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to take off tax from this interest. LAH must give 
Ms D a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Ms Ds complaint in part. 
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right for Ms D as directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2022.
