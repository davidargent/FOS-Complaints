Complaint
Mr H complains that CarCashPoint Limited (CarCashPoint) unfairly provided him with a 
logbook loan. He says he was offered the loan when he was in a vicious circle of payday 
lending and couldnt afford it.
  
Background
CarCashPoint provided Mr H with a logbook loan for £800 in January 2017. The loan was 
due to be repaid in 78 weekly instalments of £28.72.  One of our adjudicators reviewed      
Mr Hs complaint and explained why he thought CarCashPoint made an unfair lending 
decision when providing this loan. 
CarCashPoint didnt respond so the case was passed to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As well as setting out the key rules, regulations and good industry practice, weve explained 
how we handle complaints about unaffordable and/or irresponsible lending on our website. 
Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr Hs complaint. 
Having carefully considered everything Ive been provided with, Im upholding Mr Hs 
complaint. Id like to explain why.
Our adjudicator set out why he thought CarCashPoint made an unfair lending decision when 
providing this loan. As CarCashPoint didnt respond, I dont know what exactly it is it 
disagreed with in our adjudicators assessment or what it thinks he got wrong.
In any event, CarCashPoint will be aware that the rules and regulations, in place at the time 
it lent to Mr H, required it to establish whether Mr H could sustainably make his loan 
repayments. In other words, understand whether Mr H could make his repayments without 
experiencing financial difficulty or borrowing further - not just whether the loan payments 
were technically affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. And Ive seen that the 
bank statements, for Mr H, which CarCashPoint reviewed before providing this loan showed 
payments to a number of payday lenders in the months leading up to this application. Indeed 
these payments took up most of Mr Hs income.
In these circumstances, I dont think that it was fair and reasonable for CarCashPoint to 
conclude that Mr H would more likely than not have been able to make the payments to this 
loan without difficulty or borrowing further. So I think that its decision to lend in these 
circumstances having been provided with what it was provided with was unfair.  
Consequently, and having carefully considered everything provided, I think that 
CarCashPoint unfairly provided Mr H with his logbook loan.   
Fair compensation  what CarCashPoint needs to do to put things right for Mr H
I think it would be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of Mr Hs complaint for 
CarCashPoint to put things right by:
refunding the interest, fees and charges Mr H paid as a result of this loan; 
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded interest, fees and charges 
from the date they were paid by Mr H to the date of settlement;
removing any adverse information placed on Mr Hs credit file because of this loan.
HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to take off tax from this interest. 
CarCashPoint must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Hs complaint. CarCashPoint Limited should 
put things right in the way set out above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 April 2021.
