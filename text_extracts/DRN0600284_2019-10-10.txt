K820x#14complaint
Mr G complains that National  Westminster Bank  plc didnt  process  a chargeback  when he 
disputed a card payment,  but instead simply refunded it.  
background
Mr G noticed a modest card payment (under  Â£2) which he says he didnt recognise.  He 
asked NatWest to exercise  a chargeback.  It didnt  do that, but it did offer to refund the 
payment. Mr G complained to the bank and then to this service, because  he felt the banks 
decision meant that retailers would effectively be allowed  to take any payments they wished.  
Our investigator didnt  agree with Mr G. He discussed the chargeback  rules,  but also noted 
that the retailer had refunded the payment.  He didnt think the bank need do any more to 
resolve Mr Gs complaint. Mr G asked that an ombudsman  review the complaint.   
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  The key point here is that Mr G has had 
his money back.  Hes suffered no loss. The bank and the investigator discussed in a little bit 
of detail their understanding of chargeback rights  which is a process  by which  some  
disputes about card payments can be resolved through  the relevant card scheme.  But, 
whatever the position, I wouldnt award Mr G any more than the value of the disputed 
payment  which hes received. 
Ive no doubt Mr G has been inconvenienced here,  but it was his decision to pursue a 
complaint even after hed received a refund. That was his right, but it wouldnt be fair to ask 
the bank to compensate him for his time. 
my final decision
For these reasons, my final decision is that I dont require National Westminster Bank plc to 
do any more to resolve Mr Gs complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman 
Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or reject my decision before 10 November 2019.
