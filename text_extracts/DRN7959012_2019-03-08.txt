K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains about the length of time it took National Westminster  Bank  Plc to process 
and approve his loan application.
background
Mr S told us that he applied for a loan with NatWest over the phone on 8 November. He said 
that he was already a NatWest customer. He was applying for the loan to consolidate  his 
borrowing. He said that he signed  the paperwork electronically, and was told the money 
would be in his account within two working days, but that didnt happen. He didnt receive the 
money until a week later.  He said that he was contacted by the underwriters in the meantime 
and asked for much more  information. 
Mr S said he complained to NatWest  about  these delays, and it agreed to refund his call 
costs of £10.80  and pay £40 in compensation. Mr S said that didnt make up for his loss. He 
said that he had the option  to take out a loan with lower interest, which wouldve meant  he 
was paying back  about £3 less a month.  He said that if hed realised how long it would take 
to get the loan from NatWest, he wouldve applied for that cheaper loan instead.
NatWest wrote to Mr S and said that he shouldnt have been told over the phone that his 
loan was agreed. He shouldve been told that phone applications can be agreed in principle, 
but would  still be subject to further checks by the underwriting  department. NatWest said that 
it didnt have a recording of the call Mr S had made  to take out his loan, but it accepted  his 
version of events, and apologised if it had given him wrong information  at the end of the call. 
It didnt think it had made a mistake  by asking him for further details after hed made the 
phone application,  but it did think that it shouldve made clear to him on that call that this 
could happen.  
When NatWest wrote  to us, it also said that its terms and conditions make clear  that it will 
only make  a loan available when it is satisfied with any final checks  that it may make. 
Our investigator didnt  uphold this complaint. She said that the loan application that Mr S 
signed also asked  him to confirm that NatWest  may make any enquiries we deem 
necessary to confirm  the accuracy  of the information  provided and for the purpose of credit  
assessment. So she said that NatWest had made him aware that it might ask for more 
information. And the loan was drawn  down within five working days of the application being 
completed. She didnt think this was significantly longer  than the two working days  NatWest 
had, wrongly, suggested  the loan would take to agree. 
Our investigator said that she appreciated that it was frustrating for Mr S to be asked for 
further information, especially as NatWest already held some of this, but she wouldnt 
necessarily expect NatWest to cross reference his loan application with all the other 
information it held for him on other accounts. And she didnt think  that NatWest  had asked  
an unreasonable number of questions  or significantly inconvenienced Mr S in requiring him 
to respond to those.  
Our investigator said that if Mr S was given  the wrong information on his call on 
8 September,  she thought that it had done enough  to make up for that. So she wouldn't ask 
it to do any more.
Ref: DRN79590122Mr S didnt agree with that. He said that he thought this loan would be quicker. And NatWest 
had said it would be quicker on the call he made to take out the loan. Mr S said he didnt 
want to cancel the application  and apply elsewhere  because he didnt want two credit checks 
on his account  close together. He thought he was likely to be refused for a second loan.
Our investigator said that as Mr Ss initial intention was to take out a loan with NatWest, she 
didnt think that she could consider this choice to be a financial loss. And she couldnt see 
that there  were any unreasonable delays.  
Mr S didnt agree. He asked for his case to be considered by an ombudsman,  so it was 
passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive reached the same overall conclusion  
on this complaint as our investigator, and for broadly  the same reasons.
I can understand why Mr S is disappointed. He was an existing NatWest customer, and at 
least some  of the points  that NatWest was asking  Mr S to clear  up were  points  he may have 
expected NatWest to already have some  information on. For example, it asked him the 
source of a credit into his account from a legal  firm. This credit came  from a recent 
remortgage by NatWest, and was paid by solicitors recommended by NatWests remortgage 
team. 
I know that Mr S thinks that this loan shouldve been granted faster.  And he says thats what  
NatWest told him, too. Although we dont  have the call that Mr S made to NatWest to apply 
for the loan, NatWest  says that it would usually tell someone at the end of the call whether 
their loan has been agreed in principle. It has accepted that, at this point, Mr S may have 
been told that the loan would be available within two days. Its paid him £40 for that wrong 
information. I think thats the right amount to make up for this part of his complaint. 
But if Mr S was given wrong  information  about how long his application  would take to be 
approved, it seems likely  that this was after Mr S decided to make this application to 
NatWest. I think  its more  likely than not that Mr S decided to apply to NatWest simply 
because he thought, as he was an existing  customer, it would process his application faster  
than another company would.
It seems  as if Mr S thinks that NatWest shouldve done a better job of this. Ive said I can 
understand why he feels  that. But our role at this service is to provide a fair and reasonable 
outcome to complaints. When a business  has provided an acceptable level of service, then I 
cant require it to do more,  or ask it to pay compensation for not being better. And, in this 
case, I do think that NatWest has provided  an acceptable level of service. I dont think its 
been unfair or unreasonable.  So, although I realise  Mr S will be disappointed, I dont think I 
can reasonably  ask NatWest to do any more than its already  done. 
Im sorry  to have to tell Mr S that this means  I dont think this complaint should  be upheld.
Ref: DRN79590123my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 April 2019.
