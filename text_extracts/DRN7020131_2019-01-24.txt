K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains about how PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA dealt with a number  of 
chargebacks that were  later cancelled.
background
Mr B raised a chargeback with his card provider on about 50 transactions. But he later 
realised the transactions were correct and that his brother  had made  them. Mr B says he 
contacted PayPal to stop the chargebacks but it refused to help him and was obstructive  and 
difficult. He says PayPal refused to stop the chargebacks and gave him and his brother 
conflicting information. Mr B also says he spent a considerable period of time in calling 
PayPal and tried to protect his suppliers.
PayPal says Mr B raised the chargebacks with his card provider. It says it cant return the 
money until it receives authorisation from the card provider which  can take up to 85 days. 
PayPal says its not made a mistake and has acted  in line with the account terms and 
conditions, but as a gesture of goodwill its offered Mr B £50.
Mr B doesnt  accept that offer and says PayPal had received the money back  but didnt 
return it to his suppliers.
Our adjudicator looked into matters and didnt  uphold the complaint. He thought Mr B and his 
brother were responsible  for what happened and PayPal  wasnt  responsible for the 
timescales or the card providers actions. He also thought the money had been refunded  
within a reasonable period of time. 
Mr B didnt accept that view and said in summary  that PayPal knew  it had the money back  
but still acted  to claim it. He says he had to refund one supplier and pay his penalty fee and 
so PayPal should repay him that amount. Mr B says he suffers from health  problems and 
PayPals actions have  affected his recovery. He also says we should  listen to the calls 
between him and PayPal and has provided an e-mail exchange  with his suppliers which he 
says shows that he tried to sort matters out.
I looked at the complaint and decided I wanted further evidence from both parties. I asked 
PayPal to confirm  if all of the suppliers  had received their money back and if it had any call 
recordings. It says it doesnt have any call recordings but has refunded  all of Mr Bs 
suppliers.
I asked Mr B to explain why he thought PayPal knew it had the money  back but still acted  to 
claim it. I also asked  him for details of any suppliers that hadnt received the refund and the 
relevance of the e-mail exchanges.  Mr B says he has already  answered those questions and 
the information is on the calls. He says he would be prepared to accept £150 compensation.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall conclusions  as the investigator  for largely  the same reasons.  I realise Mr B will be 
disappointed by my decision and I appreciate how strongly he feels  about  this complaint.
Ref: DRN70201312Im satisfied that Mr B raised the chargebacks  with his card provider. I think  it likely he 
thought the transactions  must have been fraudulent but then discovered  they had been 
made by his brother.  So in those  circumstances I dont think  PayPal had any choice but to 
follow its terms and conditions, which I think Mr B wouldve agreed to when the account was 
opened. I also think PayPal wouldve had to follow the chargeback rules, which are not set 
by it but the card providers, when the chargeback  was raised  by Mr B.
I appreciate Mr B says he cancelled the chargeback when he realised his mistake.  But I 
think by that point it was too late and the chargeback process had to be followed. Im 
satisfied that PayPal couldnt refund Mr Bs suppliers  until it received notification  from the 
card provider which can take up to 85 days. And Im also satisfied that if that notification  
wasnt received then PayPal couldnt  make those refunds.
I can see that all of the suppliers have  been refunded and so I dont think PayPal has made  
a mistake or delayed those refunds. I appreciate  Mr B says PayPal knew  it had the money 
back but still acted  to claim it. I asked Mr B to explain what he meant  by that comment  and 
how he would know that was the case but hes not done so. I accept Mr B may have been 
told by PayPal that it knew the chargebacks  had been  cancelled.  But for the reasons Ive 
explained I dont  think PayPal could simply stop the chargeback process and was obliged to 
follow the process and wait for the card provider to provide the information.
I have no doubt  Mr B spent a considerable amount  of time trying  to sort matters  out at what  I 
accept was a very difficult time for him. But I think that inconvenience was caused  by Mr B 
mistakenly raising the chargebacks in the first place.
I appreciate Mr B says hes refunded a supplier and so PayPal should  refund him. Im sorry 
to disagree with Mr B but I think thats  a matter between him and the supplier. PayPal has 
refunded that supplier  and if he has been  paid twice then I find thats not the responsibility of 
PayPal and Mr B should approach him for a refund.
Overall Im satisfied PayPal hasnt made a mistake  or acted unfairly here. I find the 
chargebacks were raised by Mr B by mistake but PayPal were obliged  to follow the correct 
procedure. Ive not seen any evidence that Mr Bs suppliers were not paid back.  And make it 
clear that I think the e-mail exchange between Mr B and his suppliers was some time ago 
and shows that his suppliers were  unhappy  with Mr B. I dont think  that exchange provides 
evidence that the suppliers were not eventually  refunded their money.
PayPal has offered to pay Mr B £50 as a gesture of goodwill. For the reasons Ive explained 
I dont think its made  a mistake and so I will leave  it to Mr B to decide  if he wishes to accept 
it.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2019.
