I issued a provisional decision in this complaint on 25 June 2019  partially  upholding Miss Ms 
complaint. Within the decision I made  the following findings:
I felt it was reasonable for Cash Converters  to lend Miss M loans  1-5. This was because 
I could see that the repayment amounts for each of these loans were  affordable  for her 
based on the information she had declared to Cash Converters.  The checks carried  out 
seemed proportionate at this stage. 
But by the time Miss M had asked for loan 6, I think Cash  Converters should have 
carried out a full review  of her finances. I hadnt seen  enough that showed me that it did 
do this. I concluded  that if it had carried  out a full review it would have found  that this 
loan was not affordable for Miss M.
By the time Miss M asked for loan 7 I concluded Cash  Converters should have realised 
that any further lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise  harmful.  And so Cash 
Converters should  have realised that it shouldnt provide  any further  loans. 
I then concluded that Cash  Converters  needed to put things right and pay compensation 
for what it did wrong with loans 6 to 13. 
Ref: DRN07365102my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Miss M confirmed on 15 July 2019 that she agreed  with my decision and had nothing further 
to add.
Cash Converters responded on 08 July 2019 and offered to put things right. 
As Miss M has nothing  further to add and Cash Converters has not been  in contact with any 
additional points,  I dont need to make any further comments or depart  from my findings.  So I 
uphold Miss Ms complaint and Cash Converters now needs to put things right.
what the business should  do to put things right
I dont think Cash Converters should have agreed to lend to Miss M after, and including, the 
loan that she took on 04.05.2012 (loan  6) up to 13.11.12 (loan 12). So for each of those 
loans Cash Converters should;
Refund any interest and charges (including  late fees) applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Miss Ms credit file in relation to loan 6.
The number of loans  taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  7 to 12 should be removed from Miss Ms 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash Converters to take off tax from this interest. Cash 
Converters must give Miss M a certificate  showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for 
one.
Cash Converters should honour its offer to write off the outstanding balance  owed by Miss M 
on loan 13. It should  also remove any information recorded by loan 13 on Miss Ms credit  
file.
my final decision
For the above reasons, I uphold this complaint and direct Cash Converters UK Limited  to 
pay Miss M fair compensation  in accordance  with the above  calculation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 August 2019.
