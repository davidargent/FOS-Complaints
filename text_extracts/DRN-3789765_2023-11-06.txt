The complaint
The estate of the late Mr K complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as 
Barclays Partner Finance, wont refund to it the money that the late Mr K paid for some 
holiday club membership points. The late Mr Ks wife is also involved in this complaint and 
the estate is being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr K and his wife bought two holiday club memberships from a holiday company in July 
2007. The purchase price was £24,984 and Mr K entered into a fixed sum loan agreement 
with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that amount. He agreed to make 120 monthly 
repayments of £304.44 to Barclays Partner Finance. Mr K repaid that loan in January 2012.
Mr K and his wife bought six more holiday club memberships from the holiday company in 
July 2008. The purchase price was £10,950 and Mr Ks wife entered into a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that amount. The loan was repaid in 
March 2015. 
Mr K and his wife bought two more holiday club memberships from the holiday company in 
July 2009 and the estates representative says that Mr K and his wife traded in the two 
memberships that theyd bought in July 2007. They agreed to pay £13,941 to the holiday 
company and Mr K entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance 
for a loan of that amount. Mr K repaid that loan in January 2012. 
The estates representative says that Mr K and his wife traded in four of the memberships 
that theyd bought in July 2008 for another membership in July 2011. The estates 
representative says Mr K and his wife then traded in that membership and the other two 
memberships that theyd bought in July 2008 for another membership in July 2012 and they 
also paid a purchase price of £4,500. 
Mr K and his wife bought two more holiday club memberships from the holiday company in 
June 2015 and the estates representative says that they traded in their other remaining 
membership. The total purchase price was £18,000. Mr K entered into a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of £11,000 and Mr Ks wife entered into 
a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of £7,000. 
The estates representative made claims, on behalf of Mr K, to Barclays Partner Finance 
under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in May 2020 about some of 
the . It said that the products were misrepresented to Mr K and his wife; the contract was 
breached; commission was paid between Barclays Partner Finance and the holiday 
company which wasnt disclosed to Mr K and his wife which created a breach of fiduciary 
duty and caused an unfair relationship; the loan was unaffordable; and the holiday company 
filed for liquidation in December 2019 so was in breach of contract.
Barclays Partner Finance didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so a 
complaint was made to this service. The complaint form says that the holiday company and 
Barclays Partner Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mr K and his wifes ability 
to afford the loans; Barclays Partner Finance paid commissions to the holiday company 
which werent declared to them and the holiday company unduly pressured them into 
entering into agreements; all rendering the loan agreements unfair pursuant to section 140A. 
The estates representative repeated those claims in relation to the July 2007 agreements in 
March 2021 but Barclays Partner Finance said that the claims about those agreements were 
time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980. It then said that it didnt accept Mr Ks and his 
wifes claims about the other agreements but offered redress as a gesture of goodwill in 
relation to the loan that had been made to Mr Ks wife in July 2008 and the outstanding loans 
which had been made to Mr K and to his wife in June 2015. It offered to: refund all payments 
made towards the loans, with interest; refund any maintenance fees paid for the years in 
which the memberships werent utilised (subject to provision of evidence of those payments 
and usage), with interest; and cancel any outstanding loan repayments and their contracts 
with the holiday company. 
One of our investigators considered Mr Ks wifes complaint about Barclays Partner 
Finances response to the claims that had been made to it about her June 2015 loan 
separately and Mr Ks wife accepted Barclays Partner Finances offer about that loan. Mr K 
accepted Barclays Partner Finances offer about the June 2015 loan that had been made to 
him and his wife also accepted the offer of redress that Barclays Partner Finance made to 
her about the July 2008.
Another of our investigators considered Mr Ks complaint about Barclays Partner Finances 
response to the claims that had been made to it about the July 2007 and the July 2009 
loans. She didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She thought that Barclays 
Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of the section 75 misrepresentation claim 
and of the section 140A claim to turn them down. She said that she hadnt seen sufficient 
evidence to demonstrate that Mr K and his wife still owned the memberships that theyd 
bought in July 2007 and July 2009 at the time that the holiday company went into liquidation 
and that she couldnt say that there had been a breach of contract. She also said that she 
hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr K.
The estates representative has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says, in summary, that:
the late Mr K and his wife were involved in a perpetual cycle of mis-selling with 
constant promises that their investment would come to fruition and the products were 
upgraded with the assistance of finance to the ultimate goal of premium membership;
Mr K and his wife were 72 when they entered this cycle and had expected to sell their 
assets years ago but are still making repayments out of their pensions with no return 
on their "investment";
Barclays Partner Finance facilitated this with the provision of loan agreements and a 
complete absence of appropriate enquiries as to how Mr K and his wife were 
sustaining repayments from their combined annual pension income of £28,000;
over a period of eight years Barclays Partner Finance provided Mr K and his wife with 
loans of about £70,000 plus interest from an income of £28,000 and it fails to see 
how thats responsible lending;
the holiday company sought to mislead Mr K and his wife as they believed they were 
investing their pension into property to be sold at a later date and the true nature of 
the product was concealed and misrepresented so the period of limitation does not 
begin to run until they discovered the concealment or could with reasonable diligence 
have discovered it under section 32 of the Limitation Act; andall previous purchases were part of the larger purchase in 2015 so the loans provided 
by Barclays Partner Finance form part of the contracts made in June 2015.
Mr K sadly passed away in November 2022.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that the estate of the late Mr Ks complaint 
shouldnt be upheld for these reasons:
I understand that Barclays Partner Finance made five loans to Mr K and his wife 
between July 2007 and June 2015, that it made offers of redress to them relating to 
three of those fives loan and that those offers have been accepted;
the other two loans are the loan in the amount of £24,984 that was made to Mr K in 
July 2007 and the loan in the amount of £13,941 that was made to him in July 2009  
and in this decision Im only considering those two loans;
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
the estates complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that 
had made to it and I accept that the complaint was referred to this service within six 
years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to 
the claims;
the claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
the claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company and that the memberships were misrepresented to Mr K and his wife and 
that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented to them - if 
the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would be 
expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr K would have been able to make a claim to the holiday company or 
Barclays Partner Finance about any misrepresentations that could have induced him 
and his wife into entering into the agreements in July 2007 and July 2009 to buy the 
memberships no later than the times that they entered into those agreements as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations about those memberships would 
have been made to them and any loss would have been incurred as that was when 
Mr K also entered into the loan agreements with Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that Mr Ks cause of action would have accrued at that time, so he would 
have had six years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the 
holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt 
made until May 2020, more than six years later so was outside of the time limits set 
out in the Limitation Act and I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a defence 
to such a claim and I find that it wasnt unreasonable for it to have rejected the 
misrepresentation claim that was made to it relating to the July 2007 loan and that it 
wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have rejected the misrepresentation claim 
that was made to it relating to the July 2009 loan;
the estates representative says that the holiday company sought to mislead Mr K 
and his wife and that information was deliberately concealed from them so the time 
limits are postponed under section 32;
section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been 
deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the 
debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have 
been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a 
breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate 
concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
deliberate concealment of any relevant information in these circumstances so I dont 
consider that section 32 is applicable to the estates claims; 
the time limit for a breach of contract claim is also six years from the date on which 
the cause of action accrued  the estates representative says that the holiday 
company filed for liquidation in December 2019 so was in breach of contract - a 
breach of contract claim was made in May 2020 so I consider that the claim was 
made in time;
the estates representative says that Mr K and his wifes only remaining memberships 
at the time that the holiday company closed were the two memberships that theyd 
bought in June 2015 but that their previous purchases were part of the larger 
purchase in June 2015 and the loans provided by Barclays Partner Finance form part 
of the contracts entered into in June 2015;
Mr K and his wife signed an exchange check list in June 2015 which says: I/We, 
confirm that I/we are relinquishing the above ownership(s)/membership(s); and the 
membership that theyd bought in July 2012 was specified  they also signed the 
holiday companys customer compliance statement which says: We understand that 
on exchanging to our new apartment(s)/level(s) we agree to relinquish the timeshare 
ownership/membership of our previous apartment(s)/level(s):; and the membership 
that theyd bought in July 2012 was again specified;
Mr K and his wife also signed an information document in June 2015 which said that 
the purchase price to be paid by them for acquiring the rights to the membership that 
they were buying at that time was £18,000 and Ive seen nor reference to those 
memberships being given a higher price or value;
I consider it to be clear that Mr K and his wife had relinquished the membership that 
theyd bought in July 2012 and Ive seen no evidence to show that theyd traded in 
that membership or that it had been given any value when theyd bought the 
membership in June 2015 so Im not persuaded that the price that theyd paid for 
their previous memberships was included in the price that they paid for the memberships that they bought in June 2015;
I also consider it to be clear that Mr K and his wife no longer owned the memberships 
that theyd bought in July 2007 and July 2009 when the holiday company stopped 
trading so Im not persuaded that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company relating to those memberships or that it would be fair or reasonable for me 
to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to the estate any of the money that 
Mr K and his wife had paid for those memberships as a result of the holiday company 
stopping trading;
the complaint form says that the holiday company and Barclays Partner Finance 
failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mr K and his wifes ability to afford the 
loans; Barclays Partner Finance paid commissions to the holiday company which 
werent declared to them and the holiday company unduly pressured them into 
entering into agreements; all rendering the loan agreements unfair pursuant to 
section 140A;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that the July 2007 and July 
2009 loans were repaid in January 2012 and Ive seen no evidence to show that the 
loans continued after January 2012 so I consider that the loan agreements ended in 
January 2012;
Mr K would have had six years from then to bring a section 140A claim against 
Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made until May 2020, more than eight 
years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act, so I 
consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a defence to the section 140A claim and 
that it wasnt unreasonable for it to have rejected the section 140A claim that was 
made to it relating to the July 2007 loan and that it wouldnt have been unreasonable 
for it to have rejected the section 140A claim that was made to it relating to the July 
2009 loan;
the estates representatives May 2020 letter says that the loans were unaffordable 
and the complaint form says the holiday company and Barclays Partner Finance 
failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mr K and his wifes ability to afford the 
loans;
Barclays Partner Finance hasnt provided any information about the affordability 
checks that it conducted for the July 2007 and July 2009 loans but the estates 
representative says that Mr K and his wifes combined annual pension income was 
£28,000 but it hasnt provided any information about their expenditure or evidence to 
show that the loans werent affordable for Mr K;
the July 2007 loan was for an amount of £24,984 with a monthly repayment of 
£304.44 and the loan account statement shows that Mr K made the monthly 
repayment each month until January 2012 when the loan was repaid by a payment of 
£16,484.12
the July 2009 loan was for an amount of £13,941 and from the evidence that Ive 
seen it looks as though the monthly payment was £172.90 and that Mr K made the monthly payment each month until January 2012 when the loan was repaid by a 
payment of £11,769.96;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the loans werent affordable for Mr K when they 
were made to him or that he asked Barclays Partner Finance for any information 
about its affordability assessment before May 2020  as the loans were made to him 
in July 2007 and July 2009 and were repaid in January 2012, I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect him to have raised any concerns about the affordability of 
the loans before then;
Barclays Partner Finance said that the claims about the July 2007 agreements were 
time-barred under the Limitation Act and I consider that to have been a fair and 
reasonable response to those claims;
it has offered to: refund all payments made towards Mr Ks June 2015 loan, with 
interest; refund any maintenance fees paid for the years in which the membership 
wasnt utilised (subject to provision of evidence of those payments and usage), with 
interest; and cancel any outstanding loan repayments and his contract with the 
holiday company  I understand that that offer was accepted by Mr K before he 
passed away so theres no need for me to make any finding on the complaint about 
Barclays Partner Finances response to the claims that had been made to it about 
that loan;
Barclays Partner Finance hasnt issued a substantive response to the claims that 
were made to it relating to the July 2009 loan so I cant say that its response to those 
claims was fair and reasonable  but if it had properly considered those claims I 
consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it not to have upheld them; 
and
I sympathise with Mr Ks wife and the estate for the loss of Mr K, for the issues that 
theyve had with the memberships and the other difficulties that Mr Ks wife has 
experienced, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to the estate any of the money 
that was paid under the July 2007 and July 2009 loan agreements, to pay it any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to this complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold the estate of the late Mr Ks complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask a representative of 
the estate of the late Mr K to accept or reject my decision before 4 December 2023.
