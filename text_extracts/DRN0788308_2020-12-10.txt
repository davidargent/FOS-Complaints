K820x#14Complaint
Mr T complains about problems he had using his National Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest) 
current account. 
Background
In December 2018, Mr T switched his current account from a different bank to NatWest. 
Shortly after this, Mr T received a text message from NatWest saying the account was ready 
for use but Mr T says he didnt have full details of his account that point.  So he says he 
couldnt use it and NatWest shouldnt have told him he could  in this message. 
Then in early  January 2019, Mr T tried to access his account via telephone  banking, online 
banking and also tried to make a transfer out of his NatWest account. But he found he 
couldnt do so and then his online and telephone  banking was blocked. So NatWest asked 
him to go to a branch with identification and it took him a few days  to get access to his 
money. 
Mr T was unhappy with the amount  of time he spent  on the phone dealing  with this, and 
when he first called   NatWest didnt  log the call straightaway. He also thought one of the 
people he spoke to at NatWest was rude. He also wasnt  happy  he had to attend  the branch 
and that when he got there, the bank wouldnt make the transaction  he wanted to. 
NatWest agreed that it hadnt handled  things as well as it could have. So it offered  Mr T:
£42.60 to cover the cost of phone  calls
£21 for travel
£30 in recognition of not contacting Mr T about  his loss of earnings  claim
£25 for not logging  Mr Ts initial call about  the text message issue
£58.77 in recognition of the overall  worry and inconvenience caused
Mr T wasnt happy with this because he said hed had to take time off work to sort things  out, 
so he wanted  £250 to reflect his loss of earnings.  He referred his complaint to our service.
An Investigator considered what had happened  and said, in summary, he thought  what 
NatWest had already  done to put things right was fair in the circumstances.  He said this 
because most of the problems Mr T had experienced in accessing  his account had been 
caused by security issues. 
Mr T said didnt  agree,  he said he didnt think it was fair that his account had been blocked in 
the circumstances. As Mr T didnt agree, the complaints been passed to me. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I dont think  NatWest 
need to pay Mr T any further compensation, Ill explain why. 
Mr T applied  to switch his account on 3 December 2018. Mr Ts account was opened on 
11 December 2018. Mr Ts first concern was that he received a text message saying he 
could use his account  but he didnt know his full account number and sort code at this 
point, so he couldnt in fact use the account.  I dont know  when Mr T received the text 
Ref: DRN07883082message from NatWest, but I can see it sent his card and PIN by first class post on 
11 December 2018. And the card wouldve had the sort code and account number on it, so I 
dont think Mr T would likely have been without this information for more than a few days 
after hed received the text message. 
NatWest has explained  that the full account number  isnt included in text messages for 
security reasons  which I dont  think is unreasonable. And Ive not seen anything to suggest 
Mr T contacted NatWest to ask for the account  information in order to use it. So although I 
understand why Mr T would feel he couldnt have used the account  despite receiving a text 
message saying he could  I dont think NatWest made a mistake by doing  this. The account  
was in fact open and ready for use, even if Mr T hadnt yet received his full account details. 
On 2 January  2019, Mr T called NatWest about this. Ive listened to the call. During the 
conversation, the call handler  agrees  with Mr Ts point that he had tried to raise  this issue 
previously but it hadnt been logged. And he offered  Mr T £25 in recognition of this  I think 
this is reasonable  to reflect the fact that Mr Ts initial call about this wasnt properly logged.  
But he didnt  agree that NatWest had made a mistake by sending the text message. Mr T 
thought the call handler was rude during this call and NatWest  agreed in its final response 
letter that the call handler hadnt  handled  things appropriately and apologised to Mr T for this 
in that letter.  Again, I think this is appropriate  in the circumstances. 
NatWests records show that Mr T tried to log in to his telephone banking on 2 January but 
entered the wrong PIN a number of times.  Which resulted in this facility being  blocked. Then 
Mr Ts online banking access was blocked because, during a webchat, Mr T gave NatWest a 
different name and so it had concerns someone  who wasnt  Mr T  was trying to access  
his account. 
I understand that because of this Mr T then had to visit a branch to get the account 
unblocked, and that this was inconvenient  for him. But given the incorrect  login attempts 
across telephone and internet banking  as well as the incorrect  information  being given 
during a webchat, I dont think it was unreasonable for NatWest  to limit access in these  
circumstances to protect Mr Ts account.  Nonetheless, NatWest  has offered to cover Mr Ts 
travel costs related  to his visits to the branch. 
Mr T was then unhappy that when he did attend  the branch  the withdrawal he was trying to 
make was refused  and that he was given  incorrect information about using card readers. 
NatWest has provided its notes, and it had concerns  about the circumstances of the 
transaction Mr T was trying to make. And given what had already  happened,  again I dont 
find this was unreasonable. So although Mr T couldnt access his money  on the day he 
wanted to, I dont think NatWest was wrong  to do this in the circumstances. It appears from 
the statements  that Mr T then withdrew  the money he wanted  in batches over a number of 
days at ATMs. NatWest also accepts that what it told Mr T about card readers wasnt 
correct.
Overall I dont think NatWest did anything wrong  by sending  the text message, blocking 
access to Mr Ts accounts and asking him to come  to the branch with ID  given the 
concerns it had. So I dont think it needs to pay Mr T compensation for these  things or cover 
the amount he says he lost by taking time off work to attend the branch. 
But, I do agree that NatWest wasnt as helpful  as it could  have been when Mr T contacted it 
for help with these  issues. Having considered  all the circumstances of the case, and for the 
Ref: DRN07883083reasons Ive explained above, I find what NatWest has already offered  Mr T is fair and 
reasonable to recognise the distress  and inconvenience caused. 
My final decision
NatWest has already offered to pay £177.37  to the settle the complaint. For the reasons Ive 
explained, I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.  
My final decision is National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr T £177.37, if it hasnt done 
so already. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 January 2021.
