K821x#15complaint
I issued a provisional decision in this complaint about HSBC UK Bank plc (trading as First 
Direct) on 6 July 2021. It contains the relevant background  information and sets out my 
provisional findings. For completeness, a copy is annexed to this final decision. 
background
In brief summary, I was minded to partly uphold this complaint about disputed  transactions 
(for the purchase of binary options) on the basis that they constituted unusual or 
uncharacteristic activity  for Mr L and/or his account,  so ought reasonably to have triggered 
HSBCs potential fraud alerts. Ifin  line with various regulatory duties (and good industry 
practice)HSBC had contacted Mr L before executing his payment instructions, most  of his 
losses would  probably have been prevented. For example,  a warning about the high-risk  of 
scams associated with binary-options trading would probably have caused Mr L to 
investigate such unlicensed,  unregulated  investments and/or the purported trader  more 
closely  and stopped him from making further  payments. 
However, I also concluded that Mr L did share  20% responsibility for what happened, so my 
proposed compensation award  was reduced accordingly. I did not think  HSBC could 
reasonably have been triggered until the third scammed payment, so Mr L would  also have 
to forgo  his first two losses totalling  £10,000. The total award I had in mind  (net of interest  
and/or tax deductions) was £120,600. 
The above  is not a substitute for my full reasons, so I would urge the parties to re-read my 
provisional decision (below) before proceeding. 
responses
Mr L has not added anything further, so I assume he is happy  with my proposed  outcome for 
resolving his complaint.  Our investigator  has phoned him three times to check whether he 
wishes to comment on the provisional decision  but has received no reply. Accordingly, in 
line with rules and guidance in DISP  3.5.8 to 3.5.15 of the Financial Conduct Authority 
Handbook, I will proceed to the next stage on the basis of the information  I already have. 
HSBC disagrees with my provisional decision and has made further submissions. I have 
carefully read and digested those submissions in full  but HSBC has helpfully summarised 
its key points, which, in the interest  of conciseness, I now repeat (making only essential 
grammatical changes):
The provisional decision as to HSBCs conduct is inconsistent with recently  clarified 
legal standards.  There is no explanation for the preference of guidance over legal 
and regulatory  standards;
The provisional decision retrospectively creates and imposes  on HSBC obligations 
which it could not possibly have been aware of at the time.  This is neither fair nor 
reasonable;
There is a striking  lack of detail as regards the background of this complaint and only 
limited information on key issues has been provided in support, which raises further 
concerns. It is worrying that the provisional  decision does  not address that Mr L was 
apparently concerned  from an early stage that transactions were being  processed 
without his consent but did nothing  to address this;
Ref: DRN58389662The provisional findings in respect of HSBCs actions  are unrealistic and unfair.  It is 
also unclear from where the ombudsman derived  the information  which  forms the 
basis for his conclusions; and
Mr L should bear at least 50% responsibility for the loss that he has suffered, and it is 
fair and reasonable that he should  do so. As noted in the HSBC Response,  Mr L 
does not appear  to have carried out even cursory  research,  and that was despite 
having concerns  as noted in the provisional  decision.
findings
I have reconsidered  all the evidence and arguments in light of HSBCs  response in order to 
decide what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint. Having done 
so, I remain of the view that this complaint  should  largely be upheld  for the reasons that 
follow:
1.I was mindful of the High Court judgment  referred to by HSBCPhilipp v Barclays Bank 
plc [2021] EWHC 10 (Comm)even though I did not cite it. But we have previously  
explained to HSBC that we are aware  the judge  took a different view about the 
Quincecare duty on a bank in that case.  However, I am not suggesting the Quincecare 
duty applies to this case. And notwithstanding  what  the judge  said, we have a duty to 
resolve complaints  based on what we think is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of the case,  taking into account  not just the law, but also regulators rules 
and guidance,  relevant codes  of practice  and what I consider to have  been  good industry 
practice at the time.
2.Indeed, DISP Rule 3.6.1 of the Financial Conduct Authority  Handbook states that, The 
Ombudsman will determine  a complaint  by reference to what  is, in his opinion, fair and 
reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. This wide remit is further  clarified in 
DISP Rule 3.6.4:
In considering what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, the 
Ombudsman will take into account:
(1) relevant:
(a) law and regulations;
(b) regulators rules, guidance and standards;
(c) codes of practice; and
(2) (where appropriate) what he considers to have been good industry practice  at the relevant 
time.
3.The judges in the Philipp and Quincecare cases were restricted  to deciding the issues 
before them  as pleaded by the parties  in an adversarial process  with strict  evidential  
rules. It is unclear from those judgments  whether they were  invited to consider, in detail 
or at all, the overall  regulatory  landscape  or general principles of good industry practice. 
Our wider investigatory remit permits us to take account of such  matters irrespective of 
whether they are expressly raised  by the parties;  and to depart from the law if needs be 
(albeit with an explanation  as to why, for the reasons set out in a judicial-review case 
brought by Aviva, now mentioned by HSBC). 
4.However, we have explained to HSBC on numerous occasions  why our approach to 
fraud and scams is not inconsistent with the strict legal position; and why it is fair and 
reasonable for a bank or Payment Services Provider  (PSP) to take reasonable, limited 
steps to safeguard its customers in line with the prevailing regulatory  and industry  
Ref: DRN58389663standards at the relevant  time (see, for example, paragraph 15 of my provisional 
decision, below). That includes taking reasonable steps to guard against the risks of 
money-laundering and terrorism, which have been legal requirements for many  years 
now, and long before  the events that are the subject-matter of this dispute. HSBC ought 
to take account  of and follow our approach in line with its complaint-handling  obligations 
in DISP 1.4. If it vehemently  disagrees with our approach or an individual decision,  it has 
the option of bringing a judicial  review. What it should not do is challenge each and every  
case, as this hinders our statutory obligation  to resolve disputes quickly and with 
minimum formality. 
5.In order to uphold  this case, it is not necessary to conclude that HSBC breached its 
obligations in law  and I made  no finding  that it did. I am mindful of the strict legal 
position; but it is still fair and reasonable to conclude that a regulated bank  or PSP has 
wider obligations such as those which I and other ombudsmen have set out beforein  
order to protect customers from the risk of fraud and financial harm. 
6.I do not accept that I created or held HSBC to retrospective standards of which  it could 
not reasonably  have  been aware at the time of the disputed transactions.  HSBC  has 
mentioned a BSI Code  but it has conceded that I did not cite that in my provisional  
decision nor allude to it. I accept  that that Code was not published at the relevant time, 
which is why it formed no part of my rationale. 
7.HSBC also takes issue with my comments on regulatory alerts published by the FCA 
and/or the International Organization of Securities Commissions  (IOSCO):
This effectively creates a retrospective obligation  on us, as a PSP, not to process any 
payments to a merchant  that has been the subject of a FCA warning  or IOSCO alert one 
month or more prior to the date of the payment without first conducting an investigation into 
that payment. This is deeply concerning  because  no such obligation  exists  and there would 
have been no way for us to have  known at the time that we would be held responsible on the 
basis of such a duty imposed by your service several  years after the event. You seek  to do 
this in reliance  on general comments as to what constituted good industry  practice in 2012 
FSA guidance (which did not create any legal or regulatory standards requiring us to flag 
transactions based on IOSCO  alerts).  It is neither fair nor reasonable to hold us liable on the 
basis of such ex post facto obligations.
8.This is a specious argument. There is no retrospective application of obligations  here. A 
regulated firm has always been  obliged, if only as a matter  of good practice, to take 
account of alerts  published by the regulators  for the reasons set out in the 2012  FSA 
guidance that I previously cited. It is neither onerous  nor unfair  for an international bank 
to maintain a watchlist of potentially  fraudulent or illegally-operating payees; nor to pause 
any payments directed  to such persons rather than simply execute the instructions of lay 
clients with less knowledge and expertise. It is true I concluded that a one-month  grace 
period from publication might  be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  but that 
merely operates in favour  of firms to give them time to update  their systems. Within the 
spectrum of reasonable conclusions, I could  equally have concluded that, in this day and 
age, electronic alerts should be acted upon more quickly. I am satisfied that it is fair and 
reasonable for a large corporate  body to update its fraud  alerts and watchlists  within  a 
month of a regulator publishing an alert. HSBC has given  no good reason why this is not 
the case. I still think it would be unreasonable to expect a firm to act immediately on an 
alert because  that would not take account of the commercial  realities  and logistics  faced 
by bodies corporate.  
Ref: DRN583896649.On the specific facts of this case,  I was satisfied  that Mr L would probably  have  acted 
differently if HSBC had intervened  or given a warning (in line with its duty to act fairly and 
reasonably)  and that he was only 20% to blame for what  happened.  HSBC  has not 
specified what further detail it seeks, but it has had many  months  to investigate this case 
and submit its defence. It has access to all the information before me. There  is no 
evidence before me which  HSBC has not seen  or itself presented. The background 
circumstances were  also set out in some detail in our investigators initial assessment of 
24 July 2020,  which HSBC did not materially contradict. 
10.In summary, Mr L said (and here I largely  repeat the investigators summary): He 
invested his money with 23Traders as he was about to retire and wanted to increase his 
pension income.  To do so, he used the money he had saved for his pension. He does 
not remember how he entered  into contact  with 23Traders. His 23Traders account first 
built up steadily over a few months,  to reach  an apparent peak of about £460,000.  Then, 
following a particular  dealing,  the whole sum was apparently lost. Around the same time, 
he was diagnosed with cancer and had to go to hospital. He was in and out of hospital 
for two years. The trades  followed  a pattern of building  up and then losing it over a 
period of a month.  All the transactions were  made over the phone. 23Traders brokers  
would call him before a transaction  and send him an email with an authorisation form to 
sign and return.  They would only inform Mr L afterwards of how much  it had cost.  He did 
not realise there would be so many transactions  and it would amount  to as much  as it 
did. Trading decisions were made by the trader not by him. The performance varied 
hugely. 
11.Mr L said he only used the platform to follow the success/failure of the trades entered  by 
the traders. He could never reach  23Traders by phone. They had kept his card details 
(long card number and CVV) and continued  to make  transactions.  In order to take the 
investment to the next level and to get a better percentage,  they encouraged him to 
invest more. Mr L explained: Its like getting into a lane which  you cant get off, it goes 
on and on and on, they always  make  excuses for you to invest again. He wanted to put 
in place monthly withdrawals of £5,000  or £10,000 but they never replied positively to 
that request.  He felt he did not have  control on the withdrawals. The withdrawals  were  
minimal compared with the amount deposited.  The merchant presented  themselves  on 
the internet as a brokerage firm but (he later discovered) they are not a registered 
brokerage/investment firm and, therefore, were not authorised  to provide the service he 
had paid for. He never received the terms and conditions as they only appeared on 
23Traders website. He only realised  it was a scam after speaking  to his financial adviser 
who warned him about it. He believes he spoke to HSBC  before to mention his concerns,  
but it never warned him about 23Traders or mentioned any concerns. The bank did not 
tell him 23Traders were unregulated. He also invested £43,143 with another merchant 
(53Capital) in March  2017 and June 2017. When he tried to withdraw money,  that 
merchant did not allow it either. But Mr L did not raise  a chargeback  claim for that 
investment as, at the time, his energy was focused on 23Traders and on his health.
12.I accept  that Mr L probably could and should have done more  to protect himself and/or 
act on his concerns  (e.g. when he was apparently  losing a lot of money and not in control 
of or receiving responses to withdrawal requests)  but that is why I made  a deduction  
for contributory negligence. Given the relative  knowledge and expertise of the two 
parties, Mr Ls own failings do not wipe out HSBCs responsibilities  as the financial 
professional in the relationship. I also appreciate there are gaps in Mr Ls account. But 
this is unsurprising  given  the passage of time,  Mr Ls age and vulnerability, and the 
intangible nature  of the online product in which he was trying to invest,  which he was 
Ref: DRN58389665unfamiliar with. There is nothing to indicate that Mr L has not tried his best to give a full 
and frank account of his dealings  and he has made  concessions  as to his conduct 
which simultaneously  undermine his case but bolster his credibility as an honest and 
reliable witness. 
13.For the reasons explained above and before (and by other ombudsmen in other  cases),  
it is not unrealistic to expect a bank to intervene  when  a customers authorised payments 
suddenly change  pattern and become unusual or uncharacteristic  when compared with 
the way the account  has been run in recent  times.  Such  activity  is a clear indicator of 
potential fraud, so triggers the banks obligations  to monitor and undertake due diligence, 
which are independent  of any duties the customer may also owe.  I accept HSBCs point 
that an unusual  transaction is not necessarily  suspicious. But I never  suggested that. I 
set out all the disputed transactions; and it was clear from those that there was a pattern  
which, viewed in context  and in light of the regulatory alert about 23Traders, merited  
closer investigation  by a responsible bank. For example,  on his first two days  of 
tradingthe 1st and 6th of February 2017 Mr L made eight payments to the same  new 
international payee of £5,000 each, totalling  £40,000. This was certainly  suspicious,  as it 
could have been an attempt to get around the anti-money-laundering threshold  of 
£10,000 (which  banks should  monitor).  If HSBC had investigated at the time, it would or 
should have realised the payments were  going  to a trader  who had, at that time, been  
the subject-matter of an IOSCO alert just a week before.  I cannot  accept HSBCs 
assertion that there was nothing to be suspicious about. And of course,  HSBC  was 
triggered enough to contact Mr L on 28 February 2017 (after  further  payments)  but 
only to confirm his ID. This implies  a failure in its protocols or processes for guarding 
against fraud. There was something potentially suspicious and serious going on but 
HSBC was only concerned to check  the payments  were authorised.  
14.HSBC has questioned  the relevance  and logic of my citing  its call to Mr L of 11 April 
2017, given that this was long after most of the disputed transactions. However, it is 
wrong to suggest  that I found  this call to be determinative of liability.  This is a 
misrepresentation of my findings.  In fact, I said (under  the heading causation):
If HSBC had asked Mr L what  the payments were for and the basic surrounding context,  it is 
likely he would have  fully explained what he was doing and that everything had been done 
over the phone and online  with his broker.  Whilst HSBC may not have known  for certain 
whether Mr L was dealing with a fraudulent binary-options trader  or investing in a legitimate  
(albeit highly speculative) product, it ought reasonably  to have  provided a scam warning in 
light of all the information then known  to financial professionals about  the risks associated  
with unregulated, overseas  binary options. Indeed, HSBC and Mr L spoke by phone on 11 
April 2017  about his application for a £30,000 bridging loan or overdraft, and he 
volunteered lots of information about his binary-options dabblingand expressed 
some misgivings about 23Traders responsiveness (see contributory  negligence 
below)which was a perfect opportunity for HSBC  to give a potential scam  warning, 
especially as its representative  declined  the application (after  reviewing his 
transactions and referring to a manager), saying that the bank did not understand nor 
cover that type of investment.
15.The purpose of discussing  that call was simply to show  that, if Mr L had been called, he 
would have told the truth about what he was doing  thereby  giving  HSBC  a fair chance  to 
warn him or intervene. In other words, it goes not to HSBCs liability or breach of duty but 
to the question of causation . It did not take much probing  for the bank to be told about 
the binary-options trading, so had similar  questioning taken place at the outset (when  I 
think it should have  been),  the bank would have  been in a position to warn and prevent 
Ref: DRN58389666further losses. In other words, but for the failure to question, and then potentially the 
failure to act on answers (we do not understand or cover that type of investment), Mr L 
would probably  not have  suffered the losses he did. 
16.Apportioning liability for contributory  negligence is not an exact  science. There  will be 
cases where a 50% deduction is warranted.  I fully accepted that Mr L could have done 
more to protect himself; that consumers have to take responsibility  for their own 
decisions; and that Mr L must bear some  blameworthiness for what  happened because, 
as HSBC points  out, he was investing  large sums  in a high-risk, unregulated product and 
had neglected  to consult his financial adviser until too late. Mr L is having his 
compensation reduced because I am satisfied  he foresaw some risk of this type of harm 
but proceeded nevertheless.  However, it would be unfair  to reduce  compensation too 
much, as Mr L was elderly and vulnerable at the time. He was a consumer unfamiliar 
with such matters.  HSBC may have  in mind another recent decision of mine in which  I 
made a 50% deduction. But that was entirely different as the duped customer  was not a 
consumer but a body corporate which had delegated the handling of its account to a 
professional third party. In the case of Singularis Holdings Ltd v Daiwa Capital Markets 
Europe Ltd [2019] UKSC  50interestingly  applying Quincecare in favour of the 
commercial customer  (a case bristling with simplicity , as Lady Hale said)the 
Supreme Court  only made a deduction of 25% for contributory negligence. So it seems 
to me a deduction  of 20% in this particular consumer case is fair and reasonable. Each 
case must be decided on its individual facts and circumstances. 
17.In my judgment,  a 20% deduction  is appropriate,  and I have seen nothing  to persuade 
me to the contrary. Mr L was not, as HSBC asserts, incredibly reckless; he was just 
less careful than he ought reasonably  to have been  for the reasons set out previously. 
final decision
For the reasons  set out above and before, I have decided to uphold this complaint. I 
therefore require  HSBC UK Bank  plc to refund to Mr L all of his stolen payments save  the 
first two (totalling £10,000)  but subject to a 20% deduction for contributory negligence.
As Mr L also received  £14,250 in pay-out inducements from 23Traders, the losses  
outstanding total £150,750, so 80% of that would amount to an award of £120,600.
This was a savings account, so HSBC should add interest to that sum (less any tax properly 
deductible) at the relevant  account rate(s) from the respective dates of loss to the date of 
refund. For the avoidance of doubt (in case it becomes relevant despite my reduction for 
contributory negligence), our statutory cap of £150,000 does  not include interest or costs, 
which can be awarded over and above  that sum.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr L (or those 
authorised by him or in law to represent  him) to accept or reject my decision before 
11 September 2021.

complaint
Mr L complains  about his bank, HSBC UK Bank plc (trading as First Direct). He says the 
bank failed to protect  him from financial harm caused by a company  called  23Traders.com.  
He alleges they were scammers  posing as binary-options traders, as a result of which he 
lost around £160,000. He is unhappy with how a chargeback claim was handled and 
communicated; and with HSBCs ultimate  closure of his account after 20 years  custom. 
HSBC denies  responsibility for the loss. Its position,  broadly, is that Mr L authorised all the 
payments to 23Traders and reassured  the bank of his intentions when it phoned him on 
three occasions to check. So, HSBC says it was obliged to process  the transactions without 
undue delay in line with the Payment  Services Regulations  2009 (which were in force  at the 
material time). 
There were 41 disputed  transactions between 1 February 2017 and 23 October 2017 (see 
Appendix 1 below for details). These totalled  £175,000. Many of the payments were  for 
£5,000, though some were for greater or lesser sums. Mr L believed he was trading in binary 
optionsessentially a win-or-lose bet on the performance of commodities (etc)and that he 
was making very good profits based  on the information shown on his 23Traders online 
platform. Early on, in February and March  2017,  he did receive £14,250 back  from 
23Traders in five tranches  but he now thinks these payments were simply more  bait to 
hook him firmly onto the scam and carry on investing (which he did). Mr L now believes the 
platform was nothing  more than manipulated software or a video game  and not linked to 
real-life trades. Deducting  the £14,250 returns, Mr Ls total loss with 23Traders is therefore  
£160,750. He is aware that this is higher than our £150,000 statutory cap on awards  for acts 
or omissions  that occurredand were referred  to usbefore 1 April 2019 (see DISP  Rule 
3.7.4 of the Financial  Conduct Authority Handbook).
my provisional findings
Upon reading  all the available evidence and arguments from both parties, I have  concluded 
that it would  be fair and reasonable partly to uphold this complaint for the following reasons:
1.Not every complaint  referred to us and categorised as a binary-options scam is in fact a 
scam. Some  cases simply involve high-risk investment bets on the performance  of 
(e.g.) commodities or stocks that resulted in very disappointing  returns or losses. Some 
binary-options traders promoted these productswhich  were not regulated by the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  or its predecessor at the timeusing sales methods 
that were arguably unethical and/or  misleading. However, whilst customers  who lost out 
may understandably regard such acts or omissions  as fraudulent,  they do not 
necessarily meet the high legal threshold or burden  of proof for fraud, i.e. dishonestly 
making a false representation and/or failing  to disclose information with the intention  of 
making a gain for himself or of causing  loss to another or exposing another  to the risk of 
loss (Fraud Act 2006).  
2.Banks and other Payment Services Providers  (PSPs) have duties to protect customers  
against the risk of financial loss due to fraud and/or  to undertake due diligence  on large 
transactions to guard  against money laundering (see below). But when simply executing  
authorised payments,  they do not have to protect  customers  against the risk of bad 
bargains or give investment advice  and the FCA has confirmed that a fraud warning 
Ref: DRN58389668would not constitute unauthorised investment advice (see its predecessors 2012 
consultation paper on investment fraud, below). So, the first question to resolve  is 
whether this particular  retailer/trader was actually a fraudster.  
3.I am satisfied that 23Traders were  not carrying out legitimate binary-options trades but 
were instead dishonestly defrauding customers,  e.g. by not actually  making trades/bets  
with the money  received from clients but simply manipulating their online trading  
platform to show purported gains with initial token pay-outsin order  to induce further 
investments from victims such as Mr L. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I 
have concluded  this because:
a.Before January 2018 (i.e. at the time of these disputed transactions),  and 
reflecting the risky nature of such products, binary-options traders  operating in 
the UK were required to be regulated  by the Gambling Commission  whereas 
23Traders were not. Nor were they regulated in any other jurisdiction  so far as I 
am reasonably  aware. This indicates they were operating illegally,  probably  with 
dishonest intentions. Legitimate  firms tend to comply  with regulatory 
requirements.
b.On 23 January 2017, a warning about  23Traders  was placed on the Investor  
Alerts Portal of the International Organization of Securities Commissions 
(IOSCO). The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority reported that they were 
offering financial  services in its jurisdiction  without authorisation. This is another 
potential indicator of dishonest  intentions.  
c.There are several reports in the public domaine.g. foreign press and online 
forumsstating that 23Traders were scammers.  This hearsay is not in itself 
sufficient evidence  of fraud. But in the context of known regulatory facts,  it may 
fairly and reasonably  be regarded as circumstantial evidence that helps build an 
overall picture of scammers dishonestly seeking  gains  at the expense of others. 
4.Having concluded  that this was a scam rather than just a bad bargain or poor investment 
advice, I must now go on to consider four more issues in order  to determine the outcome 
of the complaint:
a.Did HSBC deal with Mr Ls chargeback claims fairly?
b.If so, were any of the disputed transactions still so unusual or uncharacteristic for 
Mr L and/or his account that HSBCs fraud  alerts  ought reasonably  to have 
triggered some sort of intervention?
c.If triggered, would HSBCs intervention have made  a difference  and prevented or 
reduced the loss?
d.And if so, was Mr L partly to blame for what happened such  that it would be fair 
and reasonable to reduce  compensation  proportionately?
chargeback 
5.Chargeback is a voluntary scheme run by Visa whereby it will ultimately  arbitrate on a 
dispute between  the merchant and customer if it cannot be resolved  between them after 
two presentments.  Such arbitration is subject to the rules of the scheme  so there are 
limited grounds on which a chargeback can succeed. Our role in such  cases  is not to 
second-guess Visas  arbitration decision or scheme  rules, but to determine whether the 
regulated card issuer  (i.e. HSBC)  acted fairly and reasonably when presenting (or 
choosing not to present) a chargeback on behalf of its cardholder.  
Ref: DRN583896696.Mr L is upset because  HSBC  refused to take his chargeback claim to Visa for arbitration 
after the second presentment under  Reason  Code 53not as described or defective  
merchandisewas  defended by the merchant acquirer on behalf  of 23Traders. (It may 
seem odd that a scammer would actively engage  in a chargeback process, e.g. by 
supplying screenshots of transactions, payments  out, terms of business, etc. However, I 
understand this is not uncommon  for this type of investment scam, whose business 
model is often predicated on using payment services such as Visa.) 
7.In my judgment, it was not unreasonable of HSBC to drop the chargeback  claim after the 
second presentment failed. First, taking the matter to arbitration is not without a costs 
risk; and in any event, it is strictly a matter of discretion  for the card issuer. In this case,  
HSBC would have  been mindful, in exercising its discretion in a fair and non-arbitrary 
manner, that the Visa chargeback rules  did not cover binary-options trading at that time. 
Binary Securities Trading  Disputes were only included within the scope of Reason Code 
53 from 14 October 2017, i.e. after all but one of the disputed  transactions in question: 
see Visa Business News, 26 October  2017:
Effective 14 October 2017, issuers may use Reason Code 53 to address cases  whereby a 
binary options (or forex)  merchant has imposed  obstacles to prevent cardholders  from 
withdrawing funds. This chargeback right is limited to the amount available in the binary  
option account at the time funds are requested. Issuers cannot charge  back  more  than the 
original transaction amount,  so capital  gains from binary  options trades cannot  be paid out via 
the chargeback  process.
8.Though not material to the circumstances  of this case, it is worth adding  for 
completeness that, from 1 December 2018, Visas rules  changed  again  to require binary-
options merchants  (and other high-brand risk merchants) to be coded  under Merchant 
Category Code (MCC) 7995 Betting, including Lottery Tickets, Casino Gaming  Chips,  
Off-Track Betting, and Wagers at Race Tracks. Visa Business  News dated 6 September 
2018 stated:
Visa has discovered that certain binary  options, rolling  spot forex  trading, financial spread  
betting and contracts for difference merchants are being acquired in markets  that do not 
require licensing or regulate merchant trading platforms. In addition,  some of these  merchants 
are selling into countries where local laws prohibit  such transactions or require licensing  by 
the relevant financial services authority.
9.Given that the disputed transactions in this case occurred between 1 February  2017  and 
23 October 2017, before the changes  to Reason  Code 53 were published, HSBC could 
only have successfully  presented  a chargeback claim if 23Traders had expressly 
promised Mr L a guaranteed return contrary to the realities  of such  high-risk  trading. And 
there was no evidence they had; on the contrary,  the terms of business provided by 
23Traders in their defence made no such claims.  Mr L did not provide persuasive 
evidence showing otherwise. So, declining to forward  the case  to Visa arbitration  in 
circumstances where  there  were  no reasonable prospects of success  was neither  an 
unfair nor unreasonable exercise  of HSBCs  discretion. 
10.Having said that, the last payment of £5,000 was on 23 October 2017, after the Visa rule 
change. However,  that was not included in Mr Ls chargeback claim. HSBC saysand  I 
acceptthat a number of payments  were  missed or not listed for inclusion due to the 
Claims Management Company (CMC) employed by Mr L at the time. So I cannot  
reasonably hold HSBC liable for that omission.  As the chargeback rules include time 
limits for presenting claims, it is now far too late to present a claim for that. 
Ref: DRN58389661011.Mr L has also expressed concerns that it was not made clear to him that the money 
recredited to his account pending the outcome of the chargeback would  be debited once 
again if the claim failed (as of course happened). Whilst  it is true that HSBC did not make  
this clear to Mr L at the time,  this was because the process was carried  out via a CMC, 
so its standard  declaration form containing such information was not used. I agree with 
HSBC that Mr L could and should have been  made aware by his CMC of how the 
chargeback process generally operates. In any event, HSBC paid him £300 
compensation for any distress or inconvenience  caused by this communication  error, 
which did not in itself cause any other financial loss. 
12.For the reasons set out above,  I am not persuaded  that HSBC acted unfairly or 
unreasonably in connection  with the chargeback claim, so I cannot uphold this complaint 
on that ground.
unusual or uncharacteristic activity
13.HSBC is aware  of our general position  on a PSPs safeguarding and due-diligence duties 
to protect  customers from the risk of financial harm due to fraud. We have published 
many decisions  on our website setting out these principles and quoting  the relevant rules 
and regulations. It is unnecessary to rehearse  them again  here in detail.  
14.It is common ground that the disputed payments were authorised by Mr L for the 
purposes of the Payment Services Regulations  2009 (the Regulations),  in force at the 
time. This is because  they were made by Mr L using the legitimate security credentials 
provided to him by HSBC. These must  be regarded  as authorised  payments even 
though Mr L was the victim of a sophisticated scam. So, although he did not intend  the 
money to go to scammers, under the Regulations,  and under the terms and conditions  of 
his bank account, Mr L is presumed liable  for the loss in the first instance.  
15.However, taking  into account the law, regulatory rules and guidance, relevant codes of 
practice and what I consider to have been  good industry practice  at the time,  I consider 
HSBC should  fairly  and reasonably:
Have been monitoring accountsand any payments made  or received to counter 
various risks, including anti-money-laundering, countering  the financing  of terrorism, 
and preventing fraud and scams;
Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other  signs that 
might indicate its customers were at risk of fraud (amongst  other  things). This is 
particularly so given  the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years, 
which banks are generally more familiar with than the average customer;  and  
In some circumstances,  irrespective of the payment channel used, have taken 
additional steps, or made additional checks, before processing a payment, or in 
some cases  declined  to make a payment altogether, to help protect customers  from 
the possibility  of financial harm from fraud.
16.I am satisfied there were enough triggers in this case to have alerted a responsible  
regulated bank such as HSBC  that Mr Ls account  was being subjected  to unusual  and 
uncharacteristic activity. There were  reasonable grounds to suspect a fraud or scam,  and 
therefore justify  an intervention  (such as phoning him in order to ask discreet questions 
about the nature and purpose of the payments).
Ref: DRN58389661117.First, regulated firms  ought reasonably to take notice of alerts about  traders published by 
the FCA and/or IOSCO. As long ago as June  2012, the FCAs predecessor  indicatedin 
its consultation paper entitled Banks Defences Against Investment Fraud: detecting 
perpetrators and protecting victims that  it was good industry practice  for firms  to build  
up an updated watch-list of types of scams  and potential perpetrators; and regularly to 
share timely and detailed intelligence  with other  banks, UK and overseas regulators, 
the police, etc. Whilst the regulator gave no specific timings, it is not unreasonable in my 
view to expect an international bank to update  its watch-list and communicate internally 
to staff within, say, one month of an alert being  posted by the FCA or IOSCO. In my 
judgment, such alerts should automatically trigger alarm-bells and lead to the payment 
being paused pending further enquiries  (and a possible scam warning) to the payer.  
18.In Mr Ls case,  there was a warning  about 23Traders on IOSCOs  Investor  Alerts  Portal 
from 23 January 2017, which was before  the first payment on 1 February 2017  but 
only by just over a week. It is not unreasonable to expect a large international bank that 
regularly updates its internal alerts to include information about payees who had tried to 
carry out regulated  activities without permission. I accept that the warning did not 
specifically relate  to binary-options trading; and it did not necessarily follow  from the 
nature of the warning in isolation that these were fraudsters. And given the timing of the 
alert relative to the first payment, I do not think  HSBC ought to have automatically 
blocked it; and may not yet have had a fair chance to update and communicate its 
watch-list. However,  in light of the odd pattern of payments  that followed, I do think this 
was a trigger for potential fraud, particularly given that this was also a new payee; also 
an international payee; and a payee  trading in binary options  without being registered 
with the Gambling Commission (as required at the time). The bank had constructive if 
not actual notice that the payee might not be a legitimate merchant  therefore, it would 
have been reasonable  for it to have properly questioned Mr L before processing all the 
payments in order to satisfy itself that all was well. 
19.But even if I were to give HSBC  the benefit of doubt and conclude that the first payments 
were too close to the IOSCO alert to trigger internal alarms,  the frequency of the 
payments and sums involved should  in themselves have alerted HSBC to the risk of 
harm and prompted discreet queries  almost  from the outset. 
20.The payments  on the first two days of Mr Ls trading were as follows:
date payment total
01/02/2017  £5,000  £5,000
01/02/2017  £5,000 £10,000
01/02/2017  £5,000  £15,000
01/02/2017  £5,000  £20,000
06/02/2017  £5,000  £25,000
06/02/2017  £5,000 £30,000
06/02/2017  £5,000 £35,000
06/02/2017  £5,000 £40,000
21.This was a highly  unusual and uncharacteristic pattern of spending for Mr L compared 
with his recent history  on the account   and was an indicator that something untoward 
might be happening (including, for example, an attempt to circumvent  the anti-money 
laundering requirements by making  a number of smaller payments in short  succession to 
Ref: DRN583896612the same  payee). Certainly by the time Mr L attempted  to make the third payment on the 
same day, a pattern was emerging that ought reasonably to have caused HSBC to make 
further enquiries of him about what was going on. Indeed, HSBC  did in fact contact Mr L 
but not until 28 February 2017 (after he had paid £64,000 over the course of 17 
payments); and again on 6 and 7 March 2017. HSBC said the purpose  of these calls was 
simply to confirm that it was in fact Mr L making the payments. But this reinforces my 
view that there were reasonable grounds for suspicions that could and should have been 
properly acted on  and acted on much sooner. 
22.If, instead of merely confirming Mr Ls identity and intention to pay, HSBC  had fulfilled its 
duties and carried out due diligence by asking suitably  probing questions,  there is no 
reason to doubt that he would have  explained  what he was doing. In such  
circumstances, whilst  the bank  had no duty to protect him from a bad bargain  or give 
investment advice, it could have  checked its watch-list and/or IOSCO  and warned  Mr L 
that the payee was subject to an international alert and/or invited him to check  whether 
the payee was registered with the Gambling Commission.  After  all, at that time, there 
was information  in the public  domain which a bank  ought to have known even if a lay 
consumer ought notabout the very high risks associated with binary  options,  including  
many warnings  of potential fraud (e.g. Action  Frauds  June 2016  warning; the European 
Securities and Markets Authoritys July 2016  warning; the Financial  Conduct  Authoritys 
consultation paper of December 2016;  and the Gambling Commissions  December 2016 
scam warning that an unlicensed operator is likely operating  illegally,  and so forth). 
23.There is no evidence  that HSBC provided Mr L with any meaningful warnings or gave  
him other  reasons to doubt the legitimacy of the payments he was making. It was a 
missed opportunity to intervene.
causation 
24.If HSBC  had asked  Mr L what the payments were for and the basic surrounding context, 
it is likely  he would have fully explained  what he was doing and that everything had been 
done over the phone and online with his broker. Whilst HSBC may not have known for 
certain whether  Mr L was dealing with a fraudulent binary-options trader  or investing  in a 
legitimate (albeit highly  speculative) product, it ought reasonably to have provided a 
scam warning in light of all the information  then known to financial professionals  about  
the risks associated with unregulated, overseas  binary  options.  Indeed,  HSBC  and Mr L 
spoke by phone on 11 April 2017 about  his application  for a £30,000 bridging loan or 
overdraft, and he volunteered  lots of information  about  his binary-options dabbling
and expressed some  misgivings about  23Traders responsiveness  (see contributory 
negligence below)which  was a perfect  opportunity for HSBC  to give a potential scam  
warning, especially as its representative  declined  the application (after  reviewing  his 
transactions and referring to a manager), saying that the bank did not understand nor 
cover that type of investment.  
25.If HSBC  had given a warning, I believe that Mr L would have paused  and looked more 
closely into 23Traders  before proceeding. There is no evidence  that he was willing to 
take high risks or had a history  of speculative investments or gambling; these were  his 
pension monies  after all. It seems more  probable  that he would  have made further 
enquiries into binary-options scams and whether or not 23Traders were regulated in the 
UK or abroad.  He could have discovered the IOSCO alert and the various regulatory 
warnings about the risk of binary-options scams (see above). In other  words,  I am 
satisfied that a warning from his trusted bank of 20 years would probably have exposed 
Ref: DRN58389661323Traders smoke and mirrors, causing him to stop trading and preventing further 
losses. 
26.Even  if he had not worked out that this was a scam, it is likely that a warning would have  
prompted greater  research into binary  options,  which in turn would have revealed the 
truth behind his supposed brokers (mis)representations  i.e. that they were not really  
regulated UK investments but highly-risky international bets more akin to a wager in 
which the broker must lose if he is to win. This would probably have stopped him in his 
tracks. But for HSBCs failure to act on clear triggers of potential  fraud  or financial  harm, 
Mr L would probably have lost no more than the first two payments totalling £10,000. I 
think it would be expecting too much of HSBC  to have  intervened and made a difference  
from the first or second payments, which were only just over a week after the IOSCO 
alert about 23Traders.  
contributory negligence
27.Notwithstanding the above, I do think that Mr L was partly  to blame for what  happened;  
that he did foresee  the risk of some sort of harm of this nature but nevertheless  
proceeded to take it by deploying inadequate  or no measures to avert it. At the time of 
his trading, there was information in the public domain about this particular  trader   
plus general information about  the risks of binary options. Despite regulatory safeguards, 
there is a general principle that consumers must still take responsibility for their decisions  
(see s.1C(d)  of our enabling statute,  the Financial Services  and Markets  Act 2000). I do 
not place too much  weight on general  but arcane information in the public  domain  for 
reasons previously alluded to about the information imbalance between  financial 
professionals and ordinary consumers. 
28.Rather,  Mr Ls own comments indicate that he did entertain some  misgivings at the time. 
As well as the pause in his trading with 23Traders between April and August  2017 (he 
carried on with other  binary-options trades elsewhere), which  arguably indicates  a period 
of hesitation and reflection  with regard to that particular company, he remarked  to our 
investigator that Its like getting into a lane which you cant get off, it goes  on and on and 
on, they always make excuses for you to invest again. He mentioned difficulties trying to 
get pay-outs despite apparently significant profits/leverage. And in one of the phone calls 
from the bank checking his ID, he seemed surprised at how much had been taken from 
his account that day by 23Traders:  £20,000 in four payments on 7 March 2017.  I also 
reiterate my comments above  about  his slight misgivings in the overdraft call of 11 April 
2017. It is possible that he simply did not recognise any danger   but I think  it more 
probable that he had some misgivings by then as there  was a pause with this particular 
company, and his future trades with them were more sporadic and sometimes  of lower  
value (e.g. £1,000 or £500). 
29.In the circumstances,  I think it would be fair to reduce compensation by 20% on the basis 
that Mr L should share some  blame  for what happened. 
30.Finally, whilst I appreciate Mr L is also unhappy  that HSBC  closed his account, I am 
satisfied that it was entitled  to do this with notice under the contractual  terms and 
conditions. This was a legitimate  exercise of its commercial judgment.  
Ref: DRN583896614provisional decision 
For the reasons  set out above, I am minded mainly to uphold  this complaint and propose 
asking HSBC UK Bank plc to refund to Mr L all his stolen payments save the first two 
(totalling £10,000)  but subject to a 20% deduction  for contributory negligence. 
As Mr L also received  £14,250 in pay-out inducements from 23Traders, the losses  
outstanding total £150,750, so 80% of that would amount to an award of £120,600. 
This was a savings account, so HSBC should add interest to that sum (less any tax properly 
deductible) at the relevant  account rate(s) from the respective dates of loss to the date of 
refund. For the avoidance of doubt (in case it becomes relevant despite my reduction for 
contributory negligence), our statutory cap of £150,000 does  not include interest or costs, 
which can be awarded over and above  that sum.
