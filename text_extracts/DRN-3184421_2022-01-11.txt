The complaint
Miss S complained to National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) when they reported missed 
payments on her loan to the credit reference agencies, despite a payment deferral having 
been agreed.
What happened
Miss S had a loan with NatWest requiring regular monthly repayments. Due to the financial 
impact of the global pandemic, Miss S applied to NatWest for a payment deferral. NatWest 
ultimately agreed to this for a total of six months.
During the payment deferral agreed, Miss S discovered that NatWest were reporting missed 
payments on her credit file with the credit reference agencies. Miss S didnt think this was 
right. The missed payments had already been agreed by NatWest so she didnt believe they 
should be reported.
Miss S raised this with NatWest. NatWest agreed theyd made a mistake. They said theyd 
correct her credit file and remove any adverse data reported from March to June 2020. But 
they reported arrears again for the month of July 2020. NatWest apologised for their 
mistake, agreed to remove the reported arrears and paid Miss S £100 in recognition of the 
upset and inconvenience caused.
Miss S wasnt happy with NatWests response. She was concerned they were continuing to 
report arrears incorrectly. NatWest agreed to check Miss Ss credit file again and diarise 
forward to remove any adverse data reported for August 2020.
NatWest ultimately agreed to refinance Miss Ss loan when it reached the end of the 
payment deferral period agreed. But there appeared to be some confusion about how this 
would be completed. NatWest wrote to Miss S in October 2020. They agreed that Miss S 
had been misinformed when she was told that paperwork would be sent to her to extend the 
term of her loan. They told Miss S shed need to complete a new application to refinance her 
existing loan. They also confirmed that her credit file no longer showed any adverse data. 
They paid her a further £100 for the upset and inconvenience caused.
It then appears NatWest again reported a missed payment in September 2020. NatWest 
said theyd already taken steps to remove this but agreed theyd failed to tell Miss S this. 
They apologised once again for their oversight. It also appears that a further missed 
payment was reported in October albeit NatWest had also taken steps to remove this from 
Miss Ss credit file.
Miss S wasnt happy with how NatWest had handled her complaints. She was concerned 
that she was continuously having to check her credit file. So, she referred matters to this 
service.
One of our adjudicators looked into Miss Ss complaints. He agreed NatWest had made 
mistakes. However, he also thought NatWest had responded fairly to Miss Ss complaints. 
He didnt think NatWest needed to do anything more.
Miss S didnt agree with our adjudicator. She thought NatWest should pay her more 
compensation for their mistakes. So, she asked for her complaint to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued guidance to lenders on 2 April 2020 which 
explained what it expected from businesses during the exceptional circumstances arising out 
of the global pandemic. It provided guidance asking businesses to consider payment 
deferrals of up to three months under regulated credit agreements. 
The FCA said their guidance applied where consumers were already experiencing or 
reasonably expect to experience temporary payment difficulties as a result of the pandemic. 
The FCA also said that firms should ensure that there is no negative impact on the 
consumers credit file because of the payment deferral.
Later guidance suggested that businesses should consider further extensions of up to three 
months to any payment deferral agreed, where the circumstances showed a need. It 
appears this is what was agreed in Miss Ss case. So I think NatWest complied with the 
FCAs guidance here.
Unfortunately, throughout Miss Ss payment deferral period, NatWest reported missed 
payments on Miss Ss credit file with the credit reference agencies. This despite the FCAs 
guidance being clear on this point. Once Miss S highlighted this to NatWest, they agreed to 
remove the adverse data. But they continued to report further missed payments. So, Miss S 
continued to highlight this to them.
From the evidence Ive seen, NatWest agreed to check Miss Ss credit file each month and 
remove any adverse data reported. In Miss Ss case, it appears their systems and processes 
meant these checks and adjustments had to be completed manually each time. 
It isnt the role of this service to supervise, regulate or impose fines on any business. Its also 
not our role to ask a business to alter its procedures or processes or impose improvements 
on the level of service offered to their customers. These aspects fall firmly within the remit of 
the regulator  in this case, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
But it is our role to examine and decide whether a business has been fair and reasonable in 
the manner in which those policies and procedures are applied in the individual 
circumstances of Miss Ss experience with them. I completely appreciate Miss Ss frustration 
and concern here. She clearly didnt feel comfortable leaving NatWest to check and amend 
her credit file each month. 
NatWest did ultimately ensure that any incorrectly reported adverse data was removed from 
Miss Ss credit file. In our adjudicators view, he asked Miss S to provide a copy of her credit 
file in the event she believed any adverse data was still recorded. Miss S hasnt reported any 
further discrepancies to this service. So, Ive no reason to ask NatWest to do anything more 
here.
Im also aware NatWest have paid compensation to Miss S on two separate occasions 
totalling £200. Compensation is a personal thing. What is seen as reasonable by one party 
may not be considered so by another. Miss S did experience some inconvenience. But I 
think the amounts paid by NatWest feel fair in all the circumstances here. I appreciate that 
Miss S doesnt agree. But it isnt the role of this service to make awards in order to penalise 
NatWest for their mistakes. Any award is considered based upon the impact NatWests 
mistake had upon Miss S. And I think the amounts already paid by them does that.
I do appreciate Miss S will be disappointed, but I shant be asking NatWest to do anything 
more here.
My final decisionFor the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Miss Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 February 2022.
