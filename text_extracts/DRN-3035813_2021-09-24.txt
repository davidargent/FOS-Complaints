The complaint
Mr I complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) wouldnt submit a 
chargeback request on his behalf. 
What happened
In August and September 2020, Mr I made several transactions to a spiritualist using a 
mobile phone application for a money transfer service, to which his NatWest debit card was 
linked. He says the spiritualist had told him all services would be completed by December 
2020. But he didnt receive what hed paid for and the spiritualists social media page could 
no longer be found. 
Mr I realised he was likely to have been a victim of a scam, so he asked NatWest to submit a 
chargeback request on his behalf in an effort to get his money back. But NatWest said it was 
unable to process the chargeback claim because the transactions were made to a third party 
who were not responsible for the supply of the goods or services Mr I had purchased. Mr I 
raised a complaint, but NatWests position remained the same. It said Mr I had been 
correctly advised that it was unable to offer any assistance through the chargeback process 
in respect of the transactions.
Mr I remained unhappy, so he brought his complaint to our service. He felt that NatWest 
should be able to arrange the return of his funds because hed used his debit card to make 
the payments. 
Our investigator looked into his concerns but didnt think Mr Is complaint should be upheld. 
He didnt think NatWest had treated Mr I unfairly. He said it wouldnt have been able to raise 
a successful chargeback on Mr Is behalf. 
Mr I disagreed with our investigators view. He felt that he should have been refunded his 
transactions because, although hed used an app, hed used his debit card to make the 
payments. So, his complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The relevant regulations require NatWest to pay due regard to the interests of its customers 
and treat them fairly. The chargeback scheme is a voluntary scheme. While there was no 
obligation for NatWest to pursue a chargeback on Ms Is behalf, its good practice for it do to 
so if theres a reasonable prospect of success.
Mr I asked NatWest to submit the chargeback request in February 2021 because he hadnt 
received the services hed paid for from the spiritualist. But Mr Is debit card payments were 
made to a money transfer service, rather than directly to the spiritualists bank account. This 
means that NatWest would have needed to consider if there was evidence to suggest there 
were any failings by the money transfer service when deciding whether or not to attempt a 
chargeback. 
I havent seen any evidence to suggest that the money transfer service didnt provide the 
service it was supposed to, which was to pass the payments on to the spiritualist. NatWest 
has also commented that the time period provided by the card scheme for raising 
chargebacks had passed. And I think NatWest is also right about this because the scheme 
rules require most disputes to be processed no later than 120 days after the date of the 
transaction. 
I appreciate my answer will be disappointing for Mr I who has told us he contacted the 
spiritualist after a close relative had passed away. Its unfortunate that he appears to have 
been taken advantage of at what must have been a very distressing time. But I can only 
consider NatWests actions. And having considered everything, I think NatWests decision to 
not attempt the chargeback was reasonable. So, I dont think NatWest has acted unfairly.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Is complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 October 2021.
