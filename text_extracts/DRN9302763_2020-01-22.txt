K821x#15complaint
Miss B says Evergreen Finance London  Limited (trading as Money Boat) irresponsibly lent to 
her.
background
This complaint is about six instalment loans Money Boat provided to Miss B between  
September 2016 and November 2017. Miss Bs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Repayment
1 05/09/2016 28/09/2016 6 £200.00 £60.23
2 25/10/2016 07/11/2016 6 £500.00 £154.87
3 23/01/2017 05/05/2017 6 £350.00 £93.65
4 12/07/2017 28/07/2017 6 £300.00 £87.04
5 12/10/2017 24/10/2017 6 £500.00 £144.38
6 30/11/2017 01/08/2018 6 £400.00 £123.52
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Bs complaint  and thought the loan 6 shouldnt have been given 
because the pattern of lending indicated Miss B was reliant  on the borrowing. Money  Boat 
didnt respond  to the view so, the complaint was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Money Boat needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could consider a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Money Boat should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN93027632refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Money Boat was required to establish 
whether Miss B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Bs complaint. Having done this, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Miss Bs complaint about loans 1 to 5. Miss B didnt respond  to 
the opinion. As there is no dispute about the adjudicators  findings  about these loans, I wont  
be making any further findings on them. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Money  Boats  lending history with Miss B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Money Boat should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Money Boat should  have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the circumstances of Miss Bs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Money Boat ought to have realised  Miss B was not managing to repay 
her loans  sustainably.  Miss B had taken out six loans within 14 months. So, Money 
Boat ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Miss B was having to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in his/her finances 
and that Miss Bs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Miss Bs first loan was for £200  and loan 6 was for £400.  At  this point Money Boat 
ought to have known that Miss B was not likely  borrowing  to meet  a temporary  
shortfall in her income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Money  Boat. Loan  6 
was taken out over a year after Miss Bs first. And it was for a larger  amount.  Miss B 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Money Boat over an 
extended period.
I think that Miss B lost out because  Money  Boat provided borrowing for loan 6 because:
Ref: DRN93027633his loan had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Miss Bs indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Bs ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Money Boat needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss B paid on loan 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
any information recorded about  loan 6 is adverse. So all entries about this loan 
should be removed  from Miss Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Money Boat to take off tax from this interest.  Money Boat must 
give Miss B a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Bs complaint.  Evergreen Finance 
London Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 February  2020.
