The complaint
Mrs T complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
Blue Motor Finance Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality. A relative is also involved with her 
complaint.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by the investigator for these 
reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mrs T in January 2019 under a hire purchase agreement 
with Blue Motor Finance that she electronically signed in December 2018;
Blue Motor Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mrs T - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mrs T was nearly four years old, had been driven for 
about 26,000 miles and had a price of £14,995;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car broke down in February 2020 and the breakdown report refers to a 
transmission fault  it also says that the cars front tyres were illegal, the car had no 
valid MOT certificate or road tax and that its mileage was 61,431; 
Mrs T complained to Blue Motor Finance about the gearbox fault and said that shed 
bought a warranty from the dealer but the dealer had stopped trading  it didnt 
uphold her complaint so she complained to this service;
our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld and Mrs T 
has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman;
Mrs T was able to use the car for more than twelve months and was able to drive 
more than 35,000 miles in it before it broke down in February 2020  I dont consider 
it to be likely that shed have been able to do so if the cars gearbox had been faulty 
when it was supplied to her  I consider it to be more likely than not that the gearbox 
fault has been caused by the use that Mrs T has had from the car and that its a wear 
and tear issue;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mrs T so I dont consider that it would be 
fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Blue Motor Finance to 
allow Mrs T to reject the car or to pay for it to be repaired;
Mrs T did buy a warranty from the dealer which is provided by a third party  Ive not 
seen the full terms of the warranty but, based on the terms that I have seen and 
because the gearbox fault is likely to be considered to be a wear and tear issue, I 
consider it to be unlikely that the warranty would cover the required gearbox repair 
(but Blue Motor Finance has provided her with the contact details for the warranty 
provider);
Mrs T also says that the dealer owes her £99 as shown on the invoice  but that is an 
issue between her and the dealer and its not something for which I consider that 
Blue Motor Finance is responsible; and
I sympathise with Mrs T for the issues that she has with the car but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Blue Motor Finance has 
responded to her complaint incorrectly and I dont consider that it would be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to pay any compensation to 
Mrs T or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2020.
