The complaint
Mr B complains about direct debit payments to his credit card from Madison CF UK Limited  
trading as 118 118 Money (118).
What happened
Mr B has a credit card from 118. In January 2023, the limit was £3,500 and the balance was 
£3,519. The next payment was £246.97, due by 1 February 2023. Mr B made a manual 
payment of £20 on 10 January 2023, so the payment due was then £226.97.
Mr B had a direct debit arrangement in place to collect the minimum payments. 118 had 
written to him to say the payment due date was changing from 1 February 2023 to 31 
January 2023. The email said the payment due was £226.97  to be taken on 31 January 
2023.
What then happened was that on 30 January 2023, £226.97 was claimed by 118 from Mr Bs 
bank as a direct debit. This was refunded the same day  Mr B said he organised the refund 
through the direct debit indemnity scheme and through his bank. 
Then a further direct debit was taken from Mr Bs bank account on 31 January 2023 (also for 
£226.97) and credited to Mr Bs credit card account. This was also refunded the same day 
by 118.
On 31 January 2023, 118 sent an SMS text to Mr B to say two payments had been claimed 
in error - and one would be refunded. On 3 February 2023, 118 sent a further SMS text to 
confirm that one payment had been refunded.
Mr Bs statement dated 12 February 2023 included interest of £120.80. The balance was 
£3,620  so, he was over the limit by £120.04.
The account then fell into arrears and was passed to debt collectors on 24 August 2023  
there were then seven months arrears (February 2023 to August 2023).
Mr B complained. He said that the first payment had been taken too early - contrary to the 
email from 118. And so  he obtained a refund for it under the direct debit indemnity 
scheme. 
He said the second direct debit payment shouldnt have been refunded  and this caused 
him (1) to pay more interest  of £120 (2) go over the limit because of the interest (3) put the 
account into arrears (4) he refused to make any more payments while his complaint was 
being considered by 118 and then by us (5) his credit file was now marked with adverse 
information, which wasnt fair.
118 apologised that the second payment was collected  this was an error. The first 
payment had been refunded by Mr Bs bank and caused the arrears. The interest charged 
was based on the previous months balance and so the double payments and refunds didnt 
affect the interest charged in January 2023. On the effect on Mr Bs credit file - 118 offered 
to delete the missed payment for January 2023  if Mr B brought his account up to date. 118 
offered £25 for the inconvenience caused.
Mr B rejected the offer of £25 and brought his complaint to us. Our investigator didnt uphold 
it. He said:
- Theres no dispute that 118 made an error and shouldnt have refunded the second 
payment on 31 January 2023.
- The interest charge of £120 was accurate and was calculated from the previous 
statement. The direct debit issues in January 2023 didnt affect that.
- Mr B had a contractual obligation to make the monthly payments and 118 didnt have  
to hold his account while his complaint was being looked at.
- He could see that 118 had agreed to remove any adverse information reported to the 
credit reference agencies for January 2023  if Mr B brought the account up to date  
this was reasonable. 
- The compensation of £25 was fair under the circumstances.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I wanted to understand exactly what happened here so asked more questions of 118; and 
they also sent us more information.
What happened was:
- Two payments were taken by direct debit on 30 January 2023 (£226.97) and 31 
January 2023 (£226.97). Its not in dispute that this was an error by 118.
- Mr B then got a refund of the first payment by claiming under the direct debit 
indemnity scheme.
- But  118 also refunded the second payment of £226.97. 
- So  this meant that no payments were made to Mr Bs account for that month, and 
the account fell into arrears.
- So  I can see what happened here, and so I looked at what communications were 
sent by 118 to Mr B, as these are important in the context of this complaint.
118 wrote to Mr B by SMS text on 31 January 2023 to explain theyd collected two payments 
in error and would be refunding one. It said Hi Nigel, we've made a mistake and attempted 
your Direct Debit twice. We're working on this now and will urgently refund any additional 
payments we collect. We're very sorry for the inconvenience this will cause.
118 then wrote again to Mr B on 3 February 2023 to say: Hi Nigel, we sent an SMS earlier 
this week to warn that your Direct Debit payment may be incorrectly taken twice. The extra 
payment taken has now been refunded to your bank account. We sincerely apologise for any 
inconvenience this has caused.
So here, 118 advised Mr B what had happened, and what they were going to do about it  i.e. refund one payment. But by that time, of course Mr B had organised his own refund  so 
no payments had been made.
I consider that because 118 had clearly told Mr B what had happened, and how they were 
going to put things right  its reasonable to say that Mr B should then have realised that no 
payments had been made for the month and that he needed to make a payment himself. I 
noted he did make a manual payment of £20 on 13 January 2023  so he was aware he 
could do that.
Mr B argues this caused him to go into arrears, I can see how that was the case  as the 
payment was due by 1 February 2023, and there was little time for him to make the manual 
payment. But to be fair to 118, they offered to delete the late payment marker from his credit 
file for that month  - if he brought his account up to date. 118 advised that to Mr B on 30 
March 2023. And by then, no payments had been received since 13 January 2023  so I 
consider that was a fair offer from 118. Its clear that Mr B didnt accept that offer  as he 
didnt bring his account up to date.
Mr B says he had fallen into arrears and his debt has been sold to a debt collection agency 
because of what happened. He told us he refused to pay anything while his complaint was 
still outstanding, firstly with 118 and then with us. I noted that 118 didnt agree to a standstill 
on payments in that way  and our service also takes the view that normal contractual 
agreements continue while complaints are being reviewed.
I can see that Mr B made no payments after the credit of £20 on 13 January 2023  and so 
in August 2023, 118 passed his account to a debt collection agency. As his account was, by 
then, more than six months in arrears (and the arrears were £2,049.68)  that was a 
reasonable thing for 118 to do. And, for the same reason, I think the markers on his credit 
file should remain  as 118 have a responsibility to report accurate information to credit 
reference agencies, and thats what they did here.
Mr B also argues that he was charged additional interest because of the missed payment in 
January 2023. We asked 118 about that and they worked out the additional interest was 
£7.16. But  as I dont consider 118 were at fault, nor acted unreasonably, I am not saying 
this should be refunded.
I appreciate that Mr B feels strongly about his complaint and will therefore be disappointed 
by my decision, but Im not asking 118 to do anymore here, other than pay Mr B the £25 
theyve already offered.

My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint. Madison CF UK Limited  trading as 118 118 Money has 
already made an offer to pay £25 to settle the complaint and I think this offer is fair in all the 
circumstances.So my decision is that Madison CF UK Limited  trading as 118 118 Money should pay £25.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2023.
