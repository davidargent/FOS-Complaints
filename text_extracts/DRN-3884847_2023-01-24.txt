The complaint
Mr M complains that PayrNet Limited blocked and later closed his account. They returned 
funds to original source rather than to him. Mr M would like the money returned and 
compensation.  
Mr M held a Rizq branded account  who provided services on behalf of PayrNet  but I will 
refer to Rizq as PayrNet in this decision.
What happened
In January 2021, PayrNet blocked Mr Ms account and held the money in it. Mr M said this 
caused him a lot of financial distress and damaged his mental health. Mr M was a university 
student at the time and couldnt pay his rent.
PayrNet returned the money left in the account to the original sources, and closed Mr Ms 
account in April 2021.
Our investigator reviewed things and recognised PayrNet hadnt asked Mr M for entitlement 
to the money held in his accounts. So, he didnt think it was reasonable the money was 
returned to source  and he hadnt seen any evidence it had been returned, despite asking 
PayrNet for it on a number of occasions. So, he asked PayrNet to:
Return £780.90 (plus 8% statutory interest) which had been returned to source back 
to Mr M.
Pay Mr M £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Mr M was happy with our investigators recommendation. PayrNet wasnt. In summary, they 
said they acted within their legal obligations and they no longer held the funds as they had 
been returned to source.
Our investigator asked PayrNet again for evidence of their review, and that they had 
returned the money to source. PayrNet didnt respond.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive decided to uphold this complaint. And Ill explain why.
PayrNet has said they no longer hold the funds and have acted in accordance with the 
regulations by returning the funds to source. 
The problem is I cant tell whether Mr M isnt entitled to the money paid into his account as 
PayrNet havent shared even basic information. I respect that PayrNet has internal policies 
and processes to follow along with legal and regulatory obligations. But they are also aware 
of our rules. 
DISP 3.5.2 states, amongst other things, that an Ombudsman can reach a decision on the 
basis of what has been supplied and take account of the failure by a complainant or a firm to 
provide information that an Ombudsman has requested; .
So, Ive considered Payrnets refusal/failure to provide information. Ive also considered the 
fact that PayrNet are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet its legal 
and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of new 
and existing relationships. That sometimes means they need to restrict customers accounts 
 either in full or partially while they carry out the review. I havent seen enough evidence to 
satisfy me that PayrNet was complying with their legal and regulatory obligations when they 
reviewed Mr Ms account from January 2021  April 2021. I also havent seen any evidence 
that PayrNet involved Mr M in the review by asking him appropriate questions such as proof 
of entitlement to the money in the account, or what the account was used for as example. 
So, I cant fairly say theyve acted appropriately. 
Should PayrNet have returned the money in Mr Ms account to source? 
While PayrNet are usually entitled to carry out a review, wed expect them to do so in a 
timely manner and without undue delays. PayrNet have shared limited information with our 
service in regard to the actions they took during the review. When financial institutions carry 
out reviews, its common practice across the banking industry that the review will require 
additional information from the account holder. Often, the information required is related to 
the consumers identity, proof of entitlement to recent payments or more details on what the 
account is used for. Based on the evidence Ive seen, and alongside Mr Ms testimony, 
PayrNet didnt ask Mr M any questions. 
PayrNet made the decision to return three payments back to the original sources. I think It 
would have been helpful if PayrNet asked Mr M for proof of entitlement to these funds as 
part of the review. They didnt  and therefore, Ive had to consider whether it was fair to 
return the money to source. Ive carefully considered PayrNets limited evidence  and with 
the absence of any thorough investigation relating to the payments in question, Im not 
satisfied PayrNets actions were fair. Ultimately, PayrNet would have to be satisfied that 
Mr M wasnt entitled to the money himself to justify returning it back to the original sender. 
And as Ive seen nothing to persuade me that they asked Mr M for these particular proofs of 
entitlements, I dont find any plausible explanation as to how they satisfied themselves that 
Mr M wasnt entitled to the money. 
It therefore follows that I think PayrNet should refund Mr M the full balance of the three 
payments which was returned to source. I also dont think its reasonable that Mr M has been 
without his money for a long period of time. So, like our investigator, I think 8% simple 
interest should be paid on this amount.
Putting things right
Overall, based on the evidence received, I dont think PayrNet did enough to satisfy 
themselves that Mr M wasnt entitled to the money in the account  so I think they should 
refund him as he is now at a loss. And I think adding interest to the amount they refund him 
fairly compensates Mr M for the loss of use of his money. 
I also consider £100 compensation to be appropriate in the circumstances to recognise the 
distress this situation caused Mr M. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint. PayrNet Limited should do the following: 
Refund Mr M £780.90 which they returned to source.Calculate interest at 8% simple per year on the above amount. PayrNet should 
calculate this from the date they blocked the account up to the date they refund 
Mr M. 
HM Revenue & Customs requires PayrNet Limited to withhold income tax from the 
above-mentioned interest. PayrNet should give Mr M a certificate showing how much 
is taken off if Mr M asks for one. 
Pay Mr M £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Mr M needs to provide an up to date statement (dated in the last three months) to allow 
PayrNet to make the settlement. PayrNet must pay the compensation within 28 days of the 
date Mr M provides the up to date statement. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 February 2023.
