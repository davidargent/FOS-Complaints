The complaint 
Mr Os complaint is about the refurbishment charges Lex Autolease Ltd (Lex) have asked 
him to pay since he returned a car at the end of a hire period.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done I agree with the conclusions 
reached by the investigator for these reasons: 
Mr O acquired his car under a hire agreement. This is a regulated consumer credit
agreement and as a result our service is able to look into complaints about it.
The terms of Mr Os finance agreement said the car would need to be returned in
good condition and enabled Lex to charge for any damage beyond normal wear and
tear.
The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA) provide the industry
guidelines on what is considered fair wear and tear when a vehicle is returned after a
lease period. Thats the standard the inspector will have applied and the one Ive
used to assess the damage in the photographs contained in the inspectors report.
Having reviewed the areas of damage Lex are charging for I think all of the charges
have been applied fairly as the damage is clearly in excess of the standard that the
investigator accurately explained in her view. Ive been helped making that decision
as the inspector has added rulers to the pictures to help assess the length of
scratches and viewing aids to help assess where there are dents.
For these reasons, I dont uphold this complaint. 
DRN-1631523My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint against Lex Autolease Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 July 2020.
