K822xcomplaint
Miss H complains about the amount  that shes been  charged  for a car that was supplied  to 
her under a conditional sale agreement with Hyundai Capital UK Limited, trading as Hyundai 
Finance.
our initial conclusions
A new car was supplied  to Miss H under a conditional sale agreement with Hyundai Finance  
in January 2018. She says that shed agreed  a price for the car and a value for the car that 
she was part-exchanging  with the dealer. She also paid for a three year service plan. But 
when she checked  the amounts set out on the agreement she says she realised  that they 
were wrong. The dealer  has stopped  trading. Miss H complained  to Hyundai Finance that 
shed agreed a part-exchange  value of £8,000 but only received £6,250 and that shed paid 
for the service plan twice. She wasnt satisfied with its response so complained  to this 
service.
The adjudicator recommended that this complaint should be upheld in part. She said that 
Miss H had received  a discount of £1,151 in addition  to the part-exchange value of £6,250  
and that Hyundai  Finance  had offered to pay her £599 (which  with the £1,151  and £6,250 
totals £8,000). She was satisfied that this was a fair and reasonable offer.
Miss H has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman.  She has responded 
in detail and says, in summary, that she hasnt  received the £1,750 difference  between  the 
part-exchange values and that shes paid for the service plan twice.  She says that she 
agreed a cash deposit  of £14,000 but made  card payments  of £1,000  and £13,599 with the 
extra £599  being a second  payment  for the service plan.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss H says that the price agreed for the car was £30,610. But the invoice for the car shows 
that the total vehicle price was £29,459  (which included £499.17 for the three year service 
plan). The difference between £30,610 and £29,459  is £1,151.  
The invoice shows that the £29,459 was to be paid as follows: a £6,250  part-exchange 
allowance, £6,110 was to be financed  by a conditional sale agreement with Hyundai 
Finance, a deposit contribution from the dealer of £2,500 and the deposit of £1,000 that 
Miss H had paid by card in December 2017. That left £13,599 payable by Miss H and shes  
provided evidence  to show that she made a card payment of £13,599  in January 2018. 
The conditional sale agreement  shows that the cash price of the car was £29,459 and that 
the amount of credit was £6,110  so those amounts were  consistent with the amounts 
shown on the invoice. It also showed that the total charge for credit  was £309.76 and that 
Miss H was to make  24 monthly payments of £267.49.
Miss H has paid a deposit of £1,000,  shes received a part-exchange allowance of £6,250,  
shes entered into a conditional sale agreement to provide credit of £6,110  and shes made  a 
card payment of £13,599. So in total shes paid £26,959 for a car which had a cash price  of 
Ref: DRN77492832£29,459  the difference  between those two amounts being the £2,500 deposit contribution 
from the dealer.
So although  the amounts  arent as clearly set out as they couldve been, I consider that 
Miss H has paid the correct amounts for the car. And I dont consider that shes paid for the 
service plan twice. The difference  between the price that Miss H says was agreed  for the car 
and the price shown  on the invoice and conditional  sale agreement  is £1,151.  Miss H says 
that shes received  £1,750 less than she shouldve done for the part-exchange  of her car. 
And Hyundai Finance  has agreed  to pay her the difference between those two amounts 
which is £599. Im not persuaded  that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require  
Hyundai Finance  to pay to Miss H a higher amount than the £599  that its agreed  to pay her 
 or to require it to take any other action in response  to her complaint. 
my decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Miss Hs complaint in part. And I order 
Hyundai Capital UK Limited, trading as Hyundai Finance,  to pay £599  to her.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 October  2019.
