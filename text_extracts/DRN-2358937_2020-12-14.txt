The complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has rejected his complaint about an 
item he bought on eBay.
What happened
Mr M sold an item on eBay but the purchaser raised a dispute stating the item didnt work 
properly. eBay concluded this in the buyers favour and told Mr M to refund the purchase 
price and costs.
Mr M disagreed and said he was satisfied the item was working when it was sent. He felt 
hed been the victim of a fraud and didnt agree to make the refund. eBay then relied on its 
agreement with Mr M to claim the money from his linked PayPal account. PayPal wasnt able 
to collect the money from Mr Ms PayPal account as Mr M had removed his payment details. 
As a result, it had referred the matter to a collections agency.
Mr M unhappy that PayPals accepted the decision without carrying out its own investigation. 
Hes also unhappy that hes now unable to use his PayPal or eBay accounts because of this 
dispute. 
PayPal says it had acted in line with the PayPal user agreement. This specifically says that 
PayPal isnt required to verify or confirm the amount eBay presents to it following a dispute. 
On that basis PayPal didnt agree it had done anything wrong.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She said PayPal had acted in accordance with 
the eBay agreement Mr M had signed up to when he opened his eBay account.  For that 
reason, she didnt consider PayPal had done anything wrong so she couldnt ask it to refund 
the payment or stop asking Mr M for payment.
Mr M disagreed. He said it couldnt be reasonable for PayPal to rely on what eBay said, 
without first taking steps to verify the payment itself. He remains of the view this was an 
unauthorised transaction by PayPal and that hed been the victim of fraud. He felt PayPal 
was shielding eBay and this shouldnt be allowed. It was also unfair for PayPal to avoid 
responsibility by relying on his agreement with eBay and to then use this to chase him for 
payment. He asked for his complaint to be referred to an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise Mr M may be disappointed by my decision but, having done so, I dont uphold this 
complaint as Ill now explain.
Mr M is clearly unhappy with eBays decision to refund the purchaser the cost of the item 
hed bought from Mr M. However, eBay and PayPal are separate businesses and eBay 
doesnt come within the jurisdiction of this service. For that reason, I can only consider the 
actions of PayPal in my decision.
Ive seen that when Mr M joined eBay, he signed up to its terms and conditions. These 
include the eBay Money Back guarantee programme that both allows eBay to contact 
PayPal for any monies due to it and says that PayPal can accept eBays decision without 
undertaking its own investigation.  
I know Mr M feels this is unfair but this is what Mr M signed up to when he joined eBay so I 
cant reasonably say PayPal has done anything wrong by in acting in line with this 
agreement.
Mr M explained very clearly why he feels its for PayPal to carry out its own investigation and 
not just rely on what it was told by eBay. However, the agreement he signed with eBay 
specifically says PayPal doesnt have to do this. It also says that, where theres insufficient 
money in the consumers eBay account, eBay can go to PayPal to cover any shortfall. This 
is what happened in this case but while I can understand why Mr M finds it so frustrating, its 
whats provided for in the agreement between Mr M and eBay so I cant reasonably say 
PayPals done anything wrong.
When Mr M opened his PayPal account he also signed an agreement that allows PayPal to 
use a range of methods to recover any monies due from him. This would include instructing 
a collections agency. I can see Mr M feels very strongly that this is unfair but I cant agree its 
unreasonable or out of line with the terms and conditions of the agreement hed signed.
I recognise Mr Ms frustration at whats happened but, for the reasons given, I cant agree 
PayPal has done anything wrong. For that reason, I cant reasonably ask it to do anything 
more or to stop pursuing Mr M for the funds as he would like.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 January 2021.
