The complaint
Mr S complains that a television that he paid for using a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Hitachi Capital (UK) plc wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
Mr S entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Hitachi Capital to pay for a television in 
January 2020. The price of the television was £579, he made an advance payment of £58 
and agreed to repay the loan by 24 monthly payments of £26.09. He contacted the supplier 
in about February 2021 because the television wasnt working properly and he provided a 
photo showing the issue. The supplier said that it was caused by physical damage to the 
screen but then arranged for the television to be inspected by the manufacturer. It said that 
the screen had been damaged and that physical damage wasnt covered by the warranty.
Mr S complained to Hitachi Capital but it said that the television had been inspected and 
physical damage to the screen wasnt covered under the warranty. It said that Mr S had had the 
television for more than a year and it would be his responsibility to prove a manufacturing fault 
with the TV through an independent inspection. It said that Mr S had received a goodwill 
payment from the supplier of £50 and that the supplier had also paid for the manufacturers 
inspection. Mr S wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that there 
wasnt enough evidence to support that there was a manufacturing issue with the television for 
which Hitachi Capital was liable.
Mr S has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman.
'
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr S used credit, in the form of a fixed sum loan agreement with Hitachi Capital, to 
pay for the television;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ss complaint about Hitachi Capital, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the 
television and that Hitachi Capitals response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair 
or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ss claim under section 75 
as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr S says that the television isnt working properly so the breach of contract about 
which hes complaining is that the television wasnt of satisfactory quality when he 
bought it;
Mr S bought the television in January 2020 and he complained to the supplier about 
it in about February 2021  so hed had the television for more than a year;
he provided a photo showing the issue with the screen and the supplier said that it 
had been caused by physical damage to the screen which wasnt covered under the 
warranty;
the supplier arranged and paid for the television to be inspected by the manufacturer 
but it also said that the issue was caused by physical damage to the screen which 
wasnt covered under the warranty; 
the photo that Mr S has provided shows lines on the screen but it also shows that the 
television isnt supported by its bracket or a wall mounting and is leaning against 
some boxes on the floor  theres clearly a jagged line across the screen and I 
consider it to be more likely than not that the issue has been caused by physical 
damage to the screen;
Hitachi Capital said that if Mr S obtained an independent inspection report that 
confirmed that there was a manufacturing fault with the television, it would review that 
evidence  but Mr S hasnt provided an independent inspection report on the issues with 
the television;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres a manufacturing 
fault with the television or that it wasnt of satisfactory quality when Mr S bought it  so 
Im not persuaded that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
the supplier says that the issue was caused by physical damage which wasnt covered 
under the warranty  and Im not persuaded that theres been a misrepresentation or 
breach of contract relating to the warranty;
I consider that Hitachi Capitals response to Mr Ss complaint has been fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances; and  
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Hitachi Capital to allow 
Mr S to reject the television, to pay for it to be repaired, to pay him any compensation 
or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2022.
