The complaint
Mr E is unhappy PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wont refund money he lost as a result of a 
scam.
  
What happened
Mr E agreed to purchase a car online. The seller said hed have the vehicle delivered and Mr 
E would be refunded if he didnt want to keep it. Unfortunately for Mr E, he was actually 
communicating with a fraudster. 
Mr E believed he was paying for the vehicle using an escrow service provided by PayPal. He 
received an invoice via email setting out the details of this arrangement.
Suspicious of the email, Mr E contacted PayPal using its genuine live chat service. An 
automated response suggested he should send the email to a PayPal email address 
dedicated to establishing whether correspondence was fraudulent or otherwise.
Mr E did as asked and received a response shortly afterwards. It said PayPal didnt think the 
email was fraudulent, so Mr E proceeded to make the payment - £5,390.
When the vehicle wasnt delivered, Mr E contacted both PayPal and his bank. PayPal said 
that the payment hadnt gone through its platform, so they wouldnt reimburse Mr E. His 
bank refunded 50% of the loss.
Mr E complained  he said hed relied on the information provided by PayPal and wouldnt 
have gone ahead otherwise  so it should be responsible for his loss. 
One of our investigators agreed. They were satisfied that the email Mr E received had come 
from PayPal and that he was entitled to rely on its contents. So they recommended PayPal 
refund the remainder of Mr Es loss, as well as 8% interest and £100 compensation.
PayPal disagreed, it said that it couldnt have verified the validity of the sale because the 
payment wasnt made through its platform. It also disputed that the email had come from 
PayPal.
As no agreement could be reached, the case was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There are two main points of disagreement between the parties:
- Whether, as a matter of fact, the email allegedly from PayPal advising Mr E that the 
email was not fraudulent, actually came from it; and
- Whether Mr Es decision to proceed with the payment in light of that email does, in 
any case, mean PayPal are liable for the remainder of Mr Es loss
Im persuaded by Mr Es version of events, that is:
- He contacted PayPals live chat to ask for advice about the emailed invoice 
- He sent a copy of the email to PayPals dedicated inbox 
- He received a response from that inbox advising him that the email was not 
fraudulent
Ill explain why.
PayPal have provided evidence of the live chat  its clear thats what happened. Mr E has 
provided both a copy of the email he sent to PayPal and the response he received. PayPals 
correct, genuine email address is visible on both Mr Es email and the reply  so Im satisfied 
the emails havent actually been sent to, or come from, another address. That makes it very 
unlikely that the response is actually from the fraudster (theres also no suggestion the 
fraudster ever had access to Mr Es emails). 
That leaves only one other plausible explanation  that Mr E fabricated the email evidence. I 
dont think this is the case. As mentioned its undisputed that Mr E contacted PayPals live 
chat service to ask for advice and theres every reason to think that he would have followed 
that advice. The email evidence is also compelling  its timestamped, and PayPal havent 
disputed that it contains wording used by it to respond to reports of fraudulent emails (a 
search online also suggests other people have received a very similar response from PayPal 
after reporting a suspected fraudulent email). 
PayPal have provided a list of all the emails they sent to Mr E and the email in dispute does 
not appear. However, all the emails on the list are either marketing emails or relate to 
transactions which have taken place through the PayPal platform. Essentially, it appears to 
be a list of emails linked to activity on his account. But, as PayPal point out, this transaction 
did not happen through Mr Es account and its not clear whether an email which was sent to 
a general inbox would be linked to his account and appear on this list.  
In any case, as Ive set out, Ive seen persuasive evidence that the email did come from 
PayPal and even if the list shows all emails, regardless of whether they are linked to account 
activity, such a record is not infallible.  
On balance then, Im persuaded that the email did come from PayPal.
On the issue of liability, Im satisfied that Mr E was reasonable in relying on PayPals 
response, it said:
We analyzed your report and determined that the suspicious email does not appear to be 
fraudulent.  While this one may not be fraudulent, we appreciate you taking the time to report 
the suspicious email.
While not completely unequivocal, the response is quite a strong endorsement of the 
authenticity of the email (an email which PayPal easily ought to have identified as fraudulent 
 given that it contains numerous incorrect statements about how PayPal operates). As 
PayPal are not only the experts in this regard, but providing a service dedicated to identifying 
fraudulent emails, I can see why Mr E was reassured and went ahead with a payment he 
was otherwise reluctant to make.
So, despite Mr E not having made the payment through the PayPal platform, Im satisfied 
that it should bear some responsibility for the loss, as it provided incorrect advice which Mr E 
reasonably relied on. Mr E has already received 50% reimbursement through his bank, I think its fair PayPal should refund the remaining loss. Im also satisfied that Mr E has been 
deprived of this money which he would have otherwise used for a specific purpose, so I think 
8% simple interest is appropriate here too. 
Though I accept the perpetrator of the fraud is the chief cause of the distress and 
inconvenience caused to Mr E, the scam could have easily been prevented if PayPal had 
taken more care in deciding whether the email Mr E received was authentic. Had that 
happened, Mr E would have been saved the upset of losing a significant sum of money. So, 
Im also of the view that PayPal should pay Mr E £100 in compensation.
    
My final decision
I uphold this complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA and instruct it to pay Mr E:
- £2,695  half the amount he transferred to the fraudster.
- 8% simple interest per year on that amount from the date he made the payment to 
the date of settlement. 
- £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 October 2021.
