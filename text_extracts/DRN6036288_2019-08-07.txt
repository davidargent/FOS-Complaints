K820x#14complaint
Mrs B says Financial Insurance Company Limited  (FICL) mis-sold her a payment protection  
insurance (PPI)  policy.  
background
Mrs B bought the policy in 1997  at the same time as taking out a credit  card.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mrs B disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Bs case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs Bs complaint because:
 A box was ticked on the application  form to indicate that Mrs B wanted PPI. So I think  
FICL made Mrs B aware that she had a choice about buying the PPI, and that she 
chose to take it. Even  if the form was completed by the salesperson, by signing it she 
indicated that the information on it was correct. 
 FICL  didnt recommend the PPI to Mrs B so it didnt have to check if it was right for her. 
 Its possible the information FICL gave Mrs B about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Mrs B doesnt  appear  to have been affected by any of the main  
things the policy  didnt cover  and based on what I know about  her circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been  useful to her. While she had some sick pay the PPI 
wouldve paid out on top of this. And it also covered unemployment. So I dont think  
better information wouldve stopped her buying  it. 
Ive taken into account Mrs Bs comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 September 2019.
