The complaint
Mrs A complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to her the money that she paid for some holiday club membership 
points. Her husband is also involved in her complaint and shes being represented by a 
claims management company.
What happened
Mrs A and her husband had bought a trial membership of a holiday club and they entered 
into an acquisition agreement in September 2008 to trade-in the trial membership and buy 
some membership points in the holiday club. The purchase price of the points, with 
membership dues, was £18,294 from which a trade-in value of £5,995 was deducted so the 
amount due from them was £12,699. Mrs A entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with a 
finance provider for a loan of £15,360.97 (which included £2,661.97 of credit that was being 
refinanced).
Mrs A and her husband entered into another acquisition agreement in February 2009 to buy 
some more holiday club membership points. The purchase price of the additional points, with 
membership dues, was £9,651. Mrs A entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of £25,565 to pay that amount to the holiday company 
and to refinance her September 2008 loan. She agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of 
£382.16 to Barclays Partner Finance. 
Mrs As representative made claims, on Mrs As behalf, to Barclays Partner Finance under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in July 2019. It said that Barclays 
Partner Finance was liable for: breaches of contract, misrepresentation and negligence of 
the holiday company; procuring a breach of fiduciary duty; and an unfair relationship.
Barclays Partner Finance didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so Mrs A 
complained to this service. Her complaint form says that: the holiday company and Barclays 
Partner Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan; 
Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared 
to her and the holiday company unduly pressured her and her husband into entering into the 
acquisition agreement and her into entering into the loan agreement; all rendering the loan 
agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs As complaint should be upheld. He said that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of the section 75 
misrepresentation claim to turn it down and he didnt think that the holiday company had 
breached the contract. He said that he hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship 
between Mrs A and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and he wasnt persuaded that a 
court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He didnt consider that 
Barclays Partner Finance had acted incorrectly in connection with any commission paid to 
the holiday company and he said that he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that 
the lending was unaffordable for Mrs A. 
Mrs As representative, on behalf of Mrs A, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. It has provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday 
company and the unfair terms that it uses and it has raised its serious concerns about the 
way that the finance was sold to Mrs A. It also says that the holiday company didnt broker 
proper credit, the provision of finance was unfair and failed to reach the standard expected 
of a regulated firm, and Mrs A has suffered harm as a result of the actions of both the 
holiday company and Barclays Partner Finance.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs As complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs As claims were made under sections 75 and 140A and her complaint is about 
Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims - I accept that she referred her 
complaint to this service within six years of her claims being made but I need to 
consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to her claims;
Im not determining the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that - Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to them was fair and reasonable in the circumstances but Barclays Partner 
Finance didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so I cant say that its 
response to them was fair or reasonable;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs As claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the 
holiday company and that the membership points were misrepresented to her and 
her husband and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs A could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her and her 
husband into buying the membership points in February 2009 as that was the latest 
time that any misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have 
been incurred as that was when she also entered into the loan agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance;I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made 
to Barclays Partner Finance until July 2019, more than ten years later so was outside 
of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act and I consider that Barclays Partner 
Finance would have had a defence to her section 75 misrepresentation claim and I 
find that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have rejected that claim;
Mrs As representative says that because of the unfair terms in the contract, its 
unenforceable and Mrs A and her husband are entitled to rescind it and to recover 
from Barclays Partner Finance all of the money that they have paid to it under section 
75, but our investigator didnt think that the holiday company had breached the 
contract;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract by the holiday company and the time limit for a breach of contract claim is 
six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which is when 
everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs A could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the unfair terms in the contract soon after she entered into the 
contract and I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would 
have had six years from then to bring a breach of contract claim against either the 
holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a breach of contract claim wasnt 
made to Barclays Partner Finance until July 2019, more than ten years later so was 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act and I consider that Barclays 
Partner Finance would have had a defence to her section 75 breach of contract claim 
and I find that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have rejected that claim;
Mrs As representatives July 2019 letter to Barclays Partner Finance says that its 
liable for the negligence of the holiday company but the letter provides no further 
information about the alleged negligence and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that theres been any negligence by the holiday company for which 
Barclays Partner Finance would be liable under section 75;
that letter also says that Barclays Partner Finance is liable for procuring a breach of 
fiduciary duty because it paid a commission to the holiday company but didnt obtain 
Mrs As informed consent to the commission;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid 
by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company and, from what this service has 
seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less 
than 15% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner Finance wouldnt have breached 
any fiduciary duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any regulatory duty 
to disclose the amount of commission paid in these circumstances;
Mrs As representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs A and 
Barclays Partner Finance and Mrs As complaint form says that the holiday company 
and Barclays Partner Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of her ability to 
afford the loan; Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the holiday company 
which wasnt declared to her and the holiday company unduly pressured her and her 
husband into entering into the acquisition agreement and her into entering into the 
loan agreement;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;Barclays Partner Finance has provided a loan account statement which shows that 
Mrs As loan was still active in June 2023 so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance 
should have responded to her section 140A claim - section 140A gives a court the 
power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the 
debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship 
between the debtor and the creditor;
Barclays Partner Finance hasnt provided any evidence to show what assessment it 
conducted of Mrs As ability to afford the loan and neither Mrs A nor her 
representative has provided any evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for 
Mrs A in February 2009 when it was made to her;
the loan account statement shows that Mrs A made the monthly loan repayments of 
£382.16 from March 2009 to June 2023 and that the outstanding balance of her 
account in June 2023 was £2,661.97;
Mrs A and her husband signed a members declaration in February 2009 which said: 
We understand clearly what we have purchased and, having carefully considered 
this, and our other financial commitments, are able to pay the amounts due on the 
dates agreed;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs A asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its affordability assessment before July 2019  as the loan was 
made to her in February 2009 I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to 
have raised any concerns about the affordability assessment that it conducted before 
then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan was mis-sold 
to Mrs A, that the holiday company brokered the loan to Mrs A incorrectly, that the 
provision of the loan to her was unfair or that the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance failed to reach the standard expected of a regulated firm,
I dont consider that the level of commission that was normally paid in this type of 
situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays Partner Finance should have 
appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mrs A risked the relationship being 
unfair under section 140A;
Mrs As complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured Mrs A and 
her husband into entering into the acquisition agreement and Mrs A into entering into 
the loan agreement  but Mrs A and her husband signed the members declaration 
which said: We have read and fully understand all of the above;
the loan agreement that was signed by Mrs A says: You have the right to cancel this 
agreement. You have until [specified date in February 2009] in which to do so (this 
date must be at least fourteen days after the day you signed the agreement; but Ive 
seen no evidence to show that Mrs A contacted Barclays Partner Finance about any 
issues with the loan or the membership points until July 2019, more than ten years 
later;
Mrs A and her husband had previously bought a trial membership, they bought some 
membership points in September 2008 and they then bought more membership 
points in February 2009 - if they were concerned about the way that the membership 
points had been sold to them in February 2009 and didnt want to buy the additional 
points, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted either 
the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance about their concerns  but Ive 
seen no evidence to show that they said that theyd been unduly pressured into 
entering into the agreements until July 2019, more than ten years later;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs A and her husband 
were unduly pressured into entering into the acquisition agreement, that Mrs A was 
unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mrs As representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in those agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents that were signed by Mrs A and her husband in February 2009 have been 
applied or operated unfairly against them or that theres been a breach of any 
applicable regulation or EU directive and I consider it to be unlikely that a court would 
conclude in these circumstances that the terms of the documents created an unfair 
relationship between Mrs A and Barclays Partner Finance;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs As relationship 
with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs A and 
Barclays Partner Finance in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt issue a substantive response to Mrs As claims so I 
cant say that its response to her claims was fair or reasonable  but if it had properly 
responded to her claims I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it 
not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mrs A for the issues that she and her husband have had with their 
membership points, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to her any of the 
money that she's paid for the points, to cancel her loan agreement, to pay her any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs As complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 August 2023.
