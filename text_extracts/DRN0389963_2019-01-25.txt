K821x#15complaint
This complaint is about a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy  taken out with a credit 
card in 1996. Miss W says National Westminster  Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-sold her the PPI.
background
I sent Miss W and NatWest a provisional decision on 28 December 2018 to explain why I 
didnt think the PPI policy had been mis-sold  but did think NatWest paying  back some  of the 
cost of the PPI was fair. An extract from my provisional decision is set out below:
When selling the PPI, NatWest had to make it clear to Miss W that she had a choice about 
it. But Miss W says the PPI was added  without her consent and she wasnt aware  it has 
been added.
NatWest has sent us a copy of Miss Ws application  form for the credit  card.  This included  a 
section on PPI, with yes  and no boxes to be ticked to show  whether she wanted to take it 
out. And the yes  box has been  ticked.
Miss W has said that the tick doesnt look like her handwriting, and so she thinks NatWest 
ticked the box after she had handed  it in to the branch. But, if Miss W didnt want the PPI, I 
think she could have  ticked  the no box. And I dont  think theres enough evidence here for 
me to say that someone  else ticked the yes box against Miss Ws wishes.
Based on the evidence  I have, I think its likely  that NatWest did make it clear  to Miss W that 
she had a choice  about the PPI. And that Miss W chose to take it, knowing she didnt have 
to.
I havent seen  clear evidence that NatWest gave Miss W any personalised advice about the 
PPI. So I dont think it recommended the PPI to her. This means NatWest didnt have to 
check if the PPI was right for Miss W. But it did have to make  sure she got the information 
she needed in order to decide if the PPI was right for her.
Its possible the information NatWest gave Miss W about the PPI wasnt  as clear as it 
shouldve been.  But, based on what Ive seen of her circumstances at the time,  it doesnt 
look like she was affected by any of the exclusions to or limits on the PPI cover.  And the PPI 
couldve paid out for longer than shes told us she wouldve been entitled to sick pay from 
her employer.
Miss W told us she also had critical illness cover and PPI on her mortgage. But critical illness  
cover provides cover for different risks than PPI. And her mortgage PPI wouldnt have 
covered the repayments on her credit card.  So I still think this PPI wouldve been useful for 
her if something went wrong. It also looks like it was affordable. So I dont think better 
information about the PPI would have put Miss W off taking it out.
Miss W has also said she never made  claim on the PPI, even when she was made 
redundant, which shows she wasnt aware of it. But, while Miss W may not have  been  aware  
of the PPI sometime after the sale,  I dont think this necessarily means she wasnt  aware of it 
during the sale.  And, as Ive explained  above, I dont  think the PPI was mis-sold.
Which means NatWest doesnt  have to pay back all of the cost of the PPI to Miss W.
Ref: DRN03899632But NatWest  should pay back some of the cost of the PPI to miss W because : 
NatWest got a high level of commission  and profit share (more than 50% of the PPI 
premium) - so it should have told Miss W about  that. Because  NatWest didnt tell Miss 
W, that was unfair.
To put that right, NatWest has basically offered to pay back the amount of commission  
and profit share that was above  50% of the PPI premium - and I think that offer is fair in 
this case.
Miss W has questioned why NatWest didnt  write  to her to check if she still wanted PPI when 
her credit card was changed from a VISA to a MasterCard.  And shes suggested  she didnt 
agree to this change. But Miss Ws credit card continued to operate in the same way, so I 
dont think NatWest needed her agreement to make this change. And NatWest didnt have to 
check that the PPI was right for Miss W, either  at the sale or afterwards. So it didnt  have to 
check whether she still wanted  the PPI after this change.
Miss W has said that she asked to cancel the PPI, but that NatWest  continued to take 
payments for it for several months. Miss W initially  said she asked to cancel the PPI in 
October 2013, and sent us a letter from NatWest  which she said confirmed the PPI had been 
cancelled.
But the letter  actually  says that her card protection policy  had been  cancelled. And NatWest 
has sent us a recording of the phone call in which Miss W asks to cancel the policy,  and its 
clear she is talking about card protection, not PPI. So I think NatWest acted correctly  in 
cancelling her card protection policy, but not her PPI, at that time.
Miss W hasnt been able to give us any detail, such as exactly  when  and how she asked or 
what was said, about any other times she asked to cancel the PPI. And NatWest  doesnt 
have any record of her asking to cancel the PPI. So I dont think  theres  enough evidence  for 
me to say that NatWest failed to cancel  the PPI when Miss W asked,  or continued  to charge 
her for the PPI after it shouldve been cancelled.
NatWest has said that the PPI was ultimately  cancelled in March 2014,  and has sent us 
copies of its records showing Miss W wasnt  charged for PPI after this date. NatWest  cant  
say how or why the PPI was cancelled. But I havent seen any suggestion  that Miss W 
wanted the PPI to continue after this, so its likely NatWest acted in accordance with her 
wishes in cancelling  the PPI here. And I dont  think shes suffered a loss as a result  of the 
PPI being cancelled here.
Miss W has also said she thinks NatWest is withholding copies of call recordings from her. 
But NatWest  says not all calls with it are recorded  and it cant locate any further recordings 
of calls with her.
From the information its sent us from its attempts to find further  call recordings, I think its 
likely that NatWest has carried  out a reasonable investigation and is unable to find any 
further recordings. I dont think theres enough evidence for me to say that NatWest is 
withholding call recordings it has found from Miss W. And, due to the amount of time that 
has passed since the calls, I also think its reasonable that NatWest  cant find any further 
calls.
I said Id consider anything else either Miss W or NatWest  sent me.
Ref: DRN03899633NatWest said it didnt  have anything further to add. Miss W re-stated some  of the arguments 
shed previously made about  the box ticked on the application  form, the cancellation of the 
policy and the calls NatWest hadnt provided.
Miss W also said that the Financial Ombudsman Service  initially  suggested that NatWest 
should refund the PPI payments she made from when  she asked to cancel the policy until it 
was actually cancelled,  and that she felt this should still be paid to her. She also said that 
NatWests poor record keeping had weakened  her case.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive already considered the arguments Miss W had previously made, and addressed  them in 
my provisional decision. So I still feel the relevant conclusions  in my provisional decision are 
correct.
This complaint is about the sale and administration of the PPI policy.  And so I havent 
considered whether the Financial Ombudsman  Service ever told Miss W she would receive  
a refund of PPI premiums as a result of NatWests failure to cancel the policy. I have though 
explained in my provisional decision  why I didnt think there was enough evidence for me to 
say that NatWest failed  to cancel the PPI when Miss W asked, or continued to charge her for 
the PPI after it shouldve been  cancelled.  So Ive explained why I dont think  NatWest  should 
be required  to refund any premiums to Miss W as a result of this.
I appreciate that Miss W feels  NatWests  poor record keeping has weakened her case. But, 
due to the amount of time that has passed since the sale and the calls, I dont think its 
unreasonable that NatWest cant provide any further  evidence.  So I dont think it would be 
reasonable to draw  any adverse conclusions  against NatWest for its failure to provide further  
evidence.
Where the evidence available is incomplete or inconclusive, I must come to a decision on 
what I think is likely to have happened, based on the evidence  I do have. And, on this basis, 
I explained in my provisional decision  why I didnt think the PPI policy had been mis-sold or 
NatWest had failed  to cancel it.
Overall then, I still dont think the PPI policy was mis-sold and so I dont think NatWest  has to 
pay back all of the cost of the PPI to Miss W. But I do still think NatWest  should pay back  
some of the cost of the PPI.
putting things rights
NatWest should  pay back to Miss W any commission and profit share it got that was more  
than 50% of the PPI premium. NatWest  should also pay back to Miss W any extra  interest 
she paid because of that.
Ref: DRN03899634NatWest should  re-work  the credit  card account  and pay back  to Miss W the difference 
between what Miss W owes and what she wouldve owed if the commission  and profit  share 
it got hadnt been over 50% of the cost of the PPI. NatWest  should also pay Miss W 8%* 
simple interest if she paid off her credit card at some point.
*Businesses have to take basic rate tax off this interest. Miss W can claim back the tax if she doesnt pay tax.
my final decision
The PPI policy wasnt mis-sold  so National Westminster Bank Plc doesnt have to pay 
back all of the cost of the PPI to Miss W.
But National  Westminster Bank Plc does  have to pay back  to Miss W any commission  and 
profit share it got that was more than 50% of the PPI premium.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am now required to ask Miss W to 
accept or reject my decision  before  25 February  2019.
