In our most recent adjudication, our adjudicator explained that they thought none of the 
loans shouldve been provided to Miss I. 
Uncle Buck  hasnt responded so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss I 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN83946092But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  was required to establish 
whether Miss I could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Is complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, Uncle Buck should  not have provided Miss I with loan one  or 
any subsequent  loans, as at the time she applied for loan one, she was clearly already in 
financial difficulty. And having looked at Miss Is complaint  I agree.
At the time Miss I applied  for loan one, Uncle Buck completed a credit check  while  gathering 
information about her finances. I can see from this check that Miss I already had outstanding  
short-term loans with other lenders  and that her repayments already exceeded the income  
she had declared  to Uncle Buck. So, it was clear that she could  not have sustainably paid 
this loan, or any subsequent loans. And I dont think that Uncle  Buck shouldve entered in to 
a lending relationship with her.
As Ive explained, at the beginning of a lending relationship, proportionate checks  may be 
less thorough, this does  not mean that information  gathered should  be ignored. Uncle Buck  
gathered this information itself, and the results of the credit checks  shouldve  prompted it to 
further examine  Miss Is financial  position. Had it done so, I think its likely it wouldve 
concluded that she was in financial difficulty,  and not entered in to the relationship with her.
Ref: DRN83946093Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Uncle Bucks lending  history with Miss I, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Uncle Buck should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Uncle  Buck should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Is case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan seven. I say this because:
At this point Uncle Buck ought to have realised Miss I was not managing  to repay  
their loans  sustainably.  Miss I had taken  out seven loans within  six months and Miss I 
had been indebted  to Uncle Buck for the entire time. So, Uncle  Buck ought to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Miss I was having to borrow further  to cover the 
hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Is 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Is first loan was for £100  and loan seven was for £350  and at this point her 
repayments were the highest they had ever been. At this point Uncle Buck  ought  to 
have known that Miss I was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in their 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From  loan seven onwards Miss I was provided with a new loan within days  of settling 
a previous one. 
Miss I wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Uncle  Buck. Loan 
eighteen was taken out over three  years  after Miss Is first. And it was for a larger  
amount. Miss I had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to 
Uncle Buck over an extended  period.
I think that Miss I lost out because Uncle Buck continued to provide borrowing from loan 
seven onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Is indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss I borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Is ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
I have also noted  that there are gaps between  a few of Miss Is loans  I dont consider that 
these are long enough  for me to separate her borrowing  into separate  chains of lending.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans one to six and loans seven to eighteen and 
Uncle Buck  should  put things right. 
putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
You shouldnt have given Miss I loans one to eighteen.
If you have sold the outstanding debts,  you should  buy these back if you are able to do so 
and then take the following steps. If you are not able to buy the debts back, then you should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
Ref: DRN83946094A)You should add together  the total of the repayments made by Miss I towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything you have already  refunded.
B)You should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments  made  by Miss I 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss I originally made 
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C)You should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made by Miss I as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans.  If this results in Miss I 
having made overpayments then you should refund these overpayments with 8% 
simple interest* calculated  on the overpayments,  from the date the overpayments 
would have arisen, to the date the complaint  is settled. You should then refund the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step E.
D)If there  is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts  calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans [and any 
principal youve already  written-off].  If this results in a surplus, then the surplus should 
be paid to Miss I. However,  if there is still an outstanding balance then you should  try 
to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss I. You shouldnt pursue outstanding 
balances made  up of principal you have already written-off.
E)You should remove any adverse information  recorded on Miss Is credit file in 
relation to loans  one to six. The overall pattern of Miss Is borrowing for seven to 
eighteen means any information  recorded  about them  is adverse, so you should  
remove these loans  entirely from Miss Is credit  file. You do not have to remove loan 
eighteen from Miss Is credit file until this have been repaid,  but you should still 
remove any adverse information  recorded  about this loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  you to deduct tax from this interest.  You should  give Miss I a 
certificate showing  how much tax youve deducted, if they ask for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Miss Is complaint. Uncle  Buck Finance LLP 
should put things right set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss I to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 March  2020.
