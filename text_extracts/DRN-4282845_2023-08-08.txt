The complaint
Ms L complains that she is unable to use her NewDay Ltd trading as John Lewis Partnership 
Card account due to verification problems.
What happened
Ms L says she is unable to register her NewDay account card as she doesnt have a mobile 
telephone due to signal problems at home. She says she spent a significant time period 
trying to speak to NewDay about the issue but was unable to get through to it. Ms L says she 
has lost about £25 in a spending bonus per month. She would like that money paid and for 
NewDay to provide her with an alternative to using a mobile telephone. She would also like 
NewDay to employ more staff to answer calls and says she is deemed to fail security as a 
code is sent to a mobile number.
NewDay says it upheld Ms Ls complaint in part and offered £35 compensation. It apologised 
for the wait times on calls and says it cant provide an alternative to using a mobile 
telephone.
Ms L brought her complaint to us, and our investigator upheld the complaint. He 
recommended NewDay pay £65 compensation and that it provides an alternative solution.
I asked both sides for further information. NewDay says Ms L can call it on a landline and it 
will register her account. It says Ms L will be able to receive security codes via her landline, 
but it hasnt answered my question about receiving codes when Ms L may be in a store for 
example.
Ms L says she has tried to contact NewDay to register her card but cant get through to it. 
She says the system will not work as NewDay say she must have a mobile telephone.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and said that NewDay should increase its 
compensation offer but I didnt think we could direct that it finds a solution to a problem in 
circumstances where it may not be able to comply with such an order.
I appreciated Ms Ls frustration here that though no fault of hers, she doesnt have a mobile 
telephone signal at her home. NewDay is aware of its obligations in those circumstances, 
and I was satisfied that it has now partially offered a solution.
 I said there was no dispute here that NewDay didnt deal appropriately with Ms Ls initial 
complaint. I could see that NewDay had fairly apologised and offered compensation. But I 
also thought NewDay told Ms L that it couldnt offer her any alternative to using a mobile 
telephone. I had no doubt Ms L spent a significant time period trying to call NewDay and 
would have been caused inconvenience. I also thought this issue had been ongoing for 
many months and at least initially, NewDay was unable to offer any form of a solution. For 
those reasons I didnt think the compensation offer went far enough and provisionally 
thought NewDay should pay £100 compensation which I thought fairly reflected what took 
place and is fair and reasonable. I said I cant fairly order NewDay pay the £25 per month as 
that depended on an unknown spending amount. 
I was satisfied that NewDay has now offered an alternative to the use of a mobile telephone. 
I appreciated Ms L says she cant get through to NewDay to register her landline and I also 
didnt think it clear what would happen if Ms L did register the card but was sent a password 
when at a shop for example. I appreciated that there was an impasse between the parties 
here. Ms L says she cant speak to NewDay about the registration, and it says Ms L should 
be able to manage her account via her landline number. But I said its not our role to work 
out a solution or sort this problem out. And it may be, this is a problem that simply cant be 
resolved.
Overall, I was satisfied that NewDay should increase its compensation offer to fairly reflect 
the inconvenience caused and the length of time it took. But I said I cant fairly order 
NewDay to implement a solution that may not be workable or that it may not be able to 
introduce. I said we are not NewDays regulator and so it was not our role to ensure it 
complies with Financial Conduct Authority rules and directions. It is also not our role to direct 
NewDay increase its staff levels as Ms L suggests it do.
NewDay has replied to my provisional view and says it has nothing further to add.
Ms L says she would like the compensation paid to an external account and says the £35 
was not paid.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the same overall view I reached in my provisional decision 
and for the same reasons.
Putting things right
I make clear to Ms L my provisional view was that NewDay pay a total of £100 
compensation. It appears that it has paid £35 but Ms L cant access it. In those 
circumstances NewDay should arrange to pay Ms L a total of £100 compensation to the 
account she supplies it details of. NewDay can no doubt deduct the £35 from the account it 
paid it to.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and order NewDay Ltd trading as John 
Lewis Partnership Card to pay Ms L a total of £100 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 September 2023.
