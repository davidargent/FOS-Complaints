Mr P complains that the loans he had from MYJAR  Limited were  unaffordable to him.
background
Mr P had eight loans from Myjar between February  2017 and October  2018  as follows:

Mr P says that, at the time, he already  had multiple  other credit commitments, including 
other short-term loans and was struggling  to pay his priority bills. He says the loans 
continued to increase as he became more dependent on them  and Myjar didnt ask for full 
details of his financial circumstances.  Mr P adds that the stress has affected  his work and 
personal life and had a detrimental effect on his mental health.
Myjar says Mr P was asked about  his income and expenditure  at the time of each loan 
application. It says it also carried out credit  checks  and calculated affordability as a 
percentage of Mr Ps disposable income.  It says that based on this, and Mr Ps repayment 
record, it believed all the loans were affordable.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She said that by loan 6, 
Mr Ps pattern of borrowing suggested he had become persistently reliant  on short-term 
loans. She recommended  that interest  and charges (plus 8% statutory interest) should be 
refunded on loans 6 to 8 and that the loans should  be removed from his credit  file.
Myjar did not respond to the adjudicators assessment.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Myjar needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN69809612But certain factors might  point to the fact that Myjar should fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Myjar was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
Loans 1 to 3
Im satisfied Myjar did enough checks before it approved Mr Ps first three  loans. His 
declared disposable income indicated the repayments were  affordable and I cant see there 
was anything on the credit file to suggest  he may have difficulty  repaying  the loans.
Loan 4
When Mr P applied  for loan 4, it was for significantly  more money and was on the same  day 
hed repaid the previous  loan. Because of this I think Myjar should  have asked  him whether 
he had any other outstanding  short-term  loans. I cant see it did this, but there  is nothing  in 
the available  information to show Mr P had other short-term loans at the time.
Loan 5
By the time Mr P applied  for his fifth loan, I consider Myjar should have carried out a full 
financial review. I say that because even though there was a gap in borrowing after loan 4, 
Mr P had been taking  short-term loans from Myjar for over a year by then. Again, I cant  see 
Myjar carried out such a check, but the available information does not clearly indicate that 
Mr P was having trouble managing his money.
Ref: DRN69809613Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Myjars lending history with Mr P, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Myjar should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Myjar  should have realised that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
By loan 6, Mr P had been  borrowing from Myjar for well over a year  given such 
high-cost loans are designed for short-term  use, I consider  it unlikely Mr P was using  
the loans for the purpose for which they were intended;
Loan 6 was taken out on the same  day that loan 5 was repaid;
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr P was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one. So Myjar ought to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr P was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances and that Mr Ps indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably;
Mr P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Myjar. Loan 8 was taken  
out 18 months after Mr Ps first. And it was for almost twice the amount. Mr P had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to service a debt to Myjar over an extended period.
I think that Mr P lost out because Myjar continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ps 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 8 and Myjar should  put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. MYJAR  Limited should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr P paid on loans 6 to 8;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on refunds from payment date to settlement date*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loan 8, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr P; 
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 8 should be removed from 
Mr Ps credit file once loan 8 has been  repaid.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Myjar to take off tax from this interest. Myjar must give 
Mr P a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If Myjar intends  to 
apply the refund to reduce  any outstanding  capital  balance, it must do so after deducting  tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 February  2020.
