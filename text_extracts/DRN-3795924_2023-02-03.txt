The complaint
Mr P complains about the service he received from PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA.
What happened
In mid-2022, Mr P raised several concerns with PayPal: 
Hed raised a Subject Access Request (SAR) but PayPal hadnt provided him with 
the information he requested. 
PayPal had failed to make reasonable adjustments for his deteriorating eyesight. 
PayPal hadnt provided him a copy of his credit agreement by post or by email as 
requested. 
PayPal had charged him a late payment fee of £12 for goods hed returned and was 
chasing him for this.
In response PayPal said:
A data access request was lodged internally, and the information was sent to Mr P 
via email in March 2021. A further request was made, and additional information had 
been sent to Mr P in August 2021. PayPal said it would look into the matter further if 
Mr P let it know what information was missing.
It had noted Mr Ps request for larger font in June 2022 and this would be actioned 
where possible. It said that as PayPal is an online payment processor, it may not be 
possible for some automated correspondence to be sent in larger font. It suggested 
Mr P might zoom in or increase the font size on the device he uses to access his 
emails.
It had requested a hard copy of Mr Ps credit agreement and this would be sent out in 
five days.
There was an outstanding balance of £24 on Mr Ps PayPal Credit account, but 
PayPal had added £24 to clear the balance.
Mr P remained unhappy, so he asked our service to consider his concerns. Our investigator 
didnt find reason to uphold Mr Ps complaint. She was satisfied PayPal had acted in line 
with the terms in the credit agreement. She didnt think PayPal had acted unreasonably with 
regards to Mr Ps SAR but had clarified what he wanted with PayPal on his behalf. She 
thought it was reasonable for PayPal to have suggested adjustments he could make on his 
phone or computer to access its services. She acknowledged Mr Ps distress that PayPal 
had sent correspondence in braille but was satisfied it had corrected its records, so didnt 
need to take further action.
Mr P disagreed with our investigators outcome. He made some further comments regarding 
the handling of his SAR. He said PayPal hadnt given him any information about the terms 
and conditions of the credit agreement, prior to or during the transaction. He said PayPal 
had failed to keep its promise to send correspondence in large font and communicate using 
his personal email address or by telephone. So, the complaint has been passed to me to 
decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ps complaint. Ill explain why.
Id like to reassure Mr P I have considered all his points, even if Ive not addressed each of 
them individually. Ive focused on what I believe is most relevant to the outcome of his 
complaint.
Mr P previously brought a complaint about PayPal to our service which was resolved in June 
2022, after Mr P accepted PayPals offer to pay him £650 compensation. It wouldnt be 
appropriate for me to consider issues that relate to Mr Ps previous complaint.
Im aware that Mr P has recently raised some further concerns with PayPal. Weve asked 
PayPal if it would be willing to allow us to consider these matters as part of this complaint. 
However, it hasnt given us permission to do so. 
This means that I can only consider the concerns raised prior to PayPals final response 
letter dated 2 September 2022. Mr Ps other concerns would need to be brought to PayPal 
as a separate complaint if he wants us to look into them.
Subject Access Request 
Its not our services role to determine whether or not a business has complied with data 
protection laws. Thats the role of the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). We also 
dont have the power to fine a business for a potential breach. But we can award 
compensation to consumers who have suffered financial loss or have been caused distress 
and inconvenience as a result of a financial business not dealing with a SAR as it should 
have done.
PayPal says Mr P raised two SARs in 2021, and information was sent to him in March 2021 
and August 2021. Mr P says he raised a further SAR in April 2022 because there was 
information PayPal hadnt provided to him.
From what Ive seen, £550 of PayPals settlement offer in June 2022 (in relation to his 
previous complaint) was for his data protection dispute. So, it wouldnt be appropriate for me 
to consider any distress or inconvenience Mr P might have experienced prior to accepting 
PayPals offer.
However, Mr P says there was still information outstanding from his SAR. PayPal says it 
tried to call Mr P prior to issuing its final response letter to his complaint on 2 September 
2022 but was unable to get hold of him. In the final response letter PayPal said it would look 
into the matter further if Mr P let it know what information he required.
Mr P says hed asked PayPal to provide all of the information it holds on him. However, 
PayPal had already provided some information in response to Mr Ps previous SARs and it 
had also told him some information (such as call recordings) wasnt available. So, I dont 
think it was unreasonable for PayPal to try to seek clarification on what remained 
outstanding. 
Mr P has raised concerns about PayPal failing to make adequate attempts to contact him to 
discuss his SAR. I can see that after our investigator got involved, PayPal agreed to send 
him all personal information that hadnt been provided as a result of previous SARs. I also note that Mr P has raised concerns about being unable to access emails PayPal has sent. 
However, these issues appear to have arisen after PayPals final response letter of 
September 2022, so are beyond the scope of what Im able to consider in this decision.
Reasonable adjustments
Mr P has complained that PayPal failed to make reasonable adjustments for him, by failing 
to send correspondence and documents in large font. In other words, hes complained that 
PayPal has failed its duty to make reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act 2010. 
Ive taken the Equality Act 2010 into account when deciding this complaint  given that its 
relevant law  but Ive ultimately decided this complaint based on whats fair and reasonable. 
If Mr P wants a decision that PayPal has breached the Equality Act 2010, then he'd need to 
go to Court.
Mr P says he repeatedly asked PayPal to send correspondence or messages to his personal 
email address because he had difficulty using its system. He says PayPal continued to send 
correspondence in small fonts, despite promising it had noted and would implement his 
requests. 
Mr P says PayPal sent him correspondence by braille on at least two occasions, although he 
cant read braille. He says he found this insensitive and distressing. PayPal says it regrets 
any upset this caused Mr P. It says braille is often used by customers with vision impairment 
and was not intended to distress him. 
Having a visual impairment doesnt mean the only useful reasonable adjustment is braille. I 
think it was unreasonable for PayPal to have sent Mr P correspondence in that format  
particularly after hed explained he needed a larger font.
I understand some emails may not have been able to go out in the format Mr P had asked 
for. However, if the information was important there was an onus on PayPal to take steps to 
share this in a format Mr P could read (e.g. in larger font via post or email). Mr P shouldnt 
have had to rely on third parties to read confidential information or to access PayPals 
services. So, while this doesnt currently apply to Mr P because his account is now closed, 
this is something PayPal needs to be mindful of in future when corresponding with 
consumers who have visual impairments. 
I think PayPal should have taken more care to consider Mr Ps needs and ensured it 
communicated with him in a way that was useful. I appreciate Mr P experienced some 
frustration and inconvenience as a result of PayPal failing to do so. However, PayPal has 
acknowledged its error and I think this is enough in the circumstances.
Late payment fee and credit agreement
Mr P says there was a delay in a seller refunding him for items he purchased using his 
PayPal Credit account. He says he informed PayPal that the goods had been returned, and 
the seller was to arrange refunds, before his first payment was due. 
PayPal says it has acted in accordance with the terms of its credit agreement. It says that if 
Mr P returned the goods, it was between him and the seller. A payment must be made when 
its due. 
Mr P has commented that PayPal should have opened a dispute when he informed it that 
the goods were defective, and he was returning them. I dont have any call recordings to tell 
me exactly what might have been discussed. But I wouldnt expect PayPal to automatically raise a dispute. A consumer would normally be expected to attempt to resolve the matter 
with the seller first. 
The credit agreement says that the minimum payment showing on the monthly statement 
needs to reach PayPal by the payment due date. It also says PayPal may charge £12 if the 
minimum monthly payment does not reach us by the Payment Due Date. So, I cant say it 
was unfair for PayPal to charge Mr P £12 if he didnt pay the minimum payment by the due 
date. I also dont think it was unreasonable for PayPal to pursue Mr P for the late payment. 
PayPal says Mr Ps PayPal Credit application would not have been successful unless he had 
confirmed he understood and agreed to the terms and conditions. 
Mr P says he wasnt made aware of the terms and disputes agreeing to them. He says an 
employee of the seller assisted him in completing the purchase of the items. However, I 
dont think PayPal is responsible for the actions of the sellers representative. 
Mr P says PayPal failed to honour its promise to send the credit agreement in large font and 
only sent it in normal font in September 2022. 
PayPal hasnt commented on the delay in providing Mr P with a copy of the credit agreement 
after he asked for it, or the reason for not sending it in large font. However, I understand that 
it has removed the late payment fees and has since closed Mr Ps account. And I think this is 
enough to resolve the matter.
In conclusion
I know my answer will be disappointing for Mr P. Unfortunately, Im not able to consider all of 
the matters hes raised and his ongoing concerns with PayPal. But, I havent found reason to 
uphold this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 March 2023.
