K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains about a decision by LeasePlan UK Limited (LeasePlan)  to hold him liable 
for a penalty  charge notice (PCN)  that it paid (in respect of a car on hire to him at the 
relevant time), plus an administration fee for doing  so.
background
In mid-2017 Mr H entered into a hire agreement (for a car) with LeasePlan.
In late-2018, as was his right, Mr H terminated  his hire agreement.
In April 2018 a third party, that I will call A, issued a PCN in respect of the car on hire to 
Mr H. This was set at £100 reducing  to £60 if paid within 14 days.
In the same  month  LeasePlan notified  A that the car, at the material time, was on hire to 
Mr H.
In the same  month  LeasePlan says it wrote to Mr H to inform  him of the PCN it had received. 
And that if it received a second notification of the same it would pay the sum being  sought 
and recharge  it to Mr H together  with an administration fee (as set out in the hire terms and 
conditions). 
In December 2018 A wrote to LeasePlan to say that it had been unsuccessful in securing 
payment from Mr H in respect of the PCN and was now holding LeasePlan liable for it. In 
December 2018  the PCN  had increased to £160.
LeasePlan paid the PCN of £160  and recharged  this sum to Mr H plus an administration fee 
of £42.
In February 2019,  and having received notice from LeasePlan that it was seeking £202 from 
him, Mr H raised a complaint. In summary  he said he had received nothing from either 
LeasePlan or A in respect of the PCN so had been deprived the opportunity of disputing  it.
This complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded it shouldnt be 
upheld. In summary she said LeasePlan had done nothing  wrong  in seeking the sum of £202 
from Mr H.
Mr H responded to say that he didnt agree. In summary he said that he hadnt  received 
LeasePlans letter dated April 2018 or any letters from A. Furthermore  he might have 
expected LeasePlan to do more than send just one letter  and no that no notice was attached 
to the car by A on the date in question.
The investigator considered Mr Hs response to her view but wasnt  persuaded to change 
her mind. Therefore the complaint has been  passed  to me for review  and decision.
Ref: DRN70322212my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear Mr H has very strong feelings  about this complaint. He has provided detailed  
submissions in support  of his view which I can confirm  Ive read and considered  in their 
entirety. However, I trust that Mr H will not take the fact that my findings focus on what  
I consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, 
as a discourtesy.  The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The 
purpose of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching  them.
I would also like to point  out that where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive  or 
contradictory, I make my decision on the balance of probabilities - that is, what  I consider is 
most likely to have happened given the evidence that is available  and the wider surrounding 
circumstances.
Mr H says he didnt receive LeasePlans letter dated April 2018. But Ive seen a copy of this 
letter (correctly addressed) and Ive no reason to doubt it wasnt sent. Furthermore in cases 
such as this I only need to be satisfied the letter was sent, not that it was received.
Mr H says that LeasePlan could and should have  sent him further  letters after its April 2018 
letter. But given that Ive seen no evidence that this letter was returned to LeasePlan, as 
undelivered for example,  that LeasePlan received anything from A until December 2018 and 
given that LeasePlan informed A in April 2018  of Mr Hs correct  address, Im not persuaded 
it should have  done.
Turning to the PCN itself Im satisfied that LeasePlan was entitled,  under the terms of the 
hire agreement, to pay this and then seek recovery of this sum, together  with an 
administration fee, from Mr H. It should also be noted that had LeasePlan not paid this PCN 
when it did there was the risk of it increasing  and LeasePlan (and ultimately Mr H) being  held 
liable for a much larger sum than £202.
Finally, and for the sake of completeness, I would add that if Mr H has any concerns about 
the actions, or inactions, of A then this is something he needs to take up with A. Ive no 
power to consider such concerns.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 June  2019.
