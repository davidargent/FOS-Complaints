The complaint 
Mr Ms complaint is about arrears on a finance agreement he had with Volkswagen Financial 
Services Limited (VWFS).
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The instalment VWFS are demanding payment for was always payable under the
terms of the finance agreement. They havent made a mistake when requesting
payment.
But they should have raised a new mandate in time for Mr M to pay his May
instalment on time.
So its fair for VWFS to compensate Mr M for that error. Theyve now offered to
provide £50 compensation in relation to the distress and inconvenience caused and
to remove any adverse credit reports they may have made to Mr Ms credit file, once
the arrears have been paid. In the circumstances I think thats reasonable.
For these reasons, I uphold this complaint in part. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint about Volkswagen Financial Services Limited 
in part. They should:
reduce the balance of Mr Ms account by £50 to compensate him for the distress and
inconvenience their actions have caused;
remove any adverse reports they may have made to his credit file in relation to this
issue but only when the arrears have been paid.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2020.
