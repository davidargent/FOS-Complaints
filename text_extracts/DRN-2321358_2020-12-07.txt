The complaint
Mr H is unhappy that Barclays Partner Finance (BPF) trading as Clydesdale Financial 
Services (CFS) activated a loan agreement before he agreed the work as complete. He 
would like this looked into.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties , so I will not repeat them here. 
Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusion reached by our investigator for these reasons:-
The loan agreement Mr H took out on 15 August 2019 allowed for the funds 
to be released on approval of the loan or at a later date if requested by the 
retailer. 
Mr Hs wife signed a customer satisfaction statement  10 September 2019 . I 
appreciate that form states it should be signed by Mr H  his name is on the 
form and he took out the loan. However, I dont think its unreasonable for the 
retailer to have accepted Mr Hs wifes signature as agreement that the work 
had been completed.
I have seen no evidence to show that Mr Hs wife was pressured into signing 
the form as suggested.
CFS activated the loan on 11 September 2019. Given the terms in the finance 
agreement and the signed customer satisfaction statement I dont think it was 
unreasonable of BPF to have done this.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2021.
