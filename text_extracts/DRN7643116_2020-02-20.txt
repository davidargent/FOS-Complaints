Mr P complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly 
lent to him. 
background 
Between December  2015 and May 2018, Mr P took out 36 loans. I have  set out the first ten 
loans below:

It appears that there may be an outstanding balance on some of Mr Ps later loan accounts. 
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be upheld in respect of loans 6 to 36. Sunny 
didnt agree. However, upon reflection, it said that it should  have  done  things differently after 
loan 18. It offered compensation  and said that it would remove loans 20 to 36 from Mr Ps 
credit file. Mr P did not respond to either our adjudicators initial view or the offer from Sunny. 
On that basis, the matter  has been  passed  to me to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
As I said above, Mr P didnt dispute what our adjudicator said about loans 1-5. On that basis, 
Ive concluded  the parties  agree that the complaint shouldnt  be upheld  in respect of that 
borrowing and so I havent considered these loans further. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. It had to 
find out whether  Mr P could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  Im satisfied that by loan 
6, the lending history  and pattern of lending clearly demonstrates that the lending was 
unsustainable.
I accept that the loan payments being  affordable on a pounds and pence  basis might be an 
indication a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt  automatically 
Ref: DRN76431162follow this is the case. This is because the relevant  regulations  define  sustainable  as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint. And Ive also looked at the overall  
pattern of the lending history with a view to seeing  if there was a point at which Sunny 
should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. If 
it was, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans. 
As I said above, this point  was reached at loan 6. I say this because  loan 6 was the sixth 
loan Mr P had applied for in six months.  It was also taken out on the same day that he repaid 
loan 3. It seems to me that Sunny should have realised it was most likely  that Mr P was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan had left in his finances. 
The application for loan 6 also came  the day after Mr P had to make  a fairly significant  
repayment towards loan 4. It should  have been  clear to Sunny by this stage that Mr  P 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying that loan was leaving in his finances 
and that his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. It should have known Mr P was not 
likely borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an on going need.  
I think that Mr P lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on his ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 36 and Sunny should put things right.
Ref: DRN76431163putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny should  not have given Mr P loans 6 to 36. 
As I said above, there may be an outstanding balance on some of Mr Ps loans. If it has sold 
the outstanding debts,  it should buy these back if it is able to do so. It must then take the 
following steps. If it is not able to buy the debts back, it must liaise  with the new debt owner 
to achieve the results  set out below:  
a)Sunny  must add together  the total of the repayments made by Mr P towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  
anything it has already refunded; 
b)Sunny  must calculate 8% simple  interest on the individual payments made  by Mr P 
which were considered as part of paragraph  (a), calculated from the date Mr P 
originally made  the payments to the date the complaint is settled; 
c)Sunny  must remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans and treat any repayments  made by Mr P as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr P having 
made overpayments,  Sunny must refund those overpayments with 8% simple 
interest* calculated on the overpayments. Simple interest  must  be calculated  from 
the date the overpayments would  have arisen  to the date the complaint is settled. 
Sunny must then refund  the amounts calculated at paragraphs (a) and (b) and move  
to step (e). 
d)If there  is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts  calculated  in (a) and (b) 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans (and any 
principal that has already been  written off). If this results in a surplus, the surplus 
should be paid to Mr P. However,  if there is still an outstanding balance, Sunny must  
try to agree an affordable  repayment  plan with Mr P. It shouldnt pursue outstanding 
balance made  up of principal it has already written off. 
e)The overall pattern  of borrowing for loans 6 to 36 means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. Sunny should remove  these  loans  entirely  from Mr Ps credit 
file. It does not have  to remove the loans from the credit file until they have been 
repaid  but it should still remove any adverse information recorded about them. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr P 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr Ps complaint. Sunny must comply  with 
the above putting things  right section. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 March  2020.
