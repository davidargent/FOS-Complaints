K821x#15Complaint
Mr M says Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him. 
Background
This complaint is about twenty-two high-cost  short term credit loans that Sunny provided to 
Mr M from July 2015 onwards. Mr Ms last loan was provided in November 2017. Our 
adjudicator partially  upheld  Mr Ms complaint  and thought he shouldnt  have been provided 
with the loans from loan 6 onwards. Sunny disagreed with our adjudicators  assessment and 
so the complaint was passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the key relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided. Having 
looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M, I think that Sunny should  
reasonably have seen that Mr M was unlikely to have been able to make his payments in a 
sustainable manner  by the time it provided loan 6. 
Ref: DRN77956912I say this because  by this stage  Mr M had an established borrowing pattern of taking out further 
loans not too long after repaying previous ones. And loan 6 was actually provided before  Mr M 
had repaid loan 5. Sunny continued lending to Mr M even when this pattern  was repeated  and 
in circumstances  where it ought reasonably  to have realised that any further loans were more  
likely than not unsustainable for him. I dont think that the monthly repayments being  less than a 
certain percentage of Mr Ms income or the fact that he repaid the loans  means that it as fair 
and reasonable for Sunny  to have provided  them in the first place.
Mr M had to pay interest and charges on loans that Sunny shouldnt have provided  him with. 
So I think that he lost out and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr M paid on loans 6 to 22;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number of loans  provided means that any information recorded about loans 6 to 22 
on Mr Ms credit file is likely to be adverse.  So all reference to these loans should be 
removed from Mr Ms credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mr M compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2020.
