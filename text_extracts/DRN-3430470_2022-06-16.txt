The complaint
Mr H complains that MoneyGram International Limited (MoneyGram) wont refund money he 
lost after falling victim to a scam.
What happened
Mr H says he was looking for a mobile phone on an online market place and found one he 
wanted priced at $500USD. He messaged the seller to let them know he was interested, and 
they asked that he pay half of the purchase price up front. Mr H says the seller lived 
overseas and operated a business trading in a different overseas country. Mr H says they 
communicated about the phone via the sellers business contact details on a messaging app.
After sending an initial payment of $250USD, the seller asked Mr H to send more money to 
cover costs including shipping, customs and tax. Altogether Mr H says he sent £1,500 
through various payments from his MoneyGram account as well as two other money transfer 
services.
Mr H sent four payments in total from his MoneyGram account. The lowest payment was for 
£191.46 and the highest was for £380.70. The payments were made between 18 January 
and 25 January 2021.
Mr H says he became aware he was the victim of a scam, after discussing the purchase with 
a friend. Mr H didnt receive the phone and couldnt get the seller to return the money hed 
sent to them. So, Mr H got in touch with MoneyGram and raised a fraud claim.
MoneyGram considered Mr Hs fraud claim but declined to refund him. MoneyGram 
explained that the funds were released to a person who identified themselves as the 
intended receiver of the money transfer. They did this by providing the sender and receivers 
names, the long original reference number of the transaction and presented photographic ID. 
MoneyGram said all necessary steps were taken to ensure the correct person got the funds. 
MoneyGram also said Mr H was presented with a scam warning, which shouldve alerted 
him to the fact he may be the victim of a scam.
Mr H wasnt happy with MoneyGrams response, so he brought a complaint to our service.
An investigator looked into his complaint but didnt uphold it. They felt that the payments 
werent so remarkable they thought MoneyGram shouldve been concerned that Mr H 
mayve been at risk of fraud. Also, MoneyGram couldnt recover the funds as they had been 
collected by the intended recipient in line with their terms and conditions.
Mr H disagreed with the investigators opinion, saying he wasnt aware that this type of thing 
could happen and had he known he wouldnt have made the payments through MoneyGram. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In deciding whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of a complaint, Im required to 
take into account relevant: law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; 
codes of practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to be good industry practice at the 
time.
I understand that Mr H is very upset about losing this money and wasnt aware of these 
types of scam and how they work. However, having reviewed his case, Ive reached the 
same answer as the investigator.
In broad terms, the starting position in law is that MoneyGram is expected to process 
payments that a customer authorises it to make, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the customers account and the Payment Services Regulations (PSRs). And I 
have taken that into account when looking into what is fair and reasonable in this case. But 
there are situations where we might expect MoneyGram to intervene before processing a 
payment. 
MoneyGram have provided a copy of the warning they say Mr H wouldve seen before 
making a payment. This suggests MoneyGram has systems and checks in place to try and 
prevent Mr H from falling victim to a scam. But a warning by itself isnt enough to say 
MoneyGram have met their obligations. So, Ive also considered whether I think the 
payments shouldve been identified by MoneyGram as suggesting that Mr H mayve been 
the victim of fraud.
Mr H opened his MoneyGram shortly before making the first payment to the scammer, so 
there was little account activity in order for MoneyGram to determine what Mr Hs usual 
spending habit or transaction pattern looked like. Also, Im conscious that a MoneyGram 
account is used slightly differently to a standard bank account and can have regular or 
frequent payments which are usually sent overseas. 
In this case, having considered the size of the payments Mr H made, the time period over 
which he made them and his previous use of his MoneyGram account  Im not satisfied that 
these payments were so remarkable that I wouldve expected MoneyGram to intervene 
before processing the payments. And, as the funds were collected prior to the scam being 
reported by Mr H, there was nothing further MoneyGram couldve done to try and recover 
the funds for him. 
I appreciate that Mr H is going to be very disappointed, but I cant fairly ask MoneyGram to 
refund him.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 July 2022.
