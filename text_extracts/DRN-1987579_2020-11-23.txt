The complaint
Mr W complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
MotoNovo Finance Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality. Hes being helped with his 
complaint by a representative.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr W under a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo 
Finance that he electronically signed in July 2019;
MotoNovo Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory quality 
will depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the car and the 
price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr W was nearly five years years old, had been driven 
for 65,387 miles and had a price of Â£11,475;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
there were some issues with the car so Mr W returned it to the dealer for repairs but 
the issues continued and the dealer stopped trading so Mr W complained to 
MotoNovo Finance in September 2019 and his representative said that Mr W wanted 
to reject the car; 
MotoNovo Finance arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert in 
October 2019  the experts report recorded the cars mileage as 68,655 and 
concluded that there were some issues with the car but said:
 there was no evidence presented at time of the inspection to suggest that 
the vehicle was unfit for its intended purpose not being road legal and in our 
opinion the condition of the vehicle these are the criteria laid out in section 75 
traffic to allow the vehicle used in public highway therefore considered fit for 
purpose and being of satisfactory quality for a vehicle its age and reported 
mileage, this opinion based on the current issues are either not critical issues 
or age-related general wear and tear issues;
Mr W didnt accept those findings and complained about on-going issues with the car 
so MotoNovo Finance arranged a second independent inspection of the car in May 
2020 when the cars mileage was recorded as 77,570  that experts report 
confirmed that there were some issues with the car but concluded:
We do also have to take into consideration the time and mileage elapsed 
since the point of finance inception. On this basis, on the balance of 
probability, we consider the reported defects would not have been developing 
at that time and have progressed and developed thereafter due to general in 
service wear and deterioration, which would not be unexpected;
Mr Ws partner has provided photos and video showing the issues with the car  but 
the second independent inspection took place ten months after the car had been 
supplied to Mr W and in that time it had been driven for more than 12,000 miles;
both independent experts have concluded that the issues are due to wear and tear, 
have developed since the car was supplied to Mr W and that the car would have 
been of satisfactory quality at that time;
Im not persuaded that its likely that the car would have been driven for more than 
12,000 miles in ten months if it hadnt been of satisfactory quality when it was 
supplied to Mr W;
I sympathise with Mr W and his representative for the issues that theyve had with the 
car and I can understand the frustration that they feel in these circumstances, but Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr W and I consider that MotoNovo 
Finance has responded to his complaint fairly and reasonably; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require MotoNovo Finance to 
allow Mr W to reject the car, to pay for it to be repaired or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2020.
