* Maximum monthly repayment including overlapping loans
Mr C says he had no disposable income and to repay the loans he had to borrow again. He 
says his credit report showed other debt and financial issues and Lending Stream shouldnt 
have agreed to the loans. Mr C adds that hes lost his job and has mental health problems.
Lending Stream says it asked Mr C about his income and expenditure and checked his 
credit file. It says that based on the information it had, it found all the loans to be affordable 
and it considered it had carried out proportionate checks.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld in part. She found that by 
loan 4, Lending Stream should have been aware Mr C was having problems managing his 
money. She added that, by loan 7, Mr Cs borrowing pattern suggested hed become reliant 
on short-term loans. She recommended that interest and charges should be refunded on 
loans 4 to 12 (plus 8% statutory interest), that negative information about loans 4 to 6 should 
be removed from Mr Cs credit file and that loans 7 to 12 should be removed entirely.
Lending Stream did not respond to the adjudicators view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Mr C could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to 
make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
Loans 1 and 2Im satisfied Lending Stream carried out proportionate checks for these loans. I say that 
because it was early in the lending relationship and the repayments were a small proportion 
of Mr Cs declared income. I cant see there was anything in the available information that 
should have suggested loans 1 and 2 were unaffordable.
Loan 3
When Mr C took out loan 3, loans 1 and 2 were still outstanding which meant his maximum 
monthly repayment was over £320. Lending Streams credit check also showed a recent 
default on his account. As a result, I dont consider Lending Streams checks went far 
enough before it approved loan 3.
 
That said, there is nothing in the available information that would have indicated to Lending 
Stream that the repayments on loan 3 were unaffordable so I cant conclude it was wrong to 
approve the loan.
Loans 4 and 5
Mr C hadnt fully repaid any of his other loans when Lending Stream approved loans 4 and 
5. This meant his monthly repayment continued to increase to over £400. I consider this 
combined with the recent default should have been an indication to Lending Stream that 
Mr C was struggling to manage his money and that it was irresponsible to continue to lend to 
him.
Loan 6
By this time, Mr C had five other Lending Stream loans, his credit file showed a second 
default and hed missed his July payment for loans 1 to 5. With the maximum monthly 
repayment heading towards £500, I find Lending Stream should have realised the lending 
was becoming unsustainable and should have declined this loan application.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Lending Streams lending history with Mr C, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Lending Stream should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
By the time Mr C applied for loan 7, hed been borrowing from Lending Stream for 
almost seven months and the term of the loan meant hed be in debt for over a year. 
As these high interest loans are intended for short-term use, I consider Lending 
Stream should have realise Mr C was not using the lending for that purpose;
Mr C still had five other short-term loans outstanding with Lending Stream;
Due to Mr Cs borrowing pattern, I think Lending Stream ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr C was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Cs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably;
Mr C wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Lending Stream. Loan 
12 was taken out 13 months after Mr Cs first. It was for a similar amount and his maximum monthly repayment was the highest yet. Mr C had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Lending Stream over an extended period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Lending Stream continued to provide borrowing at loan 7 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time;
the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Cs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for high-cost loans.
So Im upholding Mr Cs complaint about loans 4 to 12 and Lending Stream should put 
things right.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part, Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending 
Stream) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr C paid on loans 4 to 12;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write off any unpaid interest and charges for loans 8 to 12, apply the refund to 
reduce any capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr C; 
Arrange to repay any portion of the sum due to the third party that is made up of 
interest and charges  including any added by the third party;
Pay Mr C interest and charges he has already paid to the third party plus 8% interest 
simple per annum on each amount from the payment date to the date of settlement;
Remove any negative information about loans 4 to 6 from Mr Cs credit file.
The number of loans taken by loan 7 means any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about loans 7 to 12 should be removed from Mr Cs credit file, 
once the loans have been repaid;
Request the third party to remove adverse information it may have recorded about 
loans 8 to 12 once they have been repaid.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If 
Lending Stream intends to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it 
must do so after deducting the tax.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 October 2020.
