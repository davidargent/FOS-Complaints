DRN-3785600
Complaint
Miss L is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed her accounts 
without telling her why.
Background
In September 2022, NatWest took the decision to close Miss Ls accounts and provided her 
with two months notice before doing so. Miss L complained. However, NatWest didnt 
uphold Miss Ls complaint. As Miss L remained dissatisfied, Miss L referred the matter to our 
service.
One of our adjudicators looked into Miss Ls concerns. He didnt think that NatWest had 
done anything wrong or treated Miss L unfairly and so didnt recommend the complaint be 
upheld. Miss L disagreed and so the complaint was passed to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered everything, I dont think that NatWest acted unfairly towards     
Miss L and so Im not upholding her complaint. Ill explain why in a little more detail.
As our adjudicator explained to Miss L, a bank is generally under no obligation to continue 
offering an account to a consumer if it doesnt wish to do so. I know that Miss L is unhappy 
that NatWest closed her accounts. However, each bank has its own criteria and risk 
assessment for deciding whether to open (or close) accounts and providing a customer with 
an account is a commercial decision that a bank is entitled to take. 
Furthermore, having looked at the circumstances and the terms and conditions of Miss Ls 
accounts, Im satisfied that NatWest had sufficient grounds to close Miss Ls accounts and 
as such its decision to do so wasnt unfair in the circumstances. I realise that NatWests 
decision will have been very disappointing to Miss L. And I can appreciate why the closure of 
her accounts will have caused her inconvenience. But despite this, Im simply not in a 
position to be able to tell NatWest it should have continued offering Miss L accounts in 
circumstances where it legitimately decided it no longer wished to bank with her.
Overall and having considered everything, I dont think that NatWest has acted unfairly or 
unreasonably towards Miss L and Im not upholding this complaint. I appreciate this will be 
very disappointing for Miss L. But I hope shell understand the reasons for my decision and 
that shell appreciate why NatWest was entitled to close her accounts in the way that it did.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Miss Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2022.
