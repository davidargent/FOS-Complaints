K820x#14complaint
Mr B and Mrs S complain  that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) have applied  
charges to their account that they believe are unfair, disproportionate and excessive. They  
also said some  charges had been  incorrectly applied  and that NatWest  didnt  help them 
when in financial difficulties. 
background
Mr B and Mrs S held a joint current account for several years.  NatWest  says their overdraft  
facility was increased to £4,000 in November 2008.  From time to time Mr B and Mrs S 
exceeded the agreed overdraft limit and on occasions they incurred charges from NatWest 
as a result. Mr B and Mrs S say when they did go over the agreed overdraft, they always 
brought the balance back under the limit the same day. 
Mr B and Mrs S applied for a loan online with NatWest to try and consolidate some debt. 
NatWest declined the loan and says it followed the correct procedure. Eventually Mr B and 
Mrs S stopped using  the joint account and agreed a repayment plan with NatWest. 
Mr B and Mrs S feel the charges NatWest  applied to their account  were unfair and excessive 
and they also feel some of the charges applied to the account were incorrect. NatWest 
hasnt agreed to refund any of the charges and says the charges were  correctly applied in 
line with the terms  and conditions. 
Our investigator explained that because of a 2009  Supreme  Court  ruling,  charges  couldnt 
be challenged on the basis that theyre  excessive or unfair, but we could  investigate  whether 
they had been applied  correctly. He was satisfied the charges had been properly applied  to 
the account. He also didnt find NatWest  had done anything wrong in declining  the loan. 
Mr B and Mrs S didnt agree so asked  for the matter to be reviewed by an ombudsman.  
 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The main  point made by Mr B and Mrs S is that the charges were excessive, 
disproportionate and unfair. They also disputed NatWests position that the charges  were 
applied correctly and in line with the terms and conditions.
Charges made by banks were well publicised as part of a Supreme Court decision in 2009.  
The Supreme Court didnt  say such charges  were  unfair. And following the Supreme Courts  
decision, banks  havent been  obliged to refund charges on the basis that they were 
excessive or unfair. 
I appreciate that Mr B and Mrs S say the charges were disproportionate  but for the reasons 
Ive explained  I think they were  correctly applied and cant  be challenged on that ground.   
To be clear the charges  applied  to Mr B and Mrs Ss account included  arranged overdraft 
fees, unarranged overdraft fees,  overdraft interest and return  fees. Ive looked at the terms 
and conditions on Mr B and Mrs Ss account  for these  charges and having done so Im 
satisfied that NatWest had made clear that charges and fees would be incurred in certain 
situations  such  as entering  an overdraft or unauthorised  overdraft. So I dont think  NatWest  
has charged for something that they didnt have authority  to charge for. 
Ref: DRN13276642Mr B and Mrs S say NatWest didnt correctly apply credits they made to the account  which  
should have taken the account under the agreed overdraft limit. Neither  NatWest  nor Mr B 
and Mrs S have been able to provide the exact  time many of these  transfers were made but 
thats not surprising considering how long ago some  of these charges date back. 
NatWest did provide some details  for transfers made and these show  the transfers were 
made and received the following day, and in any event, it isnt guaranteed  that the transfer 
will be received the same day. So I cant safely  conclude NatWest  made  an error in 
processing the payment the way they did. 
Relevant regulations and codes of practice  in place over the period in question say that 
banks should  deal fairly with customers in financial hardship, and treat them positively and 
sympathetically. I appreciate that Mr B and Mrs S say they were in such  difficulties. Mr B and 
Mrs S had an agreed overdraft of £4,000  on the account. During the relevant period the 
account had, to a large extent, been  operated  within that facility. And where  Mr B and Mrs S 
did go over the agreed limit the account was brought back in order  swiftly and sometimes  on 
the same  day. There were  also occasions  when Mr B and Mrs S went  months without 
exceeding the limit at all. So Im not persuaded NatWest  ought to have known if Mr B and 
Mrs S were  in financial difficulty from the operation of their account alone.
Mr B and Mrs S asked NatWest  for a consolidation  loan but NatWest declined.  NatWest say 
they followed the correct procedure and based  on the information available, they were 
unable to agree to Mr B and Mrs Ss request.  There are several  factors  that lenders take into 
account when  agreeing  to lend, including credit history and other borrowing. In the 
circumstances, I dont  find NatWest  was acting unfairly if Mr B and Mrs S didnt meet their 
lending criteria. However the refusal of the loan might have prompted NatWest  to ask more 
questions about  Mr B and Mrs Ss financial situation.  
There is no one right way a lender has to do this; it doesnt have to refund charges or freeze  
interest. But it should consider what options  are available to help customers. I can see that 
Mr B and Mrs S stopped  using the account in July 2017  I understand that NatWest has 
since frozen interest on the account  and has agreed a repayment  plan with Mr B and Mrs S, 
which I consider to be a positive step but I dont think there  is enough to show  NatWest 
should have done anything else sooner. So whilst I understand the sentiments behind Mr B 
and Mrs Ss arguments that it should be NatWest that should have done more, considering 
the information provided I think  they did enough. 
Ive thought carefully about everything Mr B and Mrs S have said, and although I may not 
have highlighted  everything theyve said in this decision, I want them to know Ive read it and 
taken it into account.  But overall Im satisfied NatWest havent treated Mr B and Mrs S 
unfairly, so I wont be telling them to refund any charges or take any other action.
my final decision
For the reasons  mentioned above,  I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision  before  17 March  2020.
