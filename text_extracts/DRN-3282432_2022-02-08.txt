The complaint
Mr W and Mrs W complain National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly refused to 
allow them to port Mrs Ws mortgage and add Mr W to it. They think NatWest should 
reimburse the early repayment charge (ERC) Mrs W became liable for when she redeemed 
her mortgage. 
What happened
Mrs W had a capital and interest repayment mortgage of around £170,000 with NatWest. In 
December 2018 she took a fixed interest rate product which was subject to an ERC if she 
repaid the mortgage before the end of March 2024.
Mrs W wanted to sell her property and transfer her fixed interest rate to a new joint mortgage 
with Mr W to buy a new property together. She approached NatWest in March 2020 who 
said, in principle, theyd lend them up to around £363,000.
In June 2020, Mrs W discussed things again with NatWest who said theyd be willing to lend 
them a lower amount of around £324,000. This was less then theyd expected and felt they 
would have been able to borrow before the coronavirus pandemic had happened. It meant 
they couldnt go ahead and buy the property they wanted. In around August 2020 Mr W and 
Mrs W applied to NatWest for a mortgage through a broker. But NatWest then declined to 
offer them a mortgage altogether on grounds it wasnt affordable for them.
Mr W and Mrs W were offered a mortgage by another lender. But Mrs W was subject to an 
ERC of around £5,000 to redeem her existing mortgage with NatWest. Mr W and Mrs W felt 
it was unfair they had to pay that as they thought NatWest had unfairly refused to lend to 
them. 
When NatWest didnt uphold Mr W and Mrs Ws complaint, they brought it to this service. 
Our investigator didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly and didnt uphold their complaint. 
Since Mr W and Mrs W were unhappy with that outcome, their complaints been passed to 
me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im grateful to the parties for the detailed information theyve provided. I may not mention 
here everything theyve said. That reflects the informal nature of this service and no 
discourtesy is intended. Id like to reassure the parties Ive carefully considered the 
information and arguments theyve provided in reaching my decision. 
Mr W and Mrs W have argued, amongst other things, NatWest treated them unfairly 
because they tried several times to stay with NatWest out of loyalty; another lender offered 
them more than NatWests most recent offer; and Mrs W was discriminated against because 
she was self-employed and took financial assistance offered by the government during the 
pandemic, which wrongly gave the impression she was in financial difficulties when Mr W 
was able to cover their outgoings.
I can understand it was disappointing for Mr W and Mrs W that NatWest refused their 
mortgage application and the ERC they had to pay was a significant sum to find. And I 
appreciate Mr W and Mrs Ws strength of feeling. But, for the reasons Ill explain, I dont think 
NatWest acted unfairly.
I know Mr W and Mrs W dispute this, but from what Ive seen, NatWest never made a formal 
offer to Mr W and Mrs W to lend to them. They indicated what they might be prepared to 
lend in principle, but until Mr W and Mrs W had made a formal application, there was no 
guarantee NatWest would lend to them at all.
Mr W and Mrs W say NatWest made a mortgage offer over the phone in June 2020 after 
theyd carried out an affordability assessment and the representative Mr W and Mrs W were 
dealing with had liaised with underwriters. Id expect a formal mortgage offer to be made in 
writing but neither partys been able to provide a copy of one. The documents suggest 
NatWest gave an indication of what theyd be prepared to lend at the time but didnt issue an 
offer. Mr W and Mrs W understood no written offer was sent because NatWest didnt have 
staff available to issue one at the time due to the pandemic. 
Mr W and Mrs W have acknowledged they didnt accept an offer in June as NatWest 
wouldnt lend them what they needed to go ahead with the property they wanted to buy at 
that time. Instead, they made an application in August, which was turned down. So, whilst I 
understand Mr W and Mrs W feel strongly NatWest did make an offer in June, I dont think 
that issue affects the outcome of their complaint. Even if NatWest had been prepared to lend 
in June, it doesnt mean their decision in August not to lend was unfair. 
Mr W and Mrs W wanted to borrow more than Mrs Ws existing loan and to add Mr W to the 
mortgage as well. Since those changes were material to the affordability of the new 
mortgage, NatWest were obliged, under the relevant mortgage rules, to carry out a full 
assessment of the affordability of the mortgage. Until they had done that, there was no 
guarantee NatWest would lend to them.
In carrying out that assessment, NatWest had to consider not only whether the mortgage 
was affordable at the time of the application, but also whether it was likely to be affordable 
for them in the future. That involved looking at Mr W and Mrs Ws income and expenditure at 
the time of the application and how it might be affected going forward. 
Mr W and Mrs W say their financial circumstances hadnt changed between June and 
August, so if NatWest were prepared to lend in June, its unfair they wouldnt lend in August. 
It isnt unusual for lenders to change their lending criteria or their approach to the 
commercial risks they are prepared to take in lending when economic conditions change or 
become uncertain as they did because of the pandemic. Whilst NatWest may have been 
willing to lend earlier in 2020 had a formal application been made, they werent later in the 
year. That doesnt make their decision unfair  it simply reflects a change in commercial 
approach. 
Theres no evidence NatWest were treating Mrs W unfairly as a self-employed individual 
affected by the pandemic as she feels they were. They were assessing affordability as the 
rules required them to. Lenders have a duty to lend responsibly and they wouldnt be doing 
that if they assessed a mortgage to be unaffordable and decided to lend anyway. Even 
though another lender was prepared to give Mr W and Mrs W a mortgage, that doesnt make 
NatWests decision unfair either, as different lenders take different approaches to the 
commercial risks theyre prepared to take. Under the terms of Mrs Ws 2018 mortgage offer, Mrs W could port the interest rate product 
on her existing mortgage to a new mortgage provided she met NatWests lending criteria at 
the time of the application. I think that was clearly set out and Mr W and Mrs W understood 
the position. I think NatWest gave the application fair consideration before declining it when 
they decided the mortgage they wanted wasnt affordable.
Mr W and Mrs W knew, before they decided to go ahead and move, that theyd incur the 
ERC if they did. To avoid paying the ERC they could have delayed their move until the fixed 
interest rate period on the existing mortgage had expired, but they chose not to. I dont think 
its unreasonable for NatWest to charge the ERC, which Mrs W had agreed to pay under the 
terms of her existing mortgage. 
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont think NatWest treated Mr W and Mrs W unfairly. And 
there are no grounds on which I think it would be fair to ask NatWest to waive the ERC. 
Bearing everything in mind, whilst I understand Mr W and Mrs W will be disappointed with 
my decision, I dont uphold their complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr W and Mrs Ws complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W and Mrs W 
to accept or reject my decision before 8 March 2022.
