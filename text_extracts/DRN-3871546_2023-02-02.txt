DRN-3871546
The complaint
Miss P complains that AXA PPP Healthcare Limited gave her incorrect information relating 
to a claim under her private medical insurance policy.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. 
Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
When Miss P initially contacted AXA, it made her aware that she could have up to 20 
therapy sessions, up to £500. 
Although AXA didnt repeat the limit in later online conversations, it had already made 
Miss P aware of this, which its notes confirmed. The policy terms also stated the 
£500 limit. Im satisfied AXA didnt mislead Miss P about this.
In the online conversations, Miss P asked how many sessions she was covered for, 
and AXA confirmed she had been authorised for 20 sessions. As our investigator has 
said, AXA was willing to cover up to 20 sessions, so I dont find that AXA did anything 
wrong here by confirming that 20 sessions had been authorised. 
AXA gave Miss P a choice of three osteopaths she could see, but after emailing one 
of them, she found out they were no longer recognised by AXA. I appreciate this 
caused Miss P some minor inconvenience, but I note that AXA apologised for this 
and amended its records. I find that was reasonable. 
For these reasons, I dont uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 March 2023.
