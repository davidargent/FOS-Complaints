The complaint
Mr C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) reduced the credit limits of 
two credit cards based on outdated information. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
NatWests credit card terms allow it to review accounts and reduce credit limits. 
NatWest wrote to Mr C with a detailed explanation of the factors it considered before 
it took the decision to reduce the credit limits on his credit cards. Im satisfied 
NatWest was allowed to review Mr Cs borrowing and decide whether to reduce the 
credit limits. 
Mr C says his historic IVA shouldnt have been considered as it wasnt showing on 
his credit file. But NatWest has confirmed that it considers how previous debts have 
been repaid when completing a review. Im satisfied its reasonable for a business to 
use information it holds about how previous accounts were handled, even if they 
arent showing on a consumers credit file, when completing a review. 
I havent found anything to show NatWest has treated Mr C unfairly by reviewing his 
borrowing and reducing the credit limits on his credit cards. 
As Im satisfied NatWest has dealt with Mr Cs complaint fairly and given a detailed 
explanation of why his credit limits were reduced, Im not telling it to take any further 
action. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 May 2020.
