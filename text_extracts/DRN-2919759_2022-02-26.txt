The complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA deducted a refunded amount from his 
account.
What happened
Mr M says he bought an item using PayPal on 12 July 2020 for £299.60 which he didnt 
receive. He says he asked his bank which I will call H to raise a chargeback which it did, 
and he also complained to PayPal. Mr M says his bank refunded the full amount and PayPal 
refunded £287.28. He says both his bank and PayPal then debited the refunds on the basis 
the other had refunded the money. Mr M says he gave PayPal his bank statements showing 
what had happened but didnt receive a response and eventually had to pay PayPal the 
account balance of just over £287. He would like his money refunded.
PayPal says Mr M received a refund in August 2020 and it then realised he had received a 
refund from his bank following a chargeback. It says it acted correctly and fairly by debiting 
Mr Ms account as he received, effectively, a double refund. 
Mr M brought his complaint to us and our investigator upheld the complaint. The investigator 
thought Mr Ms bank statement clearly showed the refund and deduction by his bank and in 
those circumstances, PayPal should not have deducted its refund.
PayPal doesnt accept that view and Mr M does accept it.
I asked both sides for further information and permission from Mr M to speak to H which he 
agreed to provide. Mr M also confirmed that he didnt receive the money back via any other 
account.
PayPal says it has no evidence that it received the money back from H and says it is only 
entitled to limited information from it.
H says it credited Mr Ms account when the chargeback was raised, and it debited the 
account when he received a duplicate refund. It says at no stage did it either deduct money 
from PayPal or the merchant and so didnt refund either as these were internal 
credits/debits.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I uphold this complaint. I appreciate in 
doing so that the problem here was largely caused by Mr M raising a chargeback with H and 
by asking PayPal to refund his money. I think he ought to have realised that by doing so that 
there was the potential for this sort of situation to take place but equally Im satisfied that Mr 
M has not received his refund for the reasons I will explain.
I have looked carefully at Mr Ms bank account statements which I think he fairly provided to 
PayPal to consider. I dont think there can be any doubt that he was refunded the money by 
his bank following the chargeback, but that refund was debited at a later stage by it. Im 
satisfied that H has confirmed that is what took place and also told us that it applied the 
refund internally until the chargeback was resolved. I have not seen any evidence from 
PayPal that suggests any money was deducted from it by H and so on balance I dont think 
H ever deducted money from PayPal.
I can see from PayPals records that it too credited Mr Ms account before later debiting it. I 
appreciate that PayPal may have thought at that stage that Mr Ms bank had refunded the 
money. But I think it ought to have been clear to PayPal as Mr M sent it his statements that 
the bank had debited the money first. Im satisfied that Mr M sent PayPal the relevant 
account statements and although I cant see that PayPal says if it received them, I think it 
could have requested them if not.
I appreciate PayPal says it hasnt received the money in question from Mr Ms bank. I dont 
think PayPal has provided any evidence of a search for the money or provided evidence that 
it sent Mr Ms bank the money. H has said it didnt debit PayPal for the money and I think on 
balance that is what took place. In those circumstances I dont think H would have credited 
PayPal with the refunded amount as I dont think it ever asked PayPal for it. I also think its 
up to PayPal to speak to H about this and I dont understand why it says it would have 
limited information about the transaction in these circumstances.
Overall, Im satisfied PayPal debited Mr Ms account in circumstances where his chargeback 
had been reversed by H. The effect of that was that Mr M was out of pocket by £287.28. I 
have not seen any evidence PayPal ever sent that amount to H or any evidence from any 
extracts from its accounts that would support what it says. I am satisfied that Mr M has 
provided his account statements and that H has confirmed that it internally credited and later 
debited Mr Ms account.
Putting things right
PayPal should pay Mr M the disputed amount of £287.28.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and order PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
to pay Mr M £287.28.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 March 2022.
