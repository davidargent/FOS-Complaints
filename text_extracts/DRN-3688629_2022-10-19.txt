The complaint
Miss W complains about issues that she has with a new kitchen that was installed by a 
kitchen supplier and which she paid for using a fixed sum loan agreement with Mitsubishi HC 
Capital UK plc, trading as Hitachi Personal Finance.
 
What happened
Miss W ordered a new kitchen from a kitchen supplier in March 2020. The total product price 
was £7,818.13 and the cost of the installation was £3,215. Miss W paid a deposit of £1,105 
and entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Hitachi Personal Finance for £9,928.13. 
She electronically signed the loan agreement in March 2020 and agreed to make 48 monthly 
payments of £251.27 to Hitachi Personal Finance starting from March 2021.
There was a delay in the kitchen being installed and there were then some issues with the 
kitchen. Miss W complained to Hitachi Personal Finance in October 2020 and said that she 
wanted to reject the kitchen. Some remedial work was performed and Hitachi Personal 
Finance arranged for the kitchen to be inspected by the Furniture and Home Improvement 
Ombudsman in February 2021. It also deferred the first loan repayment due from Miss W by 
one month. 
The Furniture and Home Improvement Ombudsman identified some issues with the kitchen 
and the kitchen supplier offered to pay her £428.99 for the remedial work and to replace 
some specified items. Hitachi Personal Finance also credited £150 to Miss Ws loan account 
but it said that the specialist works, including gas work, werent funded by the loan so it had 
no liability under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 for those works. Miss W didnt 
accept that offer and complained to this service.
Our investigator recommended that Miss Ws complaint should be upheld. He said that the 
Furniture and Home Improvement Ombudsman had said that the kitchen was installed to a 
good standard so he didnt think that Miss W should be able to reject the kitchen. He said 
that there were clear issues following the installation of the kitchen and that Hitachi Personal 
Finance was jointly liable with the kitchen supplier for the breaches of the contract and was 
liable to pay for the remedial work. He said that the gas work was under a separate contract 
so Hitachi Personal Finance cant be held liable for it under section 75. He recommended 
that Hitachi Personal Finance should source a contractor and pay for the remedial work to 
be completed on the items listed in the Furniture and Home Improvement Ombudsmans 
report within 60 days or Miss W could obtain three quotes from local tradesmen to complete 
the remedial work with Hitachi Personal Finance then choosing one quote and paying for the 
work. 
Hitachi Personal Finance says that the original installer was offered to attend but that was 
refused by Miss W and an alternative installer can be arranged but it could be several 
months before any are available. It says that it would be happy to review any quotes from 
Miss W. Miss W hasnt accepted our investigators recommendation and says that shes tried 
over 60 tradesmen but theyre not interested in the remedial work. She says that this is 
unacceptable from both the kitchen supplier and Hitachi Personal Finance as the kitchen 
isnt complete and shes been lied to about the gas hob.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Miss W used credit provided by Hitachi Personal Finance to pay for the kitchen and, 
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Miss Ws complaint about Hitachi Personal Finance, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the kitchen 
supplier and that Hitachi Personal Finances response to her claim under section 75 
wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Miss Ws claim 
under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Miss W ordered the kitchen from the kitchen supplier and the order form sets out 
what was included  it lists the products that were to be supplied and the installation 
work that was to be done  it also refers to specialist works which are excluded and 
the order form says: The specialist works to be undertaken by the installer will form 
the basis of a separate contract between you and the installer and payment for such 
specialist works should be made by you directly to the installer;
the specialist works included the work to Disconnect old Gas Hob or Gas Oven and 
refit new / existing gas appliance to include accessible electrical isolation switch and 
gas supply to Gas regulations so I consider it to be clear from the order form that the 
price that Miss W paid for the kitchen didnt include the gas work so Hitachi Personal 
Finance has no liability to Miss W for it under section 75;
I can understand Miss Ws concerns about the gas work and she has obtained an 
inspection report which says that The gas work recently undertaken at your property 
may not have been carried out by a Gas Safe registered business but as the gas 
work wasnt paid for using the loan provided by Hitachi Personal Finance, Im unable 
to require it to take any action in relation to the gas work;
Hitachi Personal Finance arranged for the kitchen to be inspected by the Furniture 
and Home Improvement Ombudsman in February 2021 and it said  the kitchen is 
installed to a satisfactory standard  but it also said that some elements of the 
installation which were listed in the report could be improved upon and  there are 
minimal remedial workings required to enable balance and bring the aesthetics up to 
a professional finish;
the kitchen supplier estimated that the remedial work would require one days work 
and it offered to pay Miss W £428.99 for that work and to replace some specified 
items;
Hitachi Personal Finance deferred the first loan repayment due from Miss W by one 
month and has credited £150 to her loan account;
Hitachi Personal Finance is jointly liable with the kitchen supplier under section 75 for 
any breaches of the contract and I consider that the remedial work identified in the 
Furniture and Home Improvement Ombudsmans report show that there have been 
breaches of contract by the kitchen supplier;as Miss W has received the kitchen and its been installed mainly to a satisfactory 
standard, Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for Miss W to be able 
to reject the kitchen or for me to require Hitachi Personal Finance to write-off the 
outstanding amount that she owes to it;
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Hitachi Personal 
Finance to pay for the remedial work identified in the Furniture and Home 
Improvement Ombudsmans report to be completed  and I consider that the options 
recommended by our investigator are a fair and reasonable way for that to be 
achieved;
Miss W says that shes tried over 60 tradesmen but theyre not interested in the 
remedial work and, if shes unable to provide three quotes for the remedial work to 
Hitachi Personal Finance, she should ask it to arrange and pay for the remedial work 
to be completed; and
I sympathise with Miss W for the issues that shes had with her kitchen and the 
difficulties that shes described but I consider that the remedial work is a fair and 
reasonable way for her complaint to be resolved - Hitachi Personal Finance has 
deferred the first loan repayment due from Miss W by one month and has credited 
£150 to her loan account and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasobsle for 
me to require it to take any other action in response to her complaint.
Putting things right
I find that, if requested to do so by Miss W, Hitachi Personal Finance should arrange and 
pay for the remedial work identified in the Furniture and Home Improvement Ombudsmans 
report to be completed  or, if she provides it with three quotes for the remedial work, Hitachi 
Personal Finance should choose one of the quotes and pay for the work. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss Ws complaint in part and I order Mitsubishi HC Capital UK 
plc, trading as Hitachi Personal Finance, to take the actions described above in connection 
with the remedial work. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 November 2022.
