The complaint 
Mr R complains that NewDay Ltd has accessed his credit file and performed a credit search 
without his permission.
What happened
Mr R said hed noticed a credit search on his credit file, made by NewDay. He said he hadnt 
authorised that, and he thought it was fraudulent. He thought NewDay was engaging in 
identity theft. He said hed tried to discuss this with NewDay, but it wouldnt deal with his 
complaint and had used offensive language. He wanted compensation, and he wanted 
NewDay to be fined for defrauding him. 
NewDay said it had received an application for a credit card from Mr R. The credit card hed 
applied for was branded with the name of a travel company, but NewDay supplies it. 
NewDay said it had checked the travel companys website. The information was clear that it 
was NewDay running the credit card. Its shown us that web page. 
NewDay said it had previously agreed not to send Mr R any marketing material. And it 
hadnt. 
NewDay had done a credit check to see if it could give Mr R the card hed applied for. It had 
decided not to give him the card. That was because of adverse information it could see on 
his credit file from other lenders. 
NewDay said it wouldnt take this search off Mr Rs file. Hed made an application for credit. 
NewDay said the search reflected that. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She confirmed that the website 
said this card was managed by NewDay. So she thought it wasnt unfair for NewDay to have 
processed the application Mr R made. And it wasnt unfair to run a credit check as part of 
that. 
Our investigator looked at the information NewDay received from this search. She didnt 
think it was unfair for NewDay not to offer Mr R a card. She wouldnt ask NewDay to remove 
the search. And she wouldnt tell NewDay that it had to give Mr R a card. 
Our investigator didnt think Mr R had been subjected to offensive language as part of this 
complaint. She said all the communication appeared to have been in writing. And she didnt 
think it was offensive.
Mr R didnt agree. He asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. So it was 
passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and whyIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
I think that the travel company made clear the card Mr R applied for was being managed by 
NewDay. So I dont think NewDay did anything wrong when it did a credit search. It did that 
as part of processing Mr Rs application. I dont think thats fraudulent or identity theft. And I 
dont think NewDay has to remove that search from Mr Rs credit file. 
Mr R didnt complain about NewDay refusing to give him a card. But, like our investigator, 
Ive checked the information NewDay got. And I dont think it was unreasonable or unfair for 
NewDay to decide not to give Mr R a card. 
It seems as if Mr R didnt realise NewDay was managing this card. He has strong views 
about NewDay, so its possible Mr R may not have wanted the card anyway, once he was 
aware of this. 
Ive read carefully the documents that Mr R and NewDay have sent us. I think that when Mr 
R talks about offensive language being used by NewDay, he may have been referring to a 
previous complaint. But in case he wasnt, Ive considered the communications he had with 
NewDay for this complaint. Those have been in writing. I dont think NewDay has been 
offensive to Mr R. 
I know Mr R will be disappointed, but I dont think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2020.
