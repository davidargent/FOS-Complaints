The complaint
G, a limited company, complains that TransferWise Ltd closed his account without notice 
and without telling him why.
What happened
G is represented in this complaint by its sole director, Mr P. In September 2019 Mr P applied 
for a business account for G with TransferWise. The account was opened, but after a couple 
of days it was closed again without notice. Mr P complained, but he did not receive 
responses to his emails. Eventually, in March 2020, he referred this complaint to our 
Service, on behalf of G.
TransferWise told us it had closed the account because Mr P had been abusive in an email 
he had sent in response to its know your customer questions. It referred to the terms in its 
Acceptable Use Policy which it said it had relied on to close the account. It said it had 
overlooked Mr Ps complaint emails as a result of what it described as human error, and said 
it had improved its procedures to avoid that happening again, but it did not agree to pay 
compensation for that.
Our investigator did not uphold this complaint. Mr P had not disputed that he had sent the 
email TransferWise had referred to, and the investigator thought it had been abusive. He 
concluded that TransferWise had been entitled to close the account without notice.
Mr P did not accept that decision. He argued that the words he had used were not swear 
words, and he provided links to the Cambridge Dictionary to support his opinion. He 
accepted that he had not been polite, but said he had only lost his temper because of what 
he considered to be the incompetence of TransferWises staff. He also argued that emails 
between TransferWise and its customers were not covered by the terms and conditions 
which TransferWise had relied on. He asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I do not uphold this complaint, but for somewhat different reasons to those relied on by my 
colleague and by TransferWise.
After opening Gs account, TransferWise asked Mr P about the nature of Gs business, and 
also asked for further information about a named individual (full name, date of birth, and 
country of residence). Mr P answered the first question, but said that the named person was 
not involved in running the company, and he declined to provide information about him.
TransferWise responded by repeating both questions, and added that the person it was 
asking about appeared to be a director of the company, based on the commercial registry. 
In answer to the first question, which Mr P had already answered, Mr P repeated his earlier 
answer but also added that TransferWises staff were retarded for not understanding him 
the first time. In his answer to the second question, he called TransferWise idiots, denied 
that the person they had asked about was involved in the company, and asked where 
TransferWise was getting its bullsh*t1 information from. He then referred TransferWise to 
Gs entry on the Companies House website, which shows that Mr P is the only director and 
shareholder.
In his response to my colleagues opinion, Mr P wrote:
These  words are widely accepted and used in common daily language on radio 
and television and are not considered swearwords, also it was not addressed 
directly to any individual, but was perfectly suited in that situation when precious 
time was wasted by incompetent staff.
Nevertheless, I think that all three words are insulting and abusive, and that TransferWise 
was right to consider them as such. I dont think it matters who they were addressed to; 
somebody had to read them.
TransferWise told us that it had relied on section 1.1(d) of its Acceptable Use Policy, which 
reads as follows:
1.1 You may use our Services only for lawful purposes. You may not use our Services: 
d. for anything that is abusive, harmful, or does not comply with our content 
standards...
However, Services is defined in the glossary of TransferWises User Agreement as follows:
Services means all products, services, content, features, technologies or functions 
offered by us and all related websites, applications (including the App), and services 
(including the Website and API).2
I agree with Mr P that this definition does not extend to emails between TransferWise and its 
customers.
Section 25 of the User Agreement sets out the circumstances in which TransferWise may 
close an account without notice, but that does not refer to abusive language being used in 
communications with TransferWise.
In spite of that, however, I still think it is fair and reasonable to decide that TransferWise did 
not err by closing Gs account without notice based on Mr Ps abusive email. TransferWise 
has a responsibility to its staff, as well as to its customers, and that includes allowing them to 
work in an environment where they dont have to be insulted by customers. The terms and 
conditions of its User Agreement and Acceptable Use Policy dont say that, but I think it 
should go without saying.
Even if I had taken a different view about that, I think TransferWise was also entitled to close 
the account based on Mr Ps failure to comply with section 9 of the User Agreement, which 
requires him to comply with requests for information as part of TransferWises security and 
customer due diligence checks. Section 25.2(a) of that agreement clearly sets out 
TransferWises right to close an account without notice where section 9 is not complied with.
I have checked Gs entry on Customer Houses website, and it does indeed show that Mr P 
is the sole director and the only person with significant control over the company. But then 
1 This word was written in full, but I have had to redact it in this decision because otherwise our email 
system will intercept it and wont allow me to send the decision by email.
2 See https://wise.com/terms-of-use#/section-3 (API means software provided by TransferWise.)when I searched for the name of the third party who TransferWise had asked about, the very 
first search result was Mr Ps own name. I dont know why or what that means, but I think it 
vindicates TransferWises persistence in asking about him.
Finally, although I appreciate that it must have been frustrating for Mr P not to receive replies 
to his complaint emails, and I do think that was an error by TransferWise, I cannot award him 
compensation for that. That is because this complaint is not his but his companys, and a 
company cannot feel frustration or impatience.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask G to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 June 2021.
