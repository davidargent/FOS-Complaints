The complaint
Mr P is unhappy with the level of service provided to him by Chetwood Financial Limited, 
trading as SmartSave, when he applied for a savings account with them. Mr P is also 
unhappy that a credit check was undertaken against him, despite his not being able to open 
the savings account he applied for.
What happened
In September 2019 Mr P applied online for a savings account with SmartSave - but his 
application was declined. Mr P complained to SmartSave about this and asked that the 
credit checks that were recorded on his credit file because of his application be removed.
SmartSave looked into Mr Ps complaint. They found that Mr Ps application had been 
declined because SmartSave had been unable to electronically verify the third-party bank 
account details provided by Mr P during the application. SmartSave initially thought that 
there had been an error with their internal verification system, and so they upheld Mr Ps 
complaint and agreed to remove the credit checks relating to the application from Mr Ps 
credit file - although they confirmed that Mr P wouldnt be able to open an account with them.
Mr P wasnt satisfied with SmartSaves response. He had noticed that his credit file showed 
that credit checks had been undertaken by two companies  SmartSave and one by another 
brand held by Chetwood Financial Limited  and he wasnt happy about this. Mr P was also 
unhappy with the time that he had had to expend dealing with this issue, and also that he 
had ultimately had to open a savings account which paid a lower rate of interest, which 
meant that he had lost out financially because of SmartSaves error.
So, Mr P referred his complaint to our service. One of our investigators looked at this case. 
They got in touch with SmartSave to get more information, and at that time it was discovered 
that Mr Ps account application had been declined in line with their usual checks and criteria 
for dealing with applications like this. So, they didnt feel they had, in fact, made an error 
here.
In view of this, our investigator didnt feel that SmartSave had done anything wrong in 
declining Mr Ps account application. So, they didnt uphold that aspect of his complaint.
Additionally, our investigator noted that SmartSave had removed the credit check 
undertaken by SmartSave as they had agreed to. However, SmartSave had been unable to 
find record of a credit check on Mr Ps record undertaken by the other brand and had 
advised Mr P about this and asked him to provide more information to them about it. So, our 
investigator didnt uphold this aspect of Mr Ps complaint either.
Mr P remained dissatisfied, so his complaint was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In doing so Ive reached the same conclusion as our investigator, for essentially the same 
reasons.
Ultimately here, the reason that Mr Ps saving account application was declined with 
SmartSave was because of a type of industry standard electronic checking process known 
as an Electronic Bank Account Verification (EBAV) check. These checks are a common 
industry practice and are used to help verify the information being provided by the applicant. 
I can understand how it must have been frustrating for Mr P to have initially been told by 
SmartSave that the reason his application was declined was because of an error with their 
internal systems. However, because Mr Ps third-party bank account didnt meet the 
necessary reporting standards this meant that the EBAV verification check undertaken 
against that third-party bank account was, and would always have been, unsuccessful
So, Im satisfied SmartSave did what is should have here in terms of processing Mr Ps 
application. Its confusing that Mr P was wrongly told that this was initially because of an 
error. But having looked at the information from SmartSave here  Im satisfied that wasnt 
the case. While this advice may have been confusing, its not a reason that would cause me 
to consider it fair that SmartSave need to take any further action here.
Ive seen that SmartSave have removed the credit check undertaken by them as part of the 
application process from Mr Ps credit file, and also that SmartSave have taken appropriate 
steps in contacting Mr P and asking him to provide further information about the other credit 
check which Mr P has mentioned but which SmartSave have been unable to find.
Finally, I note that Mr P feels that he has had to expend an unreasonable amount of time in 
dealing with this issue, but because I cant conclude that SmartSave have done anything 
wrong here  beyond initially telling Mr P that the application had been declined in error - I 
cant fairly ask SmartSave to take any action because of this.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2021.
