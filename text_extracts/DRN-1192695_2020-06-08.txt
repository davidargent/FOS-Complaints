The complaint
Mrs D took out a loan with AvantCredit of UK, LLC (AvantCredit) around July 2016. Mrs D 
thinks this was irresponsible lending on behalf of AvantCredit. As resolution to this complaint 
she wants a refund of all the interest shes been charged on the loan. 
What happened
Mrs D took out a fixed sum loan around July 2016. Mrs D doesnt think AvantCredit carried 
out the necessary checks on her financial situation before offering her the loan.
AvantCredit has already looked at this complaint. They think they carried out reasonable 
checks before providing Mrs D with this borrowing. So they didnt uphold her complaint. As 
Mrs D remained unhappy, she referred the case to our service. 
An investigator has already looked at this matter. Overall the investigator felt this wasnt 
irresponsible lending and so didnt uphold the case either.
Mrs D has now asked that her complaint be referred to an ombudsman for consideration. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate Mrs D thinks that her borrowing from AvantCredit is an example of irresponsible 
lending. But Im afraid I disagree. Overall I think AvantCredit did carry out reasonable checks 
into Mrs Ds financial circumstances before providing her with the loan. AvantCredit has 
explained they followed their pre-approval assessment for affordability. And Ive seen the 
affordability report. Ive carefully considered Mrs Ds monthly net income and the payment 
she was required to make each month under the loan. I note Mrs Ds account was credit 
scored. Overall I cant say AvantCredit failed to properly assess Mrs Ds affordability. 
I dont think therefore it would be fair to ask AvantCredit to refund Mrs D all the interest shes 
paid on the loan to date. I do note Mrs D thinks shes paid a lot of interest. But this interest 
seems to have been applied in line with the account terms and conditions. 
It should be explained that having other existing lending facilities or adverse information on a 
credit file wouldnt necessarily be enough of a reason in themselves to refuse an individual 
further borrowing. 
I appreciate Mrs D says she struggled to maintain the repayments. And it appears from the 
further evidence Mrs D has kindly provided that she wasnt in the strongest financial position 
at the time of taking the loan. But as I understand, for the duration of the loan, Mrs D 
maintained the repayments. In light of this I dont think AvantCredit need to do anything 
furtherMy final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2020.
