The complaint
Mr W complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) wont refund him the cost of
a train ticket that he never received.
What happened
Mr W purchased a train ticket online from a seller, using PayPal as his chosen payment 
method in August 2021. When he arrived at the train station to board his train, he says he 
realised that he hadnt been emailed the ticket. Mr W says he had to purchase a 
replacement ticket at the station and had to get a train an hour later causing him to be late 
to the event he was attending.
He contacted the seller and asked for a refund as he said he never received the train 
ticket. But the seller responded stating that they were able to verify that Mr W received and 
opened the email which included the train ticket. The seller also confirmed that the train 
ticket was sent to the email address that Mr W used to complete the booking.
As the seller declined Mr Ws claim for a refund, he approached PayPal to raise a Buyer 
Protection claim for the train ticket, under the reason Item not received. PayPal say they 
received evidence from the seller that the ticket was delivered to Mr W, so the claim was 
upheld in the sellers favour.
One of our investigators considered Mr Ws complaint and explained that the 
documentation PayPal sent to our service included evidence to show the seller emailed the 
ticket to Mr Ws correct email address, and that this was sent to him within minutes of him 
paying for the ticket. He also went on to say that the seller had also provided PayPal with 
evidence to show that Mr W clicked on, and opened the email containing the train ticket 
shortly after it was emailed to him. Therefore, there was enough evidence to meet the 
requirements of PayPals User Agreement for Proof of Delivery. So, he didnt uphold      
Mr Ws complaint.
Mr W disagreed with the investigators outcome. He said there was no evidence of the 
actual ticket being sent. And he said it wasnt enough for PayPal to say there was evidence 
of an email being sent without it evidencing the ticket was included within the email. So, the 
case has been passed to me to consider.
I issued my provisional findings on 18 March 2022. This is what I said:
Following my review of the case and looking at the evidence PayPal have provided, plus 
the additional information and evidence Ive asked for, I think on balance, its more likely 
than not that Mr W didnt receive the train ticket from the seller. Ill explain why.
As a result of an unsuccessful claim for a refund from the seller of the train ticket, Mr W 
approached PayPal to make a claim under PayPals Buyer Protection Program, which 
says:
PayPal Buyer Protection may apply when you encounter these specific problems with 
a transaction:
You didnt receive your item from a seller (referred to as an Item Not 
Received claim), or
You received an item, but the item isnt what you ordered (referred to as 
a Significantly Not as Described claim).
Mr W made a claim with PayPal under Item Not Received claims, of which the terms 
and conditions Ive noted below:
Your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item 
Not Received claim, if:
You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your 
behalf, including if you use PayPal in a sellers retail point of sale, except for 
in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.
The seller has provided  proof of delivery.
If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in 
favour of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive 
the goods.
PayPal have provided screenshots showing an email was sent to Mr W on 13 August 2021. 
And it appears that this email was opened. However, I asked PayPal to provide the actual 
email sent to Mr W which showed the attached train ticket. But PayPal havent been able to 
show that the email in question actually contained the ticket.
From looking at the evidence PayPal have provided, theres a discrepancy in the times that 
the ticket was purchased (12:22), booked (13:23) and the time it was received by email and 
opened (11:23). Even taking into account the time zones between the UK and Berlin, 
PayPal werent able to explain the reason for all of the different timings.
I asked Mr W for a copy of the additional ticket he said he purchased at the station on the 
day he was travelling. While Mr W couldnt give me a copy of the actual ticket, he was able 
to show me a copy of his credit card statement which shows the purchase of the additional 
ticket. The credit card transaction confirms it was made at the same train station Mr Ws 
original ticket was for, and on the same date hed previously booked for. But it doesnt 
evidence the time Mr W purchased the ticket in replacement for the one he didnt receive 
from the seller. However, Im already aware that this was an hour later as Mr W event he 
was travelling to as a result of not receiving the ticket.
Im not satisfied I have enough evidence to conclude Mr W received the train ticket he 
purchased using PayPal. Theres no proof of the sent email to Mr W containing the actual 
ticket. And the transaction timings dont support what PayPal say about the ticket being 
purchased, emailed and the email being opened by Mr W.
On balance I do think its more likely than not that Mr W didnt receive the ticket, and thats 
why he purchased another ticket, on the same day at the same station. Therefore, I 
provisionally think PayPal should honour Mr Ws PayPal Buyer Protection claim for Item
Not Received.
PayPal and Mr W had until 1 April to give me any further comments to consider. Mr W 
responded accepting my provisional findings. PayPal responded and disagreed saying that the seller was able to provide information that 
the booking was successful, the email containing the ticket was delivered, opened and the 
hyperlink containing the ticket within the email was opened. PayPal also reiterated their 
explanation of the transaction timings
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the information PayPal have provided following my provisional findings, but it 
doesnt change my decision. I dont think the screenshots PayPal have sent with their 
response to my provisional findings show anything different than what theyve already 
provided. It doesnt show that the email sent to Mr W had the actual ticket attached. 
PayPal havent been able to give any further explanation to what Ive already considered in 
regard to the difference in time zones between the UK and Berlin, and how this explains the 
discrepancy in the transaction timings.
Therefore, Im not satisfied I have enough evidence to conclude Mr W received the train 
ticket he purchased using PayPal.
With this in mind, my final decision remains the same as my provisional decision for the 
reasons Ive explained above.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, Im upholding Mr Ws complaint. I require PayPal (Europe) 
Sarl et Cie SCA are to refund Mr W Â£52.50 for the payment of the ticket.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 April 2022.
