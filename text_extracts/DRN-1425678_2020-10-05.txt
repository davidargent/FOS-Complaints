The complaint
The estate of the late Mr P complains that a hire purchase agreement with PSA Finance UK 
Limited, under which a new car was supplied, was mis-sold to him. The estate is 
represented in this complaint by the late Mr Ps wife and their son. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the late Mr P signed a hire purchase agreement with PSA Finance in December 2018 
for a new car to be supplied to him - he made an advance payment of £4,781.82 and 
agreed to make 36 monthly payments of £103.05 and a final payment of £4,840;
he also signed an adequate explanation document and confirmed that hed been 
provided with pre-contract credit information;
immediately above his signature on the agreement it says:
This is a Hire Purchase Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. Sign it only if you want to be legally bound by its terms;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the dealer, or PSA 
Finance, knew or ought reasonably to have known about the late Mr Ps health 
issues before he signed the agreement or that PSA Finance acted incorrectly in 
these circumstances in providing credit to him;
I sympathise with the late Mr Ps wife and their son for their loss and the difficulties 
with which theyre having to deal and I can understand their frustration about the 
advance payment that the late Mr P made for the car - but Im not persuaded that the 
agreement was mis-sold to him or that PSA Finance acted incorrectly in supplying 
the car to him;
PSA Finance has now collected the car and says that it wont be seeking any further 
payments under the agreement - but the late Mr P was able to use the car and I 
consider that its fair and reasonable for it to keep the payments that he made for the 
use that he had from the car; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
PSA Finance to refund to the late Mr Ps estate any of the payments that the late Mr 
P made for the car, including the advance payment, or to take any other action in 
response to this complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr P 
to accept or reject my decision before 12 November 2020.
