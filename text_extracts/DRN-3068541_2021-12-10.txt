The complaint
Ms W complains that NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibly when it approved her Tui credit card and 
later increased the credit limit. Ms W also complains that NewDay lent irresponsibly when it 
approved a Fluid credit card.  
What happened
In May 2019 Ms W applied for a Tui credit card with NewDay. The application said Ms W 
had an annual income of £30,000 and living costs of £1,080 a month. A credit search found 
Ms W had around £8,800 of unsecured credit but no adverse information recorded. A Tui 
credit card with a credit limit of £500 was approved. 
In January 2020 NewDay increased the Tui credit limit to £1,500. NewDays credit file 
information shows it found Ms Ws unsecured debt had increased to around £32,500 at this 
point. 
In the same month, Ms W applied for a Fluid credit card, also operated by NewDay. Similar 
application information was taken into account. NewDay approved a Fluid credit card with a 
credit limit of £2,000. NewDays application data says it found around £30,600 of unsecured 
credit. But in February 2020 the Fluid credit file date shows Ms W had credit card balances 
of around £143,000. 
Earlier this year, Ms W complained NewDay had lent irresponsibly. NewDay didnt agree and 
Ms W referred her complaint to this service. An investigator upheld Ms Ws complaint. They 
thought the initial decision to approve Ms Ws Tui credit card with a £500 limit was 
reasonable but that the increase was not. The investigator also said NewDay lent 
irresponsibly when it approved the Fluid credit card. NewDay asked to appeal, so Ms Ws 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say NewDay had to complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Ms W could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable way. 
These affordability checks needed to be focused on the borrowers circumstances. The 
nature of whats considered reasonable and proportionate will vary depending on various 
factors like: 
- The amount of credit;
- The total sum repayable and the size of regular repayments;
- The duration of the agreement
- The costs of the credit; and 
- The consumers individual circumstances. 
That means theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. But lenders are required to 
consider the above points when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate. 
NewDay asked Ms W information about her income and outgoings when she applied for the 
Tui credit card. And I can see it completed a credit search that didnt find any adverse 
information. Ms W owed around £8,800 to other lenders at the time. Im satisfied NewDay 
completed proportionate checks and that its decision to approve Ms Ws Tui credit card with 
a limit of £500 was reasonable. 
I dont agree the checks completed before increasing the Tui credit limit were proportionate. 
The credit file data provided shows a sharp increase other debts. Ms Ws unsecured 
borrowing appears to have increased by around £24,000 in a period of around nine months. 
I think that shouldve warned NewDay Ms Ws borrowing was increasing at an unsustainable 
rate and caused it to carry out better checks. 
In much the same way, I havent found NewDay carried out proportionate checks when it 
approved Ms Ws Fluid credit card. In the same month, NewDay increased Ms Ws Tui limit 
by £1,000 and, as noted above, her borrowing had substantially increased in a short period. 
Im satisfied there were clear signs Ms W had become reliant on credit and wasnt able to 
sustainably make repayments. I think those signs shouldve caused NewDay to carry out 
better checks. 
Theres no set list of checks and NewDay couldve sought a range of information to carry out 
better checks. NewDay couldve asked for bank statements or evidence of Ms Ws income 
and outgoings for example. Had it done so, I think NewDay wouldve found Ms Ws 
outgoings to service her existing debts were already very high and further borrowing wasnt 
affordable. I note the Fluid credit file data shows Ms W had a total credit card balance in 
excess of £143,000 in February 2020, the month after it approved an application for £2,000. 
Im satisfied that, if NewDay had carried out better checks it wouldnt have increased Ms Ws 
Tui limit or approved the Fluid credit card in January 2020. 
To resolve Ms Ws complaint Im going to tell NewDay to refund all interest, fees and 
charges applied to Tui credit card balances over £500 and the full balance of the Fluid credit 
card.
I dont agree its fair for NewDay to report information about debts it lent irresponsibly to the 
credit reference agencies. As a result, Im going to tell it to amend Ms Ws credit file to 
remove any adverse information reported since January 2020.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Ms Ws complaint and directly NewDay Ltd to settle as follows:
- Refund all interest, fees and charges applied to the Tui credit card on balances over 
£500 from January 2020 to date. 
- Refund all interest, fees and charges applied to the Fluid credit card since inception 
to date
- If an outstanding balance remains once these adjustments have been made to either 
credit card, NewDay should contact Ms W to arrange a suitable repayment plan for 
this
- Balances over £500 held on the Tui credit card should be administered without 
interest going forward. The entire balance of the Fluid credit card should be 
administered without interest going forward
- If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer being 
an outstanding balance, any extra should be treated as overpayments and returned to Ms W along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from the date they were 
made (if they were) until the date of settlement
- NewDay should amend Ms Ws credit file to remove all adverse information recorded 
in relation to both credit cards from January 2020 onwards
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 January 2022.
