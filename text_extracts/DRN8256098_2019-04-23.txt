K821x#15complaint
Mr D complains about 14 instalment loans  Elevate  Credit International Limited  (trading as 
Sunny) lent to him. He says the loans were  lent irresponsibly.
background
From the information provided, Sunny lent Mr D 14 instalment loans between June 2015 and 
January 2018.  The loan amounts varied  from £50 to £600 and were typically  due to be 
repaid in six equal monthly instalments. Ive set out some of the loan information  as an 
appendix at the end of this decision.
Mr D complained to Sunny through a third party representative about all of his loans. Sunny 
didnt uphold  his complaint. It said it carried out proportionate checks  before lending  and so 
didnt do anything wrong. Unhappy with the response, Mr D referred his complaint to this 
service where it was looked  at by one of our adjudicators.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that loans 1 to 6 should be upheld  but thought that by the 
time Mr D was lent loan 7, hed formed a pattern  of dependency on these loans and Sunny 
shouldnt have continued to lend to him.
Sunny didnt agree with our adjudication  and so the complaint has come  to me  an 
ombudsman for a decision. Since  our adjudication  there have been no further  disputes  about 
loans 1 to 6 and so my decision focuses on loans 7 to 14, the loans  that remain  in dispute. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Ds case. 
Ive decided to uphold Ds complaint in part and have explained why below.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr D could  
repay his each loan in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ds income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
Ref: DRN82560982There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny has said that before it lent each loan,  it checked Mr Ds income and monthly  
expenses. It also searched Mr Ds credit file including looking at his short  term commitments  
at the time.
Mr D hasnt provided a copy of his credit  file but from the results of Sunnys searches, I cant 
see that there was any adverse information recorded on his file such  as defaults or county 
court judgements (CCJs).   
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 7 to 14 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case.
Ive looked to see if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  lending. Given  the particular circumstances of
Mr Ds case, I think that this point was reached  by loan 7. I say this because by loan 7, Mr D 
had now borrowed 7 loans in about  four months.  In that time, hed taken out further loans 
while he had a loan outstanding. For example he hadnt repaid loan 1 when  he took out loan 
2. Loan 3 was for £600 and he took out loans 4 to 6 before he repaid loan 3. Sunny ought to 
have realised it was likely his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr D wasnt making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. As stated  above,  he 
was borrowing while he still owed previous loans and when he repaid, he was borrowing 
again quickly. Effectively,  Mr D was paying large  amounts of interest to service  this debt over 
an extended period. Hed borrowed continually for more than two years. I think this shouldve 
alerted Sunny that Mr D may be using the loans  to supplement his income and not using 
them for their intended purpose of temporary cash flow. 
In response to our adjudication, Sunny has said there were  two gaps in Mr Ds lending. It 
said there were gaps between loans 8 and 9, and loans 9 and 10. Ive considered  these 
gaps carefully and I agree with the adjudicator.  At the time Mr D took out loan 9, he hadnt 
fully repaid loan 8, so there  was no break  in the lending as he was still indebted to Sunny 
during the period. Turning  to the gap between  loans 9 and 10, Sunny had lent nine previous  
loans in the past 12 months and the break  was a little less than five months. I think  given the 
length of time that Mr D had been  borrowing from Sunny  and the fact that on more than one 
occasion hed had more than one loan outstanding, I dont think this gap was sufficient to 
break the lending  chain.  Im not satisfied  that Sunny could reasonably  believe  that Mr D no 
longer needed to rely on these loans  in that time. This is borne out by the fact when from 
loan 10 onwards, Mr D was borrowing or repaying loans almost on a monthly basis.
As Sunny continued to provide borrowing and I think that Mr D lost out because:
these  loans had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing him  
take expensive credit over an extended period of time,
the sheer  number of loans was likely  to have had negative  implications on Mr Ds 
ability to access  mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
Ref: DRN82560983So Im upholding  Mr Ds complaint about  loans  7 to 14 because  the overall  pattern of lending 
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  and he lost 
out as a result.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest and charges Mr D paid on loans 7 to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were  paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 means any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 7 to 14 should be removed from Mr Ds credit  file
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny  to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr D a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Ds 
complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited should put things right as Ive set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 May 2019.
