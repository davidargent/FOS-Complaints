The complaint
Miss Z complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Debenhams (NewDay) declined a credit card 
chargeback after it was defended by the seller.
What happened
After Miss Z purchased an electrical item on-line using her NewDay credit card, she 
complained to the seller that it wasnt working as it should. The seller told her she could 
return it for a refund, or it could be replaced if it was returned. Miss Z wanted a refund and 
established it would cost her more to return the item than the amount she paid for it. She told 
NewDay she would return it at the cost of the seller. She asked NewDay to arrange a 
chargeback on this basis.
NewDay refunded the cost of the item (£65.99) to Miss Zs card and submitted a claim to the 
seller and suspended interest payable on the transaction. Unfortunately, the seller declined 
the chargeback request and NewDay reapplied the debit to the card.
Miss Z complained to NewDay that they had treated her unfairly and had handled the matter 
unprofessionally.
NewDay provided a final response and said they didnt uphold the complaint. They said it 
was a requirement of the MasterCard chargeback process that goods were returned before 
a chargeback is accepted by a seller, and they felt that any further attempt to apply a 
chargeback would be unsuccessful.
Miss Z didnt accept the final response from NewDay and brought her complaint to our 
service.
Our investigator looked into things for Miss Z and thought that NewDay hadnt done anything 
wrong because the seller had supplied evidence Miss Z hadnt tried to return the faulty item.
Miss Z didnt accept the thoughts of the investigator and asked for an ombudsman to decide 
her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator and I think they set out matters clearly and 
thoroughly. 
There are two ways that a card provider can try to help a customer recover money paid on a 
credit card. The first way is under a voluntary chargeback scheme. The rules are set out by 
the relevant card scheme, in this case MasterCard. The other method is under Section 75 of 
the CCA 1974, but this is only possible if the items in dispute have a cash price of more than 
£100. In this case the item was £65.99.
I understand Miss Z says she didnt know the chargeback scheme was voluntary and that 
she feels misled by NewDay that the credit card offered less purchase protection that she 
believed it did. I have noted Miss Zs concerns that NewDays advertise the consumer 
protection benefits of the MasterCard. I cant comment on NewDays advertisements or tell 
them to change them  were only here to look at complaints about individual situations. Its 
the regulator  the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  who regulates financial businesses 
and their processes. However, I can decide whether NewDay applied the MasterCard 
chargeback process fairly in this case.
Initially NewDay processed a chargeback and temporarily credited Miss Zs account with the 
value of the item. This is what I wouldve expected NewDay to do after Miss Z contacted 
them. I have seen that NewDay wrote to Miss Z to tell her the value of the item had been 
refunded, but they may need to look at things again if the seller provided more details. 
In this case the chargeback was defended by the seller who provided evidence Miss Z 
hadnt returned the goods. The information received from the seller was enough for NewDay 
to believe the chargeback wouldnt be successful, so under the terms of the scheme it didnt 
need to pursue the chargeback further. NewDay then re-debited the cost of the item to the 
credit card.
Although I appreciate this will have caused Miss Z significant frustration and upset, and has 
left her £65.99 out of pocket, I dont think NewDay made a mistake by reversing the 
chargeback. I think NewDay applied the chargeback process fairly in Miss Zs case and I 
havent seen that NewDay acted unprofessionally during the process.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint and I wont be asking NewDay Ltd 
trading as Debenhams to take any further action.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 January 2021.
