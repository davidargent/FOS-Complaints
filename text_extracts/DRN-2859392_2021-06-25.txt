The complaint
Mr E complains about BUPA Insurance Limiteds handling of his private medical insurance 
claim.
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts arent in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
BUPA required further information from Mr Es GP before authorising the tests. 
Thats because it wanted to check that his symptoms didnt relate to any of his pre-
existing conditions that were excluded under the policy. I dont think there was 
anything wrong with that.
However, BUPA didnt respond to Mr E on two occasions when it should have done. 
This caused unnecessary confusion for Mr E, particularly because on one of those 
occasions, hed provided information from his specialist. 
I agree with our investigator that BUPA ought to have responded to Mr E and advised 
him that it still needed more information from his GP before authorising the tests  
particularly when he chased this on 19 June. It seems it didnt make this clear to Mr E 
until it responded to his complaint in July.
I think our investigators recommendation of £100 compensation seems reasonable 
in the circumstances for BUPAs poor service. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold this complaint. I require BUPA Insurance Limited to 
pay Mr E £100 compensation.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 July 2021.
