The complaint
Mr S complains about NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua and their decision to move his account 
onto a PayDown plan.
What happened
Mr S held a credit card account with NewDay. In January 2018, NewDay wrote to Mr S 
explaining hed only been making the minimum payment on his account for the previous six 
months. NewDay followed this up with another letter in September 2018, explaining Mr S 
was classed as in persistent debt for the previous 18 months as hed been paying more in 
interest, charges and fees that hed paid to his actual borrowing.
NewDay sent further letters to Mr S at 27 and 35 months, explaining he remained in 
persistent debt and asking him to pay more if possible in order to ensure he cleared his 
balance sooner and saved on additional interest payments. NewDay also explained if no 
additional payments were received, theyd be moving Mr S account to a four-year PayDown 
plan.
No additional payments were received so NewDay wrote to Mr S in April 2020 explaining his 
account had been moved onto a PayDown plan. But Mr S was unhappy about this, so he 
raised a complaint.
Mr S explained he hadnt received the persistent letters sent by NewDay. So, he only 
became aware of the PayDown plan when he logged onto his online banking and saw his 
account had already been transferred. Mr S didnt think this was fair and thought NewDay 
shouldve discussed his options with him before taking this action. Mr S was also unhappy 
that NewDay had charged his account interest while a payment freeze was in place due to 
the impact of COVID-19 on his finances. And finally, Mr S was unhappy he was sent a 
payment chaser letter during this time.
NewDay responded and upheld Mr S complaint in part. They thought theyd made Mr S 
aware he was in persistent debt and had followed the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
guidelines by moving Mr S account to a PayDown plan to help him clear his balance. So, 
they didnt think theyd done anything wrong. But they did invite Mr S to contact them to 
discuss alternative plans should he wish to do so. 
They also thought theyd charged interest on Mr S account fairly while a payment freeze 
was in place. But they agreed they shouldnt have sent Mr S a chaser for payment in June 
2020 and offered Mr S £30 to recognise any upset this caused. Mr S remained unhappy with 
this response so he referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. She acknowledged Mr S said 
he didnt receive the persistent debt letters and notice of the PayDown plan. But she 
explained the letters were addressed correctly so was satisfied theyd been sent and didnt 
think Mr S failure to receive these was the fault of NewDay. So, she thought NewDay had 
made Mr S reasonably aware of his status as in persistent debt and the likely action they 
would take if further payments werent made. And she thought NewDays fell in line with the 
FCAs guidelines so didnt think they needed to do anything more.
She also thought NewDay made it reasonably clear to Mr S that interest would still be 
accrued on the account while the payment freeze was in place. And in any event, she didnt 
think Mr S had been impacted financially as NewDay had refunded this to ensure his 
PayDown plan didnt exceed the four years set. And finally, she thought the £30 NewDay 
offered was a fair one to recognise their error when sending Mr S a chaser for payment while 
a payment freeze was in place on his account. So, she didnt think NewDay needed to do 
anything more. 
Mr S didnt agree. He maintained his position that the letters hadnt been received and that 
NewDay shouldve sent them electronically. And he thought NewDay offering to discuss 
alternative options in their final response to his complaint showed these options shouldve 
been presented to him before a PayDown plan was put in place. And he still didnt think this 
plan was fair due to the amount of interest that was still being charged on the account. He 
maintained his view that NewDay couldve acted more positively and sympathetically to his 
situation so wanted to be compensated for this. As Mr S didnt agree, the complaint has 
been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr S. I recognise Mr S 
comments about not receiving the letters NewDay sent. So, I can appreciate the shock and 
concern Mr S wouldve felt when he discovered his account had transferred onto a PayDown 
plan and why hed query the fairness of this, considering he didnt think hed agreed for this 
to take place. But for me to say NewDay have done something wrong, Id need to be 
satisfied their decision to place Mr S on a PayDown was unfair and that it impacted his 
financial situation negatively. Or, that NewDay failed to follow the FCA guidelines regarding 
how to notify a Mr S that he was in persistent debt and that a PayDown plan may be put in 
place. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
The FCA implemented a change in their rules from 1 September 2018, which were designed 
to ensure businesses such as NewDay took action to prevent customers from being in 
persistent debt for long periods of time. This is because when customers are in persistent 
debt, they often end up paying more in interest and charges than they do paying off the 
actual amount they spent. So, Ive thought about whether NewDay fairly followed these 
guidelines.
Ive seen NewDay sent Mr S letters at 18, 27 and 36 months explaining he was classed as in 
persistent debt and explaining additional payments would reduce the cost of his borrowing 
and the time it would take him to repay his debt. This follows the guidelines set by the FCA. 
And Ive seen during this time, Mr S continued to make minimum monthly payments 
meaning most of this payment amount went to clear the interest and charges on the account, 
rather than the borrowing amount. Because of this, NewDay took the decision to place Mr S 
account on a PayDown plan over a four-year period.FCA guidelines explain at this point, a lender should offer the customer a reasonable way to 
repay the balance over a reasonable amount of time and stipulates this should usually fall 
between three to four years.
Ive seen the monthly payment of this plan was at a similar level to the minimum payments 
Mr S had been able to maintain and was set over four years. So, Im satisfied the plan 
NewDay put in place was fair and in line with the guidelines set. So, I think NewDays 
decision to place Mr S account on a PayDown plan was fair and I cant say they did 
anything wrong when taking that decision.
But Ive also considered whether NewDay made Mr S reasonably aware this action was 
likely to be taken and whether they shouldve offered alternative options to him. Mr S has 
explained he didnt receive any of the letters Ive seen from NewDay. And he doesnt think 
the PayDown plan is fair as it continues to accrue interest at a rate he feels is unfair and 
placing him in further debt. 
Ive seen the letters NewDay sent to Mr S. And Im satisfied theyre addressed correctly to 
the same postal address we hold for Mr S. While I appreciate Mr S says he didnt receive 
these, Im satisfied they were sent by NewDay and I dont think it would be fair for me to hold 
them responsible for this. I understand Mr S comments about being eligible for e-letters but 
the FCA guidelines doesnt stipulate how these letters should be sent. I dont think NewDay 
had any reason to believe these letters werent being received so I wouldnt have expected 
them to send the letters in an alternative format at the time.
And Ive seen in the letter sent to Mr S the month before the PayDown plan was put into 
place, they make it clear a PayDown plan would be introduced. So, I think NewDay provided 
Mr S with reasonable notice, in line with the guidance, on the basis they were unaware the 
letters werent being received.
And while the letter explains Mr S was unable to opt out of this, they do offer Mr S the 
chance to speak to them to discuss his financial situation. All of the letters NewDay sent 
offer Mr S the chance to speak to them in all of the letters sent to Mr S, so I think theyve 
done all they can to offer Mr S the chance to discuss his options.
And I think NewDay reiterating this option in their final response letter is showing them acting 
positively and sympathetically to Mr S situation, rather than evidence they failed to provide 
Mr S with options in the first place. So, I think NewDay made Mr S reasonably aware of the 
PayDown plan and that he was classed in persistent debt and I dont think they need to do 
anything more for this aspect of the complaint.
Ive also thought about Mr S comments about interest being charged to his account while a 
payment freeze was in place. Ive seen the letter sent to Mr S on 27 May confirming the 
payment freeze which explains If you are already on a PayDown plan, your PayDown plan 
instalments will be frozen during the payment freeze. You will then continue to pay towards 
your PayDown plan. Interest will continue to be charged during your payment freeze. I think 
this makes it reasonably clear to Mr S that interest would continue to accrue on his account 
so I cant say NewDay have acted unfairly by applying it. Because of this, I dont think they 
need to do anything more. 
And even if this wasnt the case, NewDay have said this interest was refunded to the 
account to ensure Mr S repays the borrowing within the four-year term. So, although I think 
NewDay were fair to charge this interest, I dont think Mr S has been impacted by this 
anyway and in fact is in a better position.NewDay have accepted the letter they sent to Mr S in June 2020 was an error, as it was 
chasing payment while a payment freeze was in place. And theyve offered £30 to recognise 
the upset this caused. I think this is offer is a fair one as it recognises the emotional impact 
on Mr S but also takes into consideration the fact he wasnt financially impacted by the error. 
So, I dont think they need to anything more on this occasion.
I understand this isnt the outcome Mr S was hoping for. And I recognise it doesnt help 
alleviate his immediate financial situation or concerns about the PayDown plan and the 
interest being charged to his account. But the interest being charged to the account is in line 
with the credit agreement Mr S agreed to when he took out the card. And this isnt something 
Id expect NewDay to reduce nor are they expected to do so under the FCA guidelines. 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Mr S complaint about NewDay Ltd trading as 
Aqua.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2021.
