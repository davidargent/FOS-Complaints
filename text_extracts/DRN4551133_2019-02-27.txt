K820x#14complaint
Ms W and Mr W says Bank of Scotland plc (BOS) mis-sold them  an Ultimate Reward 
Current Account (URCA) packaged bank  account in 2014.  Theyve  used a Claims 
Management Company (CMC) to complain.
background
Our adjudicators looked at Ms W and Mr Ws complaint and didnt think that BOS had mis-
sold the URCA . The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Ms W and Mr Ws complaint. 
Having looked  through everything provided and thought about what both parties have said, I 
think Ms W and Mr W chose to take the URCA knowing about the monthly cost.  And I 
havent seen anything to suggest that they couldnt have used the benefits.  
Im open  to the possibility Ms W and Mr W werent  told everything they needed to know  
about all the benefits. But I havent seen anything to suggest they wouldve been affected by 
any of the main limitations or exclusions. So I dont think clearer  information about either the 
monthly cost or the URCAs benefits wouldve  changed Ms W and Mr Ws decision and they 
received enough to know and understand what it was they were  agreeing  to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Ms W and Mr Ws complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Ms W and Mr W 
to accept or reject my decision before 27 March 2019.
