The complaint
Mrs C complains that Mitsubishi HC Capital UK plc, trading as Hitachi Capital, wont refund 
to her the money that she paid for a vacation club membership. Her husband is also involved 
in her complaint and shes being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs C and her husband entered into a vacation membership agreement in October 2013 to 
buy a vacation club membership. The total amount to be paid by them for the membership 
was £10,300 and Mrs C entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Hitachi Capital for a 
loan of that amount. She agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £133.17 to Hitachi 
Capital. 
Mrs Cs representative made claims to Hitachi Capital in June 2021 under sections 75 and 
140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the membership was mis-sold to Mrs C 
and her husband and, but for the misrepresentations made to them, they wouldnt have 
purchased it nor entered into the loan agreement. It also said that the terms of the 
agreement are so egregious as to be unfair, the payment of commission was hidden from 
view and the membership was marketed as an investment. It said that Mrs C was pressured 
into entering into the loan agreement, a proper affordability check wasnt undertaken and her 
relationship with Hitachi Capital was unfair. 
Hitachi Capital provided a detailed response to those claims. It said that the limitation period 
in respect of the section 75 claim had expired and it set out the reasons that it wasnt 
upholding her other claims. Mrs C wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was 
made to this service. Her complaint form says that: Hitachi Capital paid a commission to the 
holiday company which wasnt declared to her; the holiday company failed to conduct a 
proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured her and her husband 
into entering into the agreements and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure 
them; and the product was misrepresented to them; all rendering the agreement unfair 
pursuant to section 140A and it said that the claim should also be considered under section 
75. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Cs complaint should be upheld. She thought 
that Hitachi Capital was entitled to rely on the timing of the misrepresentation claim to turn it 
down. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mrs C 
and Hitachi Capital was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the 
conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She didnt consider that Hitachi Capital had acted 
incorrectly in connection with any commission paid to the holiday company and she said that 
she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mrs C.
Mrs C didnt accept our investigators recommendation and asked for her complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. She says that she and her husband were told that they would 
have access to 5 star accommodation that was exclusive to members only and was patrolled 
through the use of security but multiple tour companies offer accommodation at the resort, 
allowing non-members to access facilities, but shes got no physical proof of this. Her 
representative says that Mrs C and her husband were sold a product with little or no benefit 
or value as evidenced by the fact that there is little or no secondary market for it. It says that 
the product was, in effect, in perpetuity with unlimited liability for management charges which 
was concealed at the point of purchase and which have increased.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Cs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs Cs complaint is that Hitachi Capital turned down the claims that shed made to it 
and I accept that she referred her complaint to this service within six years of that 
happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to her 
claims;
Mrs Cs claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Hitachi Capitals response to those claims was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs Cs claim under section 75 is that the membership was misrepresented to her 
and her husband and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Hitachi Capital would be 
expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs C could have made a claim to the holiday company or Hitachi 
Capital about the misrepresentations that she says induced her and her husband into 
buying the membership in October 2013 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been incurred 
as that was when she also entered into the loan agreement with Hitachi Capital;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Hitachi Capital  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made to Hitachi 
Capital until June 2021, more than six years later so was outside of the time limits set 
out in the Limitation Act and I consider that Hitachi Capital has a defence to the claim 
and I find that it wasnt unreasonable for it to have rejected the claim;Mrs Cs representative says that it was deliberately concealed from Mrs C and her 
husband that there had been a breach of the regulations because the product was 
sold to them as an investment so the limitation period is postponed under section 32 
of the Limitation Act until they discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable 
diligence have been discovered and they couldnt have reasonably become aware of 
the concealment until they received advice from it in around March 2020;
section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been 
deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the 
debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have 
been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a 
breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate 
concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Mrs C and her husband had signed the vacation membership agreement in October 
2013 which granted them the right to use a one bedroom suite for four people for a 
week each year at the resort;
they also signed other documents including the terms and conditions, a form about 
their right to withdraw from the agreement and a customer compliance statement and 
Mrs C also signed a loan application and the loan agreement;
the customer compliance statement said: I/We understand that the reason for the 
purchase here today is for the primary purpose of holidays and is not a property or 
financial investment;
neither Mrs C nor her representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which Mrs C and her husband were told that the membership was 
an investment, the conversations that took place or the information that was provided 
to them before their October 2013 purchase;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
represented to Mrs C and her husband that the membership would be an investment 
or that it sold the membership to them as an investment;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
deliberately concealed from Mrs C and her husband that there had been a breach of 
the regulations so I dont consider that section 32 is applicable in these 
circumstances; 
Mrs Cs representative also says that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs C 
and Hitachi Capital - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to 
require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Hitachi Capital has provided a statement for Mrs Cs loan account which shows that 
the account was still open in June 2021 when the claims were first made to it so I 
dont consider that Mrs Cs claim under section 140A is time-barred;
as well as claiming that it was represented to Mrs C and her husband that the 
purchase would be an investment, Mrs Cs representatives June 2021 claim letter 
says that it was represented to them that the membership would allow them to 
access 5 star accommodation that was exclusive to members only and patrolled 
through the use of security, that it was being offered at a discounted price but only 
available that day and that the accommodation would be something that could be passed onto their family but the annual maintenance fees have increased drastically 
every year which is grossly unfair;
neither Mrs C nor her representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to Mrs C and her 
husband before their October 2013 purchase;
the membership granted Mrs C and her husband the right to use a one bedroom 
suite each year at the resort and they visited the resort before they entered into the 
vacation membership agreement  and it shows that Mrs C and her husband agreed 
to pay £10,300 for the membership;
the terms and conditions that were signed by Mrs C and her husband say: The rights 
acquired are the Membership Agreement are indivisible, of a personal nature and for 
an unlimited period of time (and the words for an unlimited period of time were 
underlined to draw attention to them); and: The programme for the assignment of 
timeshare rights is not available for weeks owned under the floating week system; 
and they confirmed in the customer compliance statement that they fully understood 
their obligations under the purchase agreement;
the holiday company says that Mrs C and her husband enjoyed the product acquired 
in 2014 but didnt make a booking from 2015 to 2017 and then didnt pay their yearly 
maintenance fees in 2018 and 2019 so werent allowed to use their accommodation 
and the agreement was then cancelled in 2019 due to unpaid maintenance fees  it 
also says that it hasnt received any complaint from Mrs C and her husband;
any misrepresentations would have been made to Mrs C and her husband by the 
holiday company before they entered into the vacation membership agreement in 
October 2013  but Ive seen no evidence to show that they complained to Hitachi 
Capital or the holiday company about the alleged misrepresentations until their 
representatives letter to Hitachi Capital in June 2021  more than seven years later 
and more than six years after theyd last used their membership  and, if it had been 
misrepresented to them, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to 
have complained about those misrepresentations sooner than that;
the customer compliance statement also says: I/We confirm that I/we have not been 
given representations that are not contained in the documentation presented to us; 
so if Mrs C and her husband had been given information by the holiday company that 
wasnt included in the documents that they were signing, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have raised that issue with the holiday company before 
they signed the agreements;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
misrepresented to Mrs C and her husband that the membership would allow them to 
access 5 star accommodation that was exclusive to members only and patrolled 
through the use of security, that it was being offered at a discounted price but only 
available that day and that the accommodation would be something that could be 
passed onto their family - and Im not persuaded that the membership was 
misrepresented to them by the holiday company or that they were induced into 
entering into the vacation membership agreement by any such misrepresentations;
Mrs Cs representative says that the payment of commission was hidden from view 
and Mrs Cs complaint form says that Hitachi Capital paid a commission to the 
holiday company which wasnt declared to her;
Hitachi Capital says that it cant find evidence that the existence of a commission 
arrangement was disclosed to Mrs C but that the commission rates paid by it to the 
holiday company arent excessive and that it takes care to ensure that commission rates are not set at a level which could potentially incentivise inappropriate behaviour 
by companies or individuals who introduce customers to it;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid 
by Hitachi Capital to the holiday company, but from what this service has seen 
across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less than 
15% and Im satisfied that Hitachi Capital wouldnt have breached any duty in making 
any such payment  nor was it under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of 
any commission paid in these circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of 
any commission that was normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high 
to mean that Hitachi Capital should have appreciated that not disclosing any 
commission to Mrs C risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mrs C entered into the loan agreement in October 2013 and I consider that its 
reasonable to conclude that any commission would have been paid by Hitachi 
Capital to the holiday company at about the same time  but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that she asked Hitachi Capital for any information about that commission until  
her representatives June 2021 letter to it, more than seven years later and I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect her to have made any complaint about the 
commission sooner than that;
the June 2021 claim letter says that a proper affordability check wasnt undertaken 
and Mrs Cs complaint form says that the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of her ability to afford the loan but the loan agreement included 
information showing that Mrs C was an employed homeowner with no mortgage and 
a gross income of £25,000 to £25,999 and she has also signed a loan application 
form which included that information and which showed that her husband was self-
employed;
Hitachi Capital says that it searched Mrs Cs credit record and used it, with other 
information provided on the application to calculate an overall score for Mrs C which 
exceeded its minimum lending criteria and that it utilises a third party affordability 
product but there were no indications that she would struggle to service the loan;
it says that Mrs Cs income was validated using data obtained from credit reference 
agencies and it estimated her net monthly income as £1,852.96 from which her 
monthly payments of approximately £66 for her other credit commitments were 
deducted and that, after the monthly loan repayment of £133.17, she would be left 
with approximately £1,653.79 each month for other monthly expenses which is 
generally sufficient to meet the other expenses which are typical to someone with 
similar circumstances to Mrs C  so it had no concerns about lending her an 
additional £10,300; 
neither Mrs C nor her representative has provided any evidence to show that the loan 
wasnt affordable for Mrs C when the loan made to her and Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mrs C asked Hitachi Capital for any information about the affordability 
checks that it had conducted until her representatives June 2021 letter to it, more 
than seven years later, and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to 
have made any complaint about those checks sooner than that;
the loan account statement that Hitachi Capital has provided shows that Mrs C made 
the monthly payment each month until November 2023 when the loan was repaid on 
schedule and the loan account was then closed;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for Mrs C in October 2013 when it was made to her, that Hitachi Capital 
should have done more to assess the affordability of the loan for her, that the loan was mis-sold to her or that Hitachi Capital has acted incorrectly in connection with 
the loan;
the June 2021 letter says that Mrs C was pressured into entering into the loan 
agreement and Mrs Cs complaint form says that the holiday company unduly 
pressured her and her husband into entering into the agreements and used 
aggressive commercial practices to pressure them  but the customer compliance 
statement that they signed says: I/We confirm that both the Credit and Purchase 
agreement were fully explained and the whole presentation was conducted in a 
friendly and helpful manner. I/We confirm I/we are happy to proceed with both 
agreements; 
Mrs C and her husband had signed a form about their right to withdraw from the 
vacation membership agreement within fourteen days without giving any reason but 
Ive seen no evidence to show that they contacted either the holiday company or 
Hitachi Capital to withdraw from that agreement within the withdrawal period;
the loan agreement also said that Mrs C had the right to withdraw from the loan 
agreement without giving any reason for a period of fourteen days but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that she contacted Hitachi Capital to withdraw from the loan 
agreement within the withdrawal period;
if Mrs C and her husband had been pressured into entering into those agreements 
and didnt want to buy the membership I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect them to have contacted either the holiday company or Hitachi Capital soon 
after theyd signed the agreements but Ive seen no evidence that they contacted 
either of them until Mrs Cs representatives June 2021 letter, more than seven years 
after the agreements had been signed;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs C and her husband 
were unduly pressured into buying the membership in October 2013, that Mrs C was 
unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptably aggressive commercial practices against them;
the June 2021 letter says that the annual maintenance fees have increased 
drastically every year which is grossly unfair and Mrs Cs representative says that 
Mrs C has been with unlimited liability for management charges which was 
concealed at the point of purchase;
the maintenance fee for the first year of membership was set out in the vacation 
membership agreement and the terms and conditions say: The Member must pay a 
yearly Maintenance Fee for the upkeep and management of the Resort. The annual 
maintenance fee will be calculated in accordance with the Club Constitution and will 
include the cost of managing the Club for the year (amongst others, electricity, water, 
insurance, maintenance and refuse collection), a contribution to a replacement fund 
for major repairs, replacements due to wear and tear, and a contribution to 
maintenance of common areas and facilities located within [the resort]. Maintenance 
Fees will be invoiced at the end of each year for each following year, and will be 
stipulated in accordance with the Club Constitution. A schedule of annual 
maintenance costs is enclosed as Appendix D. The Maintenance Fee will be 
collected by the Management Company;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the charges that Mrs C 
and her husband were required to pay for their membership were concealed at the 
point of purchase or are unfair;
the June 2021 letter says that the terms of the agreement are so egregious as to be 
unfair but it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the terms in the 
agreements were unfair;I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
although a term providing for termination of an agreement for a holiday ownership 
product if maintenance fees arent paid could be an unfair term, the holiday company 
says that Mrs C and her husband didnt make a booking from 2015 to 2017 and then 
didnt pay their yearly maintenance fees in 2018 and 2019 so werent allowed to use 
their accommodation and the agreement was then cancelled in 2019 due to unpaid 
maintenance fees - it also says that it hasnt received any complaint from Mrs C and 
her husband and Ive seen no evidence to show that they complained to the holiday 
company about the termination of their membership;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the termination of the 
agreement in these circumstances was unfair or that the other terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mrs C and her husband 
and I consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances 
that the terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mrs C and 
Hitachi Capital;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs Cs relationship 
with Hitachi Capital was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs C and Hitachi Capital in 
these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mrs C for the issues that she and her husband have had with their 
membership but I consider that Hitachi Capitals response to the claims that had 
been made to it was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Hitachi Capital to refund to Mrs C any of the money that shes paid under the loan 
agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Cs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2024.
