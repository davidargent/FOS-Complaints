K821x#15complaint
Miss C complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid was irresponsible  when it 
provided her with a number of loans.
background
Miss C took a number  of loans from QuickQuid between July 2013 and March 2018.  Ive 
prepared a table  from some of the information  QuickQuid has provided about Miss Cs 
borrowing. It can be found at the end of this final decision  in the annex. 
The first loan was an open-ended  credit agreement (FlexCredit) which  was active for almost 
14 months. The following  11 loans  were payday loans, repayable  through  either  one, two or 
three instalments. On a number of occasions Miss C topped  up her borrowing  in other 
words she took additional  capital advances  on loans which were outstanding. On some  
occasions when  she took top-ups, the term of the loan was also extended. 
During the period when Miss C took Loans  1 to 11 the gaps between  repaying one loan and 
taking another  ranged from around 3 days to 48 days. There  was a gap of around 16 months  
between the repayment of Loan 11 and the approval  of Loan 12.
QuickQuid didnt agree that it did anything wrong when it provided the loans to Miss C. So 
she brought her complaint to this Service.
One of our adjudicators partially upheld  Miss Cs complaint. She thought  the loans from 
Loan 4 to Loan 11 shouldnt have been  given.  The adjudicator  explained that QuickQuid 
shouldve realised, from the pattern  of lending, that Miss Cs indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably and so it wouldnt be right to continue to lend to her. QuickQuid disagreed and 
so the complaint has been passed to me for a final decision. If Miss C accepts my decision it 
will be legally binding  on the parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending  including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly  speaking,  
this all means that QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice,  this means it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make 
sure Miss C could repay her loans in a sustainable  manner. Additionally, there may come a 
point where the lending  history and pattern of lending itself clearly  demonstrates  that the 
lending was unsustainable.
When Miss C took the FlexCredit  in July 2013  she declared a monthly income of £1,000. 
QuickQuid hasnt provided details of any expenses  declared by Miss C at that time. The 
credit limit provided was £300. And the credit agreement provided a hypothetical repayment 
schedule in the event that Miss C immediately drew  down the maximum £300 and then 
repaid it over the following  ten months  without any further drawdowns. This showed that the 
maximum repayment would be around £96. With all that in mind I dont think that I can safely 
say that QuickQuid was wrong to conclude that that FlexCredit loan would be unaffordable 
for Miss C.
Ref: DRN58186292QuickQuid had an obligation to monitor how Miss C managed the loan and offer assistance if 
she demonstrated that she was experiencing financial difficulties. From what I can see 
Miss C made multiple drawdowns up to her limit over the 13 months but she tended to repay 
them in full (rather  than spread out the repayments). I can see that a late fee was charged 
on 1 April 2014 but this was repaid together with the outstanding  balance on the same  day. 
Miss C didnt use her account again for almost  four months when she drew  down  £50. And 
about a month after that drawdown the FlexCredit account was closed. 
I dont think there was anything in the way Miss C used her FlexCredit account, including the 
period it was open, such that QuickQuid shouldve stepped in to assist her. But I think that 
the way she had used it  including the number of drawdowns (12) - was something 
QuickQuid ought  to have considered when approving Miss Cs later loan applications.
Around one month after the FlexCredit agreement closed Miss C asked QuickQuid for a loan 
of £300. She declared an income of £1,000  again and declared expenses  of £325. She was 
due to repay £388.50 29 days later. 
Miss C had now been borrowing from QuickQuid for well over a year. She had changed  the 
type of loan product by taking a payday loan for a sum previously  available  to her through 
her FlexCredit agreement. And the repayment of Loan 2 was going to take up a significant 
proportion of her income. I think that QuickQuid shouldve been  doing a much  more thorough 
review of Miss Cs financial circumstances than it did. 
Similarly QuickQuid should have done  a full review and verified information provided to it by 
Miss C when she applied  for Loan 3. I accept that this was for a lower  sum but she asked for 
this loan only nine days after she repaid  Loan  2.
However  although I dont  think  QuickQuid  did enough checks when Miss C took Loans  2 
and 3, I havent been provided with anything to help me understand whether  had 
QuickQuid done  more - it wouldve decided against lending to her. 
So I'm not upholding Miss Cs complaint about  the Loan 1 (the FlexCredit)  or Loans 2 and 3.
But I am upholding Miss Cs complaint about Loans 4 to 11. Ill explain my reasons  for not 
upholding the complaint  about Loan  12 towards  the end of my decision.
At the point Miss C took Loan 4 she had been  borrowing from QuickQuid for a round a year 
and a half. I accept  that there  had been  three periods when she wasnt  indebted to 
QuickQuid of 34 days, 9 days  and 42 days.  But over that whole period she had been 
provided with credit  on 14 separate occasions.  Her declared income hadnt changed  it was 
£1,000 throughout the borrowing relationship but she had not managed  to have a sustained  
period of time when she wasnt owing money to QuickQuid. 
Then around  a month and a half after repaying  Loan 3, Miss C came back  to borrow  another  
loan. Although Loan 4 was for £100 again I note that Miss C was due to repay it through two 
instalments of £16.80 and £122.40.  So she was delaying  repayment of the full amount. And 
a week later Miss C topped up her borrowing by another £25.
Ive carefully thought  about the nature  of Miss Cs borrowing up to the point she took Loan 4. 
And I think the history, including the pattern of - borrow:repay:borrow - demonstrated  that 
further lending  would  be unsustainable for Miss C. The purpose  of this sort of credit was to 
Ref: DRN58186293act as a short-term solution  to temporary cash flow problems.  It wasnt  appropriate for 
supporting sustained borrowing over longer periods.
After Miss C repaid Loan 4 she took another 7 loans (but these were  made  up of 15 
separate advances) between 29 March 2015 and 1 August 2016 - when she took Loan 11c. 
In that time the longest she was without debt to QuickQuid was 48 days between Loans 9 
and 10. But she had not only topped up Loan 9 twice - so she doubled  the amount shed 
initially borrowed - but she also extended it so a loan intended  to last 57 days ended  up 
taking 72 days to repay. And I dont think a gap of 48 days in these circumstances was 
sufficient to conclude  that Miss C wasnt reliant  on short term loans to bridge the hole in her 
finances. 
Loan 11 began as a loan for £100  over 59 days but after three additional  top-ups the amount 
borrowed reached £400 and the term was extended  to 121 days.
Ive considered the comments QuickQuid made  in response to our adjudicators 
assessment. But Im not persuaded to change my conclusions. I dont accept that a gap in 
borrowing of 16 days in the circumstances I've outlined about  amounts to a substantial  
break such that QuickQuid could  be confident  that Miss C was not in a cycle  of dependency 
on its products. I do accept that the 485 day gap between Loans 11 and 12 was sufficient for 
that purpose  which is why I've treated the borrowing after that break as a new loan chain.
QuickQuid tells me that in five years of borrowing Miss C was only charged  four late fees.  I 
accept that there were  four late fees during the lending relationship.  Two of those were 
assessed during  periods Miss C held loans which I havent found to be irresponsibly lent. 
The two late fees in June and November  2016  were assessed whilst she was repaying 
Loans 10 and 11. But, even if shed  not been  late on any occasion,  the pattern of lending 
itself demonstrated  that Loans 4 to 11 werent sustainable for Miss C. The fact that someone  
makes repayments on time doesnt  necessarily mean that theyre doing so from sustainable 
sources. For example  someone may borrow from one short  term lender to repay  a different 
short term later and repeat that pattern over a lengthy period without ever incurring late fees.
I note that QuickQuid has sent to me a document in which it has explained the key aspects 
of its lending criteria since 2015.  QuickQuid has raised this before in relation to other cases  
and has had answers from us on these representations many times. It is expected that 
businesses will learn from our decisions.  But to be clear, this Service  is required to take into 
account more  than simply the regulations  when  determining a complaint by reference to 
what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of the case. Additionally  we will take into 
account the law, regulators  rules, guidance  and standards and codes of practice as well as 
good industry practice at the relevant time.
The regulations themselves  required  lenders to take into account more  than simply 
assessing the borrowers ability to repay  the credit. They had to take reasonable steps to 
assess the customers ability to meet repayments  under a regulated credit agreement in a 
sustainable manner  without the customer incurring  financial difficulties or experiencing 
significant adverse  consequences.  - Consumer Credit Source Book  (CONC) 5.3.1G. 
Ref: DRN58186294CONC went on to explain that that sustainable  means that repayments under the regulated  
credit agreement can be made by the customer:
(a) without undue difficulties, in particular:
(i) the customer should be able to make repayments  on time,
while meeting  other reasonable  commitments; and
(ii) without having to borrow  to meet the repayments;
(b) over the life of the agreement, or for such an agreement which  is
an open-end agreement,  within a reasonable period; and
(c) out of income and savings without having  to realise security  or assets.
Im satisfied that the circumstances around  the pattern of lending  in this case meant that 
from Loan 4 to 11 QuickQuid shouldve realised  that further credit wasnt  sustainable for 
Miss C and declined  to give her any more  loans. As it did continue to lend to her it did so 
irresponsibly. And I uphold her complaint about those loans.
As I've mentioned  Loan 12 was taken more than a year after Miss C had repaid Loan 11. So 
I think it was fair for QuickQuid to conclude that any cycle  of dependency previously 
experienced by Miss C had most likely  resolved itself in that period. Ive thought about the 
checks QuickQuid did before approving this loan and on balance,  taking account of things 
like the amounts declared by Miss C for her income  and expenses, the amount being 
borrowed and the terms for repayment  - I dont think  QuickQuid was irresponsible to provide 
Loan 12 to Miss C.
putting things  right 
To put things right QuickQuid should:  
refund  all interest and charges Miss C paid on Loans 4 to 11:
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
I understand that there is an outstanding balance due on Loans 12 and 12a (taken on 
1 March and 10 March 2018). If QuickQuid still owns this debt it may offset the refund 
against the outstanding debt. 
the number  of loans taken from 9 January 2015  to 1 August 2016  means  any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans approved 
during this period should be removed  from Miss Cs credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must  give 
Miss C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN58186295my final decision
For the reasons  explained above, I uphold Miss Cs complaint in part and require 
CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right as I've outlined.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 August 2019.
