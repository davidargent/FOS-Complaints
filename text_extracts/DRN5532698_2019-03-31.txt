K822xcomplaint
Ms G complains that shes incurred additional  costs because of how National Westminster  
Bank Plc responded  to requests made on her behalf. This complaint is brought  on her behalf 
by a firm of solicitors, D.
background 
D told us that Ms G doesnt  have capacity to manage her own affairs.  D represents  Ms G, 
under an Order issued  by the Court of Protection. He has been appointed to make decisions 
on her behalf that shes unable  to make herself, and is obliged to act in her best interests.  D 
charges for this service, and that cost is paid out of Ms Gs assets.  
D told us that the problem  here is that NatWest has caused delays in dealing  with some of 
Ms Gs affairs, which  has increased  these costs. D thinks its reasonable, when NatWest  is 
dealing with a professional deputy, for the bank to take extra  care to make sure that Ms G 
doesnt end up paying avoidable  costs. D said that he thought  that Ms G was facing £831.60 
in additional costs, because NatWest hadnt  dealt with the issues  in this complaint efficiently. 
And he said that he thought NatWest should pay that.  
D told us that he was trying to close Ms Gs accounts, and gather all her money together, so 
he could administer it for her. He said that there  had been  unnecessary  delays in identifying  
and closing the accounts she held with NatWest. 
D said that NatWest had failed to provide information and execute requests within a 
reasonable timeframe. He said that it took NatWest over two weeks  for the accounts  D 
originally knew about to be closed, a further  three months to advise him that there were two 
other accounts, and then six months  after that to close those  accounts  and send  him the 
money. He said that money was needed to pay for food, and to pay the phone bill. Ms G 
needed to keep her phone  line connected for reasons of safety.
D also said he was also trying to recover for Ms G a document which was held at a particular 
branch of NatWest.  NatWest had told him that he needed to contact this branch in writing to 
make arrangements  to collect it. He said that NatWests branch didnt respond to two 
separate letters about this. D also said he had asked repeatedly if the document could be 
sent to a branch closer to him, so he could  recover it at a lower  cost to Ms G. But NatWest 
had refused. 
D said that NatWest should take into account  Ms Gs disability, which requires her to have a 
deputy act for her. He said NatWest should take this into consideration, to avoid indirectly  
discriminating against her.  
D also gave examples of conflicting information  that NatWest had provided,  including  
conflicting advice  on the location  of the document  that should be released to Ms G, 
commitments to releasing funds which werent met, and denials that certain accounts held 
by Ms G actually existed. 
NatWest sent D a reply  to his complaint. That said that D had to travel to the branch in 
person to collect the document it held for Ms G, although it had previously said that he could 
have it collected  by a courier. It said that collection in person from the branch that held the 
document was its process, so it couldnt make alternative arrangements,  like couriering  it to 
D or to a branch near D. 
Ref: DRN55326982NatWest said that D could talk to a named contact about the problems  hed experienced with 
Ms Gs finances. 
And finally, NatWest said it had only ever received a certified copy of the relevant court  
order. So it couldnt send  D back the original. 
Our investigator upheld  this complaint.  He didnt think that NatWest had to send the 
document to D. But he said that NatWest had caused delays, and provided  conflicting 
information. He recommended  NatWest pay Ms G £200 to make up for the poor service in 
this case. He also said that D hadnt  been sent statements he had asked for. Our 
investigator expected  NatWest to send D the last twelve months of bank statements to D 
within the next month.
Our investigator said that he appreciated that D had asked for more, but he said that our 
service doesnt pay solicitors costs.
NatWest accepted that. But D didnt.  
D sent us a detailed reply. He said that he accepted the overall  conclusion  that NatWest was 
at fault, but the offer didnt take account of the extra costs that Ms G would  have to pay 
because of these  delays. He said that those extra costs had now gone  up to £1,416.20.  
D said that NatWest had said it couldnt  forward documents held in safekeeping between 
branches, but he said it must be doing that whenever it closes a branch. And he said that it 
wasnt clear where the document it held for Ms G actually  was. NatWest had failed to 
confirm that. 
D said that failure to transfer the document  held for Ms G to a closer location was likely to be 
indirect discrimination against Ms G. The banks process didnt allow  for the additional costs 
that someone who cant manage their own affairs would  incur in paying  someone  else to 
collect a document  from a distant branch. D said hed also tried to arrange  collection of the 
document for Ms G, but NatWest had simply failed to confirm that it would be released to Ds 
courier. 
D outlined the significant risks he believed  that Ms G was at, because  of mistakes  made  and 
delays caused  by NatWest. 
This case was then passed to me for a final decision.
my provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I proposed  to uphold it. 
This is what  I said then: 
-D said that the amount our investigator  proposed, of £200, was meagre, and wouldnt be 
sufficient to change  NatWests approach. But it isnt the purpose of any award made by 
this service to punish a bank,  or to charge it enough to dissuade  it from a particular 
course of action in future. I can only look to provide a fair and reasonable outcome to this 
case.
Ref: DRN55326983-Our investigator,  in turn, noted that our service  doesnt normally pay the costs  of a 
professional representative  whos helping someone  manage their affairs.  Thats  usually 
right. But I didnt think that I could assume, in the circumstances of this case,  that it 
would be inappropriate  for NatWest to make  any contribution towards  the cost of 
managing Ms Gs affairs in this case.  I have to bear in mind that Ms G has to have a 
professional manage her affairs. Shes  been  assessed, through a court  process, as not 
competent to do so herself. And it may not be fair if the costs  to her of that management  
have been increased  as a result of what NatWest  had done.
-I first asked  our investigator to write  to D about  this case. I wasnt  clear that D had shown 
that the costs  involved  in its work  for Ms G had exceeded the flat rate fee that D is 
entitled to charge  for its work on Ms Gs behalf.  Without that, I didnt think  I could 
consider whether NatWest ought to pay some of these costs.  
-I also noted that the itemised costs that D had sent didnt appear to me to represent only 
additional costs  which may have been incurred because of mistakes made by NatWest, 
or delays  caused by it. It looked instead to be the entirety of fee earner time allocated to 
this part of Ms Gs file. It seemed likely to me that at least  some of that work wouldve 
needed done anyway. So I didnt think it would be reasonable to ask NatWest to pay the 
whole costs of that. I asked D to identify the individual elements of its bill which it 
considered should  be paid by NatWest, and why. 
-D sent us a revised bill. It stated  that it had removed from Ms Gs costs  the following 
items
oInitial visit to the bank  standard procedure  to register  Deputy 
oInitial letter to the bank - Standard procedure to register Order.
oInitial phone call from NatWest needing more information
oInitial phone call to NatWest providing information. 
oInitial call from NatWest about  the courier. 
D said that meant that NatWest was responsible for £1,258.20 of the total costs  to date. 
-D also said that NatWest has a team dealing specifically with deputies  and related 
issues, so it had the resources to work with D in solving  the problem about  the collection 
of the document it held for Ms G. D said that any subsequent letters, phone calls and 
emails were made  chasing  NatWest for a response, in what should have been a 
straightforward procedure  to register the order, send the document  to London or confirm  
its location for a courier to collect, and close the accounts. 
-I have  considered the costs that D has set out. Im satisfied that Ds charges for 
managing Ms Gs affairs  on her behalf are likely to exceed the fixed  fee that D is entitled 
to charge for that service, and that those  costs will therefore be assessed in due course.  
So I think it is reasonable, in the particular circumstances of this case  (which  include a 
court-appointed deputy  acting for Ms G and charging her for that service) to ask NatWest 
to contribute towards those costs if what  it has done, and in particular mistakes  it has 
made, have  increased what Ms G will have to pay. So Ill assess those costs against my 
findings on the merits of this case. 
-Ds complaint rests, I think, on two key points. The first is that NatWest  caused delays in 
dealing with Ms Gs affairs, including in identifying  the accounts belonging to Ms G, and 
in closing those.  
Ref: DRN55326984-I think that NatWest did initially fail to identify additional accounts which belonged to 
Ms G. It then refused  to transfer funds  and close accounts, after it had apparently  agreed  
to do so, because  it said that Ms G had a document held in safekeeping which  would 
need to be collected  before it could close the accounts. That may have  been  a reason 
not to close the accounts, but it doesnt  seem to me to have been a reason not to 
transfer the funds  that D had requested be moved so he could administer  them.
-I can see that D has asked for the return of the original  sealed copy of the Order,  which  it 
sent to NatWest. NatWest replied  to this by saying  that it had only ever been sent a 
certified copy. But Ive seen the letter D sent which stated it included an original,  and 
NatWests reply  acknowledging receipt.  Ive also seen that when NatWest started to 
consider this complaint, it said it didnt have the Order, and asked for a copy. I presume 
the original has now been lost, so I wont ask NatWest to return it. But this is another  
example of additional work that D was put to, and additional  costs  incurred for Ms G, as 
a result of a mistake  by NatWest.
-I also note that NatWest has given D wrong  information on occasion,  such as its initial  
suggestion about where the document it held for Ms G actually was. It seems to have 
mentioned two branches, at the same time, only one of which  could presumably have 
had Ms Gs document. 
-Considering  all the evidence in this case,  I agree that NatWest  has caused delays, and 
has put D to additional  work on Ms Gs behalf, which  should not have been necessary. 
-The second argument D makes is that NatWest is causing  extra  costs  in getting the 
document it holds  for Ms G to her deputy. 
-D states that the branch NatWest  previously said this document was at has closed, and 
NatWest hasnt told D where the document now is. But I think  that the final response 
letter issued by NatWest on 27 April says which  branch is holding  the document. 
-D also says that NatWest shouldve transferred the document,  which  I understand to be 
a deed, to a closer  branch so that it could be collected at a lower  cost to Ms G. D is of 
the view that B can take advantage of existing arrangements to move  this document. 
However, the existing  arrangements that D is suggesting NatWest  could use to move 
this document  are one-off  arrangements  which are only made, as part of closing a 
branch, for the transfer of all of the items held in safekeeping there to another  branch.  
There doesnt seem to be a regular courier  service between  branches that NatWest  
could just use to move this document. What  D seems to be suggesting comes down, 
I think, to saying simply that NatWest, rather than D, should  bear the cost of moving this 
document from its current location to a location closer  to D. D says that it may be indirect  
discrimination for NatWest to refuse to do this. 
-If it were  indirectly discriminatory for NatWest to refuse to send this document to D, or to a 
branch closer to D, then NatWest  would need to offer an objective justification for that. And 
I think that NatWest may have  done that. It has said that it holds items on a contents 
unknown basis, so it wont forward documents, because it isnt able to assess  its liability  if 
the document is lost. Its possible that this may be a proportionate  means of achieving a 
legitimate aim. But I also think  its important  that NatWest doesnt seem to me to have told 
D that. It seems to have  just said to D that it wont  forward documents  because that isnt its 
process. D has therefore persisted with this argument, because it doesnt seem  to have 
seen any indication  from NatWest  that its been properly considered. 
Ref: DRN55326985-Because of the reasons that NatWest  has shared with us for not forwarding documents,  
I dont think that I can base my findings  in this case on the assumption that NatWest has 
indirectly discriminated against Ms G. It may be able to justify what  it has done. And its 
not clear to me, given the potential costs involved in securely relocating a single 
document from its current location to a location closer  to D, that I can say that NatWest  
has failed to provide  a reasonable adjustment for Ms G by not doing that. 
-But I think that NatWests procedures are based on two assumptions. One is that the 
document it holds  is potentially  extremely valuable, and the other is that NatWest will 
inevitably be liable if the document doesnt reach its intended destination. I think  it may 
be worth  noting that those  assumptions arent made by all banks that hold documents  in 
safekeeping. 
-I also note that there are additional factors to consider here. One is that the document  
that NatWest holds for Ms G isnt necessarily  inherently valuable.  D hasnt asserted that 
it has value, and if it is a deed to a registered property, then it may have almost no value.  
The other is that D has made a strong  argument  that Ms G would be considered to be a 
disabled person, who will incur  much higher costs if she has to have this document  
collected on her behalf.  I think  that means  that NatWest should  consider whether it can 
make a reasonable adjustment for Ms G. And in particular, I think  that NatWest  should 
consider whether it could, in this case,  open the document, check  the contents match 
what D has told us and NatWest  is inside, and if so, it could agree on receipt  of a signed 
indemnity from D against loss (which NatWest may draft, if it prefers) to simply post the 
item to D using a tracked service. 
-Ill consider any further  evidence offered by either side on this in response to my 
provisional decision, but at the moment, thats how I would  propose to deal with the 
question of how Ms G should  get her document. 
-I should also say that even  if NatWest  had been  right to insist that the document  should  
be collected (which  Im not currently persuaded it was) it was unhelpful for NatWest to 
say that this could  only be arranged directly  with the branch, and must be done in writing. 
NatWest has shared with our service the telephone contact details for the branch holding 
the document. It said it wouldnt  give D that number. But Im not clear why NatWest 
couldnt have  called  the branch, while D was on the line, and made arrangements  for Ds 
courier to collect the document.  Instead, D seems to have  been  put to the cost of 
sending two letters to the branch to try to arrange  collection,  neither of which appear to 
have been answered.  
-Overall, I think its reasonable in this case to ask NatWest to make a contribution towards 
the costs that D has incurred, working on behalf  of Ms G. Thats  because  I think that 
those costs are higher  because  of mistakes that NatWest has made. 
-Ive looked  at the costs that D has suggested that NatWest should pay. Those amount to 
£1,258.20. I think  it may be optimistic  to suggest  that this matter  couldve been entirely 
resolved with an initial visit, an initial letter, and three calls between D and NatWest. I 
think its more likely  that at least one further  letter, and perhaps three further  calls,  may 
have been required.  So I think that the amount D is seeking should  be reduced by three  
further calls (estimated at three  times £12.60) and one further letter (Ive estimated a 
substantive letter  at £75). Im also not clear  why the process  of verifying the costs  for this 
Ref: DRN55326986complaint should  be charged to NatWest, and would currently propose to exclude the 
£127 listed for that. 
-That means that NatWest should  pay D, on Ms Gs behalf,  a total of £1,020.40 in respect  
of additional costs incurred on her behalf.  I dont think any other compensation is 
warranted in this case, as D has apparently ensured that potential  risks to Ms G herself  
havent materialised, and D has of course charged for the additional time taken in 
resolving issues. 
-I also think that, unless Im persuaded otherwise, NatWest  should agree to forward 
Ms Gs document, in the way Ive set out above.  
I invited the parties  to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both NatWest and D agreed to my proposed resolution in this case. 
my findings
Although neither side has offered anything  further in this case,  Ive still reconsidered all the 
available evidence and arguments to decide  what is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. I havent changed  my mind.
my final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must  pay D, on Ms Gs behalf,  the 
sum of £1,020.40.  National  Westminster Bank  Plc must also open the document that it holds 
for Ms G, verify its contents with D, and on receipt of a signed indemnity against loss from D, 
it must  post that document to D using a tracked  service.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask D, on behalf of 
Ms G, to accept or reject my decision before 30 April 2019.
