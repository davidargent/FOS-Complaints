The complaint
Mr I says Gain Credit LLC irresponsibly lent to him. Mr I says that Gain Credit should have 
known he couldnt afford the lending and would have to borrow further to make the 
repayments. This led him into a spiral of debt.
What happened
This complaint is about 24 short-term loans Gain Credit provided to Mr I between March 
2015 and November 2017. Mr Is borrowing history for the first ten loans is as follows:

Mr I took a further 14 loans and the amounts borrowed ranged from £50 to £300. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Is complaint and thought the loans from five onwards 
shouldnt have been given. They thought Mr Is borrowing behaviour suggested he was 
having problems managing his money and that the lending was unsustainable.
Gain Credit did not respond.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me in my role as ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Gain Credit needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr I 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Gain Credit should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Gain Credit was required to establish 
whether Mr I could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr I didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to four shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr I had with Gain Credit. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Is complaint.
When Mr I applied for loan five, loans two to four were still outstanding. Loan two only had 
one further repayment but loans three and four still had five more months to run. And by 
having these loans running concurrently they significantly increased the monthly repayment 
Mr I would have to make. The monthly repayment had risen from £58.24 at loan one to 
£230.96 at loan five. And the amount owed had significantly increased and stood at £520. I 
also note that loans three to five were all taken within just over one month. So, I think Gain 
Credit should have questioned whether the lending was affordable for Mr I as his pattern of 
borrowing would suggest he was having problems managing his money. 
And Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Gain Credits lending history with Mr I, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Gain Credit should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Gain Credit should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Is case, I think that this point was reached loan six. 
I say this because:
At this point Gain Credit ought to have realised Mr I was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr I had taken out six loans within seven. So Gain Credit ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr I was having to borrow further to cover 
the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Is 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Is first loan was for £130 and loan six was for £360. At this point Gain Credit 
ought to have known that Mr I was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall 
in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr I continued to have more than one loan running at any one time and his monthly 
repayments increased according  £517.52 at loan seven. 
Mr I wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Gain Credit. Loan 24 was 
taken out 32 months after Mr Is first. Mr I had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Gain Credit over an extended period.
I think that Mr I lost out because Gain Credit continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Is indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr I borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Is ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans five to 24 and Gain Credit should put things 
right.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr I paid on loans five to 24;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loan five from Mr Is credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans six to 24 should be removed from 
Mr Is credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Gain Credit to take off tax from this interest. Gain Credit 
must give Mr I a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Is complaint. Gain Credit LLC 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 October 2020.
