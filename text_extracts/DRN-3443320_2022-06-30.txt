The complaint
Mr C complains about HomeServe Membership Limited (HomeServe) charging him for 
breakdown cover for a shower he didnt need.
What happened
Mr C had a policy with HomeServe providing breakdown cover on his shower. The policy 
was originally taken out when his shower was installed in 2011. The policy was automatically 
renewed each year, with the premiums being collected by monthly direct debit.
 
However, in 2016, Mr C took up an offer from the manufacturer to fit an upgraded shower. 
The new shower was covered by a five-year warranty. Sometime later, HomeServe 
contacted Mr C to say theyd no longer cover his [original] shower as certain parts were no 
longer available. At the same time, Mr C found his [new] shower wasnt working properly so 
contacted HomeServe for the shower to be checked. HomeServe arranged for an engineer 
from the manufacturer to inspect the shower and a dial and processor were changed. 
When carrying out the work, the engineer asked Mr C why hed paid for HomeServes policy 
for five years when the shower was covered by the manufacturer warranty. Mr C realised 
hed been paying for breakdown cover he hadnt needed. So, he complained to HomeServe, 
asking for a refund of the premiums paid since the new shower was fitted.
HomeServe didnt uphold the complaint. In their final response they said Mr C hadnt told 
them about the new shower, so the policy had continued. HomeServe said customers had a 
duty to inform them of any changes, so they wouldnt be refunding the premiums collected 
after the installation of the new shower.
 
Unhappy at HomeServes response, Mr C complained to this service. His main issue was 
hed been paying for cover on his new shower when he didnt need it. He felt HomeServe 
should have known he had a new shower and told him he didnt need the cover. 
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint, concluding HomeServe hadnt done 
anything wrong. The cover was taken out on Mr Cs original shower and automatically 
renewed each year up to and then after Mr C had his new shower fitted. The renewal 
documents asked Mr C to check the details were correct and the cover was still right 
for him. As Mr C didnt tell HomeServe about the new shower, they hadnt done 
anything wrong as they werent to know about it. So, they hadnt acted unfairly in not 
refunding the cover payments. But the investigator noted HomeServe had offered to 
refund a years payments as a goodwill gesture, which he thought reasonable.
Mr C disagreed with the investigators conclusions and requested an ombudsman 
review the complaint. He said that while he understood why HomeServe wouldnt 
refund the payments, he felt they had a moral obligation to do so.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My role here is to decide whether HomeServe have acted fairly towards Mr C.
The main issue in Mr Cs complaint is that he feels hes paid for cover on his shower he 
didnt need, because of the manufacturers warranty. He feels HomeServe should have 
known he had a new shower and told him he didnt need the cover. He thinks HomeServe 
have a moral obligation to refund the premiums hes paid. HomeServe say Mr C hadnt told 
them about the new shower when he had a duty to tell them.
Ive considered both views carefully, but on balance I agree with HomeServe. I recognise 
this will be very disappointing to Mr C, so Ill set out why Ive come to this conclusion.
Looking at what happened, its not disputed Mr C had a new shower installed in 2016, which 
he arranged privately with the manufacturer. It wasnt arranged by HomeServe. As it was 
installed by the manufacturer (a separate entity) then while HomeServe has a relationship 
with the manufacturer, I havent seen anything to suggest they would have been aware of 
this unless Mr C told them  which he didnt do. And as the policy was automatically 
renewed, then I think the onus is on Mr C to tell HomeServe about any changes affecting his 
policy. This is reflected in the wording of the renewal documents provided by HomeServe. 
While I havent seen the documents for the renewal of the policy in 2016 (around the time 
the new shower was installed) Ive seen the 2017 renewal documents (which would have 
contained similar wording). Looking at the latter, the front page of the document includes the 
following statement:
Please check your details are correct and that this cover is still right for you and your 
home. If it isnt and you decide youd like to cancel, give us a call
Weve enclosed your new policy documents, please check your details are correct 
and that this cover is still right for you.
Theres also a reference under the heading Important Information to the following:
Eligibility/other insurance
Please check that this cover is suitable for you by referring to the eligibility section of 
your policy Terms and Conditions or Policy Summary/Summary of Cover. You should 
also check that any existing insurance you hold elsewhere does not cover the same 
things as this policy, If you need to make any changes to your policy, please call 
Customer Services on.
Taking these together, I think its clear on the need to tell HomeServe about the new shower. 
I also think it reasonable to think Mr Cs new shower would have come with documentation 
and information about the manufacturers warranty (which would be equivalent to the 
reference above to existing insurance). So, Mr C would have been aware of the cover 
provided by the warranty.
Taking these points together, Ive concluded HomeServe havent acted unreasonably as the 
policy terms and conditions make it clear policyholders should tell them about changes that 
might affect the policy.
 
While I wont be asking them to take any further action, Ive noted that during our 
investigation of Mr Cs complaint, HomeServe have offered to refund a years premiums to 
Mr C as a goodwill gesture. While its for Mr C to decide whether to accept HomeServes 
offer, I dont think its unreasonable.My final decision
For the reasons set out above, my final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2022.
