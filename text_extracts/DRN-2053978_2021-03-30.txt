DRN-2053978
The complaint
Mrs B complains about the service she received from Vitality Health Limited when making a 
claim under her private medical insurance policy.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Ive listened to the phone call that took place between Mrs B and Vitality. There was 
a lot of background noise from Vitalitys call centre, and its apparent that Mrs B 
found this to be a distraction. However, the adviser did offer to arrange for a 
colleague to move to a quieter area to speak to her, which I think was reasonable. 
Vitality accepted that Mrs B was caused inconvenience as a result of the background 
noise during the phone call, and offered her Â£30 compensation. Im satisfied that was 
reasonable. 
Mrs B says she wants Vitality to refund all the premiums shes paid since taking out 
the policy. I dont agree that Vitality should do this. Vitality accepted the premiums in 
return for agreeing to pay any valid claims made by Mrs B under the policy, and so I 
see no reason to require it to return those premiums because Mrs B later decided to 
cancel the policy.
For these reasons, I dont uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint, as Im satisfied that Vitality Health 
Limited offered Mrs B suitable compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 April 2021
