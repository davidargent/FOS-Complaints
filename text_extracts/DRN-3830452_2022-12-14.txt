The complaint
Mr R complains about the amount Covea Insurance plc has paid on settlement of a claim 
under a landlords insurance policy. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on providing my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
While Covea made an error in approving the full quote for Mr Rs bathroom remodel, 
this doesnt mean Mr R should benefit from this. 
Under the policy Covea only needs to pay for the items related to replacing the 
accidently damaged shower tray. The fact Mr R chose to update the whole bathroom 
at the same time as undertaking these repairs, was his decision to do so. Although I 
can appreciate Mr R has said the timing of the remodel was, in part, influenced by 
the thought Covea would cover the labour costs of it. 
Covea has currently estimated the labour costs related to the claim but has offered 
to revisit this should Mr R provide accurate measurements of the area concerned; I 
think this is reasonable. 
Covea has offered Â£100 compensation for its error. Im satisfied this adequately 
compensates Mr R for the error it made. 
For these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Rs complaint against Covea Insurance plc. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 January 2023.
