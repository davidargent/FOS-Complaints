K820x#14complaint
Miss C complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA wrongly put limits on her account 
without notice. She says shes  lost sales as a result. Miss C asks for compensation.
background
PayPal put limits on Miss Cs account in March 2019. It said it did this because  the account 
was linked to another  account  which had engaged in restricted  activities.  This was in breach 
of its user agreement.
Miss C raised a complaint. PayPal asked her for ID and other information and restored her 
account at the end of April 2019. Limits were placed on Miss Cs account again  in May 2019, 
which were removed the following day. PayPal  says its taken  steps to avoid  this happening 
again.
PayPal put an unrelated  limitation on Miss Cs account in June 2019  as it detected a risk of 
unauthorised access. Miss C took the required steps and the limit was removed almost 
immediately. 
Miss C asks for compensation  for the difficulties caused by the account being limited on 
several occasions. 
Our investigator didnt  recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She said while the 
limits had caused inconvenience,  PayPal  acted fairly  and within the terms of the account.  
Miss C didnt agree and so the complaint has been  passed to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
Limits were placed on Miss Cs account  in March,  May and June 2019. I have to decide 
whether PayPal acted  fairly and within the terms of its agreement with Miss C.
Miss C said this service doesnt  have  all the information it needs  to reach a decision. 
However, she hasnt provided  further information  or said what  it is she thinks  we should ask 
PayPal for. Having reviewed the available evidence, I think I have enough information to 
reach a fair decision. 
Some of the information provided to us by PayPal contains information  relating to other 
people. Weve explained to Miss C that we cant provide  copies of this information to her. I 
understand Miss Cs frustration about this.
was PayPal entitled to put limits on Miss Cs account?
PayPals user agreement  says customers must not engage in restricted  activities  or have an 
account linked to another account which  has engaged  in restricted activities.  Accounts could 
Ref: DRN75040692be linked  through  personal information,  such as names, address, email address or card 
details. PayPal says Miss Cs account was linked to another account  and provided  evidence 
to support this. 
PayPals user agreement  says it can limit accounts  at any time.  While it says it usually gives 
notice it can limit an account without notice if it considers it reasonable to do so  for 
instance if the customer is in breach of the user agreement. Having an account  linked to an 
account which has engaged in restricted activities is a breach of the user agreement.
I think PayPal was entitled  under the terms of the user agreement  to put limits on 
Miss Cs account without notice.
did PayPal act fairly?
I dont think PayPal acted  unfairly when it put limits on Miss Cs account. It was entitled  to do 
so by the terms of the user agreement  Miss C agreed to these terms when she opened the 
account. Based on the evidence it provided I think it was reasonable for PayPal to think the 
account was linked  to other accounts it had concerns about. 
I understand Miss Cs frustration that she wasnt given enough information to allow  her to 
challenge the link to another account or the restricted activities.  But I dont think PayPal can 
provide this information to Miss C while at the same time meeting its obligations to protect 
the privacy of other people. 
PayPal told Miss C that where  there  are certain  issues outstanding it would place limitations 
on all accounts involved until the situation  is resolved to help prevent abuse. I should make  it 
clear that I dont make any findings here about what happened with the other accounts that 
PayPal found  were linked to Miss Cs account. Ive only looked at whether PayPal dealt fairly 
with Miss Cs account. 
Miss C asked PayPal to review its decision its decision  which  it did. After Miss C raised a 
complaint PayPal asked  Miss C for information to enable a further review. It restored 
Miss Cs account in late April 2019.  It said it did this as an exception.  
In May 2019  PayPals  system again found  links to another  account  and limited Miss Cs 
account. PayPal  restored Miss Cs account the next day and says its taken steps to avoid 
the same  thing happening  again.  
Miss Cs account was limited in June 2019  for a different reason. PayPal was concerned 
about the security  of the account.  Miss C provided  the requested information and the 
account was restored that day.
Miss C says the limits on her account affected her business. I do understand the 
inconvenience this has caused. 
But having  considered the evidence, I dont think PayPal acted unfairly  or outside the terms 
of its user agreement when it put limits on Miss Cs account. It agreed to restore  Miss Cs 
account as an exception and responded quickly when limits were put on the account after 
this. I dont think its fair and reasonable, in the circumstances, to require PayPal to pay 
compensation to Miss C.
Ref: DRN75040693my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 November 2019.
