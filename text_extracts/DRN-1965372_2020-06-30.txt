The complaint
Ms H is complaining about two charges being sought from her by PSA Finance UK 
Limited (PSA) following the return of a car she had possession of under a hire purchase 
agreement (HP agreement) and one that she incurred herself prior to returning the car.
What happened
In September 2016 Ms H entered into a HP agreement with PSA. Under the terms of this 
HP agreement Ms H was obliged to make 36 monthly payments of £141.91 and in the event 
she wanted to keep the car a final monthly payment (in month 37) of £4,671.
In December 2016 Ms H says she telephoned PSA to enquire about increasing her 
mileage and following this conversation PSA sent her a letter dated 20 December 2016 
which said:
Thank you for your recent enquiry regarding increasing your mileage.
If your term mileage is changed to 45,000 your new instalments will be:
33 monthly instalments of £141.91
1 guaranteed future value of £3,805.00
This quote has been calculated to start on the date of your next instalment on 1 
February 2017.
If youd like to accept this change please contact us on [telephone number] or email us 
at [email address]. Please note the mileage on any separate maintenance agreement 
will not be increased as a result of this quote.
If we havent heard from you within ten working days, we'll assume that you dont want 
to go ahead with the above option.
After receiving the above letter Ms H says she did what she was advised to do, and that 
was telephone PSA to accept its change quote. And she followed this up with an email 
dated 30 December 2016 for which she received an automatic reply from PSA.
On 25 January 2017 PSA says that it sent Ms H a modifying agreement for her 
signature and return which confirmed a new monthly payment going forward of £166.42 (not 
£141.91) and a final monthly payment of £3,805.
DRN-1965372Ms H, on the other hand, says she received nothing further from PSA after its 
automatic reply to her email dated 30 December 2016, nor did she expect to. And in the 
absence of receiving anything further from PSA she assumed that her term mileage had 
increased to 45,000, her monthly payments going forward would remain set at £141.91, and 
her final payment  where payable  had been reduced to £3,805.
On 19 June 2019 PSA wrote to Ms H to say her HP agreement was coming to an end.
On 17 July 2019 PSA wrote to Ms H to say that if she wanted to return the car she 
would incur an excess mileage charge of 5p a mile for every mile travelled over 18,000. If 
she returned the car without a MOT test certificate with at least two months to run she 
would incur a charge of £135 and for every damaged wheel trim she would incur a charge of 
£16.
Following receipt of the above Ms H complained to PSA that she had agreed, in late 2016, 
to a mileage increase (from 18,000 to 45,000) and that she had never been advised that 
she would need to ensure the car had a MOT test certificate with at least two months to run 
on its return (to avoid a charge of £135) or that she might be liable for a charge of £16 for 
each and every damaged wheel trim.
On 29 July 2019 PSA acknowledged Ms Hs complaint.
On 5 September 2019 PSA issued Ms H with a final response letter (FRL). In summary 
PSA said that as it hadnt received a modified agreement signed by Ms H (with 33 
monthly instalments of £166.42 being payable) the original agreement stood. However, it 
went on to say that it was prepared to accept £808.83 (33 x (£166.42 - £141.91) from Ms H, 
instead of an excess mileage charge of £1,350 (27,000 miles x 5p) if on the return of the car 
Ms H had travelled no more than 45,000 miles.
Unhappy with PSAs FRL Ms H referred her complaint to our service.
On 8 October 2018 PSA wrote to Ms H seeking payment of:
£64 for damage to four wheel trims
£1,242.85 excess mileage (5p x (42,857  18,000)
 
Ms Hs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
PSA was entitled to seek from her £64 for four damaged wheel trims but not anything for 
excess mileage. He also came to the view that Ms H was obliged, prior to returning the car, 
to pay for the MOT test that she did.
Neither party agreed with the investigators view, so the complaint was passed to me for 
review and decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in May 2020. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In considering what is fair and reasonable, I need to have regard to the relevant law 
and regulations, regulators rules, guidance and standards and codes of practice and 
(where appropriate) what I consider to have been good industry practice at the time.I would also add that where the parties disagree, Ive made my findings on the balance 
of probabilities - in other words, what I think is most likely based on the evidence Ive 
seen and the wider circumstances.
For ease I will address Ms Hs three complaint points separately.
wheel trim damage charges
Its not unusual for a finance provider like PSA to check at the end of an agreement 
that the consumer took reasonable care of the car. And Im satisfied that the HP 
agreement makes provision for PSA to be able to charge for damage that is deemed 
beyond fair wear and tear. Im also satisfied that this is something Ms H would have 
been aware of, or ought to have reasonably been aware of, from the outset.
The trade body that oversees the car rental and leasing sector  the British 
Vehicle Renting and Leasing Renting Association (BVRLA)  has issued guidance 
which outlines what is considered to be fair wear and tear and what is chargeable 
damage. In looking at this type of complaint and deciding whether PSA has acted 
reasonably, I take account of this guidance as I think its a good indicator of what 
damage is fair for a business to charge for.
BVRLA guidance states that in respect of tyres and wheels Dents on wheel rims and 
trims are not acceptable. Scuffs up to 50mm on the total circumference of the wheel 
rim and on alloy wheels are acceptable.
Having regard to the photographs provided by PSA Im satisfied that there was 
chargeable damage to all four wheel trims. And having thought about all the 
circumstances here, Im satisfied that what PSA has charged for this, being £64, is 
reasonable.
Therefore I dont uphold this aspect of Ms Hs complaint.
MOT test cost
Under 5.7 of the HP agreement terms and conditions Ms H agreed:
 [to] ensure that before delivery of the vehicle to [PSA] the vehicle does not require an 
MOT test for at least two months following the date when the final payment is due
Therefore Im satisfied that Ms H was aware of, or ought to have reasonably been 
aware of, that in the event the HP agreement ran its full term she would need, prior to 
returning the car, to have a MOT test undertaken at her own cost.
Therefore I dont uphold this aspect of Ms Hs complaint.
excess mileage charge
Based on what Ive seen Im satisfied that on increasing Ms Hs allowable term 
mileage to 45,000 (from 18,000) it was PSAs intention that Ms H pay it £166.42 a 
month going forward and its 45,000 mile change quote simply contained an error.
 
 Ive come to this conclusion because everything else being equal the greater the 
annual mileage allowance under an HP agreement the greater the required monthly 
payment and the lower the required final payment (the greater monthly payment 
reflecting the greater use the consumer has of the car each month and the 
depreciative effect that usage has on the cars value). And given the content of the 
36,000 mile change quote Ms H received which details an increase in the monthly 
payment required of £18.45 (to £160.36 from £141.91).
So what I now need to decide is whether Ms H should have the benefit of 
travelling substantially more miles than 18,000 at no cost.
In essence what has happened here is that PSA misrepresented the cost to Ms H 
of increasing the term mileage under her HP agreement to 45,000.
But in the case of misrepresentation we think the appropriate remedy isnt to put 
the consumer in the position they would have been in had the misrepresentation been 
correct, but the position the consumer would have been in had the misrepresentation 
not been made.
Now had the misrepresentation not been made and had Ms H been correctly informed 
by PSA that if she wanted a term mileage increase to 45,000 miles she would be 
required to increase her monthly payments by £24.51 to £166.42 (paying an extra 
£808.83 over the remaining HP agreement term) she would have done one of two 
things.
 Elected to remain on a term mileage of 18,000 and pay 5p a mile for each 
mile travelled in excess of 18,000 at the end of the term.
 Elected to switch to a term mileage of 45,000 and pay £24.51 a month extra 
for 33 months.
Now if Ms H had elected to do the first of the above two options she would be in the 
same position as she ultimately found herself in, this being faced with an excess 
mileage charge of £1,242.85 but having faced no increase in her monthly payments. 
And if Ms H had elected to do the second of the above two options she would now be 
in the position of facing no excess mileage charge but having faced £808.83 in extra 
monthly payments.
Now I cant say for certain. But on the balance of probabilities Im satisfied that had the 
position not been misrepresented to Ms H she would have elected for the second 
option above. And therefore the fairest remedy is for PSA to reduce what its seeking 
from Ms H for excess mileage to £808.83 from £1,242.85.
However, I think that this whole matter has caused Ms H a degree of distress 
and inconvenience for which she should also be fairly compensated for. And taking 
everything into account I think that reducing the above sum of £808.83 by £150 to 
£658.83 represents an appropriate thing for PSA to do in this respect.
Ms H responded to say that she didnt agree with my provisional decision. As well as 
reiterating and expanding on her previous submissions she said, in summary:
My statement that On 25 January 2017 PSA says that it sent Ms H a modifying 
agreement for her signature and return which confirmed a new monthly payment 
going forward of £166.42 (not £141.91) and a final monthly payment of £3,805 is 
wrong.PSA hasnt confirmed or acknowledged that the two quotations provided to her in 
December 2016 (one for 36,000 miles and one for 45,000) were wrong or what the 
total value at the end of the agreement would have been in the case of £166.42.
Although she never received PSAs modifying agreement, which PSA says was sent 
out on 25 January 2017, she has since seen a letter of the same date that quotes the 
same figures of £141.91 (for 33 months) and one final payment of £3,805 as she 
received in December 2016.
Had she received the modifying agreement (and on the assumption it was sent under 
cover of the latter dated 25 January 2017 she has now had sight of, and on the 
assumption it contained figures of £141.91 (for 33 months) and one final payment of 
£3,805) she would have signed and returned it. And had she done so it surely follows 
that PSA would have agreed to stand by it.
She followed PSAs instructions and confirmed her acceptance of the 45,000 mile 
quote as provided to her in December 2016 by both phone and email, none of which 
PSA have noted in its records.
Ive failed to consider that had there not been a misrepresentation a third option was 
open to her (one she would have elected to take). And this would have been 
remaining on the original September 2016 HP agreement terms and ensuring she 
travelled no more than 18,000 miles.
She should be fairly compensated more than £150 for the distress and 
inconvenience she has suffered.
She shouldnt have to bear the cost for the MOT test because she was never given, 
nor did she agree to, the HP agreement terms and conditions which PSA are relying 
on in this respect. In particular the copy of the HP agreement terms and conditions 
provided by PSA doesnt bear her signature in the box which says:
 
oThis box only applies if you have signed this agreement at a dealership using 
a tablet or similar device (i.e. not a printed copy)
 
Notwithstanding she was denied the chance of replacing the four wheel trims herself, 
£64 is excessive when four replacements can be readily sourced for £24.
 
PSA responded to say it had no further evidence to submit for my consideration.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
However, having done so, Im not persuaded to change my provisional findings and 
decision. However, I make the following comments by way of expansion and for the sake of 
clarity.
In my provisional decision I said that On 25 January 2017 PSA says that it sent Ms H a 
modifying agreement for her signature and return which confirmed a new monthly payment 
going forward of £166.42 (not £141.91) and a final monthly payment of £3,805. 
 
 I stand by this statement because this is indeed what PSA told our service. This statement 
also needs to be read, not in isolation, but with the statement that immediately followed 
which said:
Ms H, on the other hand, says she received nothing further from PSA after its 
automatic reply to her email dated 30 December 2016, nor did she expect to.
Ms H says that PSA hasnt confirmed or acknowledged that the two quotations provided in 
December 2016 were wrong, or what the final payment (or guaranteed future value) would 
have been under a correct 45,000 mile quote. However I disagree.
But for the avoidance of doubt I can confirm that PSA has told our service that the 36,000 
mile quote was correct in its entirety and that the 45,000 mile quote was wrong in one 
respect. That is the final payment (or guaranteed value) was correctly quoted at £3,805 but 
the 33 monthly payments should have been quoted at £166.42 and not £141.91.
Ive looked at the letter dated 25 January 2017 provided by Ms H following my provisional 
decision. And having done so Im satisfied that this is the letter PSA says it sent Ms H, 
together with a modified agreement for signing and returning.
Now I accept that this letter makes reference to figures of £141.91 (for 33 months) and one 
final payment of £3,805, in line with the December 2016 quote Ms H received. But Im not 
persuaded that this letter is sufficient for me to change my mind about this complaint.
Firstly this letter makes reference to two enclosed agreements which I havent seen sight of. 
And having not seen sight of them I cant conclude with any certainty what figures were in 
them, ie £141.91 (for 33 months) and £3,805 or £166.42 (for 33 months) and £3,805. 
But in any event, Ms H says she never received this letter in 2017 so it follows she couldnt 
and didnt rely on its contents.
Ms H suggests that had she signed and returned a modifying agreement in 2017 that 
contained figures of £141.91 (for 33 months) and £3,805 then surely PSA would have stood 
by those terms. Now I understand the point Ms H is making here but I see no need to 
comment on what is a hypothetical scenario.
I accept that PSA hasnt noted in its records Ms Hs telephone call and email of 
December 2016, following receipt by her of its December 2016 45,000 mile quote. But this 
isnt material to my consideration of this complaint because I accept that Ms H did indeed 
call and email PSA as she submits.
I accept that Ms H could have elected to take a third option had there been no 
misrepresentation. But Im not persuaded that she would have done so. I say this because 
by making the enquires of PSA that she did, Ms H clearly envisaged a need, or at least had 
a desire, to be able to travel more than 18,000 miles over the term of her HP agreement. 
Furthermore, Ms H doesnt say what she would have done instead of using the car to travel 
the miles she ultimately did, or what the cost of these alternatives might have been. So I 
remain of the view that taking everything into account Ms H, on the balance of probabilities, 
would have elected to increase her allowable mileage to 45,000 miles at an additional cost 
(over the term of the HP agreement) of £808.83.
 I accept that Ms H has suffered a degree of distress and inconvenience as a result of what 
has happened in this case. But I remain of the view that £150 represents an appropriate sum 
for PSA to have to pay in this respect.
Ms H says she shouldnt have to bear the cost of the MOT test she had done because she 
never saw, nor did she ever agree to be bound by, the HP agreement terms and conditions 
PSA are relying on in this respect. However I disagree.
First the HP agreement terms and conditions provided by PSA is a master template copy of 
what PSA says was provided to Ms H, not a copy of the actual document she was provided 
with, so I wouldnt expect to see Ms Hs signature in the box she refers to. Secondly, Im 
satisfied that I can rely on the master template copy as being an accurate reflection of what 
PSA says Ms H was provided with. So what I now need to decide is whether Ms H was 
provided with the relevant HP agreement terms and conditions that PSA are looking to rely 
on.
Ms H doesnt dispute that she signed the September 2016 HP agreement that has been 
provided to our service. And having reconsidered this document I can see that Ms H signed 
to say, amongst other things, that:
At the time of signing, pages setting out the Terms and Conditions relating to this 
agreement are attached
and;
You have been given a Pre-Contract document and a complete copy of this agreement
So given the above I thinks its entirely reasonable to conclude that Ms H had sight of, and 
agreed to be bound by, the HP agreement terms and conditions. Furthermore, had Ms H not 
had sight of the HP agreement terms and conditions Im of the view, based on what she has 
said and submitted, that on the balance of probabilities she wouldnt have signed the HP 
agreement. Therefore I think that its entirely fair and reasonable that Ms H bear the cost of 
the MOT test she had done prior to the cars return.
Its not in dispute that Ms H didnt replace the wheel trims prior to the cars return. But Im not 
persuaded she was denied the opportunity of doing so. I would also add that just because 
Ms H says four wheel trims can be sourced for £24 means that PSA was wrong to charge 
£64 for the same.  
First, and as I said in my provisional decision, Im satisfied that PSA was entitled to charge 
for four wheel trims. Secondly, my role is to consider whether what PSA has charged is 
reasonable, not whether its charge is the cheapest. And although I understand what Ms H 
says on this particular point I remain of the view that £64 isnt an unreasonable sum for PSA 
to seek recovery of for four damaged wheel trims.
 
 
 
 
 My final decision
My final decision is that PSA Finance UK Limited can seek from Ms H recovery of the 
following two charges:
Wheel trim damage £64.00
Excess mileage £658.83
However, I would remind PSA Finance UK Limited of its obligations to treat Ms H 
positively and sympathetically if, when trying to collect the above, it becomes apparent Ms H 
is in financial difficulties and that it should give Ms H reasonable time to make payment of 
the above two sums before recording any adverse information in respect of the same with 
credit reference agencies.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2020.
