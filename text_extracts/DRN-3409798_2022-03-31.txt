The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that Barclays Bank UK PLC wont refund money he lost from his personal 
account as part of a scam. 
What happened
In March 2019, a series of payments were made from Mr Ss personal account as a 
result of Mr Ss involvement with a fraudulent broker, Get Financial. 
Mr S accepts he made the first payments  totalling £30,000  thinking it was a good 
investment. But after he was warned by Barclays about an attempted £75,000 
payment, he became suspicious of the company, and he tried to get his money back. 
Mr S said he was on the phone with Get Financial for a long time and they asked for 
some of his personal information to withdraw his money, as well as using remote 
access software on his computer. 
After this call, Mr S discovered there had been debit card transactions to various 
trading platforms, as well as two online banking payments. 
Mr S disputed these with Barclays, who didnt refund them. Unhappy, Mr S brought 
his concerns to us. 
In March 2022, I contacted both sides to explain why I thought Mr Ss complaint 
should be upheld. In summary:
oI thought it was reasonable to say that Mr S authorised the debit card 
transactions according to the Payment Services Regulations 2017. But that 
there were points where Barclays shouldve intervened and I believed this 
wouldve prevented some of Mr Ss losses. 
oSo I said Barclays should refund these, with a 20% deduction to reflect that 
Mr S was also partly to blame. 
oI thought the faster payments made using Mr Ss online banking were likely 
unauthorised payments. So I said Barclays should refund these in full. 
oGiven the significant stress caused by Barclays not stepping in and not 
refunding these sooner, I said it should pay £500 to reflect Mr Ss pain and 
suffering. 
Mr S didnt add anything further. Barclays replied. They broadly accepted what I said, 
but they didnt agree with the 20% deduction for Mr Ss contributory negligence  
saying it should be 50% instead. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered Barclays points about why the redress should be reduced further to reflect 
Mr Ss contributory negligence. Theyve pointed out how there was a warning on the 
Financial Conduct Authoritys website before Mr S invested and how he sounded unsure 
about the company when he spoke to Barclays. 
I agree with Barclays that these things mean Mr S is partly to blame, but I dont think it 
warrants a 50% reduction. In saying that, Ive balanced that he couldve done more to 
research Get Financial before making his initial investment. But that Barclays not only didnt 
always intervene at the appropriate times, but later, when Mr S was persuaded to stop 
investing, Barclays suggested he remain in touch with the fraudulent company to get his 
money back. And it was this later interaction that resulted in a lot of Mr Ss losses. 
Making a deduction for contributory negligence isnt an exact science. And to be clear, its 
distinct to the Contingent Reimbursement Model, which is a voluntary code and not 
applicable in this case. So, in all the circumstances, Im satisfied 20% fairly reflects how Mr S 
shares some blame for what happened. 
Given that neither side has added anything further in response to the rest of my initial 
thoughts on this case, I see no reason to depart from them. For completeness, Ive 
explained the basis of my findings again. 
Its not disputed that Mr S was the victim of a scam involving Get Financial. So Ive started 
by considering what payments he authorised. Broadly, the starting position is that Mr S is 
liable for payments he authorised and Barclays are liable for unauthorised payments. 
The online banking payments from 8 and 12 March 2019
Its accepted Mr S authorised two payments  for £10,000 and £20,000  thinking it was for 
a legitimate investment. 
The card payments from 25 March 2019
Ive considered whether Mr S authorised the card payments and so, whether he gave his 
consent to the transactions as per the Payment Services Regulations 2017. The details of 
what happened arent clear, but Mr S said he was trying to get his original investment back  
this involved a long call with Get Financial, involving remote access. 
I think its likely Mr S was guided through setting up online wallets  he consistently said he 
provided ID, which tends to be used for account opening checks, and that he was told they 
needed to use offshore wallets to facilitate his withdrawal. 
I also think its likely he shared his card details and understood that Get Financial were using 
these details to make payments to his wallets. Thats considering the call recording from this 
date where Mr S confirms a payment to AAA Trade. 
So, Im persuaded that most people would have understood and, indeed, that Mr S did know 
that his actions meant someone else could authorise payments using his card. So I think its 
fair that Barclays treated these as authorised payments.Thats not to say Mr S wanted all these payments to be made or that he fully appreciated the 
extent of them. From experience, I think its likely this happened under the guise that he 
needed to make a further investment to withdraw his funds, or that he needed to pay taxes 
or a commission. But, in accordance with the PSRs, Mr S didnt know the details of each 
payment  it was enough that he knew they were making payments from his account. 
The online banking payments on 26 March 2019
Ive considered the online banking payments separately. Again, the circumstances of these 
payments arent clear. But I have noted theres a call from that day where Mr S says that 
when money was being transferred into his account, he had to go onto his online banking 
and use his PIN sentry device. 
So I think its likely that the fraudsters used this opportunity to set up the payments and 
convinced Mr S to share the required security information under the guise he was receiving 
money. So, I dont think he consented to payments and, unlike the card payments, I dont 
think his actions meant he understood, or that he ought to have understood, that Get 
Financial could authorise payments through his online banking. After all, he wasn't aware 
that any money was leaving his account. It follows that I consider the online banking 
payments were unauthorised.
Were the transactions out of character or unusual, or were there other signs that might 
indicate Mr S was at risk of financial harm? 
In line with the PSRs, the starting position is that Mr S is liable for the payments he 
authorised. But it remains that Barclays should fairly and reasonably have had systems in 
place to look out for out of character or unusual transactions, or other signs that might 
indicate Mr S was at risk of fraud.
Ive noted that Barclays intervened on the first payment and he was referred to branch. The 
notes suggest they confirmed the payment was genuinely made by Mr S, but theres nothing 
to suggest they questioned him about what the payment was for  something Id expect 
given their obligations to protect him from financial harm. If they had, I think its unlikely Mr S 
wouldve made the payment. Indeed, when Barclays intervened later and warned Mr S about 
a £75,000 payment, he didnt go ahead with it based on his doubts.
With appropriate intervention, I dont think Mr S wouldve made another investment  and its 
possible to say that the scam wouldnt have unfolded at all. However, Ive gone on to 
consider the card payments from 25 March 2019 separately. Thats on the basis that this 
started from something new, so its likely too remote to say that Barclays original mistake 
caused it.
Looking at the card payments, I think Barclays ought to have been concerned from the fourth 
payment. Ive considered:
It was an international payment;
It followed several other international payments that happened within ten minutes;
The amount, $7,500, was higher than Mr Ss regular spending, particularly given the 
cumulative spend in ten minutes (this payment wouldve amounted to $17,500 that 
day);
Barclays had recently spoken with Mr S, who said he was concerned hed been the 
victim of a scam.Based on these circumstances, I think Barclays shouldve stepped in. Had they called Mr S 
and asked about the payments, I think they wouldve prevented further losses. Thats 
because Im confident Mr S wouldve explained how he wanted to get his investment back 
(as he consistently told Barclays later that day). So I think Barclays couldve warned him that 
any payment he was making, or information he was sharing, was likely a continuation of the 
scam.
Its logical this wouldve also stopped the online banking payments that took place later that 
day. But either way, given my finding that these were unauthorised, I dont think Mr S is 
liable. In saying this, Im not persuaded Mr S failed with gross negligence. He was anxious to 
get his money back and I dont think its implausible that someone might need to approve 
large payments coming into their account. Im also mindful that its likely Get Financial 
manipulated his screen, so that he wouldnt have seen any payment details (I think this 
would also explain why Mr S didn't notice any money was missing, and why he thought 
money had been paid in). It follows that I dont think Mr S fell so far below what a reasonable 
person wouldve done that he failed with gross negligence. So under the PSRs 2017, I think 
Barclays are liable for these online banking payments. 
Did Mr S act reasonably in the circumstances? 
While I dont think Mr S failed with gross negligence, I have still considered whether he 
should bear some responsibility for his loss. In the circumstances, I think he shouldve done 
more to look into who he was dealing with before making online banking transfers to invest  
after all, it was clear when he spoke with Barclays that he wasnt sure about them. Ive also 
considered his actions in trying to get his money back. Im mindful that he handed over 
information to people that hed clearly had concerns about. But Im also conscious that the 
staff member from Barclays suggested that he stay he in contact with Get Financial to get 
his investment back, and to be careful to not suggest he was suspicious. So, in the 
circumstances, I think its fair to deduct 20% to reflect Mr Ss contributory negligence.
Putting things right
Ive put together the following table setting out what my findings mean for how Barclays must 
settle this:

26/03/2019 Card Payment £3,904.97 Yes, based on successful 20%This totals £170,777.65. Barclays should deduct any money Mr S received back, which I 
understand was £37,809.43, making the total refund £132,968.22. Mr S hasnt had use of 
these funds. So Barclays should also pay 8% simple interest from the respective dates of 
loss to the date of refund (less any tax lawfully deductible). 
While Mr S shares some blame in what happened, it remains that Barclays shouldve 
refunded this sooner and that caused him considerable stress. So I also award £500 for his 
pain and suffering.
 
Payments from Mr Ss business account
To be clear, this decision has only considered payments from Mr Ss personal account. As 
his business account concerns a limited company  a separate legal entity  we will need to 
consider this as a separate complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mr Ss complaint. Barclays Bank UK PLC must put
