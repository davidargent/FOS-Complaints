K820x#14complaint
Mr A complains that PayPal Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) wont  refund a number of transactions  
that he says he didnt make or authorise.
background
Mr A disputes a number  of transactions, which were taken from his PayPal account in 
January and February 2018, as follows:
date time of payment method amount  
30 January  2018 19:49:33 mobile  login £50
30 January  2018 20:08:36 mobile  login £27
30 January  2018 20:40:28 mobile  login £30
30 January 2018 21:45:56 mobile  login £100
31 January 2018 09:31:08 mobile  login £40
31 January 2018 10:39:12 web login £100
31 January 2018 13:21:17 web login £10
31 January 2018 13:23:58 web login £50
31 January 2018 14:13:17 mobile  login £50
31 January 2018 14:44:39 mobile  login £50
1 February 2018 11:14:29 web login £50
He says that he doesnt recognise the transactions and he hasnt authorised anyone else to 
use his account.  He would like PayPal to refund them.
PayPal investigated  and decided not to refund the transactions.  It felt that Mr A had most 
likely to have authorised them because it couldnt find any evidence  to show  that a third 
party had accessed his account  and the same internet  provider (IP) address was used  to 
make the transactions and to report the fraud.
Our investigator didnt  think the complaint should be upheld. In summary, he felt, on the 
balance of all the evidence, that Mr A authorised the transactions.
Mr A disagreed and asked for his complaint  to be reviewed  by an ombudsman,  so it has now 
been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, my review of the evidence  has led me to the same overall conclusions as 
the investigator previously  set out and for much the same reasons.
Generally, PayPal can hold Mr A liable for the disputed items  if the evidence  suggests that 
he most likely  made or authorised them himself.  The relevant regulations,  to this effect, are 
the Payment Services  Regulations 2017 (the PSRs  2017). 
PayPals user agreement  also requires its customers to keep their PayPal ID and/or 
password/PIN safe. It will also hold its customers liable  if they deliberately enable a third

caused by failure  with intent or gross  negligence to comply with their obligations.
Mr A says he didnt authorise or make the payments and he is seeking a refund. So my 
primary concern is to come  to a view about whether or I not I think  Mr A made or authorised 
the payments.  
From what  Ive seen, I dont think its unreasonable for PayPal to conclude that Mr A made 
or authorised the transactions. This is because:
The disputed transactions were made  from the same  IP addresses and devices (phone 
and computer) that Mr A has used numerous times.
Theres no evidence to show that a third party had access to Mr As computer or mobile 
device.
Theres no convincing explanation for how a third party could  have known Mr As PayPal 
login details. Mr A has said that he doesnt keep a written  record of them  and he hasnt  
given them to anyone.
Its unlikely that an unauthorised third party would spread the pattern of spending out 
over three days. If they dont know the account holder I would expect to see them  spend 
as much money spent  as quickly  as possible.
Taking everything into account,  I find, on balance, that Mr A authorised  the disputed  
transactions. It follows that PayPal is entitled to hold him liable for them.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 September  2019.
