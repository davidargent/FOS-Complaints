The complaint
Ms J has complained PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has levied incorrect fees on her 
account. This has led her to suffer business losses.
What happened
Ms J operated as a sole trader in the name of M. Ill use her name throughout for ease 
although the PayPal account thats the subject of this complaint is in Ms name.
Ms J brought a complaint to the ombudsman service in December 2019. She was concerned 
at the difficulties shed had in getting answers out of PayPal about Ms account. Her analysis 
of charges and fees throughout 2018 and 2019 didnt match what she believed shed been 
charged. Despite numerous attempts to tackle PayPal about what had happened, she wasnt 
able to get them to engage. She believed their fees were opaque and dubious as there was 
no clear data for her to access. She felt this was all because PayPal enjoyed a monopoly 
position which allowed them to charge what they wished.
At that time PayPal felt theyd not had an opportunity to properly interrogate Ms Js 
complaint. They wrote to her advising her how to access account data. They received no 
response.
Initially our investigator upheld Ms Js complaint. She asked PayPal to refund certain fees 
relating to currency exchange and chargebacks as well as pay Ms J £200 compensation. 
PayPal then provided information about their charges which included Ms monthly 
statements for the period of the complaint.  
After further analysis of more than 200 pages of data, our investigator confirmed she didnt 
think PayPal had over-charged Ms account. She was concerned that PayPal hadnt 
answered Ms Js original queries in 2019 so asked them to pay her £200 compensation.
Ms J was dismayed as the whole issue had caused real harm to her business. PayPal also 
disagreed that £200 was fair compensation. Our investigator re-considered her view in light 
of both parties comments. She believed £100 was fairer overall.
Although PayPal accepted this resolution, Ms J remained unhappy. Her complaint has been 
referred to an ombudsman for decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ill explain why Ive reached the decision I have.
Im aware that Ive summarised this complaint above in far less detail than either of the two 
parties and Ive done so using my own words. Im not going to respond to every single point 
made by Ms J. No discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on what I think are 
the key issues here. 
Our rules allow me to do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as a free 
alternative to the courts. If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive ignored 
it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual argument to be able to 
reach what I think is the right outcome.
Ive taken account of the PayPal user agreement which applies to Ms account; the detailed 
submissions from Ms J and PayPal and the views completed by our investigator.
Firstly its worth stating that its not our role to conduct a forensic analysis of charges. We do 
though consider evidence that either party disputes. Id also add that were also not in a 
position to consider the level of charges being levied. Businesses have the right to decide 
the level of their charges and that depends on their position in a competitive marketplace. 
However they do have to apply them fairly and Ive considered that aspect when looking at 
Ms account.
From what Ive seen of the data and web links provided by PayPal, Ms J had all the data 
eventually sent to her to consider whether the charges shed paid matched what she 
believed was right. 
Ms J agreed with our investigator what charges she believed were wrong. Our investigator 
provided a detailed rundown of all these in her view of 21 May 2020. Ive also conducted my 
own review of the data supplied by both Ms J and PayPal. These cover two years worth of 
chargebacks and disputes and currency exchange fees.
Im not going to go into the detail of the analysis of the fees  partly because as I say above 
its not our role to carry out a forensic analysis and also because Ms J hasnt provided us 
with evidence to show why her calculations are correct. However I have considered the 
detail and having reviewed these, I believe overall the charges levied on Ms account are in 
line with PayPals user agreement. Ive not seen any evidence that her charges have been 
miscalculated.
I can understand why Ms J felt thwarted in trying to understand the charges levied on Ms 
account. It did indeed take some time to get PayPal to clarify how she could access all the 
data she needed. However when that was done, from what I can see, all the information is 
available for Ms J to work out how her charges were calculated.
Putting things right
I agree that asking PayPal to pay Ms J £100 for the problems she had with Ms account is 
fair and reasonable.
I know Ms J thinks this is inadequate. Shes told us of the problems she had with being able 
to run M as an ongoing concern which she blames on PayPal. She has told us her business 
lost £15,000 but shes not provided any further evidence how this can be attributable to 
PayPal. Im also aware that Ms J still holds an account with PayPal.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is to instruct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to 
pay Ms J £100 for the inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms J to accept or reject my decision before 27 May 2021.
