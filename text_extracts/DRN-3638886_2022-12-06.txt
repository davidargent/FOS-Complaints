The complaint
Miss J complains that Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money (118 118) 
approved loans for her that she couldnt afford to repay.
What happened
Miss J was approved for two loans by 118 118, as follows:
Loan Opened Amount Term Repayments Total
1 7/12/2019 £2,000 24 months £122.91 £2,949.84
2 20/6/2020 £2,667.07 24 months £161.39 £3,873.36
Miss J told us she didnt feel either of the loans were affordable for her.
118 118 disagreed. They explained that theyd asked Miss J about her income and 
expenditure before they provided each loan. Theyd also considered information from her 
credit file and had used statistical information to validate the expenditure Miss J claimed. 
Having done that they explained that they found no reason to suggest the loans were 
unaffordable for Miss J.
Our adjudicator agreed with 118 118 and didnt think there was evidence the loans had been 
unaffordable. But Miss J was still dissatisfied. She explained that 118 118 had suggested 
theyd call her before approving either of the loans and if they had they would have realised 
together that the loans werent affordable. She said 118 118 simply approved the loans and 
therefore didnt complete adequate checks.
The complaint has therefore been referred to me, an ombudsman, for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to considering complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending is set 
out on our website. Ive had that approach in mind when considering whats fair and 
reasonable here.
Loan 1
I dont think 118 118 completed reasonable and proportionate checks before approving this 
loan. I say that because the credit file they reviewed showed them that Miss J had been 
declared bankrupt in June 2017 and although it appeared from her credit file that her position 
was improving, she had made several new credit applications in the last six months and her 
revolving credit was close to being fully utilised. 
I think 118 118 should have done more to establish if the loan they were providing was 
affordable. That could have been by calling Miss J as shes suggested they promised to do. 
They didnt need to ask for bank statements, but I think in the absence of any other 
information bank statements are the best way to establish what 118 118 would have found if 
theyd asked for more information about Miss Js income and expenditure.
I asked Miss J for bank statements for the period ahead of the loan application and shes 
been able to provide a statement from her main account for the month before the 
application. On that limited information I dont think there is anything to suggest the first loan 
was unaffordable. The statement shows Miss Js income was in line with what shed told 118 
118 and was about £3,500 net per month. Her outgoings to things like phone, broadband, 
loans, car expenses, TV, utilities, and insurance were about £1,100 per month. Theres no 
evidence from the statement, that Miss J was incurring other significant expenses that would 
suggest she didnt have enough disposable income to afford the £122.91 loan repayments 
she would be asked to pay.
So, I dont think loan 1 was irresponsibly provided.
Loan 2
118 118 completed similar checks when they approved the second loan and I think, at that 
point, that the checks were proportionate. The credit file suggested Miss Js financial position 
was continuing to improve. There were no defaulted accounts in the previous 12 months; 
she was only utilising about 50% of the credit available to her on revolving credit; and there 
had been no missed payments on her credit agreements in the last 12 months. Miss J had 
reported she was still benefitting from an income of about £3,500 and hadnt changed the 
expenditure details shed provided to the business. I dont think the business therefore 
needed to complete any further checks such as those that may have been achieved through 
a call with Miss J.
I think having reviewed that information it was fair for the business to consider that the 
second loan was affordable for Miss J and I dont therefore think the lending was 
irresponsible.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2023.
