The complaint
Mr P complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has blocked his account access.
What happened
Mr P says he has been unable to access his PayPal account for some time and told it about 
the issue when it took place. He says his partner transferred £75 into his account which he 
has been unable to access which led to a late payment fee of £38. Mr P says he has 
repeatedly asked PayPal to sort out the problem, but it took some months before he was 
able to access the account. He would like compensation of about £200 and says he has lost 
work as a result of not having a working PayPal account.
PayPal says it adjusted Mr Ps account settings to allow him access in March 2021 but says 
it was required to increase the security settings. It accepts it didnt deal appropriately with 
part of this complaint and has paid Mr P £100 compensation. PayPal says Mr P had used 
the account on a limited basis and hadnt used it for work payments in the past.
Mr P brought his complaint to us and our investigator said that he couldnt be sure what 
caused the issue and couldnt hold PayPal responsible for what took place. The investigator 
thought PayPal had paid an appropriate compensation amount of £100 for problems 
accessing the £75. He also explained that we could only consider the impact on Mr P and 
not on his partner.
Mr P doesnt accept that view and in summary says PayPal ought to have sorted matters out 
far earlier and says he lost two sales as the buyers wouldnt pay money into his partners 
account.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Having done so I have come to the overall view that PayPal has paid a fair and reasonable 
compensation amount of £100 and I dont require it do anything further in the circumstances 
of this complaint. I appreciate Mr P will be disappointed by my decision and I accept he will 
have unanswered questions about what caused this problem.
I dont think it possible to be sure what caused Mr Ps account problems. I can see that 
PayPal in March 2021 adjusted Mr Ps account settings to allow temporary access, but I 
accept Mr P had by that stage had access difficulties for some time. I also dont think it clear 
why PayPal didnt try and help Mr P earlier. But Im satisfied PayPal did try and help Mr P in 
March 2021 and has paid what I think is a fair and reasonable compensation award of £100.
Im satisfied that award fairly takes into account that Mr P was unable to access a relatively 
small balance in circumstances where I have made clear that I cant be sure why there was 
an access problem. I appreciate Mr P says he was unable to earn money as a result of the 
access problem. I dont think it cleat why Mr P and his partner say that or that they have 
explained why other payment methods couldnt be used. I dont think it clear why a legitimate 
payment into Mr Ps partners account would raise tax difficulties as they say, if the payment 
was clearly for Mr Ps work.
Overall, I accept there were delays here in sorting the issues out but Im satisfied PayPal 
has paid appropriate compensation and has tried to help Mr P. I cant fairly ask PayPal to 
compensate Mr P for the lost sales for the reasons I have explained or ask it to increase the 
compensation offer. I can see that Mr P can now access the account
Putting things right
PayPal say it has paid £100 compensation. If that is not the case, then it should do.
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has paid a fair and reasonable 
compensation award of £100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 August 2021.
