The complaint
Miss O is complaining about irresponsible lending by NewDay Ltd.
What happened
In March 2016, Miss O applied for a credit card with NewDay. Her application was 
successful and NewDay initially set a £100 credit limit. 
In June 2016, NewDay increased Miss Os credit limit to £900, and in November 2018 they 
increased it again, to £1,500. Both times, NewDay wrote to Miss O offering the credit limit 
increase and giving her the opportunity to opt out.
In March 2019, Miss O told NewDay she was experiencing financial difficulties because of a 
reduction in her income. NewDay completed an income and expenditure assessment and 
agreed a nominal payment plan for Miss O to repay her debt. In September 2019, after 
Miss O had missed several of the payments due under the agreed payment plan, NewDay 
defaulted Miss Os account and sold it to a debt collection agency.
Miss O complained to NewDay. She felt that theyd been irresponsible when they gave her 
the credit card, and both times they increased her credit limit. But NewDay said theyd 
carried out relevant checks when she first applied, and before each credit limit increase. 
They said they were confident theyd offered the credit card and credit limit increases 
correctly.
As Miss O was still unhappy she brought her complaint to our service. She complained that 
she was given the credit card and credit limit increases without relevant checks being made. 
She said this resulted in a default on her credit file and has caused her financial hardship 
due to the charges for being over her credit limit. Miss O also mentioned that the issue has 
exacerbated her mental health conditions.
Our investigator looked at Miss Os complaint. He thought NewDay had acted fairly in 
offering Miss O the credit card in the first place. And he thought NewDay had treated Miss O 
fairly once shed told them about her financial difficulties in March 2019. But he didnt think 
they should have increased Miss Os credit limit either in June 2016 or November 2018. His 
primary reason for this was that Miss O had been over her credit limit for much of the time 
she had the credit card. Our investigator thought NewDay should remove the default from 
Miss Os credit file, and refund all interest and charges she paid after the credit limit was 
increased. 
Miss O accepted our investigators view. But NewDay didnt. They said that being over her 
credit limit isnt on its own an indicator of financial difficulties  and they said theyd checked 
the affordability of both credit limit increases for Miss O. They asked for an ombudsmans 
decision.
I issued a provisional decision on 9 March 2021. In that decision I said I wasnt minded to 
uphold Miss Os complaint. I felt that shed fallen into financial difficulties primarily because 
of a change in circumstances rather than because of NewDays lending decisions. 
In summary, my provisional decision said:
Whats required of NewDay
The Financial Conduct Authoritys (FCAs) consumer credit sourcebook (CONC) sets 
out the rules about the sort of things lenders need to consider before they lend 
money to an individual. The rules were updated in November 2018 so Ive looked at 
both sets of rules. In essence, both before and after November 2018, the rules 
required a lender to make proportionate checks to ensure that a customer would be 
able to meet repayments in a sustainable way, without incurring financial difficulties.
Initial application for credit card
In Miss Os application for the credit card, she said she had gross annual income of 
£16,000 and other household income of £6,000. Her credit file showed no negative 
markers, and £200 in unsecured debt. I said I felt NewDay had carried out a 
proportionate assessment and it was reasonable for them to assume in that context 
that a credit limit of £100 was affordable for Miss O.
First credit limit increase  June 2016
At the time of her first credit limit increase, Miss O had been over her credit limit twice 
and withdrawn cash on her credit card  both potential indicators of financial 
difficulties. So I felt that NewDays checks needed to be more thorough. NewDay 
said theyd have looked at various risk factors and would have checked the cost of 
credit against an estimate of Miss Os disposable income  but they hadnt provided 
evidence of those checks. 
Because I couldnt see that NewDay had done the checks, I looked at Miss Os bank 
statements to see if the credit limit increase would likely have been affordable for her. 
I could see Miss Os income was around £1,700 per month, and I estimated her 
necessary spending was around £850 per month. So I felt she had around £850 in 
disposable income, which was more than enough to sustainably repay the £900 
credit limit.
Second credit limit increase  November 2018
NewDay used a model which estimated Miss Os disposable income at £800 per 
month in November 2018. The risk data suggested a high confidence in her income 
and fairly low risk overall.  I dont think NewDay had any reason to believe the data 
wouldnt apply to Miss O - so I thought it was fair for them to use this statistical data.
I thought about the reduction in benefits that caused Miss Os reduction in income. I 
thought this was reasonably foreseeable for Miss O but I didnt think shed told 
NewDay that part of her income was related to the age of her children so I didnt think 
it was fair for NewDay to anticipate the reduction in income when looking at 
affordability.
I also thought about the other factors that might have influenced NewDays 
assessment. Miss O had two county court judgments against her, and had 
significantly more other debt in November 2018 than shed had in June 2016. Shed 
also been over her credit limit multiple times between June 2016 and November 2018. But on the other hand, she hadnt missed any payments, and her use of the 
credit card for cash withdrawals had reduced significantly.
Taking everything into account, I felt it was appropriate for NewDay to apply some 
caution to their assessment of the affordability of the credit limit for Miss O. But I felt 
that Id done this by assuming her disposable income was only 80% of the estimated 
£800, i.e. £640. I said this amount would have been enough for Miss O to make 
sustainable repayments across all her debts. 
So I thought NewDay had done enough checks before offering the November 2018 
credit limit increase  and I thought the outcome of the checks was fair based on the 
information NewDay had available to them.
Financial difficulties - March 2019
I could see NewDay wrote to Miss O as soon as she told them she was having 
trouble making repayments. The letter explained that theyd be able to come to a 
repayment arrangement once Miss O had completed the income and expenditure 
form, and it suggested some charities Miss O might benefit from speaking to.
Once Miss O had returned the income and expenditure form, NewDay allowed her to 
make payments of £1 per month for six months and then no payments for three 
months. And they didnt charge her any interest during this time. I can see NewDay 
warned her that her account might be passed to a collection agency  and that it 
might be defaulted if she didnt make the agreed payments in line with her plan. So I 
said I thought New Day had treated Miss O fairly  I didnt think there was much 
more they could have done to help her.
Miss O and NewDay replied to my provisional decision. NewDay had no further comments 
but Miss O wasnt happy. In summary she said that NewDay should have been aware she 
wasnt able to manage her credit because of the number of times she was over her credit 
limit and because of the cash withdrawals. On top of this, she noted the CCJs shed had as 
a result of not repaying payday loans. She also mentioned that her credit file showed two 
accounts as being in default after NewDay had passed the account to a debt collection 
agency.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Although I appreciate itll be disappointing for Miss O, Im still not upholding her complaint. 
Miss O hasnt provided any new evidence, and Id already taken the comments shes made 
into account when writing my provisional decision  so they havent changed my mind. 
Miss O said NewDay should have been aware in November 2018 that she wasnt able to 
manage her credit. But, as Ive explained above, the requirement on NewDay is to do 
proportionate checks to determine whether the credit was affordable. Although the indicators 
Miss O mentioned can suggest some financial difficulties, Miss O was regularly paying at 
least two to three times the minimum payment off her credit card. And their estimate of 
effective disposable income suggested she would easily be able to make sustainable 
repayments. Having looked through Miss Os bank statements, I think NewDays estimate of 
disposable income was in line with what Ive seen. So Im satisfied that even if NewDay had 
done more checks theyd have decided the credit limit increase was affordable  and the 
decision would have been reasonable.In respect of Miss Os comments about having two defaults on her credit file (in relation to 
both NewDay and the debt collection agency), Miss Os not provided any evidence of this, 
and the credit reports she has shared with us only show one default. Im satisfied that if this 
was an issue, it was for a relatively short period and has been resolved with limited impact 
on Miss O.
My final decision
As Ive explained above, Im not upholding Miss Os complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss O to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 April 2021.
