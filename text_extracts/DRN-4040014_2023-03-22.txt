The complaint
Mr J is complaining that NewDay Ltd applied missed payments to his credit file.
What happened
In May 2019 Mr J entered into a credit card agreement with NewDay. In May 2021 he 
entered into a repayment plan to pay a reduced monthly payment of £30 per month. In 
October 2021 he contacted NewDay again to look to agree a reduced settlement to pay off 
the credit card balance and he also said he could no longer afford to pay £30 per month. 
And he asked to pay £1 per month. NewDay agreed to do so for a two month period. 
In January 2022 Mr J later complained to NewDay again to say it had reported missed 
payments on his credit file. NewDay explained this was because he was paying less than 
1% of the outstanding balance. So Mr J agreed to increase the payments to £8.50 per month 
to prevent missed payments being recorded. But NewDay said it had recorded correct 
information on his credit file so it wasnt willing to remove the markers.
I issued a provisional decision upholding this complaint and I said the following:
Theres no dispute that NewDay can report missed payments where Mr J paid less than 1% 
of his outstanding balance. The issue for me to decide is whether NewDay did enough to 
explain this to him when it gave him the reduced payment plan.
NewDay has highlighted it wrote to him to confirm the £1 monthly payments and set out that 
this could have an impact on his credit file. I dont dispute this. But Ive taken particular note 
to the information Mr J was given when he asked for the reduced payments.
It seems Mr J asked for this reduction through NewDays online chat facility. I can see the 
advisor advised him that paying less than 1% per month could impact his credit file. But Mr J 
responded to this and said Ive been advised in the past that my account would never ever 
enter such threats through medical issues existing, I eagerly wait a response to my 
complaint. I think the advisor should have reiterated here than paying less than 1% could 
result in adverse markers being recorded as I think its clear from the this Mr J was unaware 
that missed payment markers would be recorded as he queried it with the advisor and wasnt 
given any follow up information. Im satisfied that, had he been given clearer information at 
that time, he would have arranged to pay £8.50 per month as opposed to £1 per month. And, 
it follows, that had he done so missed payment markers wouldnt have been recorded. So I 
think Mr J has lost out as a result of this and I think NewDay should arrange to remove the 
missed payment markers from Mr Js credit file.
NewDay didnt respond to my provisional decision. Mr J said he was happy his complaint 
had been upheld, but queried if he would be compensated.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has given me anything further to think about regarding whether the 
complaint should be upheld or not, I see no reason to reach a different conclusion to the one 
I reached in my provisional decision. So I uphold this complaint for the reasons Ive set out 
above.
I note Mr J has queried whether he would be compensated. But Im satisfied that removing 
the missed payment markers from his credit file is fair compensation. While I think NewDay 
should have given him better information regarding the repayment plan in October 2021, Im 
also conscious it has actively looked to support him in other ways  particularly in allowing 
him to make significantly reduced payments without recording material adverse markers 
regarding this. Im also not persuaded Ive seen enough to say that hes lost out as a result 
of this issue alone. 
Ultimately, Im satisfied that NewDay removing the missed payment markers puts things 
right for Mr J. So I dont think NewDay needs to pay further compensation.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive set out above, its my final decision that I uphold this complaint and I 
require NewDay Ltd to remove the missed payment markers from Mr Js credit file. I make 
no further award.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 April 2023.
