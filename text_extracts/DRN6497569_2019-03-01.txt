K821x#15complaint
Through a claims management  company (CMC), Ms M has complained about fees and 
charges added to her mortgage account  by Paratus AMC Limited (trading as 
Foundation Home  Loans).
background
Ms M has a mortgage with Paratus taken out in 2006. The mortgage fell into arrears and 
fees and charges were applied to the account. On Ms Ms behalf, the CMC complained  
about these to us.
An adjudicator looked at the compliant. She explained that Paratus didnt consent to us 
considering fees and charges applied more than six years before it received the complaint 
on 25 May 2018. The CMC accepted this.
The adjudicator looked at fees and charges applied since 25 May 2012. She noted that there 
were arrears  fees of £39 per month applied in several months where either  the DWP had 
made a contribution to the mortgage, or where legal costs had also been applied. She asked 
Paratus to refund charges as follows:
1 January 2014 £39
31 August 2015 £39
30 September 2015 £39
30 June 2016 £39
30 September 2016 £39
31 December 2016 £39
The fee applied  on 1 January 2014 was where the DWP had made payment to the account  
for that month. The rest were where  there had also been legal costs in the same month.
Paratus didnt agree it should have to refund these fees. It didnt accept there was any 
duplication of work  where legal fees had been applied. It also considered  it was entitled to 
charge the fee for 1 January 2014  as full payment  hadnt been made  and it said Ms M was 
aware of the shortfall shed have to pay.
The adjudicator asked Paratus to show that work hadnt been duplicated on the account,  but 
its not done so. Paratus  asked for an ombudsman  to review the complaint.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive reviewed all the fees charged by 
Paratus from 25 May 2012. Having  done so, Ive reached the same conclusion as the 
adjudicator, for largely the same reasons.
Im satisfied that in January 2014 two payments were received from the DWP in 
mid-December 2013 and mid-January 2014. The DWP  makes payment every four weeks, 
rather than every calendar month.  So Im satisfied it was unfair for Paratus to charge a fee 
for that month.
Ref: DRN64975692Paratus hasnt been able to show us what additional  work  it was doing over and above the 
work carried out by its solicitors for the other  months  listed  above. In the circumstances, I 
dont think its fair or reasonable for Ms M o be charged arrears administration fees in 
months where Paratus  was taking legal action against her and also charging  for that.
my final decision
My decision  is that I partly  uphold this complaint.  In full and final settlement Paratus AMC 
Limited must  refund back to Ms Ms mortgage  account fees totalling £234 (as listed  above) 
and remove any interest  applied on those fees.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 April 2019.
