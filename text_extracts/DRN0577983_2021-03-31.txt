K821x#15complaint
Mr B has complained that Madison CF UK Limited  (trading as 118 118 Money) acted unfairly
when it defaulted  his loan account.
background
I issued a provisional decision about this complaint  in November 2020 that I summarise 
below.
Mr B was given a loan of £1,000 by 118 118 Money in June  2017.  The loan was due to be
repaid with 24 monthly repayments of around  £78. The total amount to be repaid including
interest was just over £1,880.
Mr B says he was made redundant  and he had difficulties repaying the loan. The account
defaulted in May 2018 and 118 118 Money sold the debt to a third party. Mr B says he was
in touch with the lender throughout this period, trying  to make repayments, and that he didnt
receive the default notice that 118 118 Money says it issued in March.  Mr B says this has
caused him distress  and impacted negatively  on his credit file. He wants the default  removed
from his credit file and his loan account  returned to 118 118 Money.
My provisional decision dealt only with Mr Bs specific complaint about  what happened when 
118 118 Money defaulted his account. As far as I am aware,  Mr B had not complained to the 
lender about irresponsible lending  or the affordability  of this loan. So, I didnt make  any 
findings about whether or not 118 118 Money was right to provide Mr B with the loan.
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, and I considered all the 
available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances 
of this complaint.
 
From what  Id seen, Mr B ran into difficulties meeting his loan repayments  a couple of
months after taking  the loan from 118 118 Money. He agreed a number of different
repayment plans  with the lender but he found it difficult  to maintain these arrangements
when his circumstances changed.
I carefully reviewed all the information  provided by Mr B and 118 118 Money,  including
the lenders customer contact records and the recordings of telephone conversations it had
with Mr B. I summarised my understanding of the key dates in the chain of events below:
7 March 2018
Mr B experienced difficulties meeting  his loan repayments. A default  notice is sent to Mr
B. It says that action  must  be taken  before  28 March  2018 to pay arrears on his account of
£190.85. The notice  says that if the action required is taken before the date shown,  then no
further enforcement will be taken in respect  of the breach. And that if the appropriate action
isnt taken, then the lender will serve notice in writing to terminate the loan agreement or
demand earlier payment  of the full amount owed.
8 March 2018
Mr B calls 118 118 Money and says he has lost his job. He agrees to make a partial
payment of £20 but says he cannot afford  to repay  the arrears and requests a payment plan.
118 118 Money puts his account on hold for 30 days.
Ref: DRN0577983211 April 2018
Mr B and 118 118 Money agree a new three-month payment plan whereby Mr B would
repay £104 each  month for three  months, with the first payment due on 1 May.
20 April 2018
Mr B calls 118 118 Money to inform  the lender about  his change of working hours. Mr B
explains he is now working part time and he asks if the repayment date could be moved  to
later in the month, to fit in with his weekly salary. The call handler agrees and tells Mr B that
the first repayment would be taken on 18 May,  then 18 June and 18 July. Mr B asks to set
up a new payment card and a payment of £5.00 is debited from this card during the call.
4 May 2018
Mr B is sent a Notice of Arrears dated  4 May. This letter provides a statement of Mr Bs
account which includes the £5.00 payment he made on the 20 April call (above). But it
doesnt refer to the three-month payment  plan or the revised repayment dates that were
agreed on that same call. Instead the letter says that the next payment of £78 is due on 1st
May.
11 May 2018
Mr B calls the lender.  He says he wants to double check the next payment date as hed
received a letter through the post telling him that his account was in arrears.
The call handler tells Mr B to disregard the letter as an arrangement  had been set up in
April. The call handler refers to the repayment plan for May, June and July. But he says that
the next payment under  this arrangement is not due until 18 June. He tells Mr B not to miss
a payment as it might  lead to the payment plan being cancelled  and if this happens the
normal collections process  might  apply. He also tells Mr B that whilst his account is in
arrears it might have a negative impact  on his credit file.
25 May 2018
The customer contact records note that Mr Bs account was sold on 25 May 2018  to a third
party and that the balance  at the date of sale was just over £1,237. The note also says that
the customer should be referred  to the third party, in the event that any queries are raised.
26 June 2018
Mr B calls 118 118 Money to ask why the June  loan repayment had not been taken from his
account as hed been expecting. He is told that his account has defaulted and that its been
referred to a third party. 118 118 Money says it can therefore no longer  discuss  Mr Bs
account with him.
Mr B calls the lenders customer service department to complain. He says he didnt receive
the default notice in March which is why he carried on making an arrangement to pay in April
and May.  And that no-one has mentioned  the default notice to him on any of the phone  calls
hes had with the lender.
Mr B subsequently brought his complaint to this Service.
It seemed to me that Mr B actively engaged  in the relationship with 118 118 Money,  and that
when he found  himself in financial difficulties, he tried to find ways in which  he could repay
his loan. I also thought that prior to the default,  118 118 Money behaved positively and
sympathetically towards Mr B during  his ongoing difficulties in meeting his loan repayments.
Ref: DRN05779833I thought 118 118 Money  made  Mr B aware  on several occasions that missing a payment 
might lead to a payment plan being cancelled and that if this happened, then a collections
process might follow. And I thought  that Mr B was made  aware that arrears on his account
could have a negative impact on his credit  file.
But I didnt think 118 118 Money gave Mr B clear enough information  at a crucial  juncture in
the relationship.  And I thought that 118 118 Money defaulted Mr Bs account  unfairly  
because:
The default  notice  issued by 118 118 Money  on 7 March 2018 made it clear that, if
action was taken  before 28 March 2018  then no further enforcement would be taken.
And that if the appropriate action wasnt taken,  then the lender would serve notice in
writing to terminate the loan agreement or demand payment in full. I accepted  that Mr B
hadnt cleared  the arrears on his account  by 28 March 2018. But the relationship
between Mr B and 118 118 Money  had not broken  down; hed called 118 118 Money
on 8 March to request  a new payment plan; his account had been put on hold for 30
days and by 11 April Mr B had agreed  a new 3-month payment plan to pay the
arrears on his account.
Mr B says he didnt receive  the default  notice.  But even  if the notice was correctly
served by the lender, I thought Mr B could  reasonably have assumed that hed taken
the action required  by the default notice, by agreeing to the new 3-month  payment
plan. I thought it would have been  reasonable for Mr B to assume that, as hed taken
this action with the lenders agreement,  the default wouldnt be enforced.  Id not
seen anything which made me think that 118 118 Money told Mr B during any
subsequent telephone conversations that the default  notice would  still be enforced,
despite the repayment plan. 
I also didnt think it was fair to default Mr Bs account for other reasons.  Mr B and 118 118 
Money agreed on 20 April 2018  a revision  to the dates when loan repayments would be 
taken from his account under the new payment plan. And that the first payment under this 
revised plan would be taken on 18 May.
But then it seemed that Mr B was twice given  inaccurate and misleading information
by 118 118 Money:
Firstly, when Mr B was sent the Notice of Arrears dated  4 May  which  failed to note 
the repayment plan and the revised repayment  dates previously agreed on 20 April.
Secondly, Mr B called 118 118 Money  on 11 May to query the Notice  of Arrears and 
to double-check  the next payment date. He was then given further, misleading 
information and told that the next payment was not due until 18 June.
I thought its reasonable for Mr B to have relied  on what he was told by the call handler
during the call on 11 May. I thought  its likely that Mr B was left with the understanding
that a) the Notice  of Arrears could be discarded,  and b) that the next loan repayment
would not be taken from his account  until 18 June. And it seemed that Mr B did rely on
what hed been  told in this call - the customer contact records show  that Mr B called
118 118 Money on 26 June to enquire why a loan repayment had not been debited
from his account  in June as hed been  expecting.
Its not clear from the customer  contact  records whether 118 118 Money  attempted  to take a
Ref: DRN05779834loan repayment  from Mr Bs account between its telephone conversation  with him on 11 May
and the point at which  it sold the debt to the third party on 25 May. But even if it did try and
fail to collect payment  in May, I dont think it would  have been fair or reasonable to default Mr
Bs account at this point because, as Id explained:
I thought Mr B could  reasonably have assumed that the action hed taken in setting 
up a new payment plan meant  the default notice wouldnt be enforced;
118 118 Money doesnt appear to have  served notice in writing  of its intention to 
enforce its default notice; and
Mr B reasonably relied on what hed been  told on 11 May by the lenders call handler 
- that the next payment wasnt due until 18 June.
Taking things in the round, I didnt  think 118 118 Money ought reasonably to have defaulted
Mr Bs account when it did. I didnt think it acted  fairly towards Mr B in this regard. So, I said 
that I was intending to uphold this part of his complaint  and direct  118 118 Money
to put things right by removing the default  from Mr Bs credit  file.
Did 118 118 Money  act unfairly  or unreasonably towards Mr B in any other way?
Mr B is also unhappy that 118 118 Money  sold his debt to a third party. I thought  carefully
about this. The lender  was entitled under the terms of the loan agreement to assign the loan
to another party without  giving Mr B prior notice. Mr B was in arrears on his account and hed
failed to meet the terms of the various  repayment  plans  that had been agreed  with him. Even
though I didnt think the lender was right to default Mr Bs account when it did, I could not 
fairly say that 118 118 Money acted  unreasonably when it sold the debt to the third party, as 
it was entitled  to do so at any point during its lending relationship with Mr B. I didnt think Mr 
B is in a significantly different position  or any worse off because 118 118 Money sold his 
debt to another party. And in any event,  as I explained, I was intending to direct  118 118
Money to amend Mr Bs credit file to remove the default. Mr B should  contact  the third party
directly to try and agree a new repayment  plan for his loan.
When he complained,  Mr B told 118 118 Money  that he has learning difficulties and that
because of this hed found  information  from the lender  more  difficult to understand. I
appreciate that in these circumstances Mr B might  have  found  the situation  difficult.  But I
hadnt seen anything which made  me think he made the lender  aware  of his learning
difficulties earlier on in the relationship. So, I couldnt fairly  say that 118 118 Money  was 
aware that Mr B was potentially a vulnerable consumer or that it ought to have taken this into
account in some way.
But overall, I didnt  think 118 118 Money ought  reasonably to have defaulted Mr Bs account 
when it did. 
I invited both parties to send me any further comments or evidence. I havent  seen any 
response from Mr B. 
118 118 Money sent a number of comments which I summarise below. 118 118 Money 
says:
there is no regulation  that states  the relationship between the borrower  and the 
lender must have  'broken down' before a default can be issued.
It is satisfied  that its notice to Mr B met with all statutory requirements.
Ref: DRN05779835The notice served to Mr B on 7 March 2018 made clear to him that he had to pay 
£190.85 to his account by 28 March.
It thinks the call on 20 April is unrelated to the default  notice  as this had been issued 
earlier and it had required Mr B to make the payment by 28 March.
The Notice of Arrears  captured  the reduced payments. It accepts that Mr B may have 
been given incorrect  information during the call on 11 May, but this was after the 
default notice  was issued and meant to be remedied by.
It also agrees that it didnt serve notice in writing  of its intention  to enforce the default 
notice, but this would only apply if it had intended to demand  repayment of the full 
balance  whereas 118 118 Money  says it was only requiring  the amount specified  in 
the default notice, which was not the whole balance.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to thank both parties for all the information  that has been provided about  this matter 
and 118 118 Money for responding to my provisional decision with its further comments, all 
of which  I have read and considered when reaching my final decision.
I have already accepted that the Default Notice issued 7 March required a payment of 
£190.85 before 28 March.  But as I explained  in my provisional decision, Mr B then spoke to 
118 118 Money the following day. 118 118 Money  told Mr B that it would  put his account on 
hold for 30 days to enable him to sort out his finances, and that it would try to arrange  an 
affordable repayment  plan with him. I think Mr B reasonably understood at this point that he 
was being given more time to pay. I think he reasonably assumed that, as 118 118 Money  
had agreed to put his account on hold and give him time to sort out his finances,  this meant 
any default notice  was not going to be enforced by 28 March.  
118 118 Money thinks it met all of its statutory requirements in this matter. It suggests that 
as it wasnt demanding  the full balance, it wasnt required to serve  notice in writing of its 
intention to enforce  the default notice.  But I dont think Mr B would have been  aware of the 
detailed statutory issues. I think Mr B reasonably  relied on what he was told in the various 
calls he had with 118 118 Money in which he tried to make sense of the various written 
communications he received. 
118 118 Money says there is no regulation that states the relationship  between  the 
borrower and the lender must have 'broken down' before a default  can be issued.  But it 
seems to me that this consumer was making attempts to reach agreement with 118 118 
Money about the arrears on his account, and hed explained to the lender why his financial 
circumstances had changed. Taking  everything  into account, I dont think  the lenders 
communications with Mr B were as clear  as they might have been which led to some 
confusion and it didnt  help matters when Mr B was given inaccurate  information about the 
dates when payment  would  be taken  from his account.
Ive thought carefully about 118 118 Moneys  further comments, but they havent  changed  
my view of this complaint  which I set out in detail  in my provisional decision. Overall,  I dont 
think 118 118 Money ought  reasonably  to have defaulted Mr Bs account when it did.
I explained in my provisional decision  why I didnt think 118 118 Money had acted unfairly or 
unreasonably towards  Mr B when it assigned his debt to a third party. And I didnt think the 
Ref: DRN05779836lender was aware Mr B might have  been  a vulnerable  consumer at the time.  Ive not 
received any further information from Mr B about  this, so I havent  changed  my conclusions  
about this aspect of his complaint.
Ive thought carefully about everything Ive seen about this matter. From what Ive seen, I 
dont think 118 118 Money treated Mr B unfairly  in some other way, but I dont think 118 118 
Money ought reasonably to have defaulted  Mr Bs account when it did. So, I confirm the 
conclusions I reached in my provisional decision and 118 118 Money  must  now put things 
right for Mr B.
Putting things  right
Where I find that a business has done something wrong, Id normally expect that business  
in so far as is reasonably practicable  to put the consumer back in the position they would
be in now if that wrong  hadnt taken place.
Ive considered what would be fair and reasonable for 118 118 Money to do now,  in the
circumstances of this complaint. I think its fair and reasonable  for 118 118 Money to put
things right by removing the default  from Mr Bs credit file and replacing it with an
arrangement to pay.
As far as I am aware,  the default will have been  on Mr Bs credit file since May 2018.  I cant
say how this might have impacted on Mr Bs ability to secure  credit  since then. But Mr B has
told us about the distress  and upset that this has caused him. And I think in the
circumstances that 118 118 Money should  pay Mr B the sum of £150 for the distress and
inconvenience it has caused by unfairly defaulting his account.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I uphold this complaint  and direct Madison CF UK Limited 
(trading as 118 118 Money) to put things right as set out above.
 Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2021.
