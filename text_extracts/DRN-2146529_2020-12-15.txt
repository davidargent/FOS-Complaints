The complaint
Mr T complains about the amount that hes been charged by Volkswagen Financial Services 
(UK) Limited, trading as Volkswagen Finance, for damage to a car that he returned when he 
terminated the hire purchase agreement under which the car had been supplied to him.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mr T under a hire purchase agreement with Volkswagen 
Finance that he signed in August 2017;
the agreement said: You must  keep the vehicle in good repair and condition, 
commensurate with its age and mileage; and: You will be responsible for any 
damage to or deterioration of the Vehicle which is in excess of fair wear and tear 
commensurate with the age and mileage of the Vehicle;
Mr T terminated the agreement and returned the car  it was inspected by a third 
party on behalf of Volkswagen Finance in March 2020;
the inspection report recorded that the car had been driven for 49,937 miles and 
identified damage to the cars bonnet, front bumper and left front wheel and said that 
the total estimated repair cost was £112.20 (plus VAT)  it also included photos of 
the damage;
Volkswagen Finance charged Mr T £134.64 but he complained about the charges 
and it said that the scratch on the bonnet was fair wear and tear so the charge for 
repairing it would be waived but that the other damage was outside fair wear and tear 
so estimated repair costs of £109.44 remained chargeable;
Mr T complained to this service but the investigator thought that the damage to the 
front bumper and left front wheel went beyond fair wear and tear so Volkswagen 
Finance didnt need to do anything differently;
Mr T says that the damage shown in the pictures was not present when he returned 
the car and wouldve been noticed by him and the dealer  and that Volkswagen 
Finance has already admitted one error when it charged him for the scratched 
bonnet;
Mr T had the car for about 31 months and drove nearly 50,000 miles in it before he 
returned the car;
Ive looked at the photos of the damage contained in the inspection report and I 
consider that the damage to the front bumper and wheel is more than would 
reasonably be considered to be fair wear and tear in accordance with the British 
Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association guidelines on fair wear and tear;
although Mr T says that the damage must have been caused after he returned the 
car, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that thats what 
happened  and I find it to be more likely than not that the damage was present when 
he returned the car;
I find that its fair and reasonable for Volkswagen Finance to charge him for the 
scratched bumper and wheel and I dont consider the total charge of £109.44 to be 
excessive for that damage; and
Volkswagen Finance has already waived the charge for the scratched bonnet and Im 
not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to waive or 
reduce the charge of £109.44, to pay any other compensation to Mr T or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 January 2021.
