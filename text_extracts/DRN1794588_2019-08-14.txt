K821x#15complaint
Mr and Mrs H complain about  advice  they received from Stephen Thomas  Associates 
(a trading name of Stephen Thomas Ltd) an appointed representative  of The On-Line 
Partnership Limited (trading as In Partnership) in 2005 to invest £100,000  with Scottish 
Equitable International (Dublin) plc, now known as Aegon Ireland plc.
background 
In 2004 Mr and Mrs H received advice from In Partnership to invest  £150,000 in Euros in a 
tax efficient investment,  known in France as assurance vie compliant. In Partnership  
recommended that Mr and Mrs H invest with Lombard International Assurance SA.
In 2005 Mr and Mrs H received further  advice from In Partnership. In Partnership 
recommended Mr and Mrs H invest  £100,000 in Sterling (rather than £150,000 in Euros)  with 
Scottish Equitable  International  (Dublin) plc (rather than Lombard  International Assurance 
SA). 
In January 2006 Mr and Mrs H invested £100,000  (in line with In Partnerships November 
2005 advice) with Scottish Equitable International (Dublin) plc.
In 2018 Mr and Mrs H complained to In Partnership  about the 2005  advice  they had 
received. In summary they said that they had understood that what  was recommended  to 
them in 2005  was assurance vie compliant.  But that it had come  to light in 2017, after they 
sought advice  from a new advisor,  that it wasnt assurance vie compliant. 
Having received advice in 2017  from a new advisor, which is what prompted them to 
complain to In Partnership, Mr and Mrs H surrendered their 2006 investment (with  Scottish  
Equitable International (Dublin) plc  now known as Aegon Ireland plc) in 2018 for a little 
over £154,000 and invested £150,000  of this with SEB Life International. The actual sum 
invested in units  within the SEB Life International investment was £157,500  an allocation 
factor of 105%.
When complaining  to In Partnership Mr and Mrs H said that what they were looking for by 
way of compensation was:
The refund [of] all charges and commission paid since  the commencement of the 
[Scottish Equitable International (Dublin) plc] policy as it was not fit for purpose.
Payment of the initial  set up charges  together  with the on-going  charges  for the 
[SEB Life International] policy.
In Partnership considered  Mr and Mrs Hs complaint and issued them with a final response 
letter in 2018  in which it said:
The 2005 advice  was suitable  on the grounds that Mr and Mrs Hs attitude to risk 
(ATR) had been  assessed  at this point in time as being between  cautious and 
balanced, where it had been  assessed  in 2004  as being balanced. And this 
reassessment of Mr and Mrs Hs ATR meant that an investment with Lombard 
International Assurance SA wasnt suitable  because Lombard International 
Assurance SA required  a holding of at least 10% in any one fund.
Ref: DRN17945882Its 2005 advice  letter didnt confirm, unlike the 2004 advice letter,  that the 
recommended investment  was assurance  vie compliant.
It had sought  advice from Scottish  Equitable  International (Dublin)  plc  prior to 
making its 2005 recommendation  that the proposed  investment was  eligible for 
people moving  to France [and that it was] going to be fully compatible  in the future for 
residents in France .
Mr and Mrs Hs new advisors enquiries  of Aegon Ireland  plc doesnt suggest that the 
2005 recommended  investment wasnt, in 2006 or subsequently,  vie assurance 
compliant given that Aegon Ireland plc confirmed to Mr and Mrs Hs new advisor:
oOur Private Client Portfolio (PCP) contract  wasnt designed to be used in the 
French market and weve  never  taken tax advice on whether it qualifies as an 
assurance vie contract. Our understanding is that the contract, in its version 
with lives assured (as held by your clients)  would potentially  be treated as an 
Assurance vie contract. This is because the performance of the contract 
depends on a contingent event of human  life. There are various sub 
categorises of Assurance vie contracts, and we believe  that PCP with lives 
assured could be an Assurance  en cas de dcs vie entire, a sub-category  
of Assurance  en cas de dcs because it doesnt have a fixed term and pays 
a lump sum on death of the last life assured. However, we cant provide an 
assurance on this, and your clients would  need to take French advice to 
confirm the position .
Notwithstanding the above there  are reasonable grounds to conclude that this 
complaint has been made too late to be considered by the Financial Ombudsman  
Service.
Unhappy with In Partnerships response  to their complaint  Mr and Mrs H referred  it to our 
service for investigation by one of our investigators.
The investigator first considered In Partnerships submission that Mr and Mrs Hs complaint 
might had been made too late to be considered by us. She concluded it hadnt been  and 
In Partnership agreed that she could look at the merits of it.
Having carried out an initial  review of Mr and Mrs Hs complaint the investigator concluded 
that it should be upheld (on the grounds that Mr and Mrs H would have reasonably  
understood that the investment recommended to them in 2005  was assurance vie compliant) 
and invited In Partnership to make an offer to settle matters.
In partnership responded to the investigators initial view and said, in summary:
Its 2005 recommendation was made  on the grounds that diversification was more  
important to Mr and Mrs H than having  an investment that was assurance vie 
compliant.
If having an assurance vie compliant investment was so important to Mr and Mrs H 
then one would expect them to have questioned why reference to such compliance 
wasnt noted in its 2005 advice letter, particularly given that reference  to the same 
was made in its 2004 advice letter.
Ref: DRN17945883Its just as likely, as its unlikely, that the advantages and disadvantages of the 2004 
and 2005 recommendation were discussed with Mr and Mrs H in 2005 and they 
elected to invest  as they did in the full knowledge of these.
There is no evidence that its 2005  recommended investment wasnt assurance vie 
compliant, or that Mr and Mrs H incurred a tax liability  on its surrender in 2018.
There may have been a number of reasons for surrendering their 2006 investment in 
2018 including,  but not restricted to, the change  in French tax laws some 13 years  or 
so after 2005/06.
In Partnership also referred the investigator to a previous decision issued by our service.
The investigator considered In Partnerships response to her initial  view but concluded 
Mr and Mrs Hs complaint  should still be upheld on the grounds that they would have 
reasonably understood that the investment recommended to them in 2005 was assurance 
vie compliant. 
Having upheld the complaint the investigator concluded that In Partnership should:
Refund any advice  and set up fees Mr and Mrs H incurred when investing with SEB 
Life International in 2018.
Pay Mr and Mrs H interest at 8% simple a year on the above  from the date these 
fees were paid by Mr and Mrs H to the date they are refunded  to them by 
In Partnership.
Pay Mr and Mrs H £500 for the trouble and upset this matter had caused  them.
Mr and Mrs H responded  to the investigators  view to say that they didnt agree with it. In 
summary they said:
They had paid fees of around  £20,000  to In Partnership between  2006 and 2011 (the 
first five years of the investment).
They will be required  to pay SEB Life International in excess of £2,100 a year in 
charges between 2018 and 2026 (the first eight  years of the investment).  Under their 
surrendered 2006  investment they were paying,  in 2017,  in the region of only £500 a 
year, a difference of £1,600 a year.
Under the 2018 investment they will be unable  to enjoy tax efficient  access to their 
funds for eight years.
In Partnership responded to say that it would like details of the advice and set up fees 
Mr and Mrs H incurred when investing with SEB Life International in 2018. And that it was its 
understanding that Mr and Mrs Hs new advisor  received no commission for effecting the 
SEB Life International investment.
Ref: DRN17945884On being notified by the investigator that Mr and Mrs Hs advisor had indeed not been paid 
commission for effecting the SEB Life International  investment In Partnership said:
It had been  paid substantially less than £20,000  in fees and Mr and Mrs H appear to 
have confused fees paid to it with fees/charges levied by Scottish  Equitable 
International (Dublin) plc.
Costs of an investment taken  out in 2006  are likely to be more expensive  than an 
investment taken out in 2018   some 12 years later.
Costs of an investment spread across  numerous funds (as was the 2006 investment) 
are likely to be higher than an investment spread across only a small number of 
funds (as the 2018 investment might have been).
Other than an early  encashment charge  payable in the first eight years  the only 
variable charge on the 2018  investment is the Annual  Management charge of 0.75% 
payable for the first eight years and 0.5%  thereafter. 
This means  that Mr and Mrs H are potentially liable to pay £3,150 (0.75% - 0.5%  x 
£157,500 x 8 years) not the £12,800 claimed by them.
It isnt clear that on surrendering their 2006 investment in 2018 that Mr and Mrs H 
incurred a taxation charge or penalty.
Notwithstanding the above it was prepared to pay Mr and Mrs H, to settle matters, 
£2,075 being 50% of £3,150 plus £500  for trouble and upset.
The investigator shared  In Partnerships  response  with Mr and Mrs H. They considered  it 
and responded  to say:
They were required, as evidenced  by their various submissions, the following 
charges in respect of their 2006 investment during the first 5 years  (payable  
quarterly):
oEstablishment Fee (Maintenance Charge)  of 0.625%  a quarter - circa £13,100 
over five years.
oInvestment Advisor Fees of 0.125% a quarter   circa £2,400  over five years.
oAdministration charge  of £92.50  a quarter (rising over time)  circa  £2,000  
over five years.
oOther Fees  circa £1,900 over five years.
oTotal circa £19,500 over five years.
They paid further Investment  Advisor  fees of 0.125%  a quarter between 2011 and 
2016 totalling circa £2,500 in respect  of their 2006  investment.
Ref: DRN17945885They were required, as evidenced  by their various submissions, to pay only the 
following charges  in 2017 in respect of their 2006 investment:
oAdministration charge  of £110 a quarter  equating to £440  over the year.
oSafekeeping  fees of circa £20.
oTotal circa £460 a year.
They are required, as evidenced  by their various  submissions, three charges a year 
in respect of their 2018 investment (payable  quarterly):
oManagement Charge of 0.75%  a year - circa £1,200 a year
oService Charge of 0.5% a year - circa  £800  a year
oAdministration Charge  of £82 a year
oTotal circa £2,100 a year.
And given  the above it isnt unreasonable for them to seek,  as a minimum, £13,120  this 
being £2,100 less £460 x 8 years.
They never required, nor did they seek, in 2005  access to a wider range of 
investment funds compared to 2004. In 2005  it was still their aim and objective  to 
invest in an assurance vie compliant investment.
The investigator considered In Partnerships and Mr and Mrs Hs response to her (second) 
view. Having done so she concluded that it should still be upheld but In Partnership should:
Pay Mr and Mrs H the difference between the Management Charge payable on their 
2018 investment  (over  the first eight years) and payable in year nine onwards.  Based  
on an initial investment  of £157,500 this equates to £3,150.
Pay Mr and Mrs H £500 for the trouble and upset this matter has caused them.
Mr and Mrs H responded  to the investigators  (third) view to say that they didnt accept it. In 
doing so they reiterated their previous submissions and pointed out that their 2018 
investment wasnt subject just to the Management  Charge (of 0.75% reducing to 0.5%) but 
other charges as well.
In Partnership responded to the investigators (third) view but provided nothing  materially  
new for her consideration.
Because both parties disagreed with the investigators view it was passed to me for review  
and decision.
Ref: DRN17945886I issued a provisional decision on this case in July 2019. In summary  I said:
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   
Its clear both parties have very strong feelings about this complaint. Both have provided 
detailed submissions in support  of their respective views which  I can confirm Ive read and 
considered in their entirety. However,  I trust that the parties will not take the fact that my 
findings focus on what I consider to be the central  issues, and that they are expressed in 
considerably less detail, as a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address  every  
point raised. The purpose of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for 
reaching them.
I would also like to point  out that where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive  or 
contradictory, I make my decision on the balance of probabilities - that is, what  I consider is 
most likely to have happened given the evidence that is available  and the wider surrounding 
circumstances.
As part of its submissions In Partnership  makes reference to a decision issued by our 
service in 2014. Im aware of this decision  but would point out, as Im sure In Partnership  is 
aware, that Im not bound by what a previous ombudsman might have concluded and that in 
any event, each case is considered on its own facts and merits.
In essence Mr and Mrs H complain that what they wanted, above anything  and everything  
else, and what they believe  they had been  advised to invest  in (in 2005), was an assurance 
vie compliant investment. So the first thing I need to decide is whether what In Partnership  
recommended in 2005 was assurance vie compliant.
I accept that this isnt clear. But based  on what has been said and submitted by both parties 
Im persuaded that more likely than not the 2005  investment wasnt  assurance vie compliant.
Having concluded,  on the balance of probabilities,  that Mr and Mrs Hs 2005 recommended 
investment wasnt assurance vie compliant,  what Im now required to decide is whether it 
was suitable.
In Partnership reassessed Mr and Mrs Hs ATR in 2005 as being between  cautious and 
balanced, having assessed  it in 2004 as being  balanced. And this reassessment  meant  that 
its 2004 advice  to invest in what is accepted by both parties to have been an assurance vie 
compliant investment was no longer suitable.
In Partnership submit that its 2004 recommended investment was restricted  to a maximum 
of 10 funds and so offered insufficient  diversification  (amongst other things) for consumers 
who had an ATR between  cautious  and balanced.  But even if I was to accept what  In 
Partnership says on this point Ive seen nothing that would lead me to conclude  that there 
werent assurance vie compliant investments available that didnt carry such a fund holding  
restriction.
Ref: DRN17945887I will now turn to what I understand  is In Partnerships submission that Mr and Mrs H could 
and should have understood that its 2005 recommended investment wasnt assurance vie 
compliant because, amongst other things, no reference to it being  so was made  in its 2005 
advice letter. And what I understand  is its submission that being assurance  vie compliant 
wasnt what Mr and Mrs H wanted  above  anything and everything else.
I accept that In Partnerships 2005  advice letter makes no reference to the recommended 
investment being  assurance vie compliant. But in my view this advice letter needs to be 
considered not in isolation but in conjunction  with In Partnerships 2004 advice letter  and the 
conversations that both parties agree took place. 
And having regard  to the conversations both parties agree took place, and both advice 
letters (2004  and 2005), Im satisfied that it was entirely fair and reasonable for 
Mr and Mrs H to believe that their 2005 recommended investment  was assurance vie 
compliant and that this was what was most important to them.  And on this last point I would 
add that I find it very difficult to reconcile what I understand is In Partnerships submission 
that being assurance vie compliant wasnt what Mr and Mrs H wanted above anything  and 
everything else with its submission that it had sought advice from Scottish  Equitable 
International (Dublin) plc on this very issue.
So given what I say above Im satisfied that In Partnerships 2005 advice wasnt  suitable  and 
that Mr and Mrs Hs should be fairly  compensated for that unsuitable advice.
In my view, with suitable advice, Mr and Mrs H would have invested differently in 2006 and 
more likely than not would  have invested in an assurance vie compliant investment. But the 
difficulty I have is that I cant say for certain:
Whether Mr and Mrs H would  have invested the same, more,  or less than the 
£100,000 they did.
How long Mr and Mrs H would have held such an investment for, for example to date 
or some other date.
How such  an investment might have performed, for example whether it would have 
performed the same,  better or worse than the investment they made in 2006 and 
subsequently made  in 2018.
The charges  such an investment  might have been subject to.
However taking everything into account  I think its reasonable to conclude,  in the particular 
circumstances of this complaint, that:
Mr and Mrs H would  have invested £100,000.
Mr and Mrs H would  have still held the alternative investment to date and beyond.
The alternative investment would have  performed the same  as the investment 
Mr and Mrs H made  in 2006  and subsequently  made in 2018.
The ongoing charges would have  been  the same as Mr and Mrs H incurred on their 
2006 investment  and will incur on their 2018  investment going forward.
Ref: DRN17945888So based  on what I say above, its my view that what  Mr and Mrs H have suffered, as a 
result of investing in the manner that they did, was two lots of initial advice charges (2006 
and 2018) rather than one and a degree  of distress and inconvenience  in having to make the 
investment switch that they did in 2018. And this is what they should  be fairly and reasonably 
compensated for.
So I think that what In Partnership should have to do is to refund Mr and Mrs H the initial 
advice charge they incurred in 2006  (which  I understand  equates  to £2,750  @ 2.75% of the 
sum invested) and pay them  £500  for the distress  and inconvenience of having  to switch 
investments in 2018.
Finally, and for the sake of completeness, I would add that I dont think it would be either fair 
or reasonable for me to direct  In Partnership to pay Mr and Mrs H anything for the tax they 
might end up having to pay on their 2006 investment, or indeed  their 2018 investment. I say 
this because that notwithstanding its unclear whether such a liability  will ever crystalize it 
isnt clear what tax liability, if any, might  have accrued under an alternative investment or 
what steps Mr and Mrs H might  have been able to take, or might be able to take, to mitigate 
such a liability.
In Partnership responded to my provisional decision to say it had nothing further to add.
Mr and Mrs H responded  to my provisional  decision to say that it disagreed with it. In 
summary they said:
In 2004 and 2005 In Partnership assured them that it was fully regulated and 
authorised and able to sella fully French Tax compliant  product.
In 2005 they were  advised that what was being recommended  to them  was French 
Tax compliant.
In Partnership continued  (post 2005) to assure them that the 2005 recommended  
investment was fully French compliant.
When they discovered the 2005  recommended investment wasnt  French  Tax 
compliant they had no choice but to churn  it into the investment that they now hold.
Churning their investment in the manner  that they did means  they have incurred a 
potential tax liability in France .
They have been disadvantaged far beyond the award I recommended they be paid.
Due to a change  in French taxation rules  the tax benefits under  contracts  taken out 
after September 2017 are less advantageous  to those taken out before  this date.
They have to wait another  eight years (from  2018) to benefit from the assurance vie 
tax benefits of their new investment.
The whole matter  has caused them material distress and expense.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont under estimate Mr and Mrs Hs strength of feeling in this matter.  But Im simply not 
persuaded that they have  raised anything materially new for my consideration. Put another 
way Im satisfied that what  Mr and Mrs H have said in response to my provisional decision 
are points that I had due regard to when reaching my provisional findings.
Ref: DRN17945889I dont dispute  that having  to arrange a new investment in 2018 caused  Mr and Mrs H a 
degree of distress and inconvenience, as has the fact that to obtain the full tax benefits of 
their 2018  investment they will need  to hold it for eight years.  But I remain of the view that 
had they received suitable advice in 2005  their position now and going forward  wouldnt (on 
the balance of probabilities) be materially different. In other words Mr and Mrs H would  have 
received no more by way of an investment return,  or incurred  anything  more by way of 
ongoing investment  costs  and charges or tax.
So with the above in mind  Im of the view that the fairest outcome to this complaint is for 
In Partnership to refund Mr and Mrs H the higher of the initial advice fee they incurred in 
2006 (or £2,750) plus pay them  £500  for distress and inconvenience.
my final decision
My final decision is that The On-Line Partnership Limited must refund Mr and Mrs H the 
higher of the initial advice fee they incurred in 2006  (or £2,750)  plus pay them £500 for 
distress and inconvenience.
I appreciate Mr and Mrs H will be disappointed by my conclusions. My final decision,  
however, represents  the last stage of this services dispute resolution procedure. 
Mr and Mrs H dont have to accept  my decision, and if they dont do so, they will be free to 
pursue legal action against The On-Line  Partnership Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision  before  14 September 2019.
