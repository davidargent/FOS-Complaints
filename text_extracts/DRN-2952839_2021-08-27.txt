The complaint
Mr P complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc trading as first direct (first direct) shouldve stopped 
his joint account.
What happened
Mr P had a joint account with his wife, and they were in the process of separation. He called 
first direct in July 2019, November 2019, January 2021 and February 2021 about this. On 3 
March 2021, £226.40 was withdrawn, resulting in an overdraft of £52.51. Mr P repaid this 
amount and the joint account was closed on the same day.
Mr P complained. He said hed asked first direct to close the joint account, but they hadnt. 
And therefore, this allowed his ex-partner to withdraw the money  which was rightfully his. 
So, he was now out of pocket.
First direct said theyd reviewed the calls made by Mr P to them. On 20 January 2021, he 
called to discuss removing the arranged overdraft from the account. He also mentioned he 
was in the process of getting a divorce. But nothing was discussed about him having any 
concerns about the operation of the account. When he called on 23 February 2021, he 
asked to close the account. He was misinformed on that call that he had to wait until the 
interest that was due on March 2021 (£13.41)  and then the account could be closed. This 
was an error on first directs part  as the account couldve been closed on 23 February 
2021. But he didnt raise any issues about a dispute at that time. Had he done so, the 
options couldve been discussed with him. The other party made a withdrawal which led to 
an overdraft of £52.51  which first direct later refunded and waived the interest of £13.41.
Mr P brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said first direct had acted fairly. Where a 
joint account was concerned, both parties had equal access to the funds in the account, 
unless there was notice of a dispute between them. Hed reviewed the calls between Mr P 
and first direct. On them, Mr P said he didnt want to restrict access to the account - and so 
first direct didnt take any action. He could see that first direct made an error on 23 February 
2021  as the account couldve been closed then  so it remained open. First direct had 
refunded £52.51 and waived debit interest of £13.41, which he thought was fair.
Mr P didnt agree and asked that his complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There are two things to consider in Mr Ps complaint. They are related to each other. Firstly, 
did he put first direct on notice that he was getting a divorce and that there was a dispute 
between him and his wife? If he did, then first direct shouldve stopped the joint account and 
tried to resolve how to deal with the joint account. Usually, this would mean coming to an 
agreement with both Mr P and his wife. 
The second issue is  should first direct have closed the account when Mr P called them on 
23 February 2021? If they had, then Mr P argues that his ex-partner wouldnt have been able 
to make the withdrawal of £226.40 on 3 March 2021.
Looking at the first point. In July 2019, he messaged first direct and said there was a major 
dispute between himself and the other party, and I do not approve for this account to be 
closed without my consent. He then discussed this with first direct on 8 July 2019. Ive 
listened to this call. In it, Mr P says he and his wife were divorcing, and he didnt want the 
account to be closed without his consent. First direct offered to put a dispute marker on the 
account  which wouldve frozen it. But Mr P then said he wanted the account to continue to 
run normally.  In November 2019, Mr P called first direct again  and said he didnt want his 
wife to increase the overdraft limit. First direct said the only way to that was to put a freeze 
on the account  otherwise, either party could make changes to the limit. Mr P said he didnt 
want to put a freeze on the account.
So  looking at what happened in 2019, there wasnt an instruction from Mr P to stop the 
account  in fact, he told first direct he didnt want to do that. So, things continued until 
January 2021  14 months later.
On 20 January 2021, Mr P had two calls with first direct. He asked how much was needed to 
reduce the balance to zero  which he paid and then the limit was cancelled. He mentioned 
he was getting a divorce. But there wasnt any discussion about a dispute between them. Mr 
P then queried the overdraft interest and the call handler asked him if he wanted to speak to 
its financial support team. He said he didnt want to. 
On 23 February 2021, Mr P called first direct and said he was looking to close the account. 
He was told he needed to wait until the pending interest due on 9 March 2021 was put 
though. This was an error  the account couldve been closed on the day he called. First 
direct acknowledged this error and waived the interest of £13.41 and the (later) debit 
balance of £52.51. There was then a withdrawal of £226.41 on 3 March 2021. Mr P told us 
this was paid to his wife. 
So  I must decide whether first direct shouldve stopped the account in 2019 or 2021. I dont 
think they should have. While there was clearly a dispute in 2019, that was a long time 
before and Mr P had declined to freeze the account then  and many things couldve 
happened as between Mr P and his wife between then and the calls in 2021. And on the 
calls on 20 January 2021  Mr P wasnt explicit about any dispute  there was only a mild 
mention of a divorce - and he didnt want to speak to first directs specialist team then. On 
the call on 23 February 2021, there wasnt any mention of a dispute. So  I dont think we 
can expect first direct to have taken any action as a result.
Looking at the call on 23 February 2021  first direct made an error. But  I dont think we 
can assume that Mr P suffered a loss as a result of this. I agree there was a withdrawal of 
£226.40 on 3 March 2021. But  equally, I can also see there was a withdrawal of £950.00 
on 23 February 2021 (although this may have been made before Mr Ps call to first direct on 
that day). And there was a credit to the account of £140 on 2 March 2021, which wouldve 
been returned to the sender and wouldve had to have been dealt with as between Mr P and 
his wife. So, on balance, and in all the circumstances here, I dont think I can conclude that 
Mr P lost money as a result of first directs error. And  in any case, first direct have given Mr 
P a total of £65.92 as result of their error, which I consider to be fair.
And so  I wont be asking first direct to do anymore here. 
My final decisionI do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 September 2021.
