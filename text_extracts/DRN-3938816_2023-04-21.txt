The complaint
Mr M complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles has reported incorrect information 
about his credit card account with the credit references agencies (CRA).
What happened
Mr M holds a credit card account with NewDay. He says NewDay contacted him to offer a 
covid payment deferral (payment holiday) in August 2020. And that he accepted the offer on 
the basis he was told that it wouldnt impact his credit file. 
But Mr M later found out that NewDay had recorded adverse data on his credit file  three 
months missed payment. And he says this impacted a mortgage application. So, he 
complained to NewDay about this and, subsequently, he added his dissatisfaction that 
NewDay was unable to provide a recording of the telephone call he had with it in            
August 2020.
NewDay acknowledged that a three-month covid payment holiday was agreed in                
August 2020. But it didnt agree it had recorded any adverse data on Mr Ms credit file 
because of the payment holiday. 
It said when the payment holiday was agreed Mr Ms account was already one month in 
arrears due to a missed payment in July 2020. And it was this missed payment which has 
been recorded on Mr Ms credit file. So, it said Mr Ms credit file accurately reflected what 
had happened on his account. But NewDay offered Mr M £25 compensation as it was 
unable to provide a recording of the phone conversation which took place when the payment 
holiday was agreed. 
Unhappy with NewDays response Mr M referred his complaint to this service. One of our 
investigators looked into it, but he didnt uphold it. He was satisfied that NewDay hadnt 
recorded adverse data on Mr Ms credit file as a result of the covid payment holiday. He 
noted that Mr Ms statements showed Mr M had missed a payment to his credit card in     
July 2020 - before Mr M had discussed a payment holiday with NewDay. And he was 
satisfied that Mr Ms credit file accurately reflected that his account had been one month in 
arrears as a result of that missed payment. 
He acknowledged NewDay had been unable to provide Mr M with recording of the call Mr M 
had with NewDay in August 2020, but he thought the £25 compensation payment NewDay 
had offered was fair. He said, irrespective of what was discussed on the phone, Mr M would 
have known from his account statement that hed missed a payment in the month before the 
call with NewDay. 
Mr M didnt agree. He said that what was discussed in the call was material to his complaint. 
The investigator responded to say that Mr M would have already been aware of the missed 
payment in July 2020 and the consequences of the missed payment from the statement that 
had been issued to him before the call with NewDay.
As agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware that Ive only summarised Mr Ms submissions in bringing this complaint. And Im 
not going to respond to every single point made by him. No discourtesy is intended by this. 
Our rules allow me to take this approach. It simply reflects the informal nature of our service 
as a free alternative to the courts. If theres something I havent mentioned, it isnt because 
Ive ignored it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual point to be 
able to reach what I think is a fair outcome.
Mr M is concerned that NewDay no longer has a recording of the call from August 2020. 
NewDay has explained that it doesnt retain call recordings for more than 12 months. As the 
event Mr M complains about happened 18 months before he raised his complaint with 
NewDay, I dont find it unusual that NewDay no longer has a recording of the call. So, I dont 
agree with Mr M that NewDay has breached a duty by not being able to provide the call 
recording.
In any event, NewDay hasnt disputed that a call took place and I accept that too. Ive seen a 
copy the letter NewDay sent to Mr M on 18 August 2020  the day Mr M says the call took 
place, and this refers to a call having taken place. 
So, Ive thought about what Mr M says was discussed in the call. He says he was told the 
covid payment holiday wouldnt impact his credit file. And I accept that this is what Mr M was 
told. The temporary guidance introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) because 
of the pandemic said that when a lender agreed to a covid payment holiday adverse data 
should not be recorded on the customers credit file. 
But Mr M says NewDay recorded three months missed payments on his credit file because 
of the covid payment holiday. But, like the investigator, I dont agree that it did. I appreciate 
Mr M will be disappointed with my decision, so Ill explain why. 
Mr M has provided an extract of his credit file relating to his account and this shows a  
status 1 was recorded for three months in 2020. I understand this to mean that one monthly 
payment was missed and was outstanding for three months. If this data had related to the 
three-month covid payment holiday, I would expect the credit file to show status 3 - three 
monthly missed payments. So, Im persuaded that the status 1 credit record doesnt relate 
to the covid payment holiday. 
Mr M later said that during the call with NewDay he wasnt told that the previous missed 
payment would impact his credit file. Ive gone on to look at Mr Ms credit card account 
statements. The statement issued on 13 August 2020 shows that Mr M hadnt made the 
monthly payment set out in the July 2020 statement and a default fee of £12 had been 
charged. The statement says: You have failed to make a minimum payment. Failing to make 
your minimum payment can mean youve broken the terms of this credit agreementand 
make it more difficult for you to obtain credit in the future. 
So, Im satisfied that before the call with NewDay, Mr M had already missed his previous 
monthly payment. And Im persuaded that Mr M should have reasonably been aware  from 
his statement, that he had missed a payment and his ability to obtain credit in the future 
could be impacted as a result. 
As the subsequent call in August 2020 related to a covid payment holiday, not the previous 
missed payment, Im not persuaded NewDay was required to tell Mr M the impact that 
previous missed payments would have on his credit file. In any event, even if NewDay had discussed the previous missed payment with Mr M during the call, it remains that the 
payment had already been missed and this would have always been recorded on his credit 
file.
       
Ive seen that Mr M bought his account up to date in November 2020. But by this time Mr Ms 
July missed payment had been outstanding for three months, hence the status 1 on his 
credit file  one payment outstanding for three months. So, Im satisfied that Mr Ms credit file 
accurately reflects the status of his account. So, Im not going to tell NewDay to remove 
details of the missed payment from Mr Ms credit file.
 
I note that NewDay has offered Mr M £25 compensation as it was unable to provide a 
recording of the call. As mentioned above, I dont think NewDay has done anything wrong in 
this respect, so I find this offer to be fair. So, I wont be telling NewDay to pay Mr M further 
compensation 
My final decision
For the reasons give above, I dont uphold this complaint.
NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles should contact Mr M and make arrangements to pay him 
£25 compensation if it hasnt already done so. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 May 2023.
