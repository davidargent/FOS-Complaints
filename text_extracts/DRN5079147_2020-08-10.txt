Mr M complains that Madison CF UK Limited sold him a loan he couldnt  afford.
background
In 2018 Mr M applied to Madison CF UK Limited  (trading  as 118 118 Money)  for a loan. In 
2019 he complained that the loan had been unaffordable, and that it had been irresponsible 
of 118 118 to sell him the loan. He said that if 118 118 had carried  out proper checks, it 
would have seen  that he was already heavily in debt.
118 118 did not agree. It said that it had reviewed Mr Ms finances  and concluded that he 
could afford  the loan.  It added that if Mr M had thought at the time that he couldnt afford it, 
then he should  have said so, and then 118 118 wouldnt have lent to him.
Mr M brought this complaint to our Service, but our investigator didnt uphold it. She said that 
Mr Ms credit file did not suggest  that he had been in financial difficulty  at the time of the 
loan. She said he had declared  a disposable income  of nearly £1,000,  which was more  than 
enough to cover the loan repayments  of £132 a month. She said Mr M had run into difficulty  
because he had subsequently been made  redundant, causing a drop in his income.
Mr M asked  for an ombudsmans decision.  He said hed made a lot of applications for credit  
in the months  leading  up to the loan,  and hed had a lot of loans in the recent  past. These 
should have been warning signs to 118 118.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When Mr M applied for the loan,  he declared an income of £1,933 and outgoings totalling 
£970. This would  have  left him with a disposable  income of £963.  Those  figures, if they had 
been true, would have been more  than enough for him to make his loan repayments.
However, 118 118 didnt take him at his word. It checked his credit file. That was just as well, 
because in his loan application (which  Ive seen)  Mr M had said that he was living  with his 
parents, was paying only £225 towards his accommodation costs,  and had no loans other 
than his credit card.  But his credit file revealed that he had a mortgage  on which he paid 
£446 a month,  and that he had other loans, including  a £3,500  overdraft. 118 118 picked up 
on this, and so it calculated its own figure  for Mr Ms expenditure,  instead  of the figure  he 
had declared. The figure it used was £1,470,  leaving  Mr M with a disposable income of only 
£462. But that was still much  more than the £132  loan repayments,  so it still gave him the 
loan.
That seems  to me to be to be an entirely  fair and reasonable approach. It could even be 
called generous, since Mr M had not been  entirely forthcoming about  his true financial  
situation, and so 118 118 would have been  well within its rights to decline his loan 
application, even  though  he could  still afford  it.
Nevertheless, I havent just relied  on 118 118s calculation. I have reviewed Mr Ms credit  file 
myself. Having done so, I can see three  loans that 118 118 didnt take into account. Two of 
these were very recent,  having  been  sold only a few days earlier, so these wouldnt have 
Ref: DRN50791472appeared on his credit  file yet. Therefore 118 118 couldnt have known about them, except if 
Mr M had mentioned them, which he didnt. So I certainly wont  blame 118 118 for not 
counting these. Nevertheless, I will still include them in my own calculations, for no reason. 
Mr Ms monthly repayments on these loans  were £246 and £117.
The third loan I have  mentioned was one which was sold in February 2018, which had a 
balance of £460 and on which Mr M was making  monthly payments of £23. I dont know why 
118 118 missed it, but I dont think that matters because £23 wouldnt have affected its 
decision.
118 118 didnt  know how much Mr M was paying each month towards  his overdraft, so it 
assumed this was £150. I think that is reasonable, and so I have  adopted the same figure.
I have no reason to doubt Mr Ms declared income,  since he hasnt suggested that it was 
wrong. So I have  calculated his disposable  income  in July 2018 as follows:
Income: £1,933
Expenditure:
Mortgage: £446
Overdraft repayments: £150
Credit card repayments: £86
Other loans: £246  + £117 + £23 = £386
Utilities: £100 (this figure is verified by the credit file, which  gives £65 for gas and £35 
for electricity)
Council tax: £70
Food: £200
Childcare: 75
Insurance: £200

Total expenditure = £1,713
Disposable income = £1,933  £1,713 = £220
Since that is still more  than £132, I still think the loan was affordable when Mr M applied  for 
it.
Mr M had had a lot of previous loans which had all been settled by then. But he had had no 
defaults against him in the last three  years, and he had paid all those loans off, so 118 118 
wasnt obliged to hold those against  him. His worst payment status in the last three years 
had been three months in arrears. That wouldnt automatically deter a responsible lender.
my final decision
So my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 September  2020.
