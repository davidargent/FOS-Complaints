K820x#14Complaint
Mr S complains on behalf of his business  which I will refer to as U. He says WorldPay (UK) 
Limited wont release  payments made to U. 
Background
Mr S used a merchant account with WorldPay. This account was used for Mr Ss clothing 
business to accept online payments. 
WorldPay carried out a review of the account in May 2018.
Worldpay reviewed his account. Following its review, it asked Mr S details of their suppliers 
and their customers. They sent a letter dated  29 May 2018 which informed Mr S that funds 
would be withheld in accordance with the terms of the contract  pending the supply of these 
details.
WorldPay contacted  Mr S on 12 June to terminate the contract giving  2 months notice.  The 
account was closed on 14 August 2018.WorldPay  said they would not be willing  to release 
the funds they held for 120 days pending  any chargeback claims from customers of Mr S.
Mr S was unhappy with the situation,  so he complained to WorldPay in September 2018. In 
response WorldPay said they could review  an account and retain funds  as per their 
Merchant Services terms and conditions  and the customer operating  instructions.  They  said 
they would  review the account at the end of the chargeback liability period of 120 days.
At the end of the 120 days  WorldPay hadnt released Us funds so Mr S complained to our 
service.
Our investigator looked into the complaint. he said he didnt  think  WorldPay had done  
anything wrong  by retaining  the funds after the 120 days as they were still carrying on with 
their investigations. World Pay were  following  the terms of the Merchant Service  Agreement 
in particular section  5.4 and 5.5. He said he had seen evidence that the review was ongoing 
and didnt think WorldPay had caused any unnecessary delay.
Mr S disagreed with the investigators view.  He said he had provided  WorldPay  with all the 
documents they needed to carry out their review  and was still unhappy that they were  
holding Us funds. 
As there was no agreement the matter has come  to me to decide.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill start by setting out some context for the review  of Mr Ss account. UK legislation  places 
extensive obligations on regulated financial businesses.  Financial institutions  must establish 
the purpose and intended  nature  of transactions as well as the origin of funds, and there 
may be penalties if they dont. This applies to both new and existing relationships. These 
obligations override  all other obligations.  Businesses  are also required to carry out ongoing  
Ref: DRN78975522monitoring of an existing  business relationship. WorldPay has said Mr Ss account was 
reviewed and the funds retained to meet these obligations.
The crux of Mr Ss complaint is that WorldPay have retained the funds in his account past 
the 120 days they originally  said. I appreciate  Mr S is unhappy  that WorldPay  are still 
retaining his funds and he says he has provided  them with all the information  they have 
requested. 
I have looked  at the terms and conditions of Us contract with WorldPay which Mr S agreed 
to when he entered into the contract with Worldpay. And as the investigator said WorldPay 
are able to retain the funds even after the 120-day  chargeback period.
I have also seen evidence  to suggest  that Worldpay are acting reasonably and continuing to 
review Mr Ss account and as such it would be unfair for me to require them  to make the 
funds available  to U whilst  the review is still ongoing.
Ive already said that WorldPay has procedures it must follow to comply  with its legal and 
regulatory obligations. Im satisfied that is what its doing during the review of Mr Ss 
account.
I know Mr S will be disappointed with my decision.  But I am satisfied that WorldPay  have not 
caused any unnecessary delay in the review  of his account.
In summary  I find that WorldPay  is entitled  to continue to review Us account and retain 
funds whilst it is carrying out this review. As Ive said I dont think WorldPay have caused any 
unnecessary delays so it follows  that I will not be asking WorldPay  to do anything  else.
My final decision
For the reasons  mentioned above  I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 August 2020.
