Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Fs complaint in part; he didnt think  that MYJAR  was wrong to 
lend loans 1 to 4 and loan 8. But our adjudicator thought loans 5 to 7 shouldnt  have  been  
given. MYJAR disagreed  and the complaint was passed to me.
Since the adjudication, Ms F hasnt disagreed with the adjudicators  findings  on loans 1 to 4 
and loan 8. As these  loans are no longer in dispute  and my decision focusses on 
loans 5 to 7.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
I am not quoting all the specific  regulations  here, because I would expect MYJAR to be 
familiar with these through previous ombudsman decisions, particularly recent  decisions,  
which set these rules out in more detail.
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms F 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN61425172the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Ms F could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. The previous regulators (the OFT) Irresponsible
Lending Guidance  (ILG) defined sustainability in similar terms and applies to Ms Fs earlier 
loans. And it follows that a lender  should  realise,  or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  
that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be 
able to make  their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Fs complaint.
MYJAR has said that it carried out a number of checks  before lending  any of the loans, it 
said it searched Ms Fs credit file and worked  out her credit commitments.  It also said it 
checked her monthly  income and expenses. 
By loan 5, I think MYJARs checks should have gone further, I say this because this was 
now Ms Fs fifth loan in as many months. And by this stage,  MYJAR  shouldve been 
checking Ms Fs short term commitments as well. And for loans 6 and 7, MYJAR should 
have been carrying  out a full review of Ms Fs finances before agreeing  to lend.
And had MYJAR  carried out what I consider proportionate checks, it would  have seen that at 
the time of loans  5 to 7 Ms F was borrowing from more than three  other short term lenders  
and during the period,  she had over £1,000 outstanding to other  lenders. This suggests that 
Ms F wasnt in a position  to sustainably afford these loans.
I think Ms Fs struggle  to sustainably afford these loans is borne  out by her need to borrow  
again so quickly  after repaying a previous loan. For example,  Ms F took out loan 5 six days 
after repaying loan 4 and the short time between loans was again repeated when Ms F took 
out loans 6 and 7.
In the circumstances, MYJAR shouldnt have lent Ms F loans  5 to 7 and Im upholding 
Ms Fs complaint about those loans  and MYJAR needs to put things right.
Ref: DRN61425173Putting things  right  what  MYJAR  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms F paid on loans 5 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5 to 7 from Ms Fs credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Ms F a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Fs complaint. MYJAR Limited 
should pay Ms F compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 August 2019.
