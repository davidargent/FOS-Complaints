The complaint
Mr I complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles unfairly recorded a default and arrears. 
Hes also unhappy that hes received letters despite being in a debt management plan.
What happened
Mr I held a Marbles credit card. He experienced financial difficulties and entered into a debt 
management plan. Under the plan, Mr I agreed to make monthly payments of £26.81 to 
NewDay. NewDay removed the arrears from Mr Is account on 4 April 2022 and Mr I made a 
payment of £26.81 on 5 April 2022.
NewDay produced a statement of account on 7 April 2022, it says it received no payment 
from Mr I between 7 April and 15 June 2022 and because of this it sent a default letter to Mr 
I on 16 June 2022.
Mr I complained to NewDay. He felt that the arrears and the default had been unfairly 
recorded. NewDay didnt uphold the complaint. It said it hadnt received the correct 
payments and that the arrears were valid.
Our investigator upheld the complaint. He said that Mr I had agreed to make monthly 
payments irrespective of the date when statements of account were produced. The 
investigator said that Mr I had made a monthly payment on 5 April 2022 for the month of 
April, and that NewDay had acted unfairly in sending 60 day arrears notices and recording a 
default.
NewDay didnt respond to the investigators view so Ive been asked to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay says that Mr I missed two payments which should have been made between 7 April 
2022 and 15 June 20922. This period encompasses two statement of account periods with 
statements generated on 7th of each month.
Mr I agreed to make a monthly payment to NewDay via his debt management plan. I havent 
seen anything to suggest that NewDay required the payment to be made on a particular 
date. Because hes in a debt management plan, Mr I has no control over the date that the 
payment is made.
I can see that Mr I made his payment for April 2022 on 5 April 2022. He made his payment 
for June 2022 on 15 June 2022. He missed his payment in May 2022. Notwithstanding the 
missed payment in May 2022, I dont think NewDay had acted fairly in implementing a 60-
day arrears notice. Im satisfied that Mr I met his payment obligations in April and June and 
there arent 60 days arrears here.
Putting things right
To put things right, NewDay must amend its records so that payments received from Mr I are 
recorded as being received for the month in which they were paid, irrespective of the date 
when the statement of account was generated. NewDay must show the April obligation as 
satisfied and the June obligation as satisfied. It must then correct the position by reversing 
the default notice and removing the default.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles must take 
the steps Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 February 2023.
