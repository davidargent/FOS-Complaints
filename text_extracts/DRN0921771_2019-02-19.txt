K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains, through  his financial  adviser,  that Northern Bank Limited (the business) mis-
sold a whole of life (WOL)  plan to him as it wasnt suitable because it was to protect a 
business loan over 10 years and he was single with no dependents  when it was sold to him.
background
Mr B saw an adviser in 1997 as he wanted protection  for a business loan he had taken out 
with a term of 10 years.  He was recommended a WOL plan which  provided  £100,000 of life 
cover and £50,000 of Critical  Illness Cover  (CIC).  This was taken out on a maximum sum 
assured basis with a review after the first 10 years  and every  five years  after that. 
The WOL plan was automatically subject to indexation  Mr B had to opt out of this if he 
didnt want it  which he didnt do. The way the indexation worked was that another  policy 
would be issued each  year providing a small amount of additional  cover  with a premium  
payable for that amount of cover. These policies were also subject to reviews at 10 years  
from their start, and every  five years thereafter.
Mr Bs original  plan was reviewed in 2008.  He was told that the sum assured would have to 
reduce to around £52,000 life cover  and £26,000 CIC. The original plan was reviewed again  
in 2012 when Mr B was informed that the sum assured  would reduce again,  this time to 
£42,000 for life cover  and £21,000  for CIC.
In addition to the reviews  for the original plan, Mr B has received reviews  for the additional  
policies taken out as a result of indexation,  starting  in 2012. These reviews also referred  to 
having to reduce the sum assured  for each policy as they were  reviewed.
Each time a policy was reviewed Mr B was also given  the option  of taking out a new policy to 
cover the difference between the initial sum assured and the reduced sum assured.  He 
never took up this option so his various policies were reduced  without  any attempt by him to 
make up the shortfall  by way of additional policies.
Despite this, as a result of the policies issued  as a result of indexation  Mr Bs total level of 
cover was £120,000  for life cover  and over £60,000  for CIC as of 2013.
Mr B complained to Northern Bank  Limited in November 2017  after seeing his adviser. After 
much correspondence  an ombudsman ruled  that this complaint was made within  time. 
One of our adjudicators considered the complaint and thought it should be upheld in part. In 
summary he said:
Its puzzling why Mr B didnt take out a 10 year term assurance policy.  
Although we havent been offered a copy of the loan agreement, the Mr Bs adviser  
said that the business loan was for £50,000  and yet the sum assured was for 
£100,000.  
Its not clear why Mr B went  with double the cover or continued to keep it long after 
the original loan was paid off, and why CIC was added for an open term and not just 
10 years.   
He recommended a partial uphold and recommended that all premiums paid 
between year 11 to 17 (2007 to 2013), less the cost of a life cover  and CIC, with 8% 
interest refunded.  But, no refund  of premiums  for years 1-10 (1997 to 2007).  
Ref: DRN09217712The policy wasnt fundamentally flawed but designed to keep options  open for the 
future, for someone whose circumstances may change. It also included  combined 
benefits that may have been  expensive  to purchase  separately, so was likely to have 
been good value in 1997. 
  
Mr Bs adviser disagreed  with the adjudicators  view.  In summary he said:
Whilst he understood the basis of the proposed redress, he didnt think it worked. 
What Mr B should  have  had was a 10 year decreasing  term assurance  policy. 
Instead he had an index linked plan. 
He doesnt  agree with the deduction  in the cost of life cover for the refund of 
premiums for year 11-17 because it was a cover Mr B shouldnt  have had and didnt 
need. Whether or not he had the benefit  of it, it wasnt suitable. 
He proposed a different redress calculation.  
As no agreement has been reached the matter  has been passed to me for review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
adjudicators conclusions for much the same  reasons. Im going  to partially uphold this 
complaint. 
The business has accepted the adjudicators  view and proposed redress  but Mr Bs adviser 
hasnt. Therefore the issue for me to consider, in the main, is whether  the proposed redress  
and deductions  for life cover and or CIC are fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 
In this case I dont think  its fair or reasonable to refund  the premiums for the period between  
1997 and 2007, less the cost of a 10 year decreasing term assurance policy,  for £50,000 life 
cover and £50,000 CIC, as canvassed by Mr Bs adviser.   
This part of my consideration relates  directly to the business loan, which may well be for 
£50,000, which may mean that Mr B didnt technically need more cover  than the loan 
amount or the indexation. 
But Im mindful that Mr B paid a very competitive price for the cover  he had in respect of the 
loan, and that life cover alone would have cost just under £15 of what  he was paying for 
£100,000 life cover and £50,000 CIC. 
Whilst Ive not seen a separate quote for the CIC alone, its unlikely to be cheaper taking two 
separate policies.  And in any event the bulk of the premiums  paid usually go towards the 
cost of the CIC. So, by comparison  Im not sure that Mr Bs lost out particularly as Im 
satisfied he needed  the CIC.    
I appreciate the points  made by Mr Bs adviser about the suitably and need for the plan after 
10 years,  but despite what he says, Im unable  to agree with his points.  
Even if there  was no need for the plan after 10 years  when the loan had been paid back  
which on balance I dont  think there was  Mr B continued with it long after this point, of his 
own volition.  
Ref: DRN09217713I note he didnt cancel  the plan until after he met his adviser in 2013  and its unclear why 
he didnt cancel in 2007  but I cant simply disregard the fact that the business was still on 
risk for the whole period  between 2007  and 2013.  And it doesnt seem  fair that he should  
have the benefit of free cover for this whole period. 
Its likely  that in the event  of a valid claim by Mr B the business would have paid out the sum 
assured. It wouldnt have been  an excuse  for the business to say that Mr B didnt want or 
need the cover.
Its for this reason I agree  with the adjudicator that Mr B should be refunded  the premiums 
for the period between 2007  and 2013 less the cost of life cover, with 8% simple  interest  
from the date of payment to the date of settlement.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I partially uphold this complaint. 
Northern Bank Limited should:
1.Refund all premiums  paid between 2007  and 2013, less the cost of life cover.  
2.Add 8 % simple interest  from the date of payment  to the date of settlement.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 March  2019.
