K821x#15complaint
Mr J complains that a wooden summerhouse that he paid for using  a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Omni Capital Retail Finance Limited wasnt  of satisfactory quality.
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
adjudicator so I wont repeat them again  here. Instead Ill focus on giving  the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the adjudicator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit  Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against  the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been  a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier - to be able to uphold  Mr Js complaint about Omni Capital, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation  by the supplier 
of the summerhouse  and that Omni Capitals response to his claim under section 75 
wasnt fair or reasonable (Im not determining the outcome  of Mr Js claim under  
section 75 as only a court  would be able to do that);
Mr J paid the supplier for the summerhouse  using a loan agreement  with Omni 
Capital that he electronically signed  in July 2018  and the agreement  shows that he 
paid a deposit of £175.80 - and he signed a satisfaction note in September 2018  to 
confirm that it had been installed  correctly;
he says that the supplier repaired  some  issues with the summerhouse during  the 
following winter but that there are still issues with it so he wants to reject it  and hes 
provided photos and video evidence  in support of his complaint and also a report 
from a joiner which refers to the poor build quality of the summerhouse;
Omni Capital credited  £100 to the loan agreement as a gesture of goodwill and has 
confirmed that the loan has been settled;
the adjudicator  upheld  Mr Js complaint and recommended that Omni Capital should: 
refund to him all of the payments that hed made  towards the finance agreement 
(including any deposit) with interest; pay him £150 for the distress and inconvenience 
that this has caused  him; arrange  for the summerhouse to be removed at no cost to 
him; and remove the agreement from Mr Js credit  record;
Omni Capital hasnt accepted those recommendations and said that it would be 
providing an independent report on the summerhouse but hasnt done so;
having reviewed  all of the evidence, but particularly the photos and videos that Mr J 
has provided and the report from the joiner,  I consider  it to be more  likely than not 
that the summerhouse isnt of a satisfactory  quality  and that the repairs havent  
properly remedied the issues  with it;
Ref: DRN66637042I consider that to be a breach of contract by the supplier for which Omni Capital is 
jointly liable;
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for the supplier to undertake 
further repairs of the summerhouse and I consider  that it would be fair and 
reasonable for Mr J to reject the summerhouse;
so I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Omni  Capital  
to refund to Mr J all of the payments  that hes under the loan agreement,  including 
the deposit, with interest, and that it should remove the loan agreement  from his 
credit file;
I also consider that it should arrange and pay for the summerhouse to be removed; 
and
these events have  caused distress  and inconvenience to Mr J and I consider that it 
would also be fair and reasonable for Omni  Capital  to pay him a further  £150  to 
compensate him for that distress  and inconvenience.
 
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Js complaint and I order  Omni Capital 
Retail Finance Limited to:
1.Refund to Mr J all of the payments that hes made under the agreement, including 
the deposit.
2.Pay interest on those  amounts  at an annual rate of 8% simple  from the date of each  
payment to the date of settlement.
3.Remove the loan agreement  from Mr Js credit  file.
4.Pay a further  £150 to Mr J to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that 
hes been caused.
HM Revenue & Customs  requires Omni  Capital  to deduct tax from the interest payment 
referred to above.  Omni Capital must give Mr J a certificate showing how much  tax its 
deducted if he asks it for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 July 2020.
