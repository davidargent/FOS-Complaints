The complaint
Mr H has complained that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has requested he provide further 
identification in order for him to continue using his account.
What happened
Mr H is unhappy that PayPal placed a limitation on his account on 14 January 2018. In order 
to lift the limitation, PayPal requested that Mr H provide further identification (ID). But Mr H 
feels this is unfair as he has already provided ID and he says he is exempt from sending this 
again. So, Mr H wants PayPal to allow him to continue accessing his account without the 
further ID being provided. He also feels that PayPal should compensate him for the distress 
and inconvenience this has caused and to delete the ID he has already provided from its 
records.
PayPal looked into Mr Hs concerns, but it didnt think it had acted unfairly, it said that it 
requested further ID to fulfil its duty to know their customer better as he was using his 
account more. It went on to say it would allow Mr H to continue using the account once it had 
received the identification documents it requested which were, photographic identification or 
a birth certificate, and proof of address from the last twelve months.
Mr H remained unhappy, so he referred his complaint to our service. Our investigator looked 
into the complaint, but she didnt recommend it be upheld. So, Mr H asked for the case to be 
referred to an ombudsman.  
However, prior to the case being passed to me to consider, PayPal agreed to accept Mr Hs 
polling card as acceptable ID and the limitation on his account was lifted. But Mr H still felt it 
was unfair that the limitation was applied in the first place, so the case was passed to me to 
consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the investigators findings for broadly the same reasons. I will 
explain why.
I have reviewed PayPals User Agreement which says:
Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we 
notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as 
unusual or suspicious. Limitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping 
your PayPal account open.
It goes on to list when limitations can be applied, and also outlines that it can also limit a 
PayPal account in order to comply with applicable law. PayPal explain in the user agreement 
that once the customer has provided the information requested, it usually removes the 
limitation.
So, when considering if PayPal did anything wrong in applying a limitation to Mr Hs account, 
I cant say it did, as it acted in line with its user agreement. This is put in place to protect its 
customers and to ensure it is complying with the relevant law. I appreciate that Mr H wants 
to understand the specific reason as to why PayPal put a limitation on his account, but 
PayPal doesnt have to provide this. However, having reviewed the final response letter 
issued on 4 February 2021, it says they are required to know more information about its 
customers as they use its services more. Having reviewed the user agreement terms, it 
outlines a limitation may be put in place for this reason. As such, I am satisfied that PayPal 
has acted in line with its user agreement and have explained this to Mr H.
I acknowledge that Mr H did provide proof of his address and his birth certificate when 
PayPal requested him to do so. PayPal needed this information in order to verify Mr H. 
However, having looked at Mr Hs birth certificate and proof of address, it appears that the 
names on the ID differ, as such PayPal were unbale to verify Mr H.
Mr H has said this is due to him temporarily changing his name. But PayPal wasnt made 
aware of this change. And so, it couldnt accept the documentation Mr H had provided and 
therefore the limitation remained in place. Again, I dont think this is unreasonable. I say this 
because it was important PayPal was able to verify Mr H in order to protect him and other 
customers. However, I am pleased to see that when Mr H provided his polling card, PayPal 
was able to verify him and remove the limitation.
Mr H asked PayPal to remove his ID from its systems. But PayPal has explained that it is 
required to hold this information in order to comply with the relevant law. And the retention 
time is 10 years from the date when the customer closes an account or the date of last 
significant activity on an open account. Again, I cant say PayPal has acted unfairly in 
relation to this. In line with GDPR, Mr H has the right to ask for his information to be deleted 
if its no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected, but its for PayPal to determine 
whether it still needs to process the ID he provided. However, if Mr H remains unhappy with 
how PayPal is processing his information, he can refer the matter to the Independent 
Commissioners Office (ICO).
Overall, I am satisfied PayPal has acted in line with its user agreement and so I wont be 
asking it to do anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 July 2021.
