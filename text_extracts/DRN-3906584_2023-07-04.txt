The complaint
Mr and Mrs H complain that Vacation Finance Limited, trading as VFL Finance Solutions, 
wont refund to them the money that they paid for some holiday products. Theyre being 
represented in their complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs H bought holiday club memberships from a holiday company in September 2013 
and September and December 2014. They entered into finance agreements with a finance 
provider to pay for part of the costs of those memberships. 
They entered into a membership application agreement in September 2017 to buy another 
holiday club membership. The membership application fee was £75,639, they paid £10,800 
by bank transfer and they entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Vacation Finance for 
a loan of £64,839. They agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £842.55 to Vacation 
Finance.
Mr and Mrs Hs representative made claims to Vacation Finance under sections 75 and 
140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in September 2020. It said that the products were 
misrepresented to Mr and Mrs H, the contracts were breached, commission was paid 
between Vacation Finance and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr and 
Mrs H, the finance agreements were unaffordable and the lending was irresponsible. 
Vacation Finance didnt issue a substantive response to those claims so a complaint was 
made to this service. Vacation Finance then provided a detailed response to Mr and Mrs Hs 
claims but it said that their September 2017 purchase was the only purchase funded (in part) 
by a loan from it. It set out the reasons that it didnt uphold any of their claims and it said that 
it had seen no evidence which would lead it to conclude that the membership that Mr and 
Mrs H had bought in September 2017 was mis-sold or misrepresented at the point of sale 
and it said that it had lent to them in a responsible manner.
Our investigator recommended that Mr and Mrs Hs complaint should be upheld. He said 
that this service was unable to help Mr and Mrs H in respect of their first three purchases as 
the loans werent provided by Vacation Finance, the activities complained about werent 
regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the brokering and lending for each loan 
took place outside the territory of this services jurisdiction. He also said the total price of the 
membership that they bought in September 2017 was more than £30,000 (which is the 
maximum limit for a claim under section 75) so he didnt think that Vacation Finance would 
be acting unfairly by not accepting Mr and Mrs Hs claim under section 75. But he said that 
he was able to consider their allegations about misrepresentation under section 140A and 
whether it gave rise to an unfair relationship between them and Vacation Finance Limited. 
He also said that he needed to consider whether there were other issues that would render 
the relationship unfair.
He thought that the holiday company had misrepresented the membership to Mr and Mrs H 
as something that they would receive a return on but the evidence suggested that that 
couldnt have been the case. He said that Mr and Mrs H had paid for a product that they 
wouldnt have purchased if not for the misrepresentation so theyd suffered a loss. He 
thought that Vacation Finance was wrong to decline their section 140A claim and that a court 
would likely find the debtor-creditor relationship unfair at the point of sale. 
He recommended that Vacation Finance should put Mr and Mrs H in the position they would 
have been in if they hadnt bought the membership so it should: refund the repayments 
made to Vacation Finance less the market value of any holidays that they took using their 
membership; write off any outstanding balance under the loan agreement; refund any 
deposits, management charges and other charges paid by Mr and Mrs H from the time of 
sale onwards; pay interest on those amounts; remove any adverse information recorded on 
Mr and Mrs Hs credit file as a result of the loan; and either procure Mr and Mrs Hs release 
from their obligations to the holiday company or agree to take over their points and/or 
indemnify them for any future maintenance costs. 
He asked both parties to provide their submissions on what they thought the market value 
was at the time of those holidays along with supporting evidence and he said that, if neither 
side provided such submissions, it would be reasonable to use the relevant annual 
management charges as an estimate of what those holidays were worth on the open market.
Vacation Finance hasnt responded to our investigators recommendations so Ive been 
asked to issue a decision on Mr and Mrs Hs complaint. Their representative has also raised 
its serious concerns about the way in which the finance was sold to Mr and Mrs H.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr and Mrs Hs claims are made under sections 75 and 140A about the four 
memberships that they bought from the holiday company between September 2013 
and September 2017 but the finance that they used to pay for at least part of the cost 
of their purchases in September 2013 and September and December 2014 was 
provided by a company that isnt Vacation Finance;
our investigator said that those loans werent provided by Vacation Finance, the 
activities complained about werent regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and 
the brokering and lending for each loan took place outside the territory of this 
services jurisdiction  and, as those loans werent provided by Vacation Finance, I 
consider that Im unable to include those loans in this decision so Im only 
considering Mr and Mrs Hs complaint about Vacation Finances response to the 
claims that they made relating to the September 2017 agreement; 
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
one of those circumstances is that section 75 doesnt apply to a claim that relates to 
any single item to which the supplier has attached a cash price of more than £30,000 
 the application fee for the membership that Mr and Mrs H bought in September 
2017 was £75,639 so I consider that the holiday company had attached a cash price 
of more than £30,000 to the membership so Mr and Mrs H arent able to make a 
claim under section 75;but, in these circumstances, Im able to consider whether the claims that Mr and 
Mrs H have made about the membership being misrepresented caused their 
relationship with Vacation Finance to have been unfair under section 140A;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor so, in this decision 
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Hs claim under section 140A as only 
a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Vacation 
Finances response to their claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Hs representatives letter to Vacation Finance in September 2020 said 
that the holiday company represented to Mr and Mrs H that the membership would 
be an investment that would increase in value and they would be able to sell it after a 
few years at a considerable profit but that was untrue and that the misrepresentation, 
amongst other things, caused their relationship with Vacation Finance to be unfair;
Mr and Mrs H signed documents in September 2017 including the membership 
application agreement, the holiday companys terms and conditions, a declaration of 
fair sales practice, a significant information form, a standard form of the withdrawal 
notice that could be given, an internal disclosure document, an internal exchange 
checklist, pre-contract credit information and the loan agreement;
Mr H has provided a witness statement in which he says that he was told that the 
holiday company was planning to build a series of freehold villas and apartments 
adjacent to the hotel on land that it had apparently procured with access to the beach 
and that he and his wife were advised that they would be able to part-exchange their 
memberships for the purchase of one of those properties and that investing in the 
membership in September 2017 to increase their total investment was the best 
course of action;
hes also provided e-mails that he exchanged with the holiday company about the 
progress of the building work and was told that the plans were simply awesome and 
that the building work had begun, and his need to realise part of his investment  I 
consider that those e-mails support Mr and Mrs Hs claim that the membership was 
sold to them as an investment;
Mr and Mrs H had bought memberships in September 2013 and September and 
December 2014 and I dont consider it to be likely that they would have spent 
£75,639 on another membership unless they considered it to be an investment and 
would receive something in the future in return for their investment  I also dont 
consider that it would be reasonable to conclude that Mr and Mrs H were going to 
use all of their memberships for holidays;
the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 
prohibit the holiday company from marketing or selling the membership as an 
investment;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the membership was likely to increase in value or 
that Mr and Mrs H would be able to resell it for a profit so I consider it to be more 
likely than not that the holiday company misrepresented the membership to Mr and 
Mrs H as an investment that would increase in value and that they could easily re-sell 
in the future;
I consider that Mr and Mrs H were induced into buying the membership in September 
2017 by the misrepresentation that was made to them by the holiday company and 
that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them;I consider that they entered into the loan agreement with Vacation Finance to pay for 
£64,839 of the price of the membership as a result of that misrepresentation and that 
the misrepresentation caused their relationship with Vacation Finance to be unfair;
I consider it to be more likely than not in these circumstances that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs H and Vacation 
Finance so I consider that Vacation Finances response to Mr and Mrs Hs section 
140A claim wasnt fair or reasonable;
I find that their complaint should be upheld and that it would be fair and reasonable 
for Vacation Finance to take the actions described below to put Mr and Mrs H back in 
the position that they would have been in if the membership hadnt been 
misrepresented to them; and
as Im upholding their complaint on that basis I make no finding on the other issues 
that Mr and Mrs Hs representative said caused Mr and Mrs Hs relationship with 
Vacation Finance to be unfair, that the loan agreement was unaffordable and the 
lending was irresponsible or its concerns about the way that the loan was sold to 
them.
Putting things right
Our investigator recommended that Vacation Finance should: refund the repayments made 
to Vacation Finance less the market value of any holidays that they took using their 
membership; write off any outstanding balance under the loan agreement; refund any 
deposits, management charges and other charges paid by Mr and Mrs H from the time of 
sale onwards; pay interest on those amounts; remove any adverse information recorded on 
Mr and Mrs Hs credit file as a result of the loan; and either procure Mr and Mrs Hs release 
from their obligations to the holiday company or agree to take over their points and/or 
indemnify them for any future maintenance costs. 
He asked both parties to provide their submissions on what they thought the market value 
was at the time of those holidays along with supporting evidence and he said that, if neither 
side provided such submissions, it would be reasonable to use the relevant annual 
management charges as an estimate of what those holidays were worth on the open market. 
Vacation Finance hasnt responded to our investigators recommendations and none of Mr 
and Mrs H and their representative has provided any submissions as to the market value of 
any holidays that Mr and Mrs H took using the membership that they bought in September 
2017 so I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances to use the annual 
management charges as an estimate of the market value of their holidays. 
The membership application fee under the membership application agreement that Mr and 
Mrs H entered into in September 2017 was £75,639 and they paid £10,800 of that amount 
by bank transfer and entered into the loan agreement with Vacation Finance for a loan of 
£64,839. I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Vacation Finance to refund to Mr and 
Mrs H the payment of £10,800 that they made, with interest from the date of payment to the 
date of settlement. 
I find that it would also be fair and reasonable for Vacation Finance to refund to Mr and 
Mrs H the payments that theyve made to it under the loan agreement, with interest from the 
date of each payment to the date of settlement, to write-off any outstanding balance under 
the loan agreement and to end that agreement, and to remove any adverse information that 
its recorded on Mr and Mrs Hs credit files relating to the loan agreement.
I find that it would also be fair and reasonable for Vacation Finance to arrange for the 
membership that Mr and Mrs H bought in September 2017 to be cancelled (including releasing them from any further obligation to the holiday company) or agree to take over 
their membership or indemnify them for any future liability (including maintenance charges) 
that they incur as a result of the membership.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr and Mrs Hs complaint and I order Vacation Finance Limited, 
trading as VFL Finance Solutions, to:
1. Refund to Mr and Mrs H the £10,800 that they paid to the holiday company.
2. Refund to Mr and Mrs H the payments that theyve made to it under the loan 
agreement.
3. Pay interest on the amounts at 2 and 3 above at an annual rate of 8% simple from 
the date of each payment to the date of settlement.
4. Write-off any outstanding balance under the loan agreement and end the loan 
agreement.
5. Remove any adverse information that its recorded on Mr and Mrs Hs credit files 
relating to the loan agreement.
6. Arrange for the membership that Mr and Mrs H bought in September 2017 to be 
cancelled (including releasing them from any further obligation to the holiday 
company) or agree to take over their membership or indemnify them for any future 
liability (including maintenance charges) that they incur as a result of the 
membership.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Vacation Finance to deduct tax from the interest payments 
to be made to Mr and Mrs H and Vacation Finance must give them certificates showing how 
much tax its deducted if they ask it for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H and Mr H to 
accept or reject my decision before 1 August 2023.
