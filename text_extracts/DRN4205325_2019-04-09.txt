K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that Vanquis  Bank  Limited (Vanquis) has rejected his claim under section 
75 of the Consumer Credit Act (1974) (s75).
background
Mr B had a conservatory built in 2018.  He says the invoiced price was £30,500  but this was 
reduced to £26,500  when  he changed  the Velux window to a fixed  pane and kept the kitchen 
window in situ. He paid a £3,000 deposit using his Vanquis credit card and then made 
subsequent payments of 23,500 from another bank account.
But when the building  inspectors reviewed the work they refused to approve it. They  said it 
didnt comply with building regulations and noted many faults. 
Mr B tried to contact  the builders but they didnt reply. So he made  a claim to Vanquis under 
s75. He said,  as the finance providers, they were equally liable.
But Vanquis disagreed. They said the invoice for the work was actually  £30,500 and this was 
more than the £30,000 limit for s75 claims.  They explained that, whilst Mr B had paid 
£26,500, he still owed  £4,000 and the builders had offered, through  their solicitors, to rectify 
any work to building control standards if Mr B paid the £4,000 balance. They said this 
showed the total invoice  was therefore  for £30,500 and as such  it was in excess  of the s75 
limit and they could  not process Mr Bs claim.
But Mr B didnt agree. He referred his complaint to this service and our investigator looked  at 
the evidence.  The investigator agreed with Vanquis. He was satisfied that the invoice 
amount was for £30,500  and not £26,500 as hed not seen anything from Mr B that 
suggested the original invoice had been  amended downwards. He noted that the builders 
were still claiming for the balance of that original invoice and he thought  they wouldnt be 
doing so if the agreement  had been for any other  amount.  So it appeared that Mr B had 
chosen to pay £26,500 but the sum due was £30,500 and this was in excess  of the 
maximum allowed for a claim under s75. So the investigator thought  Vanquis  were right to 
refuse to consider  Mr Bs claim and they didnt need  to take any further action.
But Mr B disagreed and he asked  for a final decision by an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I agree  with the investigators view and for similar reasons.  Please  let me explain why.
Where the information  Ive got is incomplete,  unclear or contradictory, as some of it is here I 
have to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
Ive read and considered the whole  file, but Ill concentrate my comments  on what I think  is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on 
board and think about  it but because I dont  think  I need  to comment  on it in order to reach 
what I think is the right outcome.
Ref: DRN42053252When something goes  wrong  and the payment was made, in part or whole, with a credit 
card, it might  be possible to recover the money paid through a section 75 claim. This section 
of the Consumer Credit  Act (1974) says that in certain circumstances,  a finance provider can 
be responsible  for a breach of contract or a misrepresentation  made by the supplier. 
But there are financial limits. The Act says that the claim must relate to an item that costs 
more than £100 and no more than £30,000.
And here Im not persuaded theres  been sufficient evidence to demonstrate  thats the case.  
I think its more likely than not that the agreed  price  was £30,500 which  means that Vanquis 
dont need to consider Mr Bs claim as its in excess of the limitation  set by the relevant 
legislation.
I say that because the only invoice Ive seen is for £30,500. I understand Mr B says he had 
an agreement with the builders for a lesser sum but Ive not seen any evidence  of this. 
Theres been no evidence  provided of further correspondence with the builders that I think  
would most  likely have  taken place if the amount payable was only £26,500. The builders 
demands also seem in line with them expecting a further payment to bring the total to 
£30,500. Theyve refused to rectify the problems  unless  the balance  of £4,000 is paid.
So Im persuaded  that its most likely  the agreed  cost for the work was £30,500 and, as this 
is greater than the maximum allowed under a s75 claim, I dont think  Vanquis have been 
wrong to advise Mr B they cant consider it.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given above  I dont  uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 May 2019.
