The complaint
Mr I complains that National Westminster Bank Plc restricted access to his account and 
wont release his funds. Hed like the funds to be released and compensation for the impact 
caused to him. 
What happened
Mr I had an account with NatWest. 
On the 4 March 2021 NatWest notified Mr I that theyd restricted access to his account and 
theyd be closing it with immediate effect. 
Mr I complained to NatWest that he couldnt access his funds, however NatWest explained 
theyd acted fairly in closing his account and theyd sent a fund release form to his home 
address. 
Mr I wasnt happy with NatWests response and complained to our service about their failure 
to release his funds.  
One of our investigators looked into Mr Is complaint. 
On the 15 March 2021 Mr I completed and submitted the funds release form to NatWest.  
Our investigator contacted NatWest, and after receiving the funds release form and 
reviewing Mr Is account NatWest made a decision to release his funds on the 16 April 2021. 
And Mr I confirmed hed received the funds on the 19 April 2021. 
After NatWest had released his funds our investigator looked into whether NatWest had 
acted fairly in restricting Mr Is access to them. Mr I explained that he needed the funds 
urgently, because he was undergoing cancer treatment, and his lack of access to them was 
causing him significant distress. Hed like Â£2,500 compensation for the impact this had on 
him. 
Our investigator reviewed Mr Is complaint, but he thought NatWest had acted fairly in 
restricting access to Mr Is account and the amount of time theyd taken before releasing 
Mr Is funds.
Mr I didnt accept our investigators outcome.  In summary he explained he didnt think it was 
fair that the bank hadnt release his funds for over 40 days. 
As Mr I didnt accept our investigators outcome its been passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive reached the same conclusion as our investigator and Ill explain why 
below. 
As Ive explained NatWest have now released Mr Is funds so its my role to consider 
whether they acted fairly in restricting access to his account. 
Businesses have a legal obligation to protect the security of their accounts and to comply 
with various laws and regulations. Mr I agreed to this term as a customer and I think its a 
reasonable term. Im satisfied that NatWest were acting in line with their legal and regulatory 
obligations and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the account when the bank 
initially reviewed and closed Mr Is account.
But I also need to consider the length of time it took the bank to carry out their review. In 
total NatWest took just over 40 days to complete their review. I appreciate to Mr I this felt like 
a long period of time - however I'm satisfied that this was within NatWest's own timescales, 
of 60 days, and a fair amount of time for the bank to complete the review.
In conclusion, I understand that this caused Mr I significant inconvenience and distress but I 
dont think NatWest did anything wrong when it blocked and reviewed his account. Therefore 
I wont be asking them to do anything further here. 
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold Mr Is complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 August 2021.
