The complaint
Mr A has complained that National Westminster Bank (NatWest) didnt fairly or reasonably 
deal with claims under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (CCA) in relation to a holiday product 
bought using his credit card.
What happened
I issued my provisional decision on 17 October 2023 where I set out my preliminary findings. 
I explained that I was minded to reach the same overall outcome as the investigator, but for 
different reasons. 
My provisional decision should be read in conjunction with this decision as it forms part of 
my final decision.  
I gave both parties an opportunity to respond to my provisional decision. The deadline for 
responses has now passed. 
Neither Mr A nor his representatives responded, and NatWest responded to say it had 
nothing further to add. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reconsidered the available evidence in this complaint, I see no reason to depart from 
my provisional decision.
  
I cant fairly say that NatWest can be held responsible for Business Ds alleged 
misrepresentations when the law doesnt impose such a liability. It follows that I dont think 
NatWest need to answer the section 75 claim. 
So, I wont be asking NatWest to do anything further. 
My final decision
For the reasons given in my provisional decision, I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 December 2023.
