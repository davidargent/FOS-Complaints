The complaint
Ms E complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua lent irresponsibly when it approved her 
credit card application and later increased the credit limit. 
What happened
Ms E applied for an Aqua credit card with NewDay in May 2020. In the application, Ms E 
said she was employed with an income of £21,000 and was a tenant. NewDay carried out a 
credit search and found Ms E had around £1,900 of unsecured debt with other businesses. 
No current arrears for Ms Es existing debt or payday loans were found. A CCJ for £400 that 
was 25 months old was noted. 
NewDay says it applied its lending criteria and approved an Aqua credit card with a limit of 
£900.
In October 2021 NewDay increased the credit limit of Ms Es Aqua card to £1,900. 
Last year, Ms E complained to NewDay that it had lent irresponsibly when approving her 
credit card application and then increasing the credit limit. Ms E explained shed applied 
during the pandemic and that the information included on her applications wasnt checked by 
NewDay. NewDay responded to Ms Es complaint and partially upheld it. NewDay didnt 
agree it had lent irresponsibly when approving Ms Es credit card application in 2020. But 
NewDay agreed to refund all interest and charges applied after the credit limit increase to 
£1,900 in October 2021. 
Ms E referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
thought NewDays decision to uphold Ms Es complaint from the point it increased the credit 
limit to £1,900 in October 2021 was a fair way to resolve her complaint. Ms E asked to 
appeal and said NewDay had obtained her credit file from a business Ill call C which isnt a 
credit reference agency. Ms E also said that another case shes referred to us has been 
upheld. As Ms E asked to appeal, her complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our general approach to complaints about unaffordable or irresponsible lending  including 
the key rules, guidance and good industry practice  is set out on our website.
Before agreeing to lend, NewDay needed to complete proportionate checks to be able to 
understand whether the borrowing was sustainable for Ms E. Theres no specific list of 
checks a lender has to complete. While it is down to the lender to decide what specific 
checks to carry out, these should be reasonable and proportionate to the type and amount of 
credit being provided, the length of the term, the frequency and amount of the repayments, 
the total cost of the credit and what it knew about Ms E at the time of application.
When Ms E applied for the Aqua credit card she gave information about her circumstances 
at the time. Ms E said she was employed with an income of £21,000. In addition, NewDay 
carried out a credit search to get a picture of Ms Es finances. In her response to the 
investigator, Ms E said NewDay had relied on credit information provided by a business that 
isnt a credit reference agency. But Ive reviewed NewDays application and can see it did 
complete a full credit search and reviewed Ms Es complete credit file. The credit file 
information obtained by NewDay showed some evidence of historic adverse credit but it was 
over two years old at the point of Ms Es application. And Ms Es credit file showed she was 
up to date with her existing commitments at the point she applied.
Taking all the available evidence into account, Im satisfied the checks NewDay completed 
before approving Ms Es Aqua credit card were reasonable and proportionate. I havent been 
persuaded that the information NewDay obtained during the application process shouldve 
led it to ask Ms E to supply additional information about her circumstances before approving 
the credit card. I havent been persuaded that NewDay lent irresponsibly when it opened the 
Aqua credit card for Ms E. 
NewDay has already upheld Ms Es complaints about the credit limit increases it approved in 
October 2021, so I dont need to make a finding regarding whether it lent irresponsibly. I 
understand NewDay has already confirmed the refund amounts which covered interest and 
charges applied from the point Ms Es credit limits were increased to date. Im satisfied thats 
in line with the approach we take to resolving complaints about irresponsible lending so Im 
not telling NewDay to take any further action. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Ms E but as Im satisfied NewDay has already agreed a 
settlement that is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances, Im not telling it to do anything 
else.   
My final decision
My decision is that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua has already agreed a settlement that is fair 
and reasonable in all the circumstances. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms E to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 June 2023.
