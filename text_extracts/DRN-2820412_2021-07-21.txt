The complaint
Miss H has complained that WAGEME.COM LTD (Wageme) didnt carry out sufficient 
affordability checks before approving her loans. Had it done so, Miss H says Wageme 
wouldnt have granted the loans. 
  
What happened
Miss H took 27 loans from Wageme between May 2014 and June 2016. A summary of her 
borrowing, based on the information provided to us from Wageme can be found below:

Miss H had some problems repaying her final loan, and I understand that towards the end of 
2016 a repayment plan was agreed between Miss H and Wageme. Miss H has also told us 
that she has a default on her credit file which I believe is in relation to this loan. 
In its final response, Wageme confirmed that of the loans it investigated it didnt think it had 
done anything wrong. 
The adjudicator who investigated Miss Hs complaint explained to Wageme why he thought 
we could consider all of the loans as in his view Miss H had complained to this service in 
time. Our adjudicator went on to say that he then thought, that by loan 7 Miss Hs pattern of 
use had become harmful and therefore this loan (and any future loans) were unstainable. 
It appears that Miss H agreed with our adjudicators opinion.
Wageme disagreed with the outcome that had been reached but it did make the following 
offer to settle the case;
pay Miss H £800, and
write off the outstanding balance form loan 27, and
remove any negative information recorded on Miss Hs credit file.
This offer was put to Miss H, who rejected it. 
Wageme then made a new offer, similar to then above expect this time it increased the 
amount it would pay to Miss H to £1,000. 
In addition to this, Wageme provided details of the credit checks that it carried out for each 
loan application. It also provided this service copies of Miss Hs bank statements. Although it 
isnt clear if these were given to Wageme at the point each loan was approved or provided at 
a later date. 
Miss H then rejected the new offer. As no agreement could be reached the complaint has 
been passed to me for a final decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice 
at the time these loans were provided.
Wageme needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss H 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Wageme should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Miss H. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become or was becoming 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Wageme was required to establish 
whether Miss H could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre
unlikely to be able to do so without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all means for Miss Hs complaint. 
Loans 1-6
The adjudicator didnt think Wageme had made an error when it provided these loans and 
Miss H doesnt appear to disagree with the outcome that was reached. 
So, I wont comment further on these loans, or the level of individual checks Wageme 
completed before approving these loans, as I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement 
about them. But as these loans form part of the borrowing relationship Miss H had with the 
Wageme, they are something I have taken into account when considering the later loans she 
borrowed.
Loans 7 - 27
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 7-27 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. But I will say that it seems Wageme took broadly the same 
information for each loan, that being asking Miss H about her income, monthly expenditure 
and the purpose of the loan. 
It also seems that for each loan a credit search was carried out. So, it looks like, based on 
what has been provided, that Wageme didnt do more over time to establish if the lending 
was sustainable, as it should have done. So, I dont think Id be able to conclude (if it was 
needed) that Wageme carried out proportionate checks.  
As I have explained, I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for 
these loans because I didnt consider it necessary to do so. Indeed, Id be inclined to think 
that from loan 7, Wagemes checks really needed to go further than just relying on the 
information Miss H told it and what it saw in the credit checks. At this point in the lending 
relationship, I think Wageme ought to have been verifying Miss Hs income and overall 
expenditure in order to have an accurate understanding of her actual financial position.
So, in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided toMiss H, Wageme also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded 
during the course of its lending relationship with Miss H.  
I think Wageme was wrong to have provided loans 7-27 because Miss H wasnt in a position 
to sustainably repay them for the following reasons:
At this point Wageme ought to have realised Miss H was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss H had taken out 7 loans in a little over 5 months. And Miss H 
had been indebted to Wageme for all but 12 days. So Wageme ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Miss H was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Hs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Hs first loan was for £115 and loan 7 was for £215.  At this point Wageme 
ought to have known that Miss H was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 7 onwards Miss H was provided with a new loan within a day or so of 
settling a previous loan. Further evidence that these loans were unsustainable for 
Miss H and that she was likely needing to borrow so quickly because she couldnt 
afford the repayments to the previous loans.  
Miss H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Wageme. Loan 27 
was taken out 25 months after Miss Hs first. And it was Miss Hs largest loan to date 
(£400). This shows that Miss H wasnt in a position to reduce her indebtedness to 
Wageme. Miss H had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
Wageme over an extended period of time.
I think that Miss H lost out because Wageme continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Hs indebtedness by allowing
her to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the length of time coupled with the number of loans which Miss H borrowed was 
likely to have had negative implications on Miss Hs ability to access mainstream 
credit and so kept her in the market for these loans.
So, overall, having considered everything Im upholding Miss Hs complaint as I think 
Wageme were wrong to approve loans 7-27 for these reasons.
  
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Wageme should fairly pay in this case, Ive thought about what
might have happened had it not approved loan 7 onwards as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending, Miss H may have simply left matters there,
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed
between her and this particular lender which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt
a viable option, she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative 
assuming that was even possible.Or, Miss H may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed, a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Miss H in a compliant way at this time. 
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Miss H would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Wagemes liability in this case for what 
Im satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
I think Wageme were wrong to approve loans 7-27.
  
A) Wageme should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss H towards 
interest, fees and charges on loans 7 - 26.
B) Wageme should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Miss H which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss H 
originally made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Wageme should remove al interest, fees and charges from the balance of loan 27 
and treat any repayments made by Miss H as though they had been repayments 
towards the principal. If this results in Miss H having made overpayments then 
Wageme should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on 
the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date 
the complaint is settled. Wageme should then refund the amounts calculated in A 
and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts calculated in A and B can 
d be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a 
surplus, then the surplus should be paid to Miss H. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Wageme should try to agree an affordable repayment plan 
with Miss H. But Id remind Wageme of its obligation to treat Miss H fairly.  
E) The overall pattern of Miss Hs borrowing for loans 7 - 27 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Wageme should remove these loans entirely 
from Miss Hs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires you to deduct tax from this interest. Wageme should give 
Miss H a certificate showing how much tax is deducted, if she asks for one.
  
My final decision
 For the reasons Ive explained above, Im uphold Miss Hs complaint in part.
WAGEME.COM LTD should put things right for Miss H as directed above.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 August 2021.
