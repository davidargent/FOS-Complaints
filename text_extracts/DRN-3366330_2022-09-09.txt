The complaint
Mrs B complains about John Lewis Financial Services Limiteds response to her request for 
a refund of the money that she paid for some furniture that wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
Mrs B and her husband bought some furniture with a total cost of £4,203 in 2019. Mrs B paid 
a deposit of £1,050 using a credit card from a bank in April 2019 and she paid £3,153 using 
her John Lewis Financial Services credit card in August 2019 when the furniture was 
delivered. Mrs B and her husband had some issues with the quality of the furniture so they 
complained to the retailer. The furniture was inspected by a third party in September 2019 
and, although the inspector didnt agree with all of the issues about which theyd complained, 
the inspector did identify some manufacturing faults with the furniture and recommended that 
it should be repaired. 
Mrs B made claims to both John Lewis Financial Services and the bank. The bank credited 
£1,050 to Mrs Bs account and John Lewis Financial Services made two chargeback claims 
but they were defended by the supplier so it considered her claim under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974. It also credited £30 to her account in October 2019 as a goodwill 
gesture. 
It then upheld her section 75 claim in February 2021 and agreed to refund £3,153 to her 
account but on condition that the furniture was either donated or destroyed. That wasnt 
acceptable to Mrs B so it extended its settlement offer until the end of March to give Mrs B 
more time to donate or destroy the furniture. Mrs B wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She didnt consider 
that John Lewis Financial Services did anything wrong by not processing the refund prior to 
receiving the evidence that the furniture had been donated or destroyed and she said that it 
had acted in the way that this service would expect when looking at claims under section 75.
Mrs B has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says, in 
summary and amongst other things, that the February 2021 offer provided insufficient time to 
arrange an alternative purchase which led to further communication with John Lewis 
Financial Services and it said that the offer would be held pending and once the requested 
information was available the case would be reviewed but there then no mention of the case 
being re-assessed. She also says that to dispose of the furniture prior to the refund being 
received would mean that she and her husband would have nothing to sit on, buying 
replacements could take some considerable time and would entail a considerable expense 
on top of the one already made which seems rather unfair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Bs complaint about John Lewis Financial Services, I must 
be satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier and that John Lewis Financial Services response to her claim under section 
75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Bs claim 
under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
the furniture was delivered to Mrs B and her husband in August 2019 and they had 
some issues with the quality of it  the furniture was inspected by a third party in 
September 2019 and, although the inspector didnt agree with all of the issues about 
which theyd complained, the inspector did identify some manufacturing faults with 
the furniture and recommended that it should be repaired;
Mrs B made claims to both John Lewis Financial Services and a bank and the bank 
credited the deposit of £1,050 to Mrs Bs account;
John Lewis Financial Services agreed to refund the remaining £3,153 to Mrs Bs 
account in February 2021 on condition that the furniture was either donated or 
destroyed  it said: As John Lewis Financial Services has no direct knowledge of the 
facts or issues you have raised in your dispute with the  retailer, it is unable to 
determine that a breach of contract and/or misrepresentation has occurred on the 
evidence you have presented to date. However, notwithstanding this John Lewis 
Financial Services is prepared to make an ex gratia offer of £3,153  in full and final 
settlement of your claim and without admission of any liability This offer is 
conditional upon you destroying these goods/donating the items to a local charity and 
attaching proof (ie photographs/receipts) to this form with your signed acceptance;
I consider that John Lewis Financial Services offer to refund £3,153 to Mrs Bs 
account on condition that the furniture was either donated or destroyed was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances and Im not persuaded that it was unfair or 
unreasonable for it to require her to provide evidence of the destruction or donation 
before the refund was made;
as it had offered that refund to Mrs B, I dont consider that it was reasonable to 
expect that it would then review or re-assess her claim; 
I sympathise with Mrs B for the issues that shes had with the furniture and the issues 
that shes described with ordering replacement furniture before the refund was made 
but it Im not persuaded that there was any requirement under section 75 for John 
Lewis Financial Services to refund the payment before Mrs B provided evidence that 
the furniture was destroyed or donated; and
John Lewis Financial Services credited £30 to Mrs Bs account in October 2019 as a 
goodwill gesture and has agreed to refund £3,153 to her account on the condition set 
out above  and I consider that its response to her claim under section 75 was fair 
and reasonable.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Bs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2022.
