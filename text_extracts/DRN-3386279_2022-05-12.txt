The complaint
Miss R complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
Startline Motor Finance Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Miss R under a hire purchase agreement with Startline that she 
electronically signed in November 2020. She says that the cars engine management light 
came on about a week later and was showing intermittently. She returned the car to the 
dealer but the light wasnt showing so she says that the dealer gave her some diesel cleaner 
for the engine. She says that the engine management warning light continued to come on 
intermittently and she took the car to a garage in February 2021 where a diagnostic scan 
indicated a turbo fault and recommended a repair of the turbo actuator.
Miss R complained to Startline about the issues with the car and it arranged for the car to be 
inspected by an independent expert. It said that there was no evidence to suggest that the 
faults were present or developing at the point of sale or the result of a failed repair so it was 
unable to support her request to reject the car. Miss R wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service and says that she wants Startline to pay for the car to be repaired 
and to pay her compensation. 
Our investigator recommended that her complaint should be upheld. He said that a problem 
with the turbo was diagnosed after only three months and that it was likely present or 
developing at the point of sale. He was satisfied that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality so 
he recommended that Startline should arrange for it to be repaired or cover the costs of a 
suitable repair.
Startline has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. It says, in 
summary, that a fault identified within 3 months doesnt confirm that it would have been 
present or developing at the point of sale. It says that the independent expert said that the 
required repairs  should be classed as age-related, in-service, routine maintenance and 
would not prevent the vehicle from being fit for purpose now or at the point of sale. 
Miss R says that shes paying for a broken car and she had wanted to pay for it within two 
years but the issues with it have delayed that and shell now have to pay more interest. She 
also says that shes probably doing more damage to the car by driving it and servicing it is 
likely to be more expensive.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Startline, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss R - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Miss R was about seven years old, had been driven for 
more than 84,000 miles and had a price of Â£3,795;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Miss R says that the cars engine management light came on about a week after the 
car was supplied to her and was showing intermittently so she returned the car to the 
dealer but the light wasnt showing and she says that the dealer gave her some 
diesel cleaner for the engine;
she says that the engine management warning light continued to come on 
intermittently and shes provided a screenshot of text messages that she sent to the 
dealer in January 2021 about the issues with the car and a photo showing the engine 
management warning light on;
she took the car to a garage in February 2021 where a diagnostic scan indicated a 
turbo fault and recommended a repair of the turbo actuator  Miss R then complained 
to Startline and it arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert;
the inspection took place in July 2021 and the inspection report records the cars 
mileage as 88,625 so Miss R had been able to drive more than 4,000 miles in the car 
since it was supplied to her;
the inspection report said: The current fault codes are well known to us and are 
interlinked with one other with the cause being an interruption the turbo boost 
pressure. There are two likely causes of an interruption in turbo boost pressure, one 
being that the turbocharger is approaching the end of its in-service life. In this case, 
however, we believe the most likely cause is that the DPF needs to be cleaned and 
regenerated; this should be considered routine maintenance on a vehicle of this age 
and reported mileage  In our opinion, the most cost-effective repair method would 
be to have the DPF cleaned and regenerated  If this is unsuccessful then further 
investigation will be required under workshop controlled conditions, and the next 
most likely repair method is a replacement of the turbocharger  In either instance, 
the repairs should be classed as age-related, in-service, routine maintenance and  
would not prevent the vehicle from being fit for purpose now or at the point of sale;
the inspection report identified issues with the car but said that it thought that the 
most likely cause of the issue was that the diesel particulate filter needed to be 
cleaned and regenerated  but it also said that if that was unsuccessful the 
turbocharger might need to be replaced  Im not persuaded that replacing the 
turbocharger in these circumstances would be considered to be routine 
maintenance;
Miss R had complained about the engine management warning light coming on 
intermittently soon after the car was supplied to her, shes provided evidence to show 
that she contacted the dealer about her issues with the car and a garage diagnosed 
a turbo fault and recommended a repair of the turbo actuator;
I consider it to be more likely than not that there was a fault with the car that was 
either present or developing when it was supplied to Miss R and which caused the 
engine management warning light to come on so I consider that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality at that time;
the recommended repairs include cleaning and regenerating the diesel particulate 
filter, replacing the turbo actuator and replacing the turbo charger  I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Startline to arrange and pay for the 
issues with the car to be properly repaired; and
Miss R says that shes continued to use the car so Im not persuaded that it would be 
fair or reasonable for me to require Startline to refund any of the monthly payments 
that shes made under the agreement to her or to pay her any other compensation  I 
consider a repair of the car to be an appropriate remedy in these circumstances.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Startline to arrange and 
pay for the issues with the car to be properly repaired.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss Rs complaint and I order Startline Motor Finance Limited to 
arrange and pay for the issues with the car to be properly repaired.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 June 2022.
