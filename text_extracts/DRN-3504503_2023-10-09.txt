The complaint
Mr M complains that Mitsubishi HC Capital UK plc wont refund to him the money that he 
paid for some holiday club membership point rights. His wife is also involved in his complaint 
and hes being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr M and his wife had bought a trial membership of a holiday club in July 2019, which had a 
price of £4,395, and Mr Ms wife had entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Mitsubishi Capital for a loan of that amount. They traded in their trial membership and 
bought 1,100 holiday club membership point rights in November 2019. They entered into an 
acquisition agreement with the holiday company and agreed to pay it £15,287. Mr M entered 
into a fixed sum loan agreement with Mitsubishi Capital for a loan of £19,471, which included 
£4,184 to consolidate his wifes July 2019 loan. He agreed to make 180 monthly repayments 
of £224.89 to Mitsubishi Capital. 
Mr Ms representative made claims, on behalf of Mr M, to Mitsubishi Capital in January 2021 
under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the product was 
misrepresented to Mr M and his wife; the contract was breached; commission was paid 
between Mitsubishi Capital and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr M which 
created a breach of fiduciary duty and caused an unfair relationship; the loan was 
unaffordable; and the relationship between Mr M and Mitsubishi Capital was unfair. 
Mitsubishi Capital responded to those claims in detail and set out the reasons that it wasnt 
upholding Mr Ms complaint. Mr M wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was 
made to this service. Mr Ms complaint form says that the holiday company and Mitsubishi 
Capital failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan; Mitsubishi 
Capital paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to him and the 
holiday company unduly pressured him and his wife into entering into the acquisition 
agreement and him into entering into the loan agreement; all rendering the loan agreement 
unfair pursuant to section 140A.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that Mitsubishi Capitals decision to turn down Mr Ms claims was unfair or 
unreasonable. She wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale 
and she didnt think that the holiday company had breached the contract. She said that she 
hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr M and Mitsubishi Capital 
was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the 
relationship was unfair. She then also said that she hadnt seen anything to persuade her 
that the money lent to Mr M was unaffordable given his financial circumstances at the time of 
sale.
Mr Ms representative says that Mr M doesnt agree with the decision made and would like 
the matter referred to an ombudsman. It has raised concerns about the way that the finance 
was sold to Mr M and says that the holiday company didnt broker proper credit and failed to 
meet the standard of a regulated firm. It has also referred to a decision issued by this service 
on a complaint relating to a different type of holiday ownership product in which it says the 
voluminous documentation for the product was reviewed and the debtor-creditor relationship 
was considered to be unfair. It says that the same voluminous documents and the same 
unfair charges exist in the product that was sold to Mr M and his wife so Mr Ms relationship 
with Mitsubishi Capital is unfair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ms complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr M and his wife signed the acquisition agreement in November 2019 to buy 1,100 
holiday club membership point rights and they traded in their trial membership  the 
cost price of the membership point rights, including legal and admin fees, was 
£19,682 from which the trade-in value of £4,395 was deducted, so the amount due 
form them was £15,287;
there was an outstanding amount due to Mitsubishi Capital from Mr Ms wife under 
the loan agreement that shed entered into in July 2019 of £4,184 and Mr M entered 
into a loan agreement with Mitsubishi Capital for a loan of £19,471  the £15,287 due 
to the holiday company and £4,184 to consolidate his wifes loan;
Mr M and his wife also signed other documents including the terms and conditions, a 
members declaration, a standard information form and a separate standard form of 
the withdrawal notice that could be given to withdraw from the acquisition agreement;
Mr Ms representative, on Mr Ms behalf, made claims to Mitsubishi Capital in 
January 2021 about the acquisition agreement that Mr M and his wife had entered 
into in November 2019 and Mr M then made a complaint to this service  the claim 
letter refers to claims under sections 75 and 140A, including that the 1,100 
membership point rights were misrepresented to Mr M and his wife, but his complaint 
form only refers to claims under section 140A and doesnt refer to a 
misrepresentation made by the holiday company;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ms claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Mitsubishi 
Capitals response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr Ms representatives January 2021 letter says that the membership point rights 
were misrepresented to Mr M and his wife because they were advised that the 
product was of some substance but its now clear that the product is worthless and 
has no merit;
I consider it to be clear from the acquisition agreement that Mr M and his wife had 
bought 1,100 membership point rights and the standard information form says: The 
Vacation Club is a multi-resort holiday Points system which allows Members to 
acquire their Points each year to use and enjoy the various Resorts located 
worldwide held within the Vacation Club from time to time;neither Mr M nor his representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentation was made, the conversations 
that took place or the information that was provided to Mr M his wife before their 
November 2019 purchase;
the membership point rights could be used for holidays so Im not persuaded that 
theyre worthless and have no merit or that theres enough evidence to show that the 
membership point rights were misrepresented to Mr M and his wife by the holiday 
company or that they were induced into entering into the acquisition agreement by 
any such misrepresentations;
the January 2021 letter also says that the seller has ceased to trade and has 
committed a repudiatory breach of contract and I consider that the liquidation of the 
seller could be a breach of contract for which Mitsubishi Capital might be liable under 
section 75 - but I understand that although the seller has stopped trading, the 
membership point rights remain available for Mr M and his wife to use and Ive seen 
no evidence to show that their use of their membership point rights has been 
adversely impacted by the liquidation of the seller;
I dont consider that Mitsubishi Capital has any liability to Mr M under section 75 for a 
breach of contract in these circumstances and Im not persuaded that Mr M and his 
wife would be entitled to terminate their acquisition agreement; 
the January 2021 letter says that commission was paid between Mitsubishi Capital 
and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr M which created a breach of 
fiduciary duty and caused an unfair relationship and Mr Ms complaint form says that 
Mitsubishi Capital paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared 
to him;
Mr M and his wife had signed the members declaration in November 2019 which 
said that the holiday company:  has a commercial arrangement with the lender 
who is providing the loan you have requested and as part of those commercial terms 
we may be entitled to a commission from the lender. Details of commission in respect 
of your loan are available on request by you quoting your contract number;
I consider that Mr M knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that Mitsubishi 
Capital might be paying a commission to the holiday company but Ive not seen any 
evidence to show that he asked either the holiday company or Mitsubishi Capital for 
any details about any commission that was paid and Ive not been provided with any 
evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by Mitsubishi Capital to the 
holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 15% and Im satisfied that Mitsubishi Capital 
wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any 
regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Mitsubishi 
Capital should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr M risked 
the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
the January 2021 letter also says that the loan was unaffordable for Mr M and his 
complaint form says that the holiday company and Mitsubishi Capital failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan but neither Mr M nor his 
representative had provided detailed evidence about Mr Ms financial position in 
November 2019 or to show that the loan wasnt affordable for him at that time;
the loan agreement that Mr M signed in November 2019 shows that he was 
employed with a gross income of £50,000 and the loan agreement that his wife entered into in July 2019 showed that she was employed with a gross income of 
£20,000;
Mitsubishi Capital says that it searched Mr Ms credit record and used it, with other 
information provided on his application, to calculate a credit score which exceeded its 
minimum lending criteria and that it utilises a third party affordability product and 
there were no indications that Mr M would struggle to service the loan  it says that 
Mr M told it that his gross annual income was £50,000, which was validated using 
data obtained from credit reference agencies, and his credit record showed his 
existing credit commitments and that he was a homeowner with no mortgage;
it says that it calculated Mr Ms net monthly income as £3,127 and that, after the loan 
repayment of £224.89 and the payment for his other credit commitments, he would 
be left with approximately £2,860 each month for other monthly expenses which, 
based on national averages, it says is generally sufficient to meet typical other 
expenses and given that there were no indications of financial stress on his credit file, 
there were no concerns about lending him an additional £19,471;
Mr M and his wife signed the members declaration which said: We have received 
the Pre-contract Credit Information document  and have had adequate time to 
consider the information contained there on and any questions we have raised 
arising from this document have been explained to our satisfaction prior to signing 
and receiving a copy of our finance agreement; and: We understand clearly what 
we have purchased and, having carefully considered this and our other financial 
commitments, are able to pay the amounts due on the dates agreed and in the case 
of purchases made with the assistance of finance agree that we are not aware of any 
future event that may prevent us from meeting the monthly repayments;
the loan was made to Mr M in November 2019 but Ive seen no evidence to show 
that he asked Mitsubishi Capital for any information about the affordability 
assessment that it conducted before his representatives January 2021 letter;
I consider that the evidence that Mitsubishi Capital has provided shows that it made 
reasonable and proportionate checks to assess whether the loan was affordable for 
Mr M before it was made to him and that it was reasonable for it to have concluded 
on the basis of the information that it had gathered that Mr M could afford a loan with 
a monthly repayment of £224.89;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for Mr M, that Mitsubishi Capital should have done more to assess the 
affordability of the loan for him, that the loan was mis-sold to him or that Mitsubishi 
Capital has acted incorrectly in connection with the loan;
Mr Ms complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured him and his 
wife into entering into the acquisition agreement and him into entering into the loan 
agreement  but the holiday company says that Mr M had made two purchases from 
it in 2002 which were held until 2006 when the membership was suspended for non-
payment of the annual management fees  and Mr M and his wife had bought a trial 
membership from the holiday company in July 2019;
Mr M and his wife had signed the separate standard form of the withdrawal notice 
that could be given to withdraw from the acquisition agreement within 14 days 
without giving any reason and the standard information form that they also signed 
said: The consumer has the right to withdraw from this contract without giving any 
reason within 14 calendar days from the conclusion of the contract, or any binding 
preliminary contract, or receipt of those contracts if that takes place later; 
the loan agreement said : You will have the right to withdraw from the agreement, 
without giving any reason, for a period of 14 days; but Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr M contacted either the holiday company or Mitsubishi Capital to withdraw 
from either the acquisition agreement or the loan agreement within the applicable 
withdrawal periods;
Mr M and his wife signed those agreements in November 2019 but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that they complained to either the holiday company or Mitsubishi 
Capital about the undue pressure that Mr M claims was applied to them until his 
representatives January 2021 letter  if they had been unduly pressured into signing 
the acquisition agreement and didnt want to buy the membership point rights, I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted either the 
holiday company or Mitsubishi Capital about that issue sooner that they did;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr M and his wife were 
unduly pressurised into entering into the acquisition agreement or that Mr M was 
unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mr Ms representative has referred to a decision issued by this service on a complaint 
relating to a different type of holiday ownership product in which it says the 
voluminous documentation for the product was reviewed and the debtor-creditor 
relationship was considered to be unfair  it says that the same voluminous 
documents and the same unfair charges exist in the product that was sold to Mr M 
and his wife so Mr Ms relationship with Mitsubishi Capital is unfair;
that decision related to a different type of holiday ownership product which was sold 
as an investment and related to a specified property  Mr M and his wife bought 
membership point rights from the holiday company which dont relate to a specified 
property and which I dont consider were sold to them as an investment;
both products were often sold in similar ways and may have had similar contractual 
documentation but the operation and effect of the contractual documentation would 
be significantly different between the products;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr M and his wife and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr M and Mitsubishi 
Capital;
the management charge was clearly set out in the acquisition agreement and the 
members declaration said: We understand that currently the annual Point Rights 
Dues (Annual Service Charge) are € 1089.00 for 2020. The basis of this fee is set out 
in the Scheme Rules and Regulations of the Company and information about the 
management charges was also included in the standard information form;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the management 
charges are unfair or that Mr M and his wife have been required to pay any other 
unfair charges for their membership point rights;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Ms relationship with 
Mitsubishi Capital was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr M and Mitsubishi Capital 
in these circumstances;I sympathise with Mr M for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership point rights but I consider that Mitsubishi Capitals response to the 
claims that had been made to it was fair and reasonable in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Mitsubishi Capital to 
refund to Mr M any of the money that hes paid under the loan agreement, to cancel 
the loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 November 2023.
