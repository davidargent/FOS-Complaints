The complaint
Mr B complains that Retail Money Market Ltd trading as RateSetter set up a direct debit 
instruction to collect direct debits from his bank account without his consent.
What happened
Mr B had an account with RateSetter. Mr B says his bank informed him that RateSetter had 
set up a direct debit on his account. The direct debit was set up using the Automated Direct 
Debit Instruction Service (AUDDIS). AUDDIS is operated by Bacs Payment Schemes 
Limited (Bacs).
Mr B obtained details of the direct debit mandate from his bank. These indicated:
the direct debit was set up using AUDDIS on 10 October 2019;
the originator was RateSetter; and
the reference quoted was the number for Mr Bs account with RateSetter.
Mr B says he never authorised this direct debit to be set up. So, he complained to 
RateSetter.
RateSetter told Mr B it had no record of the direct debit instruction and it wasnt responsible 
for it. It also said it couldnt set up direct debit instructions on accounts such as the one he 
held with it. 
Mr B was concerned by this response. He said that either RateSetter was not telling the truth 
or it had permitted someone else to access his information. He cancelled the direct debit 
instruction and complained to our service.
Our investigator looked into his complaint. She said that the evidence showed a direct debit 
had been set up by RateSetter. RateSetter hadnt shown it had investigated the matter to 
find out why the direct debit had been set up. She thought RateSetter should send a letter of 
apology to Mr B for the inconvenience hed been caused. And it should confirm to him that 
his details hadnt been compromised.
Our investigator also considered whether any compensation should be paid to Mr B. She 
said Mr B hadnt suffered any financial loss since hed cancelled the direct debit. But he had 
been inconvenienced. So, she said RateSetter should pay him £50 by way of compensation 
for the inconvenience hed been caused.
RateSetter didnt agree and so the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear from the information Mr B has provided that a direct debit was set up using 
AUDDIS. I wouldve expected RateSetter to investigate the information Mr B provided from 
his bank. It doesnt appear to have done that or to have contacted Bacs to query what had 
happened. It says it has no record of having set up a direct debit for Mr Bs account.
I dont think thats enough to persuade me that it didnt set up the direct debit. The evidence 
from Mr Bs bank shows a direct debit was set up in AUDDIS using RateSetters name and 
Mr Bs account details.
RateSetter says it cannot set up auto-lending which is via direct debit for investors from its 
end. But I can see that the terms and conditions state that customers can set up direct 
debits to pay funds from their nominated bank account to the holding account with 
RateSetter. This can be done using the Auto Invest function within RateSetters systems.
Having considered the terms and conditions I think this means Mr B wouldve been able to 
give his consent, using the functionality in Auto Invest, for RateSetter to set up a direct debit 
from his bank account. But it is RateSetter itself which would be the originator under 
AUDDIS.
Its also the case that if Mr B had used the functionality in Auto Invest, RateSetter should 
have an audit trail to show this. But it hasnt provided any evidence of this. And the date the 
direct debit instruction was set up in AUDDIS was after the date when Mr B says hed asked 
RateSetter to close his account. 
So, having considered everything here, on balance, Im satisfied RateSetter did set up the 
direct debit instruction using AUDDIS. Im also satisfied Mr B didnt provide his consent to 
the direct debit instruction.
Mr B is concerned that his information may have been compromised. So, I agree with our 
investigator that its fair and reasonable to require RateSetter to send him a letter to 
apologise for the inconvenience hes been caused and give him an assurance that his 
personal information hasnt been compromised.
I can see that Mr B hasnt suffered any financial loss as a result of what happened. He 
cancelled the direct debit as soon as his bank made him aware of it. And his bank told him 
he wouldve had the protection of the direct debit guarantee scheme if any payments had 
been taken. But it is the case that he has been inconvenienced. So, I agree with our 
investigator that £50 is fair and reasonable compensation for the inconvenience hes 
experienced.
Putting things right
To put things right, RateSetter should:
 
send Mr B a letter of apology for the inconvenience hes been caused;
confirm to Mr B that RateSetter hasnt compromised his personal information; and
pay Mr B £50 by way of compensation for the trouble and inconvenience hes 
experienced. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above I uphold this complaint against Retail Money Market Ltd trading 
as RateSetter. I now require it to take the following action:
send Mr B a letter to apologise for the inconvenience hes been caused;
confirm to Mr B that RateSetter hasnt compromised his personal information; andpay Mr B £50 by way of compensation for the trouble and inconvenience hes been 
caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 August 2020.
