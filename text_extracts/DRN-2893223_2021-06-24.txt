The complaint
Mr G complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA made it difficult for him to return money
to PayPal which they accidently refunded him and threatened him with a debt collection
agency.
What happened
Mr G received refunds totalling £1,150 as a result of an error. PayPal emailed Mr G on 24
April 2020 to inform him of the error and said that they would need to reclaim the funds from
his PayPal account in the next 10 days. The email asked Mr G to have sufficient funds in his
PayPal account to fulfil the scheduled debit.
Mr G says he rang PayPal on 6 May 2020 to chase up the payment as it hadnt been
deducted from him yet. He also informed PayPal that his card had been cancelled through
an unrelated incident, so they wouldnt be able to take the money from his bank account.
PayPal restricted Mr Gs PayPal account on 16 May 2020. This was due to Mr G being
underage when he created his PayPal account.
Mr G received an email from PayPal on 23 June 2020. The email acknowledged that Mr G
was not at fault as a result of the refunds and they apologised for the mistake. The email
explains that because of the error then Mr G has benefitted at PayPals expense (this is
because PayPal had paid the funds to a third party company but this was refunded in error
by the third party, which meant PayPal had been out of pocket by £1,150 by honouring these
payments). The email also asked him to pay the funds by 8 July 2020 and explained how he
could add funds into his PayPal account. The email explained to Mr G that if there were
insufficient funds in his account to cover the liability then PayPal reserve the right to collect
the amount he owes them by any legal means, which includes the use of a debt collection
agency.
Mr G says the threat of a debt collection agency was very stressful for him as he said he had
done nothing wrong. He was unable to transfer money into his PayPal account as the use of
his account had been restricted on 16 May 2020. When he tried to pay into his PayPal
account using his unique details through his bank account the payment was returned. Mr G
said he tried to contact PayPal on 23 June 2020. Mr G sent an email to PayPal on 24 June
and he says he copied in the CEO of PayPal and head of departments into the email. The
email explained how he owed PayPal money and he was trying to pay it back, but he
couldnt contact anyone that could help. He explained to PayPal that hes now being
threatened with a debt collection agency by them.
Mr G received a phone call from PayPal on 24 June 2020. Mr G says the call handler
apologised for the customer service he received and shell escalate things to customer
services to understand why it has taken so long and why contact from Mr G wasnt
responded to. The call handler was able to remove the restrictions to Mr Gs PayPal account
while he was on the phone and Mr G managed to make a successful payment to his PayPal
account for £1,150.
Mr G made a complaint and brought the complaint to our service. He said that he had spent
many hours trying to fix the error and was threatened with a debt collection agency which
caused him considerable stress.
Our investigator did not uphold his complaint. She said PayPal werent unreasonable in their
communications with Mr G and quoted the PayPal User Agreement with how PayPal would
attempt to retrieve money owed to them. She also said that while Mr G had his account
restricted by PayPal on 16 May 2020, she saw no reason why Mr G couldnt have paid into
his PayPal account prior to this time. Our investigator did note that his card was cancelled on
6 May 2020, but it wasnt PayPals fault that he couldnt pay the debt prior to 16 May 2020.
Our investigator also appreciated that it was difficult getting in touch with PayPal but due to
the pandemic they had limited advisers available.
Mr G asked for an Ombudsman to review his complaint. He made a number of points,
including his expectation that PayPal would try to take the money directly from his bank
account, the error had cost him hours of his time in trying to rectify it, the communication
from PayPal wasnt reasonable and Mr G didnt agree the money he was accidently
refunded was classed as an owed debt and should be subject to PayPals User Agreement.
As my findings differed in some respects from our investigators, I issued a provisional 
decision to give both parties the opportunity to consider things further. This is set out below: 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr G has made a number of points to both PayPal and this service and Ive considered and
read everything hes sent us. But, in line with this services role as a quick and informal body
Ill be focusing on the crux of his complaint in deciding whats fair and reasonable here.
Both parties accept that the money was sent to Mr G in error. So, what Ive looked at first is
the communication that PayPal sent Mr G when theyve realised an error has been made.
The email clearly states that PayPal will now need to reclaim the amount from your PayPal
account in the next 10 days. We will take the funds totalling 1,150.00 GBP from your PayPal
account balance. Please ensure you have sufficient funds in your PayPal account to fulfil this
scheduled debit.. So, what I would expect here is PayPal to take the £1,150 from Mr Gs
PayPal account within 10 days of 24 April 2020.
But this didnt happen. I asked PayPal why they didnt take the £1,150 from Mr Gs PayPal
account within the timeframe they said they would. PayPal responded that Mr G did not have
the sufficient balance in his account during this time and therefore they couldnt take the
£1,150 as they said they would. Mr G should have been able to transfer the balance into his
PayPal account during this timeframe. I say this as this was before his account was
restricted on 16 May 2020 and before Mr Gs card was cancelled on 6 May 2020.
Im not persuaded that PayPal should have attempted to take the money from Mr Gs bank
account, even if the refund was credited to his bank account. I say this as PayPal were clear
when they were going to try and take the money and PayPal were clear where they were
going to take the money from. Im persuaded that had Mr G moved the £1,150 into his
PayPal account within 10 days of 24 April 2020 then PayPal would have taken the funds
they were owed, and this would have been the end of the matter.
In addition, PayPal have explained to me that they wouldnt have been able to take the funds
from Mr Gs bank account anyway as they do not have the authorisation to debit funds from
a customers bank account as this requires a pre-authorisation from the customers financial
institution which in turn could only be done by the account holder as this is user initiated.Mr G has said that hes spent hours trying to resolve an issue which wasnt his fault. Im
satisfied the error wasnt his fault. But equally the error wasnt PayPals fault as they say the
refund was made to Mr Gs bank account by the third party company. Mr G has been
proactive in trying to return the funds to PayPal as hes realised that paying these funds back
is the right thing to do, even if he didnt cause the error to be made. But Im not persuaded
that he needed to spend hours trying to contact PayPal to resolve the issue and Ill explain
why.
Ive previously mentioned that if Mr G had ensured the funds were in his PayPal account
from 24 April then Im satisfied this would have resolved the issue. But Ive also seen a call
note on PayPals systems on 7 May 2020. I asked PayPal for a copy of this call but
unfortunately it is not available. But the call note explains that Mr G contacted PayPal that
his card has been cancelled so funds cant be claimed from the card. The system also has a
note from the call handler advising Mr G that he will receive an email from PayPal when an
update is available. So, Mr G did not need to try and chase things up at this stage as PayPal
didnt send him an email again until 23 June 2020.
I understand that Mr G will have been frustrated that hes tried to contact PayPal to resolve
the matter and there were long periods of time when hes heard nothing back, or hes had to
deal with bots in the absence of real people. But I need to consider the reason for this and
whether this was reasonable in the circumstances.
Mr G told our investigator that he works away for a month at a time and is sometimes not in
range of a phone signal and cant be on hold for lengthy periods. In addition, due to the
pandemic, lockdown had only been introduced a matter of weeks before PayPal emailed Mr
G initially. PayPal have said they took a number of safety precautions around this time to
protect their staff which vastly reduced their customer servicing facilities, which they say Mr
G was informed about. The restriction of his PayPal account had further delayed matters
although PayPal were entitled to take the actions that they did here. So, while its taken a
while to resolve the error, Im not persuaded that PayPal were unreasonable with their
communication, even if Mr G believes they were.
Ive considered what Mr G has said about the funds being classed as an owed debt and how
PayPals User Agreement shouldnt apply to him as what was sent wasnt a debt. But looking
at PayPals system notes they do not refer to the £1,150 as a debt. And, looking at the
emails he was sent on 24 April and 23 June 2020 I cant see that PayPal have described this
as a debt as such. The 24 April email refers to reclaiming the amount. The 23 June email
says, we therefore request that you repay the full sum of £1,150 GBP. While they use the
word liability Im persuaded that this is used in the context of them being owed money,
which I think Mr G would agree he did owe them money based on the subject of his email to
PayPal on 24 June which starts I owe PayPal money.
Finally, Ive considered what Mr G has said about being very stressed with PayPal
mentioning a debt collection agency. But as our investigator explained to Mr G, PayPal were
required to make him aware of the consequences for non-payment. Ive looked at the
context of PayPal explaining this to Mr G. It appears this was first mentioned to him on their
email dated 23 June 2020 and the email says we reserve the right to collect the amount you
owe us by any legal means, including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection
agency. However, we hope that it will not be necessary and this matter can be resolved
amicably.
As the email was sent on 23 June and the matter was resolved on 24 June, Im not
persuaded that the wording used here would have a significant impact on Mr G. I say that as
Im persuaded the debt collection route which PayPal have said they may use would only be
in response to non-payment and as Mr G has always been willing to pay the money back toPayPal I dont think that PayPal wouldve needed to use a debt collection agency to recoup
the money owed. So for the reasons Ive previously given. I wont be asking PayPal to take
any further action.
I invited both parties to let me have any further submissions before I reached a final 
decision. PayPal accepted the provisional decision. Mr G did not. He made a number of 
points that he wanted to be considered for my final decision. In summary, he said he couldnt 
overstate his inability to freely access the internet while he was at work as he works at sea 
so there is no mobile signal or internet connection which severely hampers his ability to just 
log into PayPal and add funds, it would be reasonable to assume PayPal would just take the 
payment from his bank account as in PayPals email they call it a scheduled debit. 
Mr G felt that PayPal were lying as they had pre-authorisation and a direct debit instruction 
set up on his account and it would be reasonable for PayPal to take money from his bank 
account in this case. Mr G said that he felt uncomfortable about having the money in his 
account and that after a week of no updates feared that the issue would have been forgotten 
about and it was only because he wasnt at work he was able to keep chasing up PayPal on 
the issue. 
Mr G added that it was only because he emailed the CEOs of PayPal that the situation was 
resolved, or he believes he would have had a debt collection agency attempting to 
repossess his belongings or be in front of a judge. He said he would appreciate if the 
ombudsman could think how he would rule if he had complained after he had possessions 
possessed by debt collectors or if he'd been taken to a county court. Mr G also said he 
realised early on that debt collection could be a result and he was angry at his time being 
wasted and was terrified that he would be getting contacted from collection agents for a debt 
that is the result of PayPals mistake.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought about what Mr G has said about working at sea and how this impacted his ability 
to simply transfer money into his PayPal account. But PayPal have provided me a statement 
of his PayPal activity from 4 April to 6 May 2020. This shows that he was able to make 
several transactions during this period of time and so Im persuaded that Mr G would have 
had an opportunity to add funds to his PayPal balance within the original timeframe given by 
PayPal. So Im not persuaded that Mr G was unable to do this even if he was at sea, as the 
statement showed he was still able to use his account in this timeframe. 
Mr G has also mentioned it would be reasonable to assume PayPal would just take the 
payment from his bank account as in PayPals email they call it a scheduled debit. But 
PayPal said on their email on 24 April 2020 to please ensure you have sufficient funds in 
your PayPal account to fulfil this scheduled debit. So Im not persuaded its reasonable to 
assume the payment would be taken from his bank account as the wording is clear here that 
it is referring to his PayPal account and not his bank account. So for that reason, whether 
PayPal had pre authorisation/direct debit access or not I would expect PayPal to take the 
funds from his PayPal account and not another method. I say this as PayPal were clear how 
they were going to take the funds. And when Mr G did return the funds it was done so 
through his PayPal account. 
I can sympathise with Mr G saying he was uncomfortable with the funds sitting in his 
account. After all it was not his error that resulted him being in this position. But I must add it 
wasnt PayPal who had caused the error either. The merchant Mr G used refunded this money back into Mr Gs bank account in error. Ive thought about what Mr G has said about 
having no updates for long periods of time and that they may forget this issue. But as I 
mentioned in my provisional decision, the system note on 7 May 2020 advised that Mr G 
would receive an email from PayPal when an update is available. As PayPal were impacted 
by the pandemic they had to vastly reduce their customer servicing facilities, which PayPal 
say they informed Mr G about. So it would be reasonable to expect their response times 
would be longer than usual and Mr G was aware that PayPal explained to him they would let 
him know when there would be an update. 
Ive considered what Mr G has said about his issue only being resolved as he had emailed 
the CEOs of PayPal and that if he hadnt taken this action then debt collection agencies 
could repossess his belongings, or he might be in front of a judge. Mr G wanted to know how 
I would rule if this happened. But I can only make a decision on what did happen, not what 
could have happened. Mr G says that he was terrified that he would be getting contacted 
from debt collection agents for a debt that was not his error. But as I explained in my 
provisional decision, Im persuaded the debt collection route which PayPal said they may 
use would only be in response to non-payment. And as Mr G has always been willing to pay 
the money back to PayPal I dont think that PayPal wouldve needed to use a debt collection 
agency to recoup the money owed.
In summary, Mr Gs response hasnt changed my view and my final decision and reasoning 
remains the same as in my provisional decision. I know Mr G will be disappointed with the 
decision, but I hope he understands my reasons. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2021.
