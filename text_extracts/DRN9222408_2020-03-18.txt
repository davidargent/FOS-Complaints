The information provided about  Mr Ss loans shows that there was a gap of 282 days  in-
between loans 10 and 11. Ive considered this period significant enough to create a gap in 
the lending history.  This means  that when  Mr S applied for loan 11, this became a new loan 
chain. 
Our adjudicator considered Mr Ss complaint  and thought the loans  from loan 6  10 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny responded agreeing to uphold  Mr Ss complaint about 
loans 8 onwards  but disagreed with the adjudicators opinion  about loans 6 and 7. So the 
complaint was passed to me to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
Ref: DRN92224082consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint. Our adjudicator  didnt think loans 1  5 
and loans 10  13 should be upheld. Mr S appears  to have agreed with this opinion so as 
these loans are no longer  in dispute,  I have  not consider them any further in my decision. 
But I have thought about these loans when looking at the overall pattern of lending  between 
Mr S and Sunny.   
Looking carefully  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr S, Ive considered  
whether there was a point at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr S was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken out five loans within eight months, and although there  
had been some  gaps in the lending at this point, these were  not significant  and so did 
not break the chain of lending. Over these first eight  months Mr S had been indebted 
Ref: DRN92224083to Sunny for around  six months. And Mr S had requested the highest  amount  so far 
for loan 6. So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more likely than not Mr S was in a 
cycle of borrowing  and that his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ss first loan was for £200  and loan 6 was for £400. At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that Mr S was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 10 was 
taken out around one year and eight months  after Mr Ss first. And even though he 
paid off some of these  loans  early, Mr S had paid large amounts of interest  to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr S lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 to loan 
10 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ss ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6  10 and Sunny should put things right.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 6 - 10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loans  6 to 10 means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  loans  6 to 10 should  be removed from Mr S s 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ss complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 April 2020.
