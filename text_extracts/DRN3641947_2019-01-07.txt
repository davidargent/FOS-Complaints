K820x#14complaint
Mr P complains that Clydesdale Bank Plc (trading as Yorkshire Bank)  closed two of his bank 
accounts without  explanation. He said he hadnt done anything  wrong.
background
Yorkshire Bank said itd made a decision that the services it was offering Mr P didnt meet 
his requirements or expectations. And its terms and conditions  say it can close  any or all of a 
customers accounts without explanation  by giving him two months  notice.
Our investigator could  see that Yorkshire  Bank  had complied with its terms and conditions 
when it closed two of Mr Ps accounts.  So she didnt think itd done  anything wrong.
Mr P said he felt bullied by the bank.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know Mr P has been upset about the banks decision so I know hell be disappointed with 
mine. But Ive come to the same conclusion as our investigator for very similar  reasons.
As long as a bank  acts in line with its terms and conditions  when it closes  a bank account,  
we cant make it reconsider  its decision.  And the terms and conditions of the accounts  Mr P 
has with Yorkshire Bank allow it to close an account  so long as it gives  two months notice. 
And it doesnt have  to give any explanation.
Im sorry  Mr P feels  bullied by the bank  and Ive looked at all the information I have from both 
him and Yorkshire  Bank. But I cant see theres  sufficient  evidence for me to come to that 
conclusion.
So for all those reasons  I agree with our investigator that the bank hasnt done anything  
wrong.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 February  2019.
