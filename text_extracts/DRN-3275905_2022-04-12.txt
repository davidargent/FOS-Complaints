The complaint
Mr B complains that he got poor service from National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest).
What happened
Mr B was a vulnerable customer and was given access to a dedicated helpline with 
NatWest. He called the helpline to set up a standing order but was told he had insufficient 
security to do that. To set that up, NatWest sent him an activation code - even though he 
said he didnt want to have online banking. NatWest sent Mr B a card reader to set up the 
activation code  which he objected to as he didnt want online banking. NatWest then sent 
to Mr B an activation code by text message.
Mr B complained. He said that when he called the helpline, he received a poor level of 
service  including questions as to why he was using the helpline. He said he didnt want to 
have online banking, and yet NatWest still sent him an activation code to set that up.  And 
they then sent him a card reader  again even though he didnt want to have online banking. 
He said he was also told that an activation code could be sent to him by text when in fact, it 
couldnt be guaranteed that it could be so. And despite that, NatWest did send him the 
activation code by text message. He said hed been most distressed by the overall 
experience.
NatWest apologised and said theyd not provided a good service to Mr B. They paid 
compensation of £150 for the service Mr B first experienced on the helpline, and a further 
£200 for the issues surrounding the further telephone and online banking errors. 
Mr B brought his complaint to us. Our investigator acknowledged that NatWests service had 
fallen short. He agreed with NatWest that they should pay further compensation of £75.
Mr B disagreed. He believed NatWest should pay another £250 for what happened  this 
was put to NatWest by us. NatWest declined to pay this amount. They said that 
compensation of £425 (£150 plus £200 plus £75) was fair for what happened. So  Mr Bs 
complaint came to me to look at.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at Mr Bs complaints and its clear that his experiences with NatWest have 
fallen short.
When he first called NatWests dedicated helpline for vulnerable customers, the initial 
questioning and conversations werent helpful  and Mr B wasnt treated fairly. But also  
I can see that NatWest upheld his complaint, apologised, and paid compensation of 
£150. So - I think that was fair.
On Mr Bs complaint about the setting up of security  so he could set up a standing 
order. Its again clear that NatWest fell short of the service levels they want to achieve. 
While Mr B had told NatWest - he didnt want to be set up for online banking, they still 
sent him an activation code, and then a card reader  which both served to set up online 
banking. They then said theyd send an activation code by SMS text  but then reversed 
this and said they couldnt. NatWest said that in fact, an agent couldnt choose the 
method by which an activation code could be sent  it was a random selection for 
security reasons. Mr B still questions whether that was the case  because he did indeed 
receive an activation code by text. This created some confusion and concern on the part 
of Mr B. NatWest apologised for Mr Bs experiences and paid compensation of £200.
I can see that Mr B has argued that this level of compensation isnt enough. He says he 
suffered a lot of anxiety and stress, impact on his health and personal well-being. He 
said that given the number of mistakes made by NatWest, the compensation should be 
increased.
So  Ive considered this. Our service has set out some criteria by which to consider the 
appropriate amount of compensation for stress and inconvenience. This says An award 
between £100 and £300 might be fair where there have been repeated small errors, or a 
larger single mistake, requiring a reasonable effort to sort out. These typically result in an 
impact that lasts a few days, or even weeks, and cause either some distress, 
inconvenience, disappointment or loss of expectation. This can be found on our website. 
Ive carefully considered what happened to Mr B  and I think its fair to say that his 
experiences fall into this definition  so a compensation award of up to £300. While Ive 
no doubt that what happened was very inconvenient and stressful and took a lot of effort 
to sort out  and I completely understand that - the only clear impact was that Mr B 
couldnt set up a standing order. And while that was inconvenient, I havent seen 
anything which suggests there was a significant financial impact.
And so, for these reasons, I think an award of £425 (in total) is a very fair outcome here. 
This will require NatWest to pay a further £75 - which theyve agreed with us.
My final decision
NatWest has already made an offer to pay £75 to settle the complaint and I think this offer is 
fair in all the circumstances. This is in addition to the £350 already paid.
So my decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay a further £75.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 May 2022.
