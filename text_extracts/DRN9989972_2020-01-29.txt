* The highest instalment for each  loan takes into consideration  any other  outstanding  loans 
repayments Miss K had to make to Sunny  at the time. 
Our adjudicator considered Miss Ks complaint and felt that loans 1-3 shouldnt be upheld. 
Miss K had accepted this opinion so these loans havent been considered further  in this 
decision. However, I have  thought about  these loans when  looking at the overall  picture of 
Miss Ks lending. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Ks complaint  about  loans 4  6 and felt these loans shouldnt 
have been given. Sunny disagreed, and so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss K could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN99899722the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss K could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ks complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 4 and 5 would most likely have 
shown that Miss K:
had outstanding loans with several other short-term lenders at the time; and
already had other outstanding loans  with Sunny at the time;
All of the above factors demonstrate that Miss K was having problems managing her money 
and she would be unlikely  to be able to repay this loan, and the subsequent  ones,  
sustainably, So Im upholding  Miss Ks complaint  about loan 4 and 5. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss K, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ks case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss K was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss K had taken out five loans within five months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Miss K was having  to borrow  
further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Miss Ks indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Ref: DRN99899723Miss Ks loan amounts varied  across the six loans,  but the amounts were  not 
substantially decreasing over the time.  So, by loan 6 Sunny  ought to have known that 
Miss K was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary  shortfall in her income  but to 
meet an ongoing  need. 
Miss K often  took out a new loan while an existing loan was still running  with Sunny.
Miss K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan 6 was 
taken out six months after Miss Ks first. And as the amounts  borrowed was not 
significantly reducing over this time, Miss K had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
Sunny responded to say that the nature  of the product  it provides  allows  for customers to 
take out up to four loans  at the same  time in order to give them more flexibility to manage 
their finances. Sunny  says that this was taken into consideration when each loan application  
was assessed.
Ive thought about what Sunny has said and Ive also considered  Miss Ks monthly income 
and expenditure  at the point of taking out each  loan. While it may appear on the outset that 
Miss K wouldve been able to afford  the repayments  at each stage  of borrowing, the number  
of loans taken  and the period it was taken suggests  that Miss K had developed a reliance on 
this type of credit. And looking at Miss Ks lending pattern by loan 6, I think  Sunny ought to 
have reasonably realised  that further lending was unsustainable, and potentially harmful.
I think that Miss K lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing which was likely to 
have had negative  implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans. So Im also upholding the complaint about loan 6 and 
Sunny should  put things right as set out below.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss K paid on loans 4, 5 and 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Miss Ks credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loan 6 should be removed  from Miss Ks 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss K a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ks complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Miss K compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 February  2020.
