The complaint
Miss F complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc mishandled her chargeback claim.
What happened
Miss F bought a package holiday for herself and five other people, and paid for it with her 
HSBC debit card. She cancelled the booking the next day, because travel to her destination 
was restricted due to the covid-19 pandemic. She only received a partial refund from the 
retailer, so she raised a chargeback with HSBC for what she thought was the outstanding 
amount (which she said was £2,908.50).
HSBC paid two refunds to Miss Fs account, but she said that she was still owed £1,030.88. 
She was also dissatisfied with HSBCs customer service, and HSBC upheld her complaint 
about that and paid her £150 in compensation.
Miss F referred this complaint to our service, but our investigator did not uphold it. He said 
that as Miss F had only raised a chargeback for part of what she had paid, HSBC was only 
liable for the amount she had claimed, and between the refunds from the retailer and the 
bank, the amount she had claimed from HSBC had been paid to her. HSBC was not liable 
for the rest.
Miss F asked for an ombudsman to look into her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I am satisfied that Miss F has got most of her money back, and HSBC is not 
liable for what is still left over. I will explain why.
Miss Fs bank statement shows that she made four payments to the retailer. These were as 
follows:
£180 on 25 March 2022
£1,000 on the same date
£1,908.50 on 10 May
£850.88 on 1 June
These add up to a total of £3,939.38.
She received two refunds from the retailer and two from the bank. These were as follows:
A refund from the retailer of £60 on 6 June
A refund from the retailer of £1,274.68 on 10 June
A refund from HSBC of £1,000 on 12 July
A refund from HSBC of £573.82 on 29 November 2022
These add up to £2,908.50.
That means there is still a shortfall of £1,030.88. The question is whether HSBC is 
responsible for that.
Miss F has told us that after she received the refunds from the retailer, she then raised a 
chargeback with HSBC for what was still outstanding, which she told us was £2,908.50. (In 
fact, that was not quite correct, because the remaining balance was actually £2,604.70.)
This is confirmed by HSBCs records, which show that Miss F raised chargeback disputes 
for two of her card payments: the £1,000 payment in March, and the £1,908.50 in May  the 
second and third payments on the list above  which make a total of £2,908.50. She did not 
raise a chargeback for the other two payments, which add up to £1,030.88.
That means HSBC was only responsible for getting back the amount of £2,908.50 which she 
had asked it for. HSBC therefore took into account what she had got back already from the 
retailer, and refunded her the difference. That is all she was entitled to under the rules of the 
chargeback scheme, and that was all HSBC was obliged to do.
I can understand why Miss F did that: she thought the other two card payments had already 
been refunded by the retailer, and so she only asked HSBC for the other two. But that was 
just her assumption, which was wrong. That is also not how chargeback works: if she 
wanted all of her money back, then she needed to claim all of it from HSBC, and the bank 
would have taken into account any refunds she had received from the retailer. As it is, she 
has been refunded the full amount she claimed in the chargeback dispute, and HSBC is not 
liable for more than that.
Miss F will need to pursue the retailer directly for the rest of her money.
Finally, I think that £150 was fair compensation for the customer service issues.
My final decision
So my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss F to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2023.
