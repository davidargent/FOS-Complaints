The complaint
Miss Ms complained about how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) dealt with her 
request for a refund for goods shed returned to a retailer.
What happened
At the start of 2021, Miss M bought goods from a retailer Ill call R.  She paid Â£102 for the 
goods, using her credit card through her PayPal account.
When the goods arrived, Miss M decided they werent suitable and returned them to R.  R 
acknowledged the return, but explained they were having technical issues which would 
mean a delay in processing Miss Ms refund.  
When Miss M didnt get a refund from R, she raised a claim under PayPals Buyer Protection 
on the basis the goods were significantly not as described (SNAD).  PayPal advised     
Miss M that, to use this service, she needed to return the goods to the address linked to Rs 
PayPal account.  Miss M couldnt do this as shed already returned the goods using the 
return information provided by R.  So PayPal closed her claim.
Miss M complained about how PayPal had dealt with the issue.  PayPal considered her 
complaint and rejected it.  So Miss M brought her complaint to us.
Our investigator considered the complaint but didnt think PayPal needed to do anything 
differently to resolve it.  She said Miss M hadnt followed the process set out in PayPals user 
agreement so it was fair for PayPal to close the claim.  And she noted that, since bringing 
her complaint to us, Miss M had also raised a chargeback with her card provider  which 
entitled PayPal to close their claim to ensure the payment wasnt recovered twice.
Miss M didnt agree with the investigators view.  So Ive been asked to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Im not upholding Miss Ms complaint.  Ill explain why.
I understand Miss Ms frustration.  From what Ive seen, she contacted PayPal because 
shed not received a refund from R  even though R had acknowledged shed returned the 
goods.
But I can only decide PayPal should do something to put matters right if I think theyve made 
a mistake  and that mistake has had a negative impact on Miss M.
Ive looked at PayPals user agreement.  Miss M told our investigator that shed never had 
this.  But I can see that customers searching PayPals website for information on how to get 
a refund are directed to the agreement for a full list of eligibility requirements and 
exclusions.  So Im satisfied the information is available.  And PayPal referred Miss M to 
the relevant sections.
The requirements of using the Buyer Protection include that claimants must provide PayPal 
with information it requires and comply with shipping requests.  Ive seen that PayPal told 
Miss M the goods had to be returned to a specific address which PayPal held for R, so they 
could monitor the return.  Because Miss M had already returned the goods to a different 
address, she couldnt provide this.
I accept that Miss M returned the goods.  But I think its reasonable for PayPal to be able to 
confirm this before refunding her.  And they couldnt do that.  So I dont think closing her 
claim was unfair.
Im pleased to see Miss M received her refund by raising a chargeback.  But Im satisfied 
that PayPal dealt with her Buyer Resolution claim in line with their terms and conditions.  So 
I dont think they need to do anything more to resolve her complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Miss Ms complaint about PayPal (Europe) 
Sarl et Cie SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 December 2021.
