The complaint
Mr G says PDL Finance Limited (trading as Mr Lender) lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr G had 18 loans with Mr Lender, during a period of about six years. There were some 
significant gaps between the loans, the largest of which I've noted in the table below

An adjudicator considered the complaint and thought it should be upheld in respect of loan 7 
only. Mr Lender accepted this but Mr G didn't. He said that the two larger loans should also 
be refunded as they were part of a chain of lending. He also said that Mr Lender ought to 
have realised from the increasing size of the loans that he was dependent on them. As there 
was no agreement, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
 What Ive decided  and why
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure
Mr G could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Having considered everything, I think Mr Lender's offer (following the adjudication) to refund 
the interest and charges Mr G paid on loan 7 is a fair way to settle this complaint. I'll explain 
why.
Mr G's borrowing history isn't what I'd typically expect to see in complaints of this nature and 
is in some ways quite unusual. Although he had a relatively large number of loans there are 
four significant breaks of between 250 and 363 days, meaning in my view there are five 
distinct 'chains' of lending. This means that although Mr G borrowed from Mr Lender over a 
period of about six years, he spent significantly less time than that actually indebted to
Mr Lender. So, except for loan 7, I don't think the pattern of lending alone is enough to 
demonstrate that Mr G was borrowing in a way which was likely to be unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful.
There are factors other than the pattern of lending I have taken into consideration. I don't 
think that Mr Lender always carried out proportionate checks before lending. For loans 5, 6 
and 17 for example, I think Mr Lender ought to have taken further steps to verify Mr G's 
income and outgoings. But for these loans I don't have enough information from either party 
to show that proportionate checks would've demonstrated that they were not affordable.
I've also seen from Mr Lender's notes that there were times when Mr G appeared to be in 
financial difficulty. Mr G appears to have contacted Mr Lender to make payment 
arrangements for loans 7 and 11, for example. Each of these loans, however, were followed 
by long periods with no borrowing. So it wasn't inherently unreasonable for Mr Lender to 
lend to Mr G again after these loans, as his circumstances may have changed.
Except for loans 11 and 17, I also don't think there's a clear ongoing increase in the amounts 
Mr G was borrowing. For loan 11, I don't think it was unreasonable for
Mr Lender to agree this loan as this was only the second loan in a new chain of borrowing, 
after a break of almost a year. I think loan 17 is more debatable, being the sixth loan in a 
new chain and for a substantially larger amount than all the other loans in that chain. On the other hand, there was a break of 128 days between loans 16 and 17 and there were few 
signs of repayment difficulties on the other loans in that chain. On balance, I don't think it 
was inherently unreasonable for Mr Lender to agree loan 17. As I've said above, I can't say 
that proportionate checks would've demonstrated that it was unaffordable.
I've seen a copy of Mr G's personal credit report - and this does demonstrate that he was 
borrowing from a number of other lenders, often during the times he wasn't borrowing from 
Mr Lender. Mr Lender's own credit checks appear to have been limited to checking for 
certain pieces of adverse data, rather than checking Mr G's credit history and commitments. 
That won't, in my view, always have been proportionate for every loan. And it does mean
Mr Lender didn't have the full picture of Mr G's broader pattern of borrowing. But Mr Lender 
wasn't required to obtain any particular type of credit check and so in this case I do not find 
against it for not having this information.
I'm therefore only upholding Mr G's complaint in respect of loan 7. Mr Lender has already 
agreed this, so I'll say no more about this loan.
Putting things right
Mr Lender should refund the interest and charges Mr G paid towards loan 7. It should add 
8% simple interest per year to this refund, from when Mr G paid the interest and charges, 
until the date of settlement. Mr Lender should also remove any adverse information about 
loan 7 from Mr G's credit history (although as six years has passed, this may already have 
happened).
HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. 
Mr Lender must give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I partly uphold Mr G's complaint. PDL Finance Limited must 
put things right by taking the steps set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 July 2020.
