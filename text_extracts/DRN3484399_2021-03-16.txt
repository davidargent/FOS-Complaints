K821x#15complaint
Mrs S has complained that Madison  CF UK Limited  trading as 118 118 Money  lent to her
irresponsibly. Shes also complained that the lender acted unfairly towards her in other ways.
background
I issued a provisional decision about this complaint  in January 2021 that I summarise below.
Mrs S was given three loans by 118 118 Money  between October 2016 and November 
2017. All the loans were due to be repaid  in 24 monthly instalments. A summary of Mrs Ss
borrowing is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date  Repaid Amount Term Instalments
1 13/10/2016 16/05/2017 4,000 24 mths £222
2 16/05/2017 06/011/2017 4,579 24 mths £254
3 28/11/2017 16/03/2018 2,500 24 mths £140
Mrs S thinks  that the loans were unaffordable in her circumstances and that 118 118 Money
didnt carry out proper checks on her financial position. She says one of the loans was a top
up and she only took it because 118 118 Money texted her about  it. Mrs S has also
complained that when  she first applied for a loan in 2015, she was rejected, but she was
later accepted for all three loans even though she says her financial position hadnt changed.
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, in particular the checks  that 118 
118 Money needed to do such as the amount being lent, and the consumers  income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, I thought less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate in the early stages of the lending relationship.
I said that 118 118 Money was required to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks  in 
order to establish  whether  Mrs S could sustainably repay each loan.
118 118 Money carried out some checks before it gave  each  loan to Mrs S. This included
asking for details of her income and expenditure  and acquiring a credit report. 118 118
Money says that, based on the information  Mrs S provided and what it found in its checks,
each loan was affordable.
Mrs S was applying to 118 118 Money  for expensive lending, and she had to maintain her
repayments over an extended period. In the circumstances, I would have expected  118 118
Money to want to obtain a thorough understanding of Mrs Ss financial position before it
agreed each loan  including a more independent check  of her regular monthly income and
expenses - to satisfy itself that she could sustainably meet  her loan repayments over the
whole loan term. Overall, from what Id seen, I couldnt fairly say that the checks 118 118
Money carried out were  reasonable  and proportionate.
But in any event, I didnt  think  that 118 118 Money made a fair lending  decision when it
agreed the first two loans.
I thought that 118 118 Money would  have been aware from the credit  report it acquired when 
Mrs S applied for her first loan that she had a total loan balance of just over £16,000 and a
Ref: DRN34843992revolving credit balance of just over £3,000,  and a joint mortgage. Mrs S gave the reason for
applying for the loan from 118 118 Money  as home improvements and repairs. So, it
doesnt seem that she planned to use the loan to reduce her monthly payments to creditors
or consolidate her debts  in some way.
118 118 Money was required to establish  that Mrs S could sustainably repay her loan  not
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesn't automatically follow  this is the case. This
is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to
make their repayments without borrowing further.
The FLA Lending  Code 2006 says that factors which may show a high risk of a consumer
experiencing financial difficulty include spending  more than 25% of monthly  income on
credit. Mrs S declared her monthly  income  when  she applied for her first loan as £2,150.  I
think given the information 118 118 Money found in Mrs Ss credit  report,  it ought  reasonably
to have been aware that Mrs S would  be committing a substantial percentage of her monthly
income (over 30%) to meet repayments to 118 118 Money and her other existing  creditors. I
think in these circumstances  118 118 Money ought  to have realised that this put Mrs S at
high risk of experiencing financial difficulty.
Mrs S declared a slightly higher level of income  when  she took the second  loan. But she was
borrowing more from 118 118 Money and so had to make slightly higher monthly
repayments of £254   which she was expected  to maintain every month for two years, in
addition to payments  to her existing creditors. Considering the level of her existing
credit commitments  and the higher monthly repayments to 118 118 Money, this would  have
meant that Mrs S was still committing a substantial proportion of her monthly income  to
repaying credit. Whilst 118 118 Money  might  have calculated that her loan was affordable on
a pounds and pence basis, I thought the lender ought to have realised that Mrs S was at 
high risk of experiencing financial difficulty - given the proportion of her income that she was
spending on credit.
On balance, I didnt  think that 118 118 Money  ought  to have agreed to provide  either  the first 
or second loan to Mrs S. I said I was intending to uphold her complaint about  these  two 
loans.
Mrs S applied for a third loan in November 2017.  The credit report  shows that some  of Mrs 
Ss previous credit commitments had come  to an end and her repayments to 118 118 Money  
were also lower because she was borrowing a small sum. So overall  it seemed to me that 
Mrs S was spending a lower proportion of her income to manage her credit. But even  though 
this loan was for a reduced amount of £2,500, it was the third time in around  12 months that 
Mrs S had applied for a loan with an extended loan term. I thought 118 118 Money ought to 
have done more to independently  check Mrs Ss financial circumstances - to satisfy itself 
that she could  sustainably meet her loan repayments over the whole loan term.
But even if 118 118 Moneys checks werent proportionate, it doesnt  automatically follow  
that the lender was wrong to provide Mrs S with the third loan. Mrs S hasnt been able to 
provide her bank statements from that period as she no longer has access to the bank 
Ref: DRN34843993account she used  at the time. This is understandable, given the time that has passed. But 
without further  information, I couldnt say whether better checks  by 118 118 Money would 
have uncovered anything that would have shown that Mrs S might have difficulty  repaying 
her third loan sustainably. So, although  I thought the lender should have done more  to check 
Mrs Ss true financial position  before  it agreed to lend to her, I couldnt fairly  say that better  
checks ought reasonably to have led 118 118 Money to conclude that it shouldnt  lend to Mrs 
S for a third time in November 2017. And so, I couldnt fairly say that 118 118 Money lent to 
Mrs S irresponsibly  when  it gave  her the third loan.
Did 118 118 Money  act unfairly  or unreasonably towards Mrs S in some other way?
Mrs S says she only took her second  loan because 118 118 Money  told her she could top
up her loan. When Mrs S took her second  loan, she used some of it to settle  her first loan 
and took the remaining £1,500 in cash. I didnt have enough information about what 
happened at the time for me to fairly say that 118 118 Money acted unfairly by letting Mrs S 
know that she could  apply to re-finance her loan. But as this was only around seven months  
or so after she had taken a 24-month loan, I thought the lender ought  to have considered  
whether the second loan was overall extending the length of time that Mrs S would be 
indebted to 118 118 Money.  But in any event, I didnt think I needed to come  to a conclusion  
about this because as Ive explained  above, I was intending to uphold  the complaint  about 
this loan.
Mrs S also complained that when she first applied for a loan in 2015, she was rejected,
but when she applied later for the three loans she was accepted, even though  she says her
circumstances hadnt changed. I hadnt seen any further information  about what happened
when Mrs S applied  for any earlier lending from 118 118 Money.  But as it was some time
before her 2016-17 loans were  given, I didnt think it was unreasonable  for 118 118 Money 
to have re-considered further applications  from Mrs S sometime  after she first applied for 
lending.
Overall, I hadnt seen anything which made me think that 118 118 Money acted unfairly or
unreasonably towards  Mrs S in some other way. But I didnt think  it should  have
agreed to provide loans one and two to her. I said that I was intending to uphold  Mrs Ss 
complaint about  these  two loans and 118 118 Money needs to put things right.
I invited both parties to send me any further comments or evidence. Mrs S has told us she 
has nothing further  to add. 118 118 Money  disagreed with my provisional decision and has 
made a number of comments, all of which I have read very carefully and considered when 
coming to my final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought very carefully about what 118 118 Moneys further comments, but they havent 
changed my overall  view of this matter.
118 118 Money doesnt think  its fair to penalise  it in relation to the 25% threshold  advised 
within the FLA handbook,  especially given  the customers faultless lending history. 118 118 
Ref: DRN34843994Money says when Mrs S took the second  loan her credit repayments were  only slightly over 
the threshold, her spending  on credit  had reduced  and her total debt had also reduced.
But as I explained  in my provisional decision,  when 118 118 Money provided the first loan to 
Mrs S it ought reasonably  to have realised from its checks that she would  be committing a 
substantial percentage of her monthly income  to meet  repayments  to 118 118 Money and 
her other existing creditors. I think it ought reasonably to have been aware that she was at 
risk of being  unable  to repay her loan sustainably and taking everything  into account, I think  
it ought reasonably  to have declined to lend to her.
When Mrs S returned to borrow again  only a few months after taking her first loan, I think  
118 118 Money ought reasonably to have been aware that she was still repaying a 
significant proportion  of her income on credit and the amount she owed overall was still high, 
in comparison to her resources. I think as a responsible lender 118 118 Money  ought  fairly to 
have realised that Mrs S was still at risk of being  unable to repay her second  loan 
sustainably and that it was potentially extending  the length of time she would be indebted to 
118 118 Money. 
118 118 Money accepts  that Mrs S was spending around 33% of her income  on credit when 
it provided the first loan,  but it says this didnt put her in financial  hardship  and the loan 
improved her financial position, so the lending wasnt unsustainable. It also thinks  that as 
Mrs Ss subsequent financial position  improved,  including her taking larger  sole mortgage, 
then this shows that its lending wasnt unsustainable and didnt cause  any financial hardship. 
But I think there could  be many factors as to why Mrs S was subsequently took a sole, larger 
mortgage. And the fact that she found  a way to repay her loans does  not in my view alter the 
lenders obligation  at the time it lent to her to ensure it made  a fair lending decision and 
ensure that she could  repay the lending sustainably.
I accept that 118 118 Money holds a different view of this matter  and I have  thought very 
carefully about all of its further comments. Taking  everything into account,  I think  in the 
circumstances 118 118 Money ought  to have realised that Mrs S was at high risk of 
experiencing financial difficulty when she took the first two loans.  On balance, I dont think 
118 118 Money made a fair lending decision when it provided Mrs S with the first 2 loans.
I didnt uphold Mrs Ss complaint about  her third loan and Ive not seen any new evidence to 
change my mind about this loan. I also dont think that 118 118 Money acted unfairly or 
unreasonably towards  Mrs S in some other way. But I dont think 118 118 Money ought to 
have provided  Mrs S with loans one or two. So, 118 118 Money needs to put things right.
Putting things  right
I understand that all three loans have been  settled.
I think it is fair and reasonable for Mrs S to have repaid the principal  amount  that she
borrowed in loans one and two, because she had the benefit of that lending.  But she has 
paid interest and charges on two loans that shouldnt have been  provided to her.
118 118 Money should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges  on loans  one and two and treat all the 
payments Mrs S made on these loans as payments  towards the capital.
Ref: DRN34843995If reworking Mrs Ss loan account results  in her having effectively made payments 
above the original capital  borrowed, then 118 118 Money  should  refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments,  from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen,  to the date the complaint is settled*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mrs Ss credit  file in relation to loans 
one and two.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money  to deduct tax from this interest.  118 118
Money should give Mrs S a certificate  showing how much tax its deducted,  if she asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  this complaint and direct Madison CF 
UK Limited  trading as 118 118 Money to put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 April 2021.
