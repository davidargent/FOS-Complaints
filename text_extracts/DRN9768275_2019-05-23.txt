* Highest  instalment due
Mr M says the loan repayments  took so much  of his income that he had to borrow again, 
from both QuickQuid and other short-term  loan providers.  He says QuickQuid should have 
realised from his borrowing history  that his debt problems  were worsening and it would be 
irresponsible to continue  to lend. Mr M says his credit file would have shown multiple debts 
and in the end he had to take out a longer term loan to make the required repayments.
QuickQuid says it asked  Mr M about his income and expenditure and was satisfied the 
repayments were affordable based  on the information provided. It says his pattern of 
borrowing did not suggest Mr M was dependent on the loans, nor was it notified that Mr M 
was in financial difficulty.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld in part. He said there wasnt  
enough information to say QuickQuid  was wrong to approve the first two loans, but he found  
the pattern  of lending itself showed the borrowing was unsustainable  from Mr Ms third loan 
onwards. He recommended QuickQuid should refund interest and charges on loans 3 to 8 
(plus 8% statutory interest) and that it should remove the loans from Mr Ms credit file.
QuickQuid responded  to say, in summary, that it could not agree  the pattern of borrowing 
showed the lending was unsustainable. It said that Mr M had significant breaks between 
each of his loans which is not typical for someone  who has become dependent on the 
borrowing. It added that Mr M did not tell it he was in financial  difficulties,  despite  the late 
fees early on in his borrowing,  and that he had gone  on to repay  two of the loans early. 
QuickQuid explained  that the loans were repaid with two or three repayments, which would 
have meant  he should  have  been  able to comfortably afford  the repayments, including  those 
with additional  top-ups.
Ref: DRN97682752my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr M. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer 
could sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. 
This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook  (CONC) defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make repayments sustainably  if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Loans 1 and 2
When Mr M applied for his first two loans from QuickQuid, he said his income was just over 
£1,000, with a disposable  income of between £540 and £640. I cant  see that QuickQuid had 
any information that should have  prompted it to do further checks  at this stage. As the 
maximum loan repayments were under £170, Im satisfied  it did nothing wrong by approving 
Mr Ms first two loans.
Ref: DRN97682753Loans 3 onwards
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 
3. I say this because:
Mr M had incurred  late fees on both his first two loans. Given  the figures  hed 
declared to QuickQuid implied he could comfortably afford  the repayments, I consider 
this should have been an indication that further lending  might be unsustainable.
From  loan 3 onwards  Mr M was provided with a new loan within weeks of settling a 
previous one. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr M 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Ms indebtedness  was generally increasing unsustainably.
By the second  top-up to loan 7, Mr Ms maximum  repayment  on the loan was higher 
than the disposable income hed declared  to QuickQuid.
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed. Loan 8 was taken out 
two years after Mr Ms first. And it was for over three times the amount. Mr M had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt over an extended  period.
I think Mr M lost out because QuickQuid continued to lend from loan 3 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ms 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 3 to 8 and QuickQuid should put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) 
should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr M paid on loans 3 to 8;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
The number of loans  taken from loan 3 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So loans 3 to 8 should  be removed from Mr Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 June  2019.
