The complaint
Mr S has complained PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA didnt do all they could to help him 
when he reported hed not got anything in return for a PayPal payment.   
What happened
Mr S has used his PayPal account for a while. In 2020 he was looking to buy a phone and 
found a seller on a re-conditioned website. The seller wanted Mr S to send him a bank 
transfer. Mr S wasnt keen as he felt a PayPal payment would be safer. He paid £600.50 as 
a personal payment.
Mr S didnt receive the phone. The seller was telling him theyd not received the money 
although Mr S knew itd left his PayPal account. Mr S checked with his bank account and the 
original website (who went on to block the seller). He then raised his concerns with PayPal. 
He used their webchat service. This didnt have an option to raise concerns about a scam so 
Mr S explained it was unauthorised.
PayPal confirmed the payment had been made by Mr S. As it was sent as a personal 
payment, their rules offering buyer protection didnt apply. Mr S was unhappy with this 
response. He brought his complaint to the ombudsman service.
Our investigator believed PayPal could have done more. They were aware of Mr Ss 
concerns hed been a victim of a scam but had taken no further steps to help. He asked 
PayPal to refund Mr S, along with 8% simple interest.
PayPal reiterated their view that Mr Ss payment  as a personal payment  did not fall 
under their umbrella of payment protection. They didnt think there was anything else they 
could do.
Mr Ss complaint has been referred to an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusion as our investigator. Ill explain why.
When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where 
appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time.
The Payment Services Regulations primarily require payment services institutions to refund 
customers if they didnt make or authorise payments themselves. Certain other 
circumstances do apply but nothing thats had a marked impact on the decision Im making 
here. So when we look at whether a business has acted fairly in rejecting someones fraud 
complaint, one of the things we consider is whether the customer made the transactions 
themselves or allowed them to be made. If they did, then we generally wouldnt ask the bank 
to refund them under the PSRs.
In broad terms, the starting position in law is that a financial institution is expected to process 
payments and withdrawals that a customer authorises it to make without undue delay, in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the customers account. But thats not the full 
story as I confirm below.
To help me reach this decision, Ive considered evidence provided to us by PayPal and 
Mr S. Ive also noted the detail in our investigators view of 12 May 2021. I wont be 
repeating all that was stated there. I will, of course, refer to those aspects which drive the 
decision Im making.
Firstly all parties accept Mr S made this payment himself. I know he claimed it was 
unauthorised but I suspect this was no more than there being no alternative on PayPals 
webchat service to explain the circumstances of what had happened. Mr S was being 
offered a more than two hour wait to have a webchat with an individual rather than an 
automated service.
At the time Mr S made this complaint, PayPal were able to temporarily block the sellers 
PayPal account so Im satisfied that the money had been received following Mr Ss original 
instruction. 
PayPal has confirmed their buyer protection policy doesnt apply to personal payments. 
These are designed for payments between friends and family and arent designed by PayPal 
to pay for goods and services. That said Im satisfied they must be aware this use goes on 
and unfortunately it does offer individuals who scam others to use a mechanism without  
they believe  any comeback.
So did PayPal have any other option? Could they have assisted Mr S regardless of the fact 
their buyer protection policy doesnt apply to these types of payments? I believe the answer 
is clearly yes.
Clearly PayPal were advised early on  12 May 2020  that Mr S was concerned hed been 
scammed. PayPal has shared the webchats held with Mr S so I can see he was able to 
confirm what had happened. Whilst PayPal dismissed Mr Ss complaint by saying their rules 
didnt apply, they could have done more.  
Industry best practice offers bank customers the ability to claim back payments where 
theyve been the victim of a scam. Whilst PayPal, as operator of their own payment scheme, 
are not part of that model, I can consider as highlighted above whether those principles can 
 because they are best practice  be considered more widely. 
I think I can partly because PayPal runs both the sender and recipient accounts in 
complaints like this. They have much more power in this equation than banks where often 
different institutions run the sender and beneficiary accounts. In this case the funds were in 
the recipients account so its not as if the money had already been moved elsewhere and 
outside of PayPals reach.
I also have to wonder why PayPal wouldnt want to offer customers the ability to report 
scams and try to help out where funds are recoverable. This would seem to be a fair and 
reasonable step. Their response that their buyer protection policy doesnt apply seems to be 
a rule-based approach which limits the service customers receive. As Mr S has stressed to 
us, despite using the personal payment option he still felt this would be a safe option as hed 
not had problems using PayPal previously. I appreciate PayPals argument that theyd have no basis to remove funds from the sellers 
account but Im not sure I agree. If after investigation theyd found the seller had been 
misusing PayPals conditions of use, then thered be scope for managing the issue if this 
proved to be the case.  
Overall I think PayPal could have done more to assist Mr S when he reported his concerns 
to them.
Putting things right
As I believe PayPal should have done more. I think its fair and reasonable they reimburse 
Mr S for his lost funds. In accordance with our approach in similar cases, I will also be asking 
them to add 8% simple interest for the period Mr S has been without his funds.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is to instruct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
Reimburse Mr S £600.50 for the payment he made in May 2020; and
Add 8% simple interest a year to that amount from 7 May 2020 to the date of 
settlement.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 September 2021.
