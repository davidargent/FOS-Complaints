The complaint
Mrs B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc declined a debit card transaction, 
meaning her supermarket on-line grocery order and delivery slot was cancelled during the 
Covid-19 pandemic.  
What happened
Mrs B completed an on-line supermarket order and booked a delivery slot using her NatWest 
debit card. But Mrs Bs card was declined by NatWest and a block was placed on her card.
Mrs B is very unhappy about the situation. She says she was pregnant and in the vulnerable 
category so was shielding in line with the Covid-19 pandemic guidelines. And that shed 
already waited 11 days for a delivery slot. By declining the payment, she says that NatWest 
left her and her family without food and other essential items. 
She complained to NatWest and asked for compensation to fully recognise its mistake and 
the stress it had caused. She added that NatWest had made no attempt to contact her when 
it declined the payment. 
NatWest said its fraud detection system had stopped the payment for security reasons and 
that it would have attempted to contact Mrs B had she not contacted it first. So, it didnt think 
it had done anything wrong and it didnt uphold the complaint. But it paid Mrs B £50 in 
recognition of the inconvenience caused when her card was declined. 
Mrs B wasnt happy with that and brought her complaint to this service. She thinks the 
situation warrants a much higher compensation payment. 
Our investigator didnt think NatWest needed to do any more here. He said that NatWest 
acted in accordance with Mrs Bs account terms and conditions. 
But Mrs B didnt agree. In summary, she reiterated that NatWest didnt contact her when the 
transaction was declined. And that if NatWest had had concerns about her account it should 
have contacted her when her card was being repeatedly registered in the days prior to the 
transaction not after the transaction was declined. 
The investigator didnt think this altered the overall outcome hed reached. But he added that 
the transaction was declined in the very early hours of the morning and that Mrs B contacted 
NatWest about it at around 9am. So, he didnt think that NatWest had not had the 
opportunity to contact her during working hours. 
Mrs B asked for her complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman, so her complaint has been 
passed to me. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The starting point here is that its right for NatWest to have security measures and 
procedures in place to safeguard customers accounts and prevent fraud so far as possible. 
As to exactly what those procedures are and how they are carried out, that is a matter for 
NatWest to decide. What I need to decide here is whether it applied its procedure correctly 
and fairly. 
The terms and conditions of Mrs Bs account sets out that NatWest can suspend or restrict 
the account  including debit card payments, in certain circumstances. One of those 
circumstances relates to concerns about a debit card potentially being used fraudulently. 
The terms also say that NatWest will contact the account holder if it suspects or becomes 
aware that the account may be subject to fraud or security threats. 
NatWest says that the supermarket payment was declined by its automated fraud detection 
system. And a block was placed on the card to prevent further payments being made until 
Mrs B had confirmed that the transaction was genuine. In taking these steps, I find that 
NatWest was acting in line with the terms and conditions of Mrs Bs account. 
NatWest has indicated that the transaction was flagged by its system as a result of Mrs Bs 
card being registered in the days leading up to the transaction being processed by the 
supermarket. I know Mrs B thinks this isnt unusual card activity given how on-line grocery 
shopping orders are completed. But fraud systems are automated, so I dont think it was 
unreasonable that the transaction was flagged by the system in these circumstances. And, 
once it had been flagged, I think it was appropriate for NatWest to put a temporary block in 
place to protect Mrs Bs account. 
NatWest says it would have contacted Mrs B to try and verify the transaction. But here Mrs B 
contacted NatWest before it had had the opportunity to contact her. But I have no reason to 
doubt that NatWest would have contacted Mrs B during normal working hours had she not 
contacted it first.  
I do understand that this was inconvenient for Mrs B  particularly given her circumstances, 
and that this all happened when demand for supermarket delivery slots were in such high 
demand. And I sympathise with the situation Mrs B found herself in. But I dont think that 
NatWest acted unfairly or unreasonably here. The nature of bank security checks means 
that they will cause some inconvenience to some customers from time to time. But the 
measures are there to protect customers accounts. 
And I dont think NatWest did anything wrong by temporarily suspending Mrs Bs card after 
its fraud detection system had flagged a potential security issue. Its what I would expect the 
bank to do. From what Ive seen the card was reactivated following Mrs Bs call to NatWest.
NatWest has acknowledged that the situation was upsetting and inconvenient for Mrs B and 
it has paid her compensation of £50. I think thats fair. I realise its less than Mrs B would 
like. But given I have found that NatWest didnt do anything wrong, I dont think NatWest 
needs to pay any further compensation. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mrs B, but Im not going to ask NatWest to do any more here. 
My final decision
For the reasons above, I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2021.
