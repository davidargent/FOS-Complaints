Complaint
Mr O is unhappy with the way New Day Ltd trading as Aqua (NewDay) handled his 
chargeback request.
Background
Mr O has a credit card with NewDay. In November 2019, the security of his account with a 
travel website was compromised and used to pay for accommodation. He received a text 
message from the travel website explaining that the email address connected to his account 
had been changed. The same day he noticed a payment had been collected from his 
NewDay account.
He told the travel website that his account had been hacked and contacted NewDay to tell 
them he hadnt authorised this payment. After Mr O had signed the appropriate form, 
NewDay raised a chargeback on his behalf. The website responded to the chargeback 
request by asserting that Mr O had authorised the payment and provided evidence to justify 
its conclusion.
NewDay shared this response with Mr O on 13 March 2020. It said that, if he wanted to 
pursue the chargeback, he would need to complete a second form and return it within 14 
days. Mr O spoke with an employee of NewDay on 17 March 2020 and confirmed that he 
didnt agree with the response to the chargeback. He says he made NewDay aware that the 
merchant had missed that the email address used in connection with this booking was 
different to Mr Os email address. NewDay reiterated that if Mr O wanted to pursue the 
chargeback, hed need to return the signed declaration form to them.
On 2 April 2020, NewDay withdrew the chargeback on the basis that Mr O hadnt complied 
with the time limits. Mr O was unhappy with this and so he complained. NewDay responded 
by saying that it was bound by the rules of the chargeback scheme and its timelines were 
applied strictly. It didnt have any discretion. Nonetheless, it felt that it had provided a poor 
quality of customer service to Mr O and so agreed to pay him £20 in recognition of the 
distress and inconvenience this had caused to him.
Mr O was unhappy with NewDays conclusions on the chargeback, so he brought a 
complaint to this service. It was looked at by an Investigator who upheld it. The Investigator 
said that NewDay had enough information to challenge the rebuttal from the merchant. Mr O 
had explained during a telephone call that its response hadnt acknowledged that the email 
address associated with his account had changed. Even if Mr O hadnt managed to return 
the second declaration form, there was no procedural need for it to be completed since 
NewDay knew what Mr Os view was.
NewDay disagreed with the investigators view of the complaint. It said that it wouldnt 
normally look to process a second chargeback without additional evidence being provided by 
the consumer. It also said that Mr O was aware of the time sensitive nature of the 
chargeback process  it didnt think he shouldve waited so long before contacting them to 
find out the address to send the declaration form. Because NewDay disagreed with the 
opinion reached by the investigator, the complaint has been passed to me to consider and 
issue a final decision.
Findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr O says that he did complete the second declaration form and return it to NewDay. He 
says the deadline was missed due to circumstances beyond his control  for example, it 
mightve been a result of delays in the postal delivery system.
However, I dont think it particularly matters whether Mr O posted the form in time. NewDay 
spoke to him on 17 March 2020. As a result of that conversation, it knew that he disagreed 
with the basis of the merchants response to the chargeback. He also provided additional 
evidence by affirming that the email address used to make the booking was not his. As I 
understand it, the chargeback rules dont impose a requirement that a signed declaration be 
completed by the customer each time. NewDay clearly had enough information to be able to 
challenge the chargeback on Mr Os behalf and shouldve done so following that 
conversation.
There is, of course, no guarantee that a chargeback will succeed. But on balance, I think its 
more likely than not that this one wouldve done. From the evidence Mr O has provided, the 
email address associated with his account was changed just before the payment was made 
to one not connected to Mr O. He raised this with both the merchant and NewDay very 
promptly. On balance, I think its more likely than not that Mr O didnt authorise this 
transaction but that his card details, stored in his account with the merchant, allowed a 
fraudster to make payments. 
Overall, I think NewDay shouldve proceeded with the chargeback after its conversation with 
Mr O regarding the merchants rebuttal. If it had done so, I think its more likely than not that 
the chargeback wouldve been successful.     
Final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold this complaint.
NewDay Ltd needs to refund the transaction of £349.91 to Mr Os account. If this payment 
attracted interest or charges, NewDay Ltd needs to refund these too.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 June 2021.
