The complaint
Mrs F says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly 
lent to her. Mrs F says she couldnt afford the loans and as a result got into a cycle of debt.  
What happened
This complaint is about 55 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mrs F between March 2017 
and April 2019. Mrs Fs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Repayment
1 14/03/2017 31/03/2017 6 £200.00   £60.84
2 04/04/2017 28/04/2017 6 £400.00 £129.50
3 06/05/2017 26/05/2017 6 £200.00   £64.42
4 21/06/2017 30/06/2017 6 £100.00   £28.86
5 22/07/2017 27/07/2017 6   £50.00   £14.38

10 31/10/2017 25/11/2017 6 £400.00 £129.94
 
I have only listed the first ten loans. Mrs F continued to borrow regularly until April 2019 and 
the amounts borrowed were between £50 and £400. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mrs Fs complaint and thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been given. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan 22 onwards. We put the 
offer to Mrs F, but she didnt want to accept it.Another of our adjudicators reviewed the complaint and didnt think the complaint should be 
upheld at loan six as Mrs F had only been borrowing for around four months at that point. 
But the adjudicator did think a pattern of borrowing had emerged by loan eight so upheld the 
complaint at that point.
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs F could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs F could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. Mrs F didnt disagree the second adjudicators opinion that loans one to seven shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mrs F had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Fs complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs F, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Fs case, like the second adjudicator, I think that 
this point was reached by loan eight. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs F was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Mrs F had taken out eight loans within seven months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs F was having to borrow further 
to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Mrs 
Fs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mrs Fs first loan was for £200 and loan eight was for £300.  While I accept the 
amounts borrowed fluctuated, at this point I think Sunny ought to have known that 
Mrs F was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income but to 
meet an ongoing need. 
 
For most of the borrowing chain and which continued from loan ten onwards, Mrs F 
was provided with a new loan within weeks of settling a previous one. 
 
Mrs F wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 55 was 
taken out 25 months after Mrs Fs first. And it was for the same amount. Mrs F had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Mrs F lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan eight 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Fs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mrs F borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mrs Fs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans eight to 55 and Sunny should put things right.Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mrs F paid on loans eight to 55;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 
information recorded about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans eight to 55 
should be removed from Mrs Fs credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mrs Fs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 June 2020.
