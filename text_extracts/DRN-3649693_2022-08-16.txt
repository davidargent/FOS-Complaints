The complaint
Mr P is unhappy with how AXA Insurance UK Plc (AXA) has handled his travel insurance
claim.
What happened
Mr P was due to go on a holiday within the UK from 25 October 2021 to 29 October 
2021.
On 24 October 2021, Mr Ps father became ill so he decided to cancel the holiday. 
Sadly, Mr Ps father passed away on 28 October 2021.
Mr P submitted a claim to AXA on 30 October 2021 for the cancelled holiday. He was 
informed that someone would be in touch within five days but as no further 
communication was received from AXA, Mr P made a complaint on 30 November 
2021.
On 23 January 2022, Mr P brought his complaint to this service as he had heard 
nothing further from AXA regarding his claim. Since the complaint came to this 
service, AXA responded and settled Mr Ps claim on 21 April 2022 and offered £100 
compensation for the delays and for how the claim had been handled. Mr P didnt 
accept the offer of compensation.
Our investigator concluded that while the delays werent acceptable and 
acknowledged the poor service provided by AXA, she thought the £100 offer of 
compensation was fair and reasonable.
Mr P doesnt agree because he feels the poor service provided and the delays 
caused by AXA from 30 October 2021 to 21 April 2022 wasnt acceptable.
I issued a provisional decision on Mr Ps complaint on 27 July 2022. I said the following:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, my intention is to uphold this complaint. My reasons for doing so are as
follows:
Mr P submitted a claim on 30 October 2021 and the claim was eventually settled on 
21 April 2022. There was a delay of almost six months.
In between October 2021 and April 2022, Mr P sent several emails to AXA asking for 
an update. He sent all the information requested by AXA regarding his claim in early 
November 2021. So, while I appreciate there were delays caused due to the backlog 
created by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, I think the delays were unacceptable 
bearing in mind the claim details were sent swiftly by Mr P. AXA didnt update Mr P 
during the claim process and Mr P had to chase several times.
Despite the unprecedented times and uncertainty created by the pandemic, I think 
AXA could have been better at updating Mr P when he requested updates. There 
was a lack of communication from AXA for most of the six months that the claim was 
being dealt with and it was clearly frustrating and disappointing for Mr P.
Mr P had sadly lost his father which no doubt would have been a difficult time for him 
and to then have to deal with the claim for his cancelled holiday would have also 
been challenging, especially because of the poor service provided, the delays 
caused and the lack of communication.
My intention is to recommend that AXA offer Mr P £150 in total in recognition of how 
the claim has been handled. I understand its already offered £100 but Im 
recommending a further £50 for the reasons given above.
Both parties responded to my provisional decision and accepted my recommendation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In light of the responses from both Mr P and AXA, I see no reason to depart from what Ive 
said in my provisional decision of 27 July 2022. 
Overall, Im satisfied that for the reasons Ive given in my provisional decision, its fair and 
reasonable for AXA to increase its offer by a further £50, making the total offer of £150 
compensation to Mr P.  
Putting things right
AXA needs to put things right and do the following:
Pay Mr P an additional £50 compensation in addition to the £100 its already offered.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mr Ps complaint against AXA Insurance UK Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 September 2022.
