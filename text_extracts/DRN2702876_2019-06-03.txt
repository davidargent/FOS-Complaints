K821x#15complaint
Mr W says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to him. He says 
he couldnt afford the loans and was stuck  in a debt cycle.
background
This complaint is about 16 payday  loans  QuickQuid provided to Mr W between
September 2014 and June 2017. Ive set out some of the loan information in an appendix  at 
the end of this decision.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ws complaint in part and thought that loan 6 and the subsequent 
loans shouldnt have  been given. QuickQuid  disagreed and the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
In response to our adjudication, QuickQuid disagreed that it had done anything wrong during 
the course of the lending relationship with Mr W. It provided further detail about the checks it 
had made  when it approved loans from March 2015  onwards and it sent a document  
detailing its lending process from 2015. 
Ref: DRN27028762This service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic argument directly  and through  
earlier final decisions. So Im not going  to expand on this point any further  here, though Ive 
considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. Ive focussed my decision on 
the specifics of Mr Ws complaint and what both parties have said about  this.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to make repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, QuickQuids checks for loan 1 went far enough but it should 
have done more before agreeing to lend subsequent loans. Our adjudicator  also explained 
that Mr W hadnt provided sufficient information  about his circumstances so she couldnt 
safely conclude that loans 2 to 5 were unaffordable.  And so she didnt recommend that 
Mr Ws complaint  about loans 1 to 5 should be upheld.
Ive looked at the circumstances  around loans 1 to 5 and I agree with the adjudicator. Mr W 
hasnt disagreed with the adjudicators findings  and hasnt provided  any further information. 
As there isnt an ongoing dispute about loans 1 to 5, I wont be going into further details  
about those here.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr W, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid  should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid shouldve realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because by loan 6 Mr W had been  borrowing  consistently  for around 8 
months and from loan 6 onwards Mr W was usually provided with a new loan within  days of 
settling a previous  one. I dont consider that there were any significant  breaks  between  the 
loans. This is because considering the length of time Mr W was borrowing from QuickQuid, 
I dont think the short  breaks in lending  were enough  to allow  QuickQuid to reasonably 
believe Mr Ws circumstances had improved. 
Also on several of the loans; Mr W was topping-up with additional  borrowing and I can also 
see that Mr W rolled over a number of the loans before repaying them. I think  this pattern  
indicated that Mr W was likely in financial difficulties  and reliant on these loans. So 
QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more likely than not Mr W was having  to borrow  
further to cover the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and that his 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN27028763I also think Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid and so 
wasnt able to free himself  from repeated  borrowing.  Loan  16 was taken out nearly three  
years after Mr Ws first and it was for a larger  amount. Loan  6 was for £600,  more than any 
of his previous  loans  and the amounts Mr W borrowed from loan 6 onwards didnt reduce 
especially as he was topping-up  most of the loans. Mr W had paid large amounts of interest  
to, in effect; service  a debt to QuickQuid over an extended period. QuickQuid itself says its 
loans arent  suitable for use over a long period of time. I think  three years was a significant 
amount of time for Mr W to continue borrowing and it shouldve been clear  to QuickQuid that 
he wasnt using the loans for their intended purpose of short term cash flow problems.
As QuickQuid continued to lend to Mr W, I think he lost out, this is because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans, a total of 26 advanced, and deferrals were likely  to have 
had negative implications on Mr Ws ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 16 and QuickQuid should  put things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 6 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 16 should be removed from 
Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  pay Mr W compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 July 2019.
