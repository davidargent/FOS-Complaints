The complaint
Mr B complains about how NewDay Ltd dealt with him when he lost his job.
What happened
Mr B says he lost his job and contacted NewDay about his credit card account and debt in 
early 2023. He says NewDay didnt respond or offer any help.
NewDay accepts it didnt respond to Mr B when he contacted it and made an offer to refund 
late payment fees, interest and pay £75 as a gesture of goodwill.
Mr B brought his complaint to us, and our investigator thought NewDay should refund 
interest from when Mr B first contacted it in early 2023 until it did try and speak to him. The 
investigator thought the rest of NewDays offer fair and reasonable.
Mr B accepted the investigators view and confirmed his credit file had been amended but he 
said he hadnt received the interest refund or goodwill gesture.
NewDay also agreed with the investigators view and has provided us with the June 2023 
account statement which confirms the refunds and goodwill gesture were applied.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the same overall view reached by the investigator.
NewDay knows that it should treat customers in financial difficulties positively and 
sympathetically. There is no question here that NewDay didnt treat Mr B in such a way 
when he first contacted it and that it took some time to contact him. I have no doubt that 
delay caused Mr B distress and inconvenience.
Im satisfied that NewDay has fairly offered to refund interest and late payment fees. And 
that it has offered to remove adverse information from Mr Bs credit card account as well as 
paid what I think is a fair and reasonable goodwill payment of £75.
I can see all parties agreed with the investigators view. And Mr B has told us that he has 
agreed a repayment plan with NewDay.
I have looked at Mr Bs account statement from June 2023 and am satisfied the late 
payment fees and interest were refunded to him and that the payment of £75 was credited to 
his account. So, I am unsure why Mr B says they were not received.
Overall, Im satisfied NewDay has fairly complied with the investigators view including 
removing the adverse information from Mr Bs credit file. I appreciate Mr B may have been 
expecting the interest refund and fees to be paid into a different account. But Im satisfied 
that he didnt pay the interest or fees and so the fairest approach would be to reduce the 
balance Mr B owes NewDay.
Putting things right
Im satisfied that NewDay has complied with the investigator view as agreed by Mr B and I 
dont require NewDay to do anything further in the circumstances of this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 December 2023.
