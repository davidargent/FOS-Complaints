The complaint
Mrs M, through her representative, complains that Short Term Finance Limited (STFL) lent 
to her irresponsibly. These were home-collected loans.

Loan 3 took 131 weeks to pay off rather than 16 weeks.
One of the documents STFL sent to us gave an indication that Mrs M had taken a loan 
(possibly more than one) before the December 2015 loan. But neither STFL nor Mrs M have 
sent us any details of them. So, this loan table lists the loans to which this decision relates.
STFL sent to Mrs M its final response letter to her complaint in January 2022. The 
outstanding loan 16 was due to have been repaid in March 2022 and that may have 
occurred. But on the information I have now, it remains outstanding. 
STFL said that it ought to have investigated the financial details for Mrs M more thoroughly 
at loan 6. So, it was content to put things right for Mrs M for loans 6 to 8. But it considered 
that a Financial Conduct Authority Review of STFL which took place in 2019-2020 meant 
that STFL approached loan applications in a different way from June 2020, and it did not 
consider that any of the other loans had been mis-sold. 
The redress from Loans 6 to 8 payable to Mrs M was calculated to have been £472.16. 
STFL said it would remove reference to loans 6 to 8 from Mrs Ms credit file as well. 
After Mrs M had referred her complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service, one of our 
adjudicators considered the complaint and thought that STFL had agreed to put things right 
for loans 6 to 8 and so she did not review them. 
Our adjudicator also thought that loans 9 to 16 were a further set of loans for which STFL 
should pay redress to Mrs M. So, the combined uphold (what STFL had offered combined 
with our adjudicators view) was for loans 6 to 16. Mrs Ms representative has acknowledged 
the decision but has made no comment on it. 
STFL disagreed with our adjudicators view and its points are summarised here:
- Loans 9 and 10 were one loan split between weekly terms of 15 and 34 weeks to 
accommodates Mrs M
- A full enhanced due diligence check was undertaken at that point for loans 9 and 10, 
and STFL knew Mrs M had three home credit company accounts (with one loan 
company) which were delinquent and she was in a payment plan for them
- STFL says that the June payment was missed (no year given) and the account was 
cleared on 24 August 2020 (which must be reference to loan 8 which closed on that 
date)
-  Loans 11 to 14  STFL did an income and expenditure check (I&E) and there was 
no deterioration on her credit file
- Loans 15 and 16 were one loan split into 15 and 34 week terms to accommodate 
Mrs Ms request
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance, and good industry practice - on our website. 
STFL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs M could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the Mrs Ms income 
and expenditure.
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that STFL should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the 
consumer.
These factors include:
- having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income).
- the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a level of income).
- having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting 
the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable).
- coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. This is what our adjudicator thought was 
the situation with Mrs M at loan 9.
STFL was required to establish whether Mrs M could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being the 
ability to repay without undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments.
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
to do that.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ms complaint.
The FCA s166 Review submissions
I have seen these submissions made by STFL before and I have  from other complaints  
kept and re-reviewed the Report to which STFL refers.
The Executive Summary of the Report tells me that STFL was issued with a Skilled Person 
Requirement Notice on 21 October 2019 by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The 
Notice required STFL to appoint a Skilled Person under s166 of the Financial Services and 
Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) to undertake various phased Reviews.
The Report goes on to explain that STFL
ceased lending following the Phase I report in order to implement required changes. 
Following a five-month period of not lending and in line with our recommended 
changes, STF implemented its updated lending policies and processes and 
recommenced lending on 20 July 2020.I do not consider that the FCA sign off following the s166 Review necessarily means that all 
loans lent after that are ones where any complaint about irresponsible lending is bound to 
fail. Each customer can complain and having been reviewed by us, the repetitive nature and 
consistent lending across almost six years are the significant elements within the particular 
circumstances of this case. 
Loans 1 to 3
As I have mentioned earlier in this decision, the handwritten application forms from 2015 and 
2016 reveal several elements about Mrs M and her loan history. One is that she was a 
woman who had separated from her partner, was on benefits with three children and had her 
fourth child four weeks after loan 2 was approved. 
The documentation I have for loan 1 shows me that she used the proceeds from that loan to 
settle the previous loan (about which we have no details), so of the £700 loan she took 
Mrs M used £176.52 to settle the previous loan and received £523.48 as cash in hand. 
Loans 1, 2 and 3 were all used to repay the previous loan and Mrs M was scheduled to 
repay £70 or £75 a week for those loans. This was a high level of a commitment for a home-
credit loan. I can see that according to the details on those written applications it seems that 
Mrs M was able to afford the loans as her benefits income was relatively high at between 
£555 and £632 a week. 
However, I am aware that each loan was used to pay off the previous loan and that loan 3 
was scheduled to be repaid in 16 weeks and took 131 weeks. So, the impression I receive is 
that its likely she was not able to afford these loans as a single mother of 4 children and on 
benefits. But as I do not have any information from Mrs M about her finances in 2015 and 
2016, and I have no further details about any earlier loans STFL may have approved for her 
before December 2015, and as she has not responded to object to the outcome for loans 1 
to 3 after our adjudicators view, then I do not have the foundation evidence to uphold these 
loans.
What this information has given me is the background, which I deal with next.
The gap
I am not entirely in agreement with our adjudicator that the gap in the lending between 
paying off loan 3 and taking loan 4 was enough to break the lending relationship. And I say 
this because the break was only five months and it followed an extraordinarily long period 
during which Mrs M was in debt to STFL  131 weeks  which was about two and half years.  
Further, as I have outlined above, I do not think that this was the fourth loan Mrs M had 
taken  I think its likely she had taken more. 
However, five months was a gap and cant be ignored. So, I have factored into my decision 
both situations  that the five month gap did break the lending relationship and therefore 
loan 4 was the first of the new loan chain. And I have also looked at the complaint as if there 
was no break. Ive done this as its so borderline that I wanted to demonstrate to the parties 
I have looked at the complaint with both possibilities in mind. 
Loans 4 and 5
Mrs M has not disagreed with our adjudicator about the outcome for loans 4 and 5. So that 
leads me to think that she is satisfied with the outcome. So those appear to be resolved and I have not considered them further. 
Loans 6 to 8 
STFL said to Mrs M in the FRL it sent to her in January 2022 this: We do recognise that by 
loan 6 we could have looked deeper into your outgoings and completed an enhanced due 
diligence assessment, therefore we do uphold loan 6
And I think the reason for that may be because the copy credit search results list I have seen 
shows that in December 2019  when Mrs M wanted loan 6 - Mrs M already had a default 
recorded for her and she had three loans which were delinquent in the previous 12 months. 
And later in the FRL STFL made it clear it was conceding in relation to her complaint for 
loans 6 to 8. So, I need say no more about those and I have included in the redress below 
the sums for loans 6 to 8 as well. 
Loan 9 onwards
Our adjudicator considered that by loan 9 STFL ought to have realised that it had been 
lending to Mrs M for a long time. It was fifteen months continuously and nearly five years 
overall from loan 1  which as I have said before  I do not think it was loan 1 as I think 
STFL had been lending to her before that date. Our adjudicator considered that the loan 
sums were increasing and so it ought not to have lent to Mrs M from loan 9 onwards. 
STFLs submissions to defend the situation surrounding loans 9 onwards were summarised 
in the what happened part of the decision. 
However, considering all the information I have about Mrs Ms history of lending with STFL, 
considering what I have said earlier about the S166 Skilled Persons Review outcome and 
considering that loan 9 was almost five years after STFL first lent to Mrs M, then I agree with 
our adjudicator. And even if the break of five months in 2019 is treated as a break in the 
lending, still I think that loan 9 was fifteen months down the line of the second loan chain and 
so still I consider that STFL ought to have realised that it should have ceased lending at this 
point. I explain here. 
The two loans taken on the same day in September 2020 (Loans 9 and 10) were an 
escalation in the amounts Mrs M had been taking and followed what STFL knew about  
namely- Mrs M was in a repayment plan for another home credit lender with which Mrs M 
had three outstanding loans. 
Her credit file at that point  a copy of which STFL has sent us  showed that Mrs M had 
delinquent accounts and STFL knew she had two County Court Judgments (CCJs). And for 
a person to have been in debt for such a period that the creditors had succeeded 
in obtaining two CCJs against her shows that the debt had been longstanding. 
STFL has sent to us copy bank account statements (dating from around July 2020) it 
obtained from Mrs M before approving loans 9 and 10. I have reviewed those. They do not 
shed much light on the situation on their own as a lot of the transactions are transfers by 
Mrs M between what appear to have been her own accounts. And a lot are what appear to 
be payments to friends which have not been explained. So, I think that STFLs reliance on 
these bank account statements reviews are not as comprehensive a check as it thinks. 
Normally where there are obvious transfers between accounts then Id expect the bank 
account review to include that other account as well. But I do not have those other set of 
statements and as STFL has not sent any to me (I assume that they do not have them) and 
as I have said before, Mrs M has sent us nothing. From Loans 9 and 10 taken on the same day, then it started to become apparent that 
Mrs Ms needs for credit was increasing and she took overlapping loans and used, as she 
had in the past, new loans to repay older loans. 
Examples are  loan 11 was used to repay one of the two loans taken on 16 September 
2020 (loan 9). Then loan 12 was used to repay loan 10.
All this culminated in Mrs M being approved for two loans  (loans 15 and 16) coming to a 
combined fresh debt of £970 principal sum which was a total debt of £1,500 and costing 
Mrs M £100 a week. And from the information on the loan table which is information from 
STFL, loans 15 and 16 were used to repay loans 12 and 14. 
From June 2019 (loan 4) to September 2021 (loans 15 and 16) Mrs Ms debt had grown from 
£100 to £970 and so Mrs M had, effectively, being paying large sums to continually repay a 
debt over a long time. And, considering my review of loans 1 to 3 ( and what likely showed a 
history of earlier lending as well) then I think this would likely have been the second time 
Mrs M had found herself in this situation with STFL. 
And if I consider that this was one long loan chain then STFL had been lending to her almost 
continuously for years by September 2021 (loans 15 and 16). 
I think that Mrs M lost out because Morses continued to provide borrowing from loan 9 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the length of time over which Mrs M borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost loans.
STFL was wrong to have continued to lend to Mrs M from loan 9. And I uphold the loans for 
Mrs M from loan 9 as well as the ones  loans 6 to 8  that STFL has already agreed to 
uphold. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STFL should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Mrs M from loan 9 as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
And STFL has already conceded in relation to loans 6 to 8. Clearly there are a great many 
possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs M may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this lender which they may not have had with others. If this wasnt a 
viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming 
that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for borrowing). But even if they had done that, the 
information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or ought to 
have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is impossible to now 
accurately reconstruct.
From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Mrs M in a 
compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Mrs M would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. 
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFLs liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right.
What STFL needs to do
As I said earlier, it may be that loan 16 has been repaid. If it has not then if STFL has sold 
the outstanding debt on loan 16 STFL should buy it back if it is able to do so and then take 
the following steps. If STFL is not able to buy the debt back STFL should liaise with the new 
debt owner to achieve the results outlined below. If loan 16 has been repaid then the redress 
calculations are simpler.
A. STFL should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs M towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything it has already refunded.
B. STFL should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Mrs M which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs M 
originally made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. STFL should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans and treat any repayments made by Mrs M as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mrs M 
having made overpayments then STFL should refund these overpayments with 8% 
simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments 
would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. STFL should then refund the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. The surplus 
should be paid to Mrs M.
E. For loans 6 to 8, STFL has said it would remove them completely from Mrs Ms credit 
file and so I am directing that it does that. 
F. The overall pattern of Mrs Ms borrowing for loans 9 to 16 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from 
Mrs Ms credit file.
STFL does not have to remove loan 16 from Mrs Ms credit file until repaid, but STFL should 
still remove any adverse information recorded about it.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STFL to deduct tax from this interest. STFL should give 
Mrs M a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Ms complaint in part and I direct that Short Term 
Finance Limited does as I have set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or reject my decision before 25 October 2022.
