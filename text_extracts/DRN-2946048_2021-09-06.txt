The complaint
Ms J complains that TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED (TransUnion) reported 
incorrect data on her credit file.
What happened
In August 2020, Ms J discovered a default reported by a business I will refer to as C on her 
TransUnion credit file. Ms J didnt recognise the debt and contacted TransUnion to say the 
individuals date of birth didnt match hers. Ms J said shed moved in to the address 
associated with the debt a year after it was allegedly obtained.
C confirmed to Ms J that she wasnt its customer and that the debt didnt belong to her. Ms J 
disputed the information with TransUnion, but it rejected her dispute.
In 2021, TransUnion said that the incorrect data was as a result of an alias link created from 
data that it received in 2013 from a business I will refer to as B. TransUnion offered Ms J 
£50 to apologise. 
TransUnion says that it wasnt obvious that the problem with Ms Js credit file was due to a 
data merge. 
Ms J is unhappy with TransUnions explanation of how the data merge happened. She says 
that if the problems had been created by the alias link in 2013, why did it take until 2020 for 
the default to appear in Ms Js name.
The investigator recommended that Ms Js complaint be upheld, and that TransUnion should 
pay Ms J a total of £800 compensation. The investigator followed up his recommendation 
with a request to TransUnion to dispute another entry on Ms Js credit file.
TransUnion hasnt replied to the investigators recommendation, so the complaint has come 
to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms J says that she became aware of the incorrect debt on her credit file in August 2020 and 
disputed the default entry with TransUnion on several occasions. I can see from the 
evidence that Ms J has given to us that TransUnion rejected her dispute at least twice in 
2020. 
Ms J then complained to TransUnion in early October 2020. She explained the issue and 
attached copies of her driving licence, tenancy agreement and a letter from C. This letter 
recommended that Ms J contact the CRAs again to question why any entries from us are 
appearing on your credit file as we have not provided your information to them  but only 
that of our customer. 
Ms J says she didnt receive a response from TransUnion so chased again in December 
2020 before complaining to this service. It wasnt until March 2021 that TransUnion 
managed to separate the incorrect data from Ms Js credit file. This was a period of more 
than seven months since Ms J had first raised her concerns. 
Although the alias link may have been mistakenly added by in 2013, I agree with the 
investigator that TransUnion was responsible for then linking Ms Js profile with the third 
party. 
Im satisfied that TransUnion was given evidence of a data matching issue in August 2020. 
Ms Js date of birth was different to the one that C provided for its customer with the default. 
I consider TransUnion shouldve taken steps to put things right much more quickly than it 
did. And over time, the situation worsened for Ms J as more accounts were added to her 
profile. 
Ms J explains the impact that this mistake has had on her. Shed recently been made 
redundant and now suspects this might have had something to do with the negative 
information on her credit file. Due to the nature of her work, she was concerned about 
applying for a new job with the default still on her credit file. Ms J says she couldnt obtain 
reasonably priced credit for a period. And has generally been very anxious about the 
possibility of third parties gaining access to her data as a result of the merge.
I agree with the investigator that its not possible to link Ms Js redundancy with TransUnions 
error and I cant say that prospective employers would have declined job applications solely 
due to the default. This means I dont make any award for loss of earnings. However, I can 
appreciate Ms Js sense of anxiety with the situation. She gave TransUnion reasonable and 
clear evidence of a problem with her data, but it continued to decline her disputes. Ms J had 
to spend time disputing the entry with C, before coming to this service to try and resolve the 
problem  leading to more frustration. 
Overall, I find it reasonable to require TransUnion to pay more compensation than it 
previously offered. The investigator thought that £200 for Ms Js time spent sending emails, 
making calls and raising multiple disputes was fair  and I agree. 
In addition, I consider it reasonable to require TransUnion to pay Ms J £600 for the upset 
and stress the situation has caused her over an extended period is reasonable  particularly 
given Ms Js concerns around her employment situation. For the avoidance of doubt, this 
means TransUnion should pay Ms J a total of £800. It doesnt also need to pay Ms J the £50 
it had previously offered.
The investigator recommended that TransUnion should offer Ms J free fraud protection for 
the next two years. As TransUnion didnt respond to the investigators recommendation, I 
dont know exactly what it can offer to Ms J. 
Im aware that it is possible to sign up for protective registration with Cifas, the UKs fraud 
prevention community at a cost of £25 for two years. If Ms J decides to do this, I would 
expect TransUnion to bear the cost on her behalf. If TransUnion can offer any additional 
services to help protect Ms J from fraud, it should let her know.
Ms J is concerned about an entry on her TransUnion credit file relating to a financial 
connection with a business I will refer to as N. Our investigator asked TransUnion to raise a 
dispute, but I dont know if this has been done yet. I cant see that this formed part of Ms Js 
original complaint to this service, so I havent considered it as part of this complaint. Our 
rules state that TransUnion should have the opportunity to try and put things right before we 
get involved. If this issue remains outstanding, I leave it with Ms J to raise it with TransUnion before coming back to us if necessary. 
Finally, I hope that TransUnion has now sorted the data matching problem out and that apart 
from the outstanding concern identified above, everything else is correct. If it isnt, I 
recommend that Ms J let TransUnion know. 
Putting things right
To put things right, TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED should take the following 
steps:
Pay Ms J £800 compensation; 
Explain to Ms J what fraud prevention measures it can provide and offer those at no 
cost to her if she wants to take them up; and
If Ms J decides to apply for protective registration with Cifas, TransUnion should 
reimburse the cost of her first application.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I require 
TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED to take the steps outlined above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms J to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 October 2021.
