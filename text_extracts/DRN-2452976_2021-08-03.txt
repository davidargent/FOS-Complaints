Hamsard has only provided this service with limited information about the lending So while 
some loans appear to have been repaid early, I cant be sure what date each individual loan 
was closed. 
The weekly repayment column is also the payment per loan, so if for example Miss S had 
multiple loans running at the same time, then the combined weekly repayment would be the 
sum of each outstanding loans weekly payments. 
I also dont know whether Miss S has been successful in repaying all of her loans, or 
whether there is still an outstanding balance due on some of them. 
Miss S complained to Hamsard about her lending and received a final response letter. 
Unhappy with the response she referred the case to our service. 
An adjudicator reviewed the case and thought Hamsards checks went far enough for loans 
1 - 4, so she didnt think Hamsard was wrong to have provided them. She also thought 
Hamsard ought to have carried out further checks before approving loans 5 and 6. But as 
this service didnt have any information from Miss S she wasnt in a position to say that 
Hamsard had made an error about those loans. 
However, the adjudicator thought that Hamsard shouldnt have provided loan 7 (or any later 
loan) because at this point, in her view, the lending had become unsustainable. 
Miss S has accepted our adjudicators findings. 
Hamsard didnt agree, and in response it made a number of points. In summary it said;
neither the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or Yorkshire Trading Standards has 
raised any concerns about its lending policies 
all lending was compliant with the rules and regulations at the time 
Hamsard doesnt agree with the approach this service has taken to re-lending 
an affordability check was carried out before each loan was approved and these 
checks showed Miss S was able to afford the loans that she was taking 
Mrs S confirmed she could afford the lending 
a search with a credit reference agency was carried out before each loan
Miss S had a declined loan application in 2016  her reporting score was too low. 
Hamsard suggests this shows its affordability checks work
Miss S didnt raise any concerns with her agent about these loans being unaffordable 
or being in financial difficulties
no consideration has been taken about the need for these loans, for example some 
were used for Christmas or a summer holiday 
had Hamsard not provided these loans there was a risk that Miss S couldve ended 
up taking loans from unregulated lenders. 
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice 
at the time these loans were provided.
Hamsard needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss S 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.But certain factors might point to the fact that Hamsard should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Miss S. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become or was becoming 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Hamsard was required to establish 
whether Miss S could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre
unlikely to be able to do so without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all means for Miss Ss complaint. 
Loans 1-6
The adjudicator didnt uphold these loans, and Miss S has accepted the adjudicators 
outcome. Hamsard also appears to have accepted her findings into these loans. 
So, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about them. But, for the avoidance of 
doubt, given the evidence I have, I dont disagree with what the adjudicator said about this 
lending. And  as these loans form part of the borrowing relationship Miss S had with the 
lender, they are something I have taken into account when considering the later loans she 
borrowed.
Loans 7 - 22
Hamsards response concerns how this service approaches repeat lending and the rules and 
regulations that were in place at the time and how it has complied with them. We have 
responded to Hamsard on these issues in detail through other final decisions it has received, 
and the published decisions on our website. So, Im not going deal with these points at 
length here.
I will say briefly that I consider it reasonable to describe the loans Miss S took as high cost 
as does the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which includes home collected credit within 
its identified high cost credit portfolio. And while I note it has a longer term than, for example, a payday loan, that does not make it a low risk, or inexpensive, option for a 
consumer. And, as such, long-term use of these products can be harmful to a consumer. 
The FCA has not said anything to the contrary on this point. I have considered these issues 
alongside everything else in making my decision.
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 7-22 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. 
But I will say that Ive not found what Hamsard says about its checks to be persuasive in 
demonstrating the loans were either affordable or sustainable. It looks like, based on what 
has been provided, that Hamsard took the same sort of information for each loan, that being 
asking Miss S about her income and it seems to have checked this via way of bank 
statements and for her expenditure it looks like Hamsard just relied on what Miss H 
declared. 
Hamsard also says a credit search was carried out but its not provided this service with the 
results, so I cant put any weight on what those  credit checks may have shown it.
Im not clear how Hamsard is saying it carried out proportionate checks when, as Ive said 
above, it doesnt appear to have changed the type or level of checks despite Miss S 
returning for new loans fairly regularly. So the fact Miss S confirmed she could afford the 
loans doesnt set aside the requirement for Hamsard to carry out proportionate checks. 
Although Hamsard says that there is no record of Miss S raising her concerns with its agent 
about financial difficulties. It doesnt mean there werent any financial difficulties, and Im not 
sure what bearing that has on the case. What Im considering is whether Hamsard did 
something wrong when it lent these loans  in line with the rules and regulations at the time. 
As I have explained, I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for 
these loans because I didnt consider it necessary to do so. 
So, in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to
Miss S, Hamsard also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded 
during the course of its lending relationship with Miss S. 
I think Hamsard was wrong to have provided loans 7-22 because Miss S wasnt in a position 
to sustainably repay them for the following reasons:
By loan 7, Miss S had been indebted to Hamsard for nearly 8 months. During this 
time, she had taken six loans with terms of up to eight months, but most of the loans 
were due to be repaid within four or five months and there appears to have been no 
breaks in between the loans. So Hamsard ought to have realised it was more likely 
that Miss S was having longer term problems as the need for credit continued.
Miss S appear to be showing signs that she needed to borrow a new loan as soon as 
she was due to repay a previous one as some of the credit agreements show interest 
rebates towards earlier loan agreements.  When she applied for loan 7 £107.85 of 
the £250 capital appears to have gone to settling a previous loan and a similar 
pattern continued during the whole lending relationship. This continued need for 
credit ought to have alerted Hamsard to consider whether the loans were 
sustainable.
Miss S was regularly making repayments to a number of loans at the same time. This 
suggests that Miss S wasnt making any real improvements to the amount she owed Hamsard. She went on to exhibit the same pattern of borrowing for her subsequent 
loans  and at times had at least three loans running concurrently.
Loan 7 was Miss Ss largest capital loan and also the largest weekly payment for a 
loan to date. The repayments for this loan were around 2.5 times more than what 
Miss S initially paid for her first loan  its likely this amount was higher as it seems 
likely that some of the loans were running concurrently.  And the weekly repayments 
didnt sustainably decrease over the remaining borrowing period. Indeed loans 18 to 
19 were taken out on the same day with a combined weekly repayment of £27.20.  
So, Miss Ss overall indebtedness to Hamsard didnt significantly decrease over the 
time she borrowed. 
I think that Miss S lost out because Hamsard continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ss indebtedness by allowing
her to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the number of loans which Miss S borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Miss Ss ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these loans.
So, overall, having considered everything Im intending to uphold Miss Ss complaint as I 
think Hamsard were wrong to approve loans 7-22 for these reasons.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Hamsard should fairly pay in this case, Ive thought about what
might have happened had it not approved loan 7 onwards as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending, Miss S may have simply left matters there,
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed
between her and this particular lender which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt
a viable option, she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative 
assuming that was even possible.
Or, Miss S may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed, a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Miss S in a compliant way at this time.
 
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Miss S would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Hamsards liability in this case for what 
Im satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
I think Hamsard were wrong to approve loans 7-22.  So, Hamsard should do the following to 
put things right: 
Refund all interest, fees and charges Miss S paid towards loans 7- 22.Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss S from the
date Miss S originally made her payments, to the date the complaint is settled
The overall pattern of Miss Ss borrowing for loans 7 - 22 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Hamsard should remove these loans entirely 
from Miss Ss credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires you to deduct tax from this interest. Hamsard should give 
Miss S a certificate showing how much tax is deducted, if she asks for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Miss Ss complaint in part.
Hamsard 3225 Limited trading as CLC Finance should put things right for Miss S as directed 
above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 31 August 2021.
