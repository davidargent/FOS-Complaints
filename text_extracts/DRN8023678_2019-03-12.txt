K820x#14complaint
Miss M and Mr A, through a Claims Management Company (CMC), complain National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-sold an Advantage  Gold  account to them.  
background
Our adjudicators looked at Miss M and Mr As complaint and didnt think NatWest had     
mis-sold the packaged  account. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. Ive used this approach  to help 
me decide Miss M and Mr As complaint. Having done so, I dont think NatWest mis-sold the 
Advantage Gold account to Miss M and Mr A. Id like to explain the reasons for my decision. 
I think that Miss M and Mr A chose to take the Advantage Gold  account knowing they didnt 
need to have it. I dont think NatWest  recommended  the account to Miss M and Mr A. So 
they needed to decide whether  it was right for them. As far as I can see, Miss M and Mr A 
couldve used the benefits  including  the travel insurance which is likely to have covered 
any existing conditions Miss M and Mr A had - and it was up to them to do so. 
Im open  to the possibility Miss M and Mr A might  not have been  informed about everything 
they needed to know about  the account.  But Ive not seen anything  to suggest they wouldve 
been affected by the main limitations  or exclusions. So I dont think clearer  information 
wouldve made a difference  and I think Miss M and Mr A were  given enough  to understand 
what they were agreeing  to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Miss M and Mr As complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss M and Mr A 
to accept or reject my decision before 12 April 2019.
