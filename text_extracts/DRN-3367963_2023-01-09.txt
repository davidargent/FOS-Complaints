The complaint
Mr C complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) didnt take an existing direct 
debit payment on time.
What happened
Mr C switched his current account using a switch service. Following this, one existing direct 
Debit to PayPal wasnt paid on the correct date. This resulted in late payment marker on Mr 
Cs credit file and distress and inconvenience to him.
When PayPal initially contacted Mr C to say it hadnt been possible to update his account 
with the amended details, they also said that may be as they didnt have all the requested 
information. Mr C told us he gave them the information and attempted to manually update 
the details on his PayPal account. He complained to PayPal as hed been charged a late 
payment fee and interest because of the delay.
In response to his complaint, after several online chats and messages, PayPal agreed to 
credit back the amount of interest charged and paid the sum of £200 compensation as a 
credit to Mr Cs account. When Mr C brought the complaint to us PayPal told us it identified 
an error had been made and since rectified. It agreed there was poor customer service and 
a better level could have been provided. It also agreed to correct the late payment entry on 
Mr Cs credit file. They said the £200 which theyd paid earlier was Mr Cs estimation of his 
costs and request for compensation set out in his complaint form to this service.
Our investigator thought the offer PayPal had made was fair. He didnt think it was fair to 
suggest PayPals actions were responsible for the impact on Mr Cs subsequent applications 
for credit. This was because he couldnt say with utmost certainty that the erroneous entry 
on Mr Cs credit file had resulted in the reduction of a credit limit on another of Mr Cs 
accounts. Or that the disparity between Mr Cs two credit limit increases had occurred only 
as a result of the erroneous entry. So, our investigator didnt think PayPal needed to do 
anything more.
Mr C didnt agree. He didnt think it was the responsibility of the customer to ensure their 
Direct debit details were correct as PayPal had suggested when it had accepting 
shortcomings in its customer service. He though the £200 compensation was for the working 
hours hed lost in pursuing this and wasnt full compensation for the effect of the mistake and 
the consequential charges. Also, Mr C firmly asserted that it was only the addition of the 
missed payment marker on his credit file that led to the spiral of negative and adverse credit 
decisions hed experienced since then. The investigator reconsidered matters but his view 
remained unchanged.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive come to the same conclusions as the investigator for these reasons:
PayPal recognize and confirmed to us a mistake had been made and corrected it. 
They detailed that the PayPal Credit Direct Debit is a two part system and not made 
directly from Mr Cs bank. They said rather its from his bank to PayPal and then to 
his PayPal credit. They recognized there may have been some confusion around this 
issue which is why theyd taken steps to rectify it;
PayPal have refunded the interest and late charges fee and removed the marker 
from Mr Cs credit file, so it shows no payment was missed;
I think the above measures and the £200 compensation, which Mr C requested in the 
claim form, is reasonable reflection of the inconvenience here and the sort of award 
Id have suggested had it not already been offered;
Theres nothing on the evidence to satisfy me the - now removed - entry on Mr Cs 
credit file is the sole reason for the adverse decisions hes told us about. So, it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to hold PayPal responsible for the impact of 
those decisions on Mr C.
I understand this must have been frustrating time for Mr C. But given my findings I dont think 
its reasonable to ask PayPal to do anything further. I appreciate he feels strongly about 
whats happened. But my decision brings to an end what we - in trying to resolve his dispute 
with PayPal informally - can do for him.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint as PayPal have responded 
reasonably.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 February 2023.
