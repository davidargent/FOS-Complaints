The complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc lent to him irresponsibly. 
What happened
Mr P applied for  and received  the following loans from NatWest:
Date Amount Term Repayment
Loan 1 19 July 2021 £2,250 60 months £67.79
Loan 2 10 February 2022 £5,050 60 months £143.03
Mr P says the loans should never have been agreed as they were unaffordable for him. He 
has mental health issues and was suffering with a psychotic episode at the time of Loan 1. 
His mental state around the time of each loan left him susceptible to coercion over the 
phone. Mr P complained to NatWest saying that it had lent to him irresponsibly. 
NatWest looked into his complaint and issued a final response. It said it had followed its 
usual processes when assessing Mr Ps applications and it was unaware of his health issues 
until August 2022  after the loans had been drawn. It rejected Mr Ps complaint.   
Mr P was unhappy with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to us. One of our 
investigators looked into it. He said NatWest had carried out reasonable checks for Loan 1, 
but ought to have asked further questions for Loan 2. But our investigator felt that even if it 
had asked further questions for Loan 2, it would most likely still have agreed to lend to Mr P. 
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint.
NatWest accepted what our investigator said, but Mr P didnt. He said, in summary, he only 
had a reasonable credit record because his family supported him and lent him money. He 
also highlighted a letter from his doctor which said he needs help with financial matters. As 
there was no agreement, Mr Ps complaint has been passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to complaints about irresponsible and unaffordable lending on 
our website  including the key relevant rules, guidance, good industry practice and law. Ive 
considered this approach when deciding this complaint.
NatWest needed to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to ensure that it didnt 
lend to Mr P irresponsibly. I think there are key questions I need to consider in order to 
decide what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint:
Did NatWest carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr P 
was in a position to sustainably repay the loans?
oIf not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown at the 
time?
Did NatWest make fair lending decisions?
Did NatWest act unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr P in some other way?
NatWest had to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr P 
would be able to repay the loans sustainably. Its not about NatWest assessing the likelihood 
of it being repaid, but it had to consider the impact of the repayments on him. 
There is no set list of checks that it had to do, but it could take into account several different 
things such as the amount and length of the loans, the amount of the monthly repayments 
and the overall circumstances of the borrower.
For each loan, NatWest passed Mr Ps application through its usual assessment process. 
This entailed assessing his income and expenditure and passing his details through a credit 
scoring process including a search of credit reference agency data. As the applications met 
the banks lending criteria, the loans were approved.   
For each application, the details Mr P provided showed he had disposable income sufficient 
to enable him to comfortably meet the repayments to the loans he applied for. His credit file 
showed no other creditors, so there would have been nothing of concern to NatWest in that 
regard. Mr P says his credit file was good only because his family helped him out financially. 
Theres no way NatWest could have been expected to know that at the time of the 
applications. His income and expenditure appeared sufficient to be able to repay the loans 
sustainably, so it had no reason to suspect Mr P was receiving support from elsewhere.
For Loan 1, given the amount of credit and the information NatWest had about his financial 
situation, I think the checks were reasonable and proportionate. I dont think anything 
NatWest knew or ought to have known about him would have led to a different lending 
decision. 
However, Mr P applied for Loan 2 just seven months after Loan 1, and for more than twice 
the amount of money. In my view, this ought to have led NatWest to take a closer look at 
Mr Ps finances. It might have done this by taking a closer look at his bank account for 
example, to get a more detailed view of his income and expenditure. Mr P held his current 
account with NatWest so that would have been reasonably straightforward. 
If NatWest had taken a closer look at Mr Ps circumstances, Im not persuaded it would have 
reached a different decision. I say this because his account activity confirms the figures for 
income and expenditure that Mr P gave the bank during the application. His account is 
generally well run, and while I note he used his overdraft regularly, a lot of his expenditure 
was non-essential items and cash withdrawals. Theres nothing which I feel ought to have 
led NatWest to think the loan repayments would have been unsustainable for Mr P. On 
balance therefore, I think NatWest reached fair decisions to lend to him. 
Mr P said his health issues left him susceptible to coercion and he was suffering with a 
psychotic episode at the time of Loan 1. He provided a letter from his doctor written after the 
loans were drawn which says he needs help with financial decisions. But Ive seen nothing to 
suggest that NatWest was aware of his health issues at the time of either application. 
I can see that a note regarding his health was placed on his customer record in August 2022 
 after the loans had been drawn. But I cant reasonably conclude NatWest acted unfairly by 
lending to Mr P given his health conditions, if it didnt know at the time of the applications. 
Ive seen nothing which suggests it did. 
Having carefully reviewed the information and evidence provided by both parties to this complaint, I dont think NatWest acted unfairly towards Mr P in any other way. Hes told 
NatWest that he is now struggling to repay Loan 2 and Ive seen that it has taken steps to 
suspend interest while the complaint is with us. 
Ive seen that NatWest asked Mr P to provide details of his current income and expenditure 
with a view to reaching an agreement with him on a way forward. Id encourage Mr P to 
continue to work with NatWest and Id remind the bank of its obligation to treat customers in 
financial difficulty fairly.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 October 2023.
