The complaint
Miss B complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) closed down a dispute she 
had raised against a seller, leaving the issue unresolved.
What happened
In October 2020, Miss B bought an item using PayPal. When the item arrived, Miss B was 
disappointed as it was not as described. She says that the seller apologised and agreed to 
resolve the issue but never did. So, in early January 2021, Miss B raised a dispute through 
PayPal.
At that stage, PayPal sent a message to the seller. PayPal confirmed this in a message to 
Miss B, which went on to say If you cant resolve this issue, you can escalate it to a claim 
before 23 January 2021. When you escalate a case to a claim, PayPal will decide the 
outcome, usually within 30 days. If you take no action, the case will automatically close. After 
a case closes, it cannot be reopened or escalated to a PayPal claim.
PayPal sent a second message to Miss B on 7 January 2021 informing her that she had 
received a message from the seller. PayPal confirmed that Miss B or the seller could 
escalate the dispute to a claim before 23 January 2021, otherwise the case would be closed 
automatically on that date. Miss B says that, after receiving this, she responded to the 
sellers message. But she says she became ill while she was waiting for the sellers 
response.
PayPal sent further messages to Miss B on 19 and 21 January 2021 informing her that the 
seller had not yet responded and telling her to consider escalating the issue to a claim so 
that the case remained eligible for a PayPal review. These messages confirmed that the 
case would close automatically unless Miss B escalated it before 23 January 2021.
Miss B says she didnt see these messages because she was very unwell and not able to 
deal with things. As she didnt escalate the dispute to a claim, PayPal closed the case on 23 
January 2021. Miss B is unhappy about this and says that the wider circumstances of the 
COVID-19 pandemic at the time meant the situation was extraordinary and she thinks that 
PayPal should have shown more compassion. She also says that PayPal promised to 
provide a letter which she could give to her credit card company in support of a claim, but 
she hasnt received this.
PayPal says it acted in accordance with its Buyer Complaint Policy and User Agreement. It 
says that, during the claim period, Miss B was routinely logging into her PayPal account and 
processing payments, including during the time she was ill. It says that she was continuing to 
sell items during this time and receive payment for them into her PayPal account. And it says 
it has no record of agreeing to provide a letter for Miss Bs credit card provider.
Our investigator didnt think PayPal had acted unfairly here and didnt ask it to do anything. 
But Miss B didnt agree and asked for her complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
By opening and using her PayPal account, Miss B agreed to comply with all the terms and 
conditions of PayPals User Agreement. The User Agreement says that, in order to be 
eligible for Buyer Protection, Miss B must (amongst other things) follow PayPals online 
dispute resolution process. Its a requirement of the online dispute resolution process that 
Miss B will escalate the dispute to a claim within 20 days after opening the dispute, or 
PayPal will automatically close it.
Miss B didnt escalate the dispute within the deadline. So, PayPal was entitled to close it and 
I find that it acted in line with the terms and conditions of Miss Bs account when it did so. 
But Miss B has explained that she was unwell at the time and that this prevented her from 
escalating the dispute. So, Ive considered the wider circumstances here to decide whether it 
was fair and reasonable for PayPal to close the dispute, notwithstanding that the terms and 
conditions allowed it to do so. 
I understand that Miss B was very unwell in January 2021 and Im sorry to hear about that. 
But PayPal has provided evidence of transactions made on her account while the dispute 
was still active, at the time when Miss B says she was too ill to escalate it. Im satisfied that 
there were transactions on Miss Bs account during this period. 
But Miss B says that it was her partner who was using the account. She says the 
transactions were the result of payments made and received by her partner through third 
party websites, not by logging into her PayPal account. She says she shouldnt be penalised 
for the fact that her partner used her account and was supporting her while she was ill. I 
understand her point of view and Ive considered everything Miss B has said about this. But I 
dont think PayPal acted unfairly here by closing the dispute. 
Im satisfied that PayPal had told Miss B that the case would close automatically on 23 
January 2021 if it wasnt escalated before that. Even if Miss B didnt see the messages of 19 
and 21 January 2021, she had seen the earlier ones which confirmed this information. Miss 
B has explained that her partner was supporting her and using her accounts while she was 
ill. So I think she was in a position to escalate the case within the deadline - with help from 
her partner, even if she wasnt able to do it herself. In the circumstances here, I dont think 
its unreasonable that the case was closed.
The seller here had acknowledged that the item Miss B bought wasnt as described. So Miss 
B says PayPal has an obligation to ensure that she receives the partial refund which the 
seller had promised. I can understand Miss Bs strength of feeling about this issue. But I 
dont find that PayPal does have any such obligation. PayPal has a Buyer Protection policy 
which can help buyers in Miss Bs situation - within certain parameters. Miss B didnt take 
the steps required of her under the dispute resolution process and so I dont find that PayPal 
is obliged to do anything further here. I understand that Miss B remains unhappy with the 
item she purchased. But a claim through PayPal isnt the only way she could resolve her 
issue with the seller. It may be open to her to pursue a refund through other avenues and 
with third parties. 
In relation to the letter which Miss B says she was promised, PayPal doesnt have any 
record of offering this. It has confirmed that it offered to contact the seller again on Miss Bs 
behalf and Ive seen evidence that it did so on 3 February 2021. My understanding is that 
Miss B didnt realise PayPal had done this. But shes adamant that PayPal agreed to provide 
a letter for her credit card company, to support a claim for a refund. She says this was 
discussed during a phone call in February. Theres no recording of that phone call but there are notes of the call. The notes refer to the 
follow-up email to the seller, which was actioned. I find it surprising that something as 
specific as the letter to the credit card company wasnt recorded in these notes. I cant 
account for the difference in the parties evidence on this point, other than to speculate that 
this was perhaps a case of crossed-wires in the conversation between Miss B and PayPal as 
to what Miss B required.
Miss B has explained that her credit card company cant raise a claim for a refund because 
the faulty item is still in her possession. She says she needs a letter from PayPal confirming 
that the seller admitted the item was not as described but that she couldnt return it because 
the seller ignored her messages. Our investigator has explained this to PayPal and invited it 
to provide such a letter. PayPal hasnt done so to date. I dont think its something PayPal is 
necessarily in a position to provide and its not something its obliged to do. I realise Miss B 
feels strongly about this and Im sorry to disappoint her. But Im not going to ask PayPal to 
do anything more here.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 July 2021.
