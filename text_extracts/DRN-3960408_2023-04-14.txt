The complaint
T, a social club, complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) wont refund it for 
money NatWest says was missing from a pay in.
What happened
T used the business quick deposit at NatWest. To do this, T puts cash and cheques in a 
bag, seals it, and drops it off at the branch. The bag is then sent to a secure cash checking 
site to be counted  but Ts account is credited the day it drops the bag off.
When Ts bag was counted it was £350 short, so NatWest told T this and took £350 from its 
account. NatWest said T had 35 £20 notes missing.
T contacted NatWest and pointed out it couldnt have been £20 notes missing, and it didnt 
believe any money was missing. NatWest responded to say it had checked CCTV at the 
time of the counting, balanced tills and couldnt find a bank error.
But NatWest acknowledged it had made a mistake when saying £20 notes were missing, it 
was £10 notes missing, and this was human error. NatWest offered T £200 to compensate 
for this error.
T didnt accept this. T had put £10 notes into £1,000 bundles, and wanted to know which of 
these had been short. NatWest said it opened all the bundles at once and counted the cash 
in bulk. Unhappy with this answer, T brought their complaint to this service.
An investigator looked into things and didnt think Ts complaint should be upheld. The 
investigator thought NatWest had shown evidence of the checks it carried out and was 
satisfied there was money missing from Ts pay in.
The investigator thought the £200 offer was fair in the circumstances, NatWest had made an 
error in the breakdown of notes, and this had compounded the fact money missing.
Whilst T understood the investigators assessment, it was adamant there was no money 
missing. T said the money was double counted prior to going in the bag, and it had just 
reconciled its accounts for the year.
This meant there couldnt be money T hadnt paid in, it had checked the safe. And if one 
bundle was £350 short it would have been very noticeable, this was a third of the notes in 
one bundle. T asked for an ombudsman to decide things.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where evidence is in dispute, or incomplete, I can decide things on the balance of 
probabilities, whats more likely to have happened.
Specifically for Ts complaint, I need to decide whether the evidence NatWest has suggests 
there was money missing from Ts pay in. I know T will understand I wasnt there when the 
cash was counted, either by T or NatWest.
NatWest says the person counting the cash completely emptied the bag, and this is following 
a review of the CCTV. The cash was counted as a whole, not individual bundles, and once it 
had gone through the counting machine it was found to be £350 short.
The cash was put through the counting machine a second time, to check, and the machine 
itself was checked. The waste bin of the person counting was checked along with all the 
cash theyd counted that day.
Ive seen the reports showing the days cash balanced. Ive also seen a report showing what 
the previous pay ins were. One of these pay ins had a very small amount over what another 
customer had said was in the bag.
Im satisfied this extra money wasnt related to Ts pay in. But, I think it shows the person 
counting the money was accurate, theyd found more money in a previous bag and properly 
declared this amount as something NatWest needed to pay to that other customer.
Ive considered what Ts said about the steps it takes to check, and double check, the 
amount its paying in. 
And whilst I can understand Ts strength of feeling about the money being missing, Im more 
persuaded by what NatWest has shown me about the checks it carried out to properly verify 
the money was missing.
Its unfortunate NatWest cant provide more information around whether the was one bundle 
missing all the money, or several short. NatWests explained it counts the money in bulk, 
and this seems a reasonable explanation.
And while I understand why T wants this information, I dont think the lack of information 
takes anything away from the checks NatWest carried out.
When NatWest first contacted T about the missing money it said it was £20 notes missing. 
This was wrong, you cant be £350 short in £20 notes.
NatWests explained theres a drop-down function when selecting the missing notes, and 
someone simply picked the wrong denomination. But this lack of care would, I think, have 
meant T lacked trust in NatWest and the checks it carried out.
Its natural to think one error perhaps means more errors have been made. And the error 
caused unnecessary confusion for T. NatWests apologised for this error and offered T £200 
to compensate for this.
In the circumstances I think this is a fair offer for NatWest to make.
But, looking at the checks and verification NatWest carried out at the time it realised there 
was money missing, I dont think it would be fair for NatWest to refund T £350. 
And, while I cant say how or where this money went missing, Im satisfied, on balance, that 
Ts pay in was £350 short when counted by NatWest.My final decision
My final decision is I uphold Ts complaint and NatWest should pay T £200 to compensate 
for the poor service it provided.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask T to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 May 2023.
