The complaint
Miss J complains about the low property valuation and poor service when she applied to 
National Westminster Bank Plc for a mortgage. She wants it to recognise the real value of 
her property, apply a fixed interest rate product with lower interest rate and refund interest. 
  
What happened
In late 2019 Miss J applied to re-mortgage with NatWest. She applied for a product that 
required a maximum loan to value of 75%. She says NatWest used a desktop valuation 
instead of sending a qualified surveyor, and the valuation was so low as to be negligent. This 
meant she had to take out a more expensive mortgage product, in a different loan-to-value 
bracket. NatWest didnt allow her to appeal the valuation.
Miss J also says NatWest recorded her email address incorrectly. She didnt receive the 
mortgage offer and this delayed her re-mortgage for seven days. She paid interest at her 
previous lenders SVR during the delay.
NatWest offered to compensate Miss J for the additional interest during the delay and pay 
£100 for her upset and inconvenience. 
Our investigator said NatWest was entitled to rely on the valuation which was carried out by 
a qualified surveyor. She said while Miss J didnt meet criteria for an appeal, NatWest could 
have been clearer about this before Miss J collected information for the appeal. The 
investigator said NatWest had been given an incorrect email address by the broker advising 
Miss J. While NatWest should have corrected this sooner, its offer of compensation was fair. 
Miss J didnt agree. She said NatWest didnt use a surveyor and only used a figure produced 
by a computer. She said it hadnt even looked at her appeal, which she spent time putting 
together, and refused to do an actual valuation. Miss J said it wasnt clear the surveyor knew 
shed extended her lease and purchased a share of the freehold. Miss J said if the only basis 
for an appeal was that thered been recent changes to a property this should have been 
clear on the appeal form. Miss J said NatWest hadnt treated her fairly or looked into her 
individual circumstances.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss Js complaint has three parts. That the valuation of her property was too low. That 
NatWest didnt allow a fair appeals process. And NatWest input her email address 
incorrectly. She says this resulted in completion being delayed and her having a product with 
a higher interest rate.

Valuation: Its usual for lenders to ask for a property valuation when making a lending 
decision, to assess whether the property is good security for the loan. As NatWest doesnt 
have the expertise itself to value property, it appointed a valuer. Here, it appointed a 
qualified surveyor (a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) to value 
Miss Js property. 
The surveyor did a desk top appraisal. He said the estimate (provided by Miss J) was 
excessive and not supported by relevant recent comparable evidence. He gave the property 
a lower valuation than Miss J had hoped. I know Miss J doesnt agree, but I dont think 
NatWest made an error when appointing the valuer or asking for a desk top appraisal. I think 
NatWest is entitled to rely on the surveyors professional opinion and the valuation provided 
to it. 
Appeal process: NatWest does have an appeals process, however there are limited grounds 
for an appeal. 
NatWests notes say Miss Js broker called and asked how to dispute the valuation. 
According to NatWests notes it told the broker it could only dispute the valuation if there 
were significant internal or external improvements which adds to the square footage of 
property. A few days later the broker called again and said it wanted to submit comparables 
(evidence about the values of similar properties). NatWests notes say it told the broker it 
couldnt appeal and, as the valuer takes comparables into account before the valuation, 
providing comparables is unlikely to change the valuation. The broker still wanted to 
challenge the valuation and NatWest provided the challenge form.
Miss J took time putting together information to challenge the valuation. I appreciate she 
feels this time was wasted. Perhaps this could have been avoided if the appeals form set out 
the basis on which the valuation could be challenged. But I think this was explained to 
Miss Js broker. I dont think NatWest misled Miss J and her broker about the basis on which 
the valuation could be challenged, or the likelihood of this being successful.
Id expect NatWest to review the valuation with the valuer if there was an obvious error. 
NatWest says after reviewing the information Miss J provided it remained happy with the 
valuation. I know Miss J disputes the valuation, and she will be disappointed, but I dont think 
NatWest acted unfairly when she challenged the valuation.
Incorrect email address: NatWest wasnt responsible for the initial error in recording an 
incorrect email address for Miss J. But it should have corrected her email address when she 
told them it was wrong. Miss J says this meant she paid interest at her previous lenders 
standard variable rate (SVR) for seven days.
NatWest offered £100 and to compensate Miss J for her additional costs of being on her 
previous lenders SVR as compared to her product rate with NatWest for seven days. It said 
Miss J will need to provide evidence of the payments she was making to her previous lender. 
I think this is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Given that NatWest offered to do this 
in response to Miss Js complaint, I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to 
add interest at 8%. 
I dont know if Miss J cashed the £100 cheque sent to her by NatWest. If not, and she 
accepts my decision, NatWest will need to send a further cheque. 
My final decisionMy decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay to Miss J:
£100 (if she didnt cash the cheque it sent previously); and 
an amount equal to her additional costs of being on her previous lenders SVR as 
compared to her product rate with National Westminster Bank Plc for seven days (if it 
receives suitable evidence from Miss J of her payments to her previous lender).
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 June 2021.
