The complaint
Ms B complains that Clydesdale Bank plc, trading as Virgin Money, wont refund to her the 
money that she paid for a hotel break. 
What happened
Ms B used her Virgin Money credit card in August 2021 to pay £1,178 to a holiday company 
for a hotel break. She complained to the holiday company about a number of issues with the 
hotel break, including that shed been promised a harbour view but the room didnt have one, 
the food was poor, there were issues with the drinks service and that, when she checked the 
price of the same holiday at the same time for the following year, it was considerably lower. 
The hotel company refunded £100 to Ms B and she then made a claim to Virgin Money.
It said in December 2021 that it had requested a refund from the holiday company but then 
declined Ms Bs claim. Ms B complained to Virgin Money and it said that the issues that 
shed raised didnt constitute a breach of contract or misrepresentation, the service was 
utilised, and Ms B hadnt provided proof that the room didnt match what was advertised or 
that the food wasnt up to standard. It accepted that it hadnt detailed the full reasons that her 
claim couldnt be reviewed in its earlier correspondence and it apologised for that and 
offered her £50 compensation. Ms B wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this 
service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He believed that 
Virgin Money had handled Ms Bs claim correctly and felt that it had reasonably rejected her 
claim under section 75 because a breach of contract or misrepresentation couldnt be 
evidenced.
Ms B has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says, in 
summary and amongst other things, that:
shes found the whole process very confusing and Virgin Money didnt make it clear 
when it said that it had requested a refund but then then rejected her claim;
she hasnt received any compensation from Virgin Money;
they werent served drinks at their table and other customers have complained about 
the slow service; and
the holiday company has changed its advertising and shes provided a plan of the 
site showing that the chalets were across from each other and had no sea view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Ms Bs complaint about Virgin Money, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company and 
that Virgin Moneys response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable 
 but Im not determining the outcome of Ms Bs claim under section 75 as only a 
court would be able to do that;
Ms B complained to the holiday company about a number of issues with the hotel 
break and it refunded £100 to her but she then made a claim to Virgin Money;
it said in December 2021 that it had requested a refund from the holiday company 
but then declined Ms Bs claim in January 2022  after Ms B had complained to it, it 
accepted that it hadnt detailed the full reasons that her claim couldnt be reviewed in 
its January 2022 letter and it apologised for that and offered her £50 compensation;
Ms B says that shes not received that payment but Ive seen no evidence to show 
that she accepted Virgin Moneys offer of compensation  if she now wishes to 
accept it I suggest that she contacts Virgin Money about its offer;
Ms B clearly wasnt happy with a number of issues about the hotel break and I 
sympathise with her for that and appreciate how frustrating and disappointing it must 
have been for her that the holiday wasnt as good as she was expecting  but the 
quality of a holiday can be a very subjective assessment and what may not be 
acceptable to one customer may be acceptable to another  and Virgin Money can 
only be liable under section 75 if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the holiday company;
Ms B clearly feels that the hotel was advertised with harbour views, that the holiday 
company has changed its advertising and she says that shes provided Virgin Money 
with a plan of the site showing that the chalets were across from each other and had 
no sea view - but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
holiday company represented that the hotel or the chalets had a harbour or sea view;
Im not persuaded that Ms B has provided enough evidence to show that the issues 
that shes described with the food constituted a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the holiday company;
Ms B says that they werent served drinks at their table and other customers have 
complained about the slow service but Im not persuaded that shes provided enough 
evidence to show that those issues constituted a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the holiday company;
Ms B says that, when she checked the price of the same holiday at the same time for 
the following year, it was considerably lower  but shed agreed to pay £1,178 for the 
hotel break and if that wasnt acceptable to her I consider that it would be reasonable 
to expect her not to have booked that break  Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the holiday company has acted incorrectly in connection with 
the price that it charged Ms B; 
Ms B received the holiday that shed paid for and used the hotels facilities and her 
room and consumed the food that was provided to her and I dont consider that the 
issues with the hotel break that shes described are enough to constitute a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company for which Virgin Money would 
be liable under section 75; and
I consider that Virgin Moneys decision to decline Ms Bs section 75 claim was fair 
and reasonable in these circumstances  and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require it to refund to Ms B any of the money that she paid for 
the hotel break, to offer her any further compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 December 2022.
