K821x#15Complaint 
Mr L complains  that NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibly each time it increased  his credit limit on 
his Aqua credit card. 
Background
The background to this complaint, and my initial conclusions, were set out in my provisional 
decision dated 12 December 2019 - a copy of which is attached  and forms part of this final 
decision. In my provisional  decision I explained  why I thought this complaint should be 
upheld and what should happen to resolve the complaint. I invited both parties  to send  any 
additional comments or evidence they wished to make.
Mr L said he accepted  my provisional  decision  but referred to a default that had been 
recorded on his credit file in September 2019. And he provided a copy of his full credit  report 
to show this. He thought  this should be dealt with as a separate  complaint. NewDay didnt 
comment on my provisional decision about  the credit limit increases. But when asked about 
the default showing on Mr Ls credit file, it says the default was recorded by the external 
third-party debt collection  agency to whom  it sold Mr Ls debt in 2017.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr L has accepted  my provisional decision and NewDay  hasnt commented on the part of 
my provisional decision relating to the credit  limit increases. So I see no reason to depart 
from my findings as set out in my provisional decision in this respect.  It remains  that I think  
NewDay should refund  the interest  and any charges  incurred on the balance above  £1,250  
after the credit limit was increased in September 2016.
Turning now to Mr Ls credit report. Ive looked  at Mr Ls credit report  which  he has sent us. 
And this doesnt  show any adverse information  recorded by NewDay. But as mentioned  in 
my provisional decision, I think its most likely that NewDay would have recorded some  
adverse information  around 2017 as NewDay  has told us that it defaulted Mr Ls account. 
But as Mr Ls account was sold to a third-party  collection agency in 2017, I think  its most 
likely any adverse data recorded by NewDay has been superseded by data recorded by the 
third-part debt collection  agency. This is because I wouldnt expect  two business to be 
reporting a default about the same  account  at the same time.  
Credit reports  are constantly updated as things change. This means I cant  be sure what 
might previously have been  recorded  on Mr Ls credit file by NewDay.  But, as set out in my 
provisional decision, NewDay has told us that it was approached by a debt advice service  in 
2017 to tell it Mr L was in financial difficulty.  And, as a result it agreed to accept reduced 
payments from Mr L. As NewDay has a responsibility to treat consumers in financial difficulty 
positively and sympathetically, this is the type of remedy I wouldve expected  NewDay to 
agree to in Mr Ls circumstances.  So, I think  it acted fairly in this regard.   
Ref: DRN50876952But it has also told us that Mr L eventually stopped making payments altogether and, as a 
result, it defaulted Mr Ls account in 2017. And the debt was subsequently sold.  Mr L hasnt  
disputed what NewDay has said following my provisional decision. So, I dont think NewDay  
did anything wrong  when it defaulted  the account  and subsequently sold it to a third-party.  
As I have explained previously, the account terms and conditions make  provision  for this. 
And I havent seen  anything that would make  me think NewDay  didnt keep Mr L updated 
about the action it intended to take. Indeed,  NewDay has since  provided a copy  of the 
default notice  issued in 2017.  So, if NewDay  reported this to the credit  reference agencies, I 
think it was right to do so. 
But as mentioned above, I cant see any adverse data on Mr Ls credit file now that might 
have been recorded by NewDay.  So, I dont  think  NewDay will be able to remove any data 
that is no longer  showing. So, Im not asking NewDay to take any action in this respect. 
Should NewDay record any information about  this account going forward,  Mr L will be able to 
ask us to look at this as a separate complaint.  
I can see Mr L feels strongly that the information recorded on his credit file now is 
inaccurate. As this is recorded  by the third-party debt collection agency, I agree that this 
should be treated  as a separate complaint. And Ive asked for one of our investigators to 
arrange for this to be looked at under a different case reference  number. 
For clarity,  this decision solely relates to Mr Ls account before  NewDay  sold it to the third-
party in 2017.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above, and in my provisional decision, I uphold Mr Ls 
complaint. 
I require NewDay Ltd to refund the interest and any charges incurred  on the balance above 
£1,250 after the credit limit was increased  in September 2016,  until the debt was sold to the 
debt collection firm. This is to be sent to the debt collection agency  to reduce the balance 
owing.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 February  2020.

Complaint
Mr L complains  that NewDay  Ltd lent irresponsibly  each time it increased  his credit limit on his Aqua 
credit card. 
Background
Mr L applied for an Aqua  credit card with NewDay Ltd and was approved for a £600 credit limit in 
October 2015. 
In April and September 2016 NewDay increased  Mr Ls limit to £1,250 then £2,450 respectively. 
NewDay says Mr Ls account was reviewed  on both occasions before it applied  the increases.  And it 
wrote to him offering him the chance to reject them before  they were applied. But its records indicate 
Mr L accepted the increase on both occasions.
In 2019 Mr L complained that NewDay  had not acted in his best interests when it increased his credit 
limit. He said it should have been clear that he couldnt  afford the additional borrowing because he 
was relying heavily on credit, had been late with payments and had exceeded  his credit limit. 
NewDay didnt uphold Mr Ls complaint. It said the limit increases had been approved  in line with its 
lending criteria. 
Mr L referred his complaint  to our service  and an investigator looked at what  had happened. He didnt 
think NewDay  had acted wrongly when it initially increased Mr Ls credit limit. He noted that apart from 
one late payment and over-limit  charge,  Mr L made his payments on time.  And he thought the checks 
NewDay had said it had carried out were proportionate based on the amount of the new limit and 
what it knew  about Mr L.
But he upheld Mr Ls complaint about the second limit increase. He noted  that Mr L had by now 
missed more payments and had exceeded  the new higher credit limit. So he thought NewDay 
shouldnt have increased Mr Ls limit on this occasion. 
He suggested that NewDay  should refund the interest and charges applied to Mr Ls account from 
when the second  increase was applied.  But he said NewDay didnt  have to amend     Mr Ls credit file 
as this was an accurate reflection of Mr Ls payment history.
NewDay didnt accept this reiterating that the limit increase had met its lending criteria.  It pointed out 
that Mr Ls late payments  were adjusted  by Mr L the day after they were due and that he cleared his 
over-limit position  very quickly and before a statement was generated. But the investigator remained 
of the view that the fact Mr L was exceeding his limit and paying  late  even though he was putting  
things right quickly, should have been enough to indicate to NewDay  that a further limit increase was 
not appropriate.  He said this was in line with industry guidance. 
As NewDay didnt agree the complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
My provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to provisionally decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Like the investigator, I havent found that NewDay lent irresponsibly when it approved Mr Ls first limit 
increase. While Mr L did miss one payment and exceeded  his limit  overall, his account was being 
managed reasonably well. In addition, there doesnt appear to have been any adverse  information  on 
Mr Ls credit file. So I havent seen enough that would  make me think  NewDay should have been 
Ref: DRN50876954unduly concerned about Mr Ls financial situation to say the limit increase was inappropriate at this 
point.
But by September 2016  when the second limit increase was offered, Mr Ls account had incurred  
further over-limit and late payment charges. And this increase  meant Mr Ls credit limit had 
quadrupled from £600 to £2,450 in just 12 months. As the investigator has said industry guidance 
says that these types of event are indicators that lenders need to think  about before agreeing  further 
lending. And Ive seen that  from Mr Ls credit file that he was also applying to other lenders for 
short-term credit between leading  up to this limit increase.  
NewDay is free to decide how to set its lending criteria but it should complete proportionate checks  to 
ensure borrowing is sustainable. In this case, I dont think the checks  NewDay completed went  far 
enough. I understand  that NewDay  may not have had full details of      Mr Ls other credit at this time 
because of the nature of the credit checks it choose to complete. But I think  it couldve completed 
other more proportionate checks, like asking to see his full credit file or completing a new income and 
expenditure assessment  for example. 
Taking everything Ive seen into account, I dont think the decision to approve the increase to £2,450 
in September 2016 was reasonable. If NewDay had completed  better  checks  I dont think it would 
have approved this limit increase.
From what Ive seen, I think  NewDay  failed  to complete proportionate checks  to ensure the second 
limit increase was sustainable. I think its likely  that if NewDay had done better  checks  it wouldnt have 
offered Mr L this increase.  As a result,  I agree this complaint should be upheld and NewDay should 
refund the interest  and charges applied  to Mr Ls account from when the second credit limit increase 
was applied.
Our investigator didnt recommend that NewDay should remove any adverse data from       Mr Ls 
credit file. But generally, when  we think a business acted incorrectly in agreeing  new lending, we 
would expect the business  to remove any adverse  data recorded from the date the new lending was 
provided. This is because the adverse data wouldnt have  been recorded  but for the lending being  
provided.
But NewDay  has told us about other events which have  happened since the second  limit increase 
was approved. NewDay  has told us that it was approached by a debt advice service in 2017 to tell it 
Mr L was in financial  difficulty. And, as a result it agreed to accept  reduced payments from Mr L. As 
NewDay has a responsibility to treat consumers  in financial difficulty  positively and sympathetically, 
this is the type of remedy I wouldve expected NewDay to agree  to in Mr Ls circumstances. 
But it has also told us that Mr L eventually  stopped  making any payments  altogether and as a result it 
defaulted Mr Ls account and the debt was subsequently sold to a third party.  As it seems that Mr L 
had stopped  making payments to the account, I dont think  NewDay did anything wrong  when it 
applied the default and subsequently  sold the debt to a third party.   The account terms and conditions 
make provision for this. And I havent seen anything that would make me think  NewDay didnt keep 
Mr L updated about the action it intended to take. But if Mr L has any further comments or evidence in 
relation to this, I will consider  this further.   
But based on what Ive seen, Ive thought carefully about the information  recorded on Mr Ls credit 
file. And having done so, I think NewDay  Ltd should  remove  any adverse data it recorded following  
the credit limit increase in September 2016  up to the point a reduced payment plan was agreed in 
2017. But as NewDay was approached by a debt advice  organisation on Mr Ls behalf,  I think  its 
most likely that Mr L had wider financial problems  than just his Aqua credit card. And this is supported 
by the information about other borrowing on the credit file Mr L has provided us with. NewDay says it 
accepted reduced payments towards repayment of the credit card  but Mr L stopped making  these 
payments. So I think its most likely that Mr L wouldve  defaulted on his Aqua credit card even if the 
second credit  limit increase  hadnt been  given.  So I think a default wouldve  always been applied  and 
the debt sold to a third party.   
Ref: DRN50876955My provisional decision 
My provisional  decision  is that I intend to uphold this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to settle in line 
with following:
Refund the interest and any charges incurred on the balance above £1,250 after the
credit limit was increased on in September 2016, until the debt was sold to the debt collection 
firm. This is to be sent to the debt collection  agencyto reduce the debt.
Remove any adverse data recorded on Mr Ls credit  file from September  2016  to when  a 
reduced repayment plan was agreed in 2017.
Ill consider matters further if further evidence/comments are received by 26 December 2019.
