The complaint
Mr K complains that Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) wont refund around £40,000 he lost to an 
investment scam.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat everything 
again here. In brief summary, Mr K fell victim to an investment scam in August 2022. He 
became friends with an accountant (the scammer) on social media, who encouraged him to 
invest in a platform called Cboe.mobi. He then proceeded to make the following payments 
to his Binance wallets, where his funds were subsequently transferred on to the scammer:
No. Date Amount Payee Method
1 22/08/2022 £2.00 Binance (Skrill) Bank Transfer
2 23/08/2022 £500.00 Binance Card payment

Mr K realised he had been scammed when he was asked to pay a significant sum in fees to 
be able to withdraw his money. He reported the fraud to Lloyds and said it should have done 
more to protect him, but it refused to refund the money he lost as he had authorised the 
payments. 
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Ks complaint. She didnt think the payments wouldve 
appeared particularly unusual in light of his previous account activity, so she didnt think 
there was any cause for Lloyds to intervene and question him about the payments. Mr K 
disagreed, so the matter was escalated to me to determine.
I issued my provisional decision on this complaint in November 2023. I said I was minded to 
uphold it and set out the following reasons:
It isnt in dispute that Mr K has fallen victim to a cruel scam here, nor that he 
authorised the disputed payments he made to his Binance wallet (where his funds 
were subsequently transferred on to the scammer). The debit card and faster 
payments were requested using his legitimate security credentials provided by 
Lloyds, and the starting position is that banks ought to follow the instructions given by 
their customers in order for legitimate payments to be made as instructed.
However, Ive considered whether Lloyds should have done more to prevent Mr K 
from falling victim to the scam, as there are some situations in which a bank should 
reasonably have had a closer look at the circumstances surrounding a particular 
transfer. For example, if it was particularly out of character.
Lloyds says that none of the payments Mr K made would have appeared as unusual. 
And having considered the first 16 payments he made as part of the scam, Im 
inclined to agree. I say this because Mr K had already made payments to Binance 
prior to the scam in June and July 2022, so it was already an established payee on 
the account. He had also previously made payments as large as £7,500 in August 
2022 from his account, which was the same month he started making payments to 
the scammer. I appreciate that one of the payments Mr K made to Binance was 
larger than this at £9,000. But I dont consider it to have been significantly larger than 
other payments hed made previously, such that it ought to have been regarded as 
suspicious or indicating that he might have been at risk of falling victim to a scam.
However, I do consider the activity on the account to have become increasingly 
unusual and suspicious by 15 September 2022 when Mr K started making multiple 
bank transfers to Binance on the same day, where he made five transfers totalling 
£7,000. Lloyds ought reasonably to have been aware that making multiple payments 
to the same payee in quick succession is often indicative of fraud. There would be 
very little reason for someone to have to make so many payments to the same 
payee, other than to try and avoid detection. So, Im satisfied that by the fourth 
payment Mr K made that day for £1,500, there was enough suspicious and unusual 
activity to have warranted an intervention by Lloyds.
I appreciate there was an earlier occasion where three payments were made on 24 
August 2022. But this was across two different payment methods, which would have 
also shown up as different payees (i.e. Binance and Skrill). The amount cumulatively wouldnt have appeared overly unusual either, so Im not persuaded 
theres enough here to justify Lloyds blocking any of the payments made that day. 
But, for the reasons Ive explained above, I do consider Lloyds should have 
intervened by the time Mr K made the fourth payment to Binance on 15 September 
2022.
If Lloyds had asked Mr K what the payments were for and the basic surrounding 
context, I consider it likely he would have fully explained what he was doing. It could 
have discovered that he had been encouraged to invest by someone that had 
contacted him out of the blue on social media, that was telling him to make payments 
through cryptocurrency when he was under the impression he was investing in 
stocks. These are common hallmarks of these sorts of investment scams, so I 
consider there would have been reasonable grounds for suspicion here. So, Lloyds 
ought reasonably to have provided a scam warning.
If Lloyds had given a warning, I believe that Mr K would have paused and looked 
more closely into the trading platform before proceeding. It seems likely he would 
have made further enquiries into cryptocurrency scams and whether or not 
Cboe.mobi was regulated in the UK or abroad. Mr K could have discovered they 
were not, and Im satisfied its more likely than not that he wouldnt have continued to 
make any further payments. So, but for Lloyds failure to act on clear triggers of 
potential fraud or financial harm, Mr K would probably have not gone on to make the 
final two payments on 15 September 2022. I therefore intend asking Lloyds to refund 
these payments.
Contributory negligence
Despite regulatory safeguards, there is a general principle that consumers must still 
take responsibility for their decisions (see s.1C(d) of our enabling statute, the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000). I have duly considered whether Mr K 
should bear some responsibility by way of contributory negligence in this case, but 
Im not persuaded it would be fair to reduce compensation in this instance.
I accept that Mr K doesnt appear to have carried out sufficient due diligence before 
choosing to part with his money. But having carried out my own research, it doesnt 
appear that he would have found any adverse information about Cboe.mobi even if 
he had conducted his own checks at the time he chose to invest. The scammer also 
wasnt purporting to be from a fraudulent investment brokerage that he could have 
checked, so there was nothing he could have reasonably done to research the 
credentials of the person he was speaking to either.
Mr K was under the impression that he was investing in stocks and he was told to 
expect returns of around 20%. And while this would certainly be a significant return 
for the stock market, I dont consider it to have been totally unrealistic in this context, 
such that he ought to have considered it as too good to be true.
All in all, I am satisfied there was no contributory negligence on this occasion and 
Mr K was simply the unwitting and blameless victim of a clever fraudster. The bank 
was the professional in financial matters; Mr K was a layperson. Therefore, I do not 
consider it would be appropriate to reduce compensation in these circumstances.
Recovery
Ive also considered whether Lloyds did enough to try and recover the funds after the 
fraud was reported. However, there wouldnt have been any successful prospect of a chargeback for the debit card payments made to Binance, as Mr K would have 
received the services he paid for. In terms of the faster payments, we know that 
these were transferred to Mr Ks own wallet with Binance before being swiftly moved 
again to the scammer, so there would have been no reasonable prospect of Lloyds 
being able to recover any money from the receiving account either. Overall, Im not 
persuaded there were any other steps Lloyds could have reasonably taken to try and 
recover Mr Ks money in these circumstances.
I invited further comments and evidence from both parties. Lloyds responded accepting my 
provisional conclusions and agreed to settle the complaint in the way I had proposed. Mr K 
responded and said he thought Lloyds should have intervened sooner than payment 17.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into consideration Mr Ks point around where Lloyds ought to have 
intervened. I understand why Mr K may be disappointed with the outcome. However, I set 
out my reasons for why I didnt think any of the payments prior to payment 17 would have 
appeared overly unusual, and Ive not been provided with any further comments or evidence 
that would alter this conclusion. 
As a result, and given that Lloyds also had no further comments, I see no reason to depart 
from the conclusions reached in my provisional decision. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct Lloyds Bank Plc to:
Refund payments 17 and 18 listed in the table above (totaling £2,850).
Pay 8% simple interest per annum on this amount from the date of loss until the date 
of settlement. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 December 2023.
