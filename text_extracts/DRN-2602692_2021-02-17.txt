DRN-2602692
The complaint
Ms M complained about a number of loans she took out through a company called PDL
Finance Limited, trading as Mr Lender. 
Ms M says she was lent to irresponsibly and the loans caused her financial problems. We 
now know that Ms M took out 3 loans from Mr Lender between January 2014 and July 2014.
  
What happened
I issued a provisional decision in January 2021, comprehensively setting out why I was 
intending to partially uphold Ms Ms complaint in respect of loan number 2 only, and for Mr 
Lender to put things right for her. 
That provisional decision should be read in conjunction with this final decision. I then asked 
both parties to provide any further submissions or information to me within one month. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve had responses from both parties who accept my provisional findings. So, theres no 
reason for me to change the findings I set out previously.
 
Putting things right
Mr Lender should:
refund all interest and charges Ms M paid on loan 2;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information recorded on Ms Ms credit file in relation to loan 2;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. It must give Ms M a certificate
showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
  
My final decision
I partially uphold this complaint and require PDL Finance Limited to pay the compensation 
outline above.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 March 2021.
