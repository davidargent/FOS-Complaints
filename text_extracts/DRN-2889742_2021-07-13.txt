The complaint
Mrs L complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) defaulted her loan account 
and advised late payments to credit reference agencies. 
What happened
Mrs L took a loan of £15,000 from NatWest in August 2019. The repayments were £312.67 a 
month. She missed payments on March 2020, August 2020, and for the four months 
between October 2020 and January 2021. NatWest sent a number of emails and texts in 
March 2020 and April 2020. And tried to call Mrs L in May 2020 and June 2020. NatWest 
issued a default notice on 3 July 2020. In August 2020, Mrs L send an income and 
expenditure form to NatWest  this showed negative income. NatWest texted Mrs L on 4 
September 2020. They sent formal demand on 24 September 2020. A default was registered 
on 23 October 2020 - and her payments were then managed by a debt collection agency 
(DCA).
Mrs L works for the NHS and has undergone a very stressful and busy year and asks for 
compassion and understanding regarding her circumstances. Mrs L complained that shed 
tried to contact NatWest many times either by phone or via its App, but without success  to 
discuss her circumstances. She hadnt received the correspondence from NatWest  and 
when she did see a text, she thought it might be a scam, so she ignored it. She said she had 
made the payment to her loan in January 2021  but this had gone through early in February 
2021. So  the January payment was made. The February 2021 payment had been made at 
the end of February 2021  so the late payments noted on her credit file for January 2021 
and February 2021 were unfair. She had then paid £630 in April 2021 to bring payments up 
to date. But NatWest continued to advise late payments on her credit file for February 2021, 
March 2021 and April 2021. She wanted to move to a new house and was now having 
difficulty getting a mortgage.
NatWest said theyd tried to contact Mrs L many times about her situation. Theyd sent 
emails on 25 March 2020, 13 April 2020 and 26 April 2020. Texts were sent on 27 March 
2020, 14 April 2020, 25 April 2020 and 29 May 2020. They called her on 15 May 2020, 26 
May 2020 and 28 June 2020. Letters were sent on 20 April 2020, 30 April 2020, 3 May 2020 
and 3 June 2020  all methods of contact asked Mrs L to get in touch. A default notice was 
sent on 3 July 2020  which said her loan would be defaulted if she didnt contact them. The 
income and expenditure form that Mrs L sent in showed a negative income of £486 a month. 
Another text was sent on 4 September 2020  and because there wasnt any contact from 
Mrs L, they made formal demand on 24 September 2020. A default was registered on 23 
October 2020 and after that, Mrs Ls loan was dealt with by a DCA. They apologised for the 
problems Mrs L had in getting through to NatWest during the pandemic. They said that the 
correct information was advised to the credit reference agencies (CRA).
Mrs L brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said she thought that it wasnt fair that 
NatWest sent a default notice in July 2020  when shed only missed one payment. And 
after shed sent in her income and expenditure statement in August 2020, NatWest had only 
contacted her by text  10 days later. So, they couldve done more to help. So  she said the 
default registered on 23 October 2020 should be removed. And Mrs L should receive £250 
for the trouble and upset caused. 
NatWest said to our investigator that they felt that the default had been correctly registered. 
But under the wider circumstances of the pandemic, they agreed to remove the default from 
Mrs Ls credit file and pay £250 for trouble and upset caused. Mrs L accepted that, but she 
also wanted the late payment entries to be removed. She said shed brought the payments 
up to date, so they were wrongly advised to the CRAs. So, she asked that an ombudsman 
look at her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I must reach a balanced decision here based on all the evidence that Ive seen.
Mrs L argues that she made many attempts to get through to NatWest to discuss matters  
and showed us evidence of web-messages to them. And, she spent a long time trying to get 
through on the phone. She said she thought that some of NatWests text messages were 
attempts at fraud  so she ignored them.
On the other hand, NatWest have told us that they tried to contact Mrs L on many occasions 
through texts, phone call and letters  and without any response from Mrs L, other than 
when she sent to them her income and expenditure details in August 2020. Our investigator 
considered that NatWest then missed the opportunity to properly engage with Mrs L and 
agree a way forward. And because of that, she felt that the default registered on 23 October 
2020 should be removed. NatWest agreed to do this and to pay compensation of £250  so I 
wont go into that aspect of Mr Ls complaint too much. I endorse that, but  Ive also seen 
that NatWest clearly did make a lot of effort to contact Mrs L throughout 2020  mostly 
unsuccessfully. And  while I can accept that Mrs L may have thought that some texts were 
suspicious, when I consider the overall extent of the communications sent to Mr L, she must 
have been aware of her circumstances and the need to sort things out. So  I think 
NatWests agreement to remove the default registered in October 2020 recognises Mrs Ls 
circumstances  that she was an NHS worker working in the face of the pandemic.  So  I 
need to take NatWests agreement to that action into consideration in reaching my decision.
So - the key point now outstanding in Mrs Ls complaint is that she still had late payment 
markers put on her credit file  and she says these are unfair because shes paid the arrears 
off and shes up to date. And  if NatWest have agreed to remove the default, it follows that 
the late payment entries should also be removed. Specifically, she says the January 2021 
payment was shown as late because the direct debit went through on 4 February 2021. And 
the February 20201 payment was made on 28 February 2021. So  she says the late 
payment markers for January and February 2021 are wrong.
Let me explain  banks, including NatWest, are obliged to record accurate data at CRAs. 
There are essentially two types of notifications  firstly, registration of a default. The 
guidance for dealing with defaults is laid down by the Information Commissioners Office 
(ICO). This says when a consumer is at least three months behind with their payments then 
a default may be registered. And it would expect a default to be registered by the time the 
consumer is six months behind with their payments. It is the business responsibility to put 
an entry on the credit file. This cannot be taken off unless it is an error. And in this case  
NatWest have agreed to remove the default registered in October 2020.But  banks also advise payment information to CRAs. This is so other lenders can see if a 
potential borrower is a good payer or not. Its for those lenders to interpret the information as 
they wish.
In Mrs Ls case, she was behind with her payments. Ive looked at her loan statements. She 
missed payments in March 2020, August 2020, and for the four months between October 
2020 and January 2021. So, by then, she was six months behind  which is a lot. Mrs L says 
that the January 2021 payment was made in February 2021  but having looked at her 
statement, thats not the case  the January 2021 payment was due on 20 January 2021 
and was not paid then, as the direct debit was returned unpaid. Payments of £315 were then 
made in February 2021, March 2021 and April 2021. A further £630 was paid in April 2021  
so Mrs L was trying to bring payments up to date. 
But  by the end of January 2021, she was six months behind with her payments. The 
overpayment of £630 in April 2021 dealt with two of those, but she was still four payments 
behind. So  I cant say that NatWest were wrong to advise the CRAs of this. Mrs L has told 
us that shes continued to overpay to clear the arrears since that time  I havent got the data 
to show this  but I hope shes now been able to bring things up to date.
I must reach a balanced decision here based on all the circumstances of this case. And that 
is that I think that on balance  as Mrs L has had agreement to have the default removed, I 
think its fair that the late payment information advised to the CRAs by NatWest remain on 
her credit file.
Mrs L has argued strongly for her case, and I can see her strength of feeling. And so, she 
will be disappointed by my decision, but Im not going to ask NatWest to do anymore here  
other than doing what theyve already agreed to do  which is to remove the default 
registered in October 2020 and pay Mrs L compensation of £250 for distress and 
inconvenience.
Putting things right
NatWest have agreed to remove the default registered on 23 October 2020 and pay 
compensation of £250 for distress and inconvenience.  
My final decision
I uphold this complaint.   National Westminster Bank Plc must:
Remove the default dated October 2020 from Mrs Ls credit file  but not the late 
payment information.
Pay Mrs L £250 for distress and inconvenience. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2021.
