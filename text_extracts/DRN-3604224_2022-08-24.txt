The complaint
Mr P complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA refused his request for a refund, after 
he raised a claim under its Buyer Protection policy.
What happened
Mr P used his PayPal account to purchase web links from a company that provides search 
engine optimisation services. He says he didnt receive what hed paid for. He raised a 
dispute under PayPals Buyer Protection policy, but PayPal denied his claim. 
Mr P asked our service to consider his concerns, but our investigator didnt think his 
complaint should be upheld. He thought PayPal had acted fairly, in line with its user 
agreement. He didnt think there was enough evidence to show that PayPals decision to 
decline Mr Ps Buyer Protection claim was unfair. He thought it was fair for PayPal to have 
closed Mr Ps dispute because Mr P had also raised a chargeback with is card issuer.
Mr P disagreed with our investigators view. He said hed raised the chargeback with his 
bank after PayPals decision in favour of the seller, rather than at the same time. He also 
commented that items the seller sold him were not as described and he wouldnt have sent 
any money without PayPal claiming he could get 100% of his money back. So, the complaint 
has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ps complaint. Ill explain why.
Im aware that Mr P has another complaint against PayPal with our service. To be clear, I am 
only considering PayPals handling of his Buyer Protection dispute in this decision.
PayPals user agreement says that buyers may be eligible for a refund under its Buyer 
Protection policy, in certain circumstances, if the purchase is not received or is considered 
Significantly Not as Described.
PayPal says it denied Mr Ps claim because he had received the service from the seller, but 
it did not meet his expectations. I appreciate Mr P disagrees with this, but the information 
hes provided isnt enough for me to conclude that PayPals decision was unreasonable. 
Hes provided a list of web links and an email to the seller saying why hes dissatisfied. But 
theres nothing to show how the seller described what they were selling. 
I understand that Mr P also raised a chargeback with his bank.  PayPal has given us 
conflicting information about when the chargeback was raised. Mr P says this was after 
PayPal turned down his Buyer Protection claim. From what Ive seen, I think what Mr P has 
told us is likely to be correct. 
PayPals user agreement says:
You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under PayPal Buyer Protection, 
or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer. You cant do both at the same time or seek a 
double recovery. If you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the 
same transaction with your card issuer, well close your dispute/claim with us. This wont 
affect the dispute process with your card issuer. In addition, if you pursue a dispute with your 
card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.
PayPal says it couldnt take any further action on the case after Mr P raised the chargeback 
with his card issuer. Given what it says in its user agreement, I cant say that this was unfair.
 
Mr P has commented that he wouldnt have made the payment if it wasnt for PayPal 
claiming he would get 100% of his money back in these circumstances. However, PayPals 
user agreement says that it determines in its sole discretion whether a claim is eligible for 
Buyer Protection based on the eligibility requirements and the information provided. So, Im 
not persuaded that PayPal misled Mr P into believing that he was guaranteed a refund if he 
was dissatisfied with his purchase. 
I appreciate my answer will be disappointing for Mr P. But Im satisfied that PayPal has acted 
fairly and in line with its user agreement. So, I dont require it to do anything further in 
relation to this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 September 2022.
