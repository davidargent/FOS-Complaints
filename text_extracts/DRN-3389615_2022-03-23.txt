Mr M says that he was already heavily reliant on lending before he applied for his first loan 
with Likely Loans. He says he was using high-cost lending to fund essential expenditure 
and feels he was stuck in a cycle of borrowing. Mr M says if Likely Loans had done better 
checks it would have realised he couldnt afford further borrowing. He adds that he has had 
to enter into a debt management plan as a result.
Likely Loans says it conducted its standard credit check alongside asking Mr M about his 
income and expenditure. It says it found no evidence to suggest Mr M was struggling to pay 
his existing credit commitments or essential bills and that its analysis showed the 
repayments to be affordable.
Our investigator recommended the complaint should be upheld in part. He found that Mr M 
was reliant on short-term credit at the time of loan 1 and so Likely Loans was irresponsible 
to have approved further credit. However, he was satisfied its checks showed further 
lending was sustainable for the following four loans. Our investigator said Likely Loans 
should refund interest and charges on loan 1 (plus 8%) and remove any negative 
information about that loan from his credit file.
Mr M responded to say, in summary, that he was in financial difficulties throughout the 
lending period, not just loan 1, and had been in a debt management plan since 2013. He 
said if Likely Loans had carried out sufficient checks it would have seen this.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mr M and to Likely Loans on 22 February 2022. Ive 
summarised my findings:
For loan 1, I did not consider Likely Loans carried out proportionate checks which 
were likely to have shown Mr M had three open short-term loan accounts, a history of 
using short-term lenders and an account with a debt management company;
So I found Mr M was already struggling to manage his money and that Likely Loans 
did not make a fair lending decision for loan 1;
Proportionate checks for loan 2 would have shown Mr M was already committed to 
spending around 50% of his income on credit repayments and continued to rely on 
short-term lending. I considered that this should have indicated to Likely Loans that 
further lending was unsustainable;
For loans 3, 4 and 5, I considered that proportionate checks were likely to have 
shown Mr Ms expenditure on credit was a significant proportion of his income and he 
had at least three outstanding short-term loans at the time of each loan. So I found 
that Mr M was showing clear signs that he was struggling to manage his money and 
that further lending was not sustainable for him.
My provisional decision was that I didnt find Likely Loans made a fair lending decision for 
any of loans 1 to 5, although I couldnt see it acted unfairly or unreasonably in any other way.
Both Mr M and Likely Loans responded to say that they accepted my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I outlined the relevant rules and guidelines in my provisional decision, so I wont repeat them 
here.
As neither party provided any additional information and both accepted my provisional 
decision, I see no reason to depart from it.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. Oakbrook Finance Limited (trading as Likely 
Loans) should:
Add up the total amount of money Mr M received as a result of having been given 
the loans. The repayments Mr M made should be deducted from this amount.If this results in Mr M having paid more than he received, then any 
overpayments should be refunded along with 8% simple interest (calculated 
from the date the overpayments were made until the date of settlement). *
If any capital balance remains outstanding, then Likely Loans should attempt 
to arrange an affordable and suitable payment plan with Mr M;
Remove any negative information recorded on Mr Ms credit file regarding the 
loans up to the settlement date.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Likely Loans to take off tax from this interest. Likely 
Loans must give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2022.
