The complaint
Mr E complains that a motorbike acquired with finance from Honda Finance Europe Plc 
trading as Honda Financial Services (HFS) wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. Briefly, I concluded that although Mr E had 
covered significant mileage during the time he had possession of the motorbike, the rate per 
mile applied by HFS was unreasonable, and it was important to bear in mind that in the case 
of a rejection (as is the case here) the consumer should be put back in the position they 
were in had the fault not occurred, whilst recognising the businesses right to have a 
reasonable and appropriate usage deduction.
I explained why I thought it was appropriate for HFS to retain Mr Es monthly payments but 
that it should refund the deposit, with interest.
I invited Mr E and HFS to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wanted to 
make before I finally determined the matter.
Mr E said he accepted my provisional decision. HFS didnt respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr E has said he accepts my provisional decision and HFS hasnt responded. In the 
circumstances I see no reason to reach different conclusions to the ones I set out in my 
provisional decision. 
Putting things right
HFS must refund Mr Es deposit together with 8% interest and pay compensation for trouble 
and upset.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. 
Honda Financial Services must ;
Refund the deposit together with 8% simple interest from the date of payment to the 
date of settlement
Pay compensation of Â£200 for trouble and upset
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2021.
