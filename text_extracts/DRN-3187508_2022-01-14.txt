The complaint
Mr H is unhappy with the fees and charges that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aquacard, have 
applied to his account, as well as with the service that hed received from NewDay when 
attempting to discuss his account with them.
What happened
Mr H went over the agreed credit limit on his NewDay credit account on several occasions 
and incurred charges on his account as a result. Mr H also incurred late payment fees and 
unpaid direct debit fees on his account. Mr H wasnt happy with the amount of fees and 
charges that had been applied by NewDay to his NewDay account, or that NewDay wouldnt 
enter into a discussion with him about his account via email. Mr H was also unhappy that 
when hed tried to contact NewDay by telephone that he hadnt been able to get through. So, 
he raised a complaint.
NewDay looked at Mr Hs complaint. But they felt that the fees and charges had been 
applied to the account correctly, and they noted that they dont discuss accounts in detail via 
email because they have information security concerns about doing so. However, NewDay 
did acknowledge the difficulties that Mr H had had when trying to contact them by telephone, 
and so they apologised to Mr H for this and credited his account with £20 as compensation 
for the inconvenience hed incurred.
Mr H wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also felt that NewDay had applied 
the charges to Mr Hs account fairly and that it was reasonable for NewDay to not discuss 
accounts via email. Our investigator also felt that the £20 compensation that NewDay had 
already paid to Mr H for the difficulties hes had trying to contact NewDay by telephone 
already represented a fair resolution to that aspect of Mr Hs complaint. So, they didnt 
uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Mr H remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how Mr H might be unhappy to have incurred fees and charges on his 
NewDay credit account. However, contractual charges on credit accounts for such 
occurrences as exceeding an agreed credit limit or for making monthly repayments late are a 
common feature of credit card accounts, and it must be noted that Mr H agreed to these 
charges, which are outlined in the credit agreement, when he applied for and accepted the 
account. Additionally, having reviewed Mr Hs account I cant see any instance where 
NewDay have applied charges to his account incorrectly. 
However, it would be expected that if Mr H had contacted NewDay and explained that he 
was struggling to manage his credit account that he would have received appropriate 
assistance from NewDay at that time.
NewDay appear to have provided such assistance here, and I say this because when Mr H 
did contact them to explain that a change in his personal circumstances meant that he was 
finding it difficult to make the payments due on his account, NewDay placed his account on a 
payment holiday to allow Mr H time to recover his financial position.
Mr H has also stated that he feels that the amount of each charge applied to his account is 
too high. However, while I can appreciate Mr Hs position here, the single charge amount 
doesnt seem excessively high to me, and I can confirm that its in-line with industry norms. 
And, it also must be noted again, that Mr H consented to NewDays charging structure when 
he applied to NewDay for the account.
Mr H is also unhappy that NewDay wouldnt discuss his account in detail via email, and that 
when he tried to contact NewDay by telephone he couldnt get through despite being on hold 
for a considerable period of time.
Again, I can understand why Mr H might be disappointed by this. But NewDay have 
explained that they dont enter into such discussions via email because of information 
security concerns. This seems reasonable to me, and I wouldnt consider asking NewDay to 
act against their policy in this regard. 
NewDay have acknowledged the difficulties that Mr H encountered when trying to contact 
them by telephone, and theyve apologised to Mr H for this and made a payment to him of 
£20 compensation. 
Mr H has stated that this payment doesnt go far enough to resolve his issues. But it must be 
remembered that this £20 compensation was only made in response to the specific issue of 
Mr H being unable to get through to NewDay when he tried to, and wasnt made in relation to 
any other point of complaint that Mr H has raised. And, when considered in that context, I do 
feel that the £20 that NewDay have already paid Mr H here does fairly compensate him for 
that aspect of his complaint.
All of which means that I find it difficult to conclude that NewDay have acted unfairly or 
unreasonably here, and it follows from this that I wont be upholding this complaint or 
instructing NewDay to take any further action at this time.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that Mr H wanted, but I hope that hell understand, 
given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 February 2022.
