The complaint
Mr L complains about PrePay Technologies Limiteds (PrePay) decision to close his 
banking account.  
What happened
PrePay gave Mr L 60 days notice that it would be closing his account. So, Mr L raised a 
complaint. 
PrePay investigated the complaint but didnt uphold it. It said it was closing the account in 
line with its terms and conditions. So, Mr L brought his complaint to our service.
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. Our 
investigator found that PrePays terms and conditions allow it to close a customers account if 
it gives the correct notice period. Our investigator also found the relationship between Mr L 
and the business had broken down and PrePay were free to make a commercial decision if it 
no longer wants to offer a customer its banking services. 
Mr L didnt agree with the investigators view, so the complaints been passed to me to issue 
a final decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator for largely the same 
reasons. Ill explain why. 
PrePay, like most account providers has a broad discretion to decide who they want as a 
customer. I wouldnt generally interfere with their decision to close an account unless their 
reasons were unlawful. But I can also look at whether the business has treated Mr L unfairly 
when deciding to close his account. 
Given this relationship has irrevocably broken down and the type of service PrePay are 
providing, which is based mainly around fees for using its services, Im satisfied that its in 
both partys interests that the account remains closed. I also havent found that PrePay have 
acted unlawfully or unfairly when closing it. 
Section 16 of Mr Ls account terms and conditions say
16. TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION 
16.1. We can terminate this Agreement at any time: 
16.1.1. if we give you two calendar months notice and refund the Available Balance to you 
without charge. 
So, I havent found PrePay have acted outside of those terms when its made the decision to 
close Mr Ls account. Im also satisfied PrePay gave Mr L the correct notice period. 
Given the high number of complaints Mr L has raised in a short period of time, its clear Mr L 
is unhappy with the service and type of account PrePay are providing. Mr L has raised 
various complaints including being unhappy about its fee structure. PrePay also feel there is 
a lack of trust in the bank on Mr Ls part. So, I agree with the investigator when shes said 
the relationship appears to have broken down.
In summary, PrePay have closed Mr Ls account in line with the terms and conditions Mr L 
signed up to. And I havent found PrePay have acted unfairly when it has made the decision 
to end its banking relationship with Mr L.  
So based on the above, as PrePay did nothing wrong, and as it is free to choose its 
customers, in the same way a customer is free to choose who it banks with, it does not need 
to re-open Mr Ls account.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 December 2022.
