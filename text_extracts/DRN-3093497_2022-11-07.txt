The complaint
Mr R complains Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money (118 118 Money) 
irresponsibly lent to him.
Mr R is represented by a claims management company. For ease Ill refer to all submissions 
as if they were made directly by him.
What happened
Mr R was approved for a £2,000 loan by 118 118 Money in January 2019. The term of the 
loan was 24 months with repayments of effectively £200 per month. The purpose of the loan 
was listed as debt consolidation.
Mr R says this loan was irresponsibly lent. He says 118 118 Money did not complete 
reasonable and proportionate checks before approving the loan. He complains that if 118 
118 Money had done this, it ought to have known the loan was unaffordable.
Our investigator recommended the complaint be upheld. She felt 118 118 Money did not 
complete reasonable and proportionate checks, and that in any event the information which 
was gathered demonstrated that 118 118 Money made an unfair decision to lend. 
118 118 Money disagreed with our investigator. It maintained that it had completed 
reasonable and proportionate checks. And that there was sufficient information to suggest 
that the loan was affordable to Mr R.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to complaints about irresponsible and unaffordable lending as 
well as the key rules, regulations and what we consider to be good industry practice on our 
website. Ive used this approach to help me decide this complaint.   
Mr R and 118 118 Money are aware of our services approach to irresponsible and 
unaffordable lending complaints; so for the sake of conciseness I wont set out the detail 
here. But for clarity, Ive considered if 118 118 Money completed reasonable and 
proportionate checks; and if they made a fair decision to lend. Ive also considered if 118 118 
Money acted unfairly in any other way.
Having reviewed the information provided Im also satisfied that 118 118 Money did not 
complete reasonable and proportionate checks in this instance. I can see that 118 118 
Money completed an affordability assessment; and searched Mr Rs credit file. 118 118 
Money has confirmed that Mr R completed the application online and that it relied on the 
data which he had provided. 
The income assessment which Mr R provided declared that his income was £1,600 per 
month and that his total outgoings were around £820. These outgoings included money for 
rent/mortgage as well as his existing credit commitments (a figure of £64 was input for this). 
The credit file search demonstrated that Mr R had a total debt of around £3,800, of which 
£2,800 was made of unsecured loans and the other approximate £1,000 from revolving 
credit. It also demonstrated that Mr R was utilising his credit to around 97% balance to limit 
ratio. The history also demonstrated that Mr R had taken seven cash advances in the last six 
months, including three in the last three months. Mr R also had a historic CCJ for around 
£200. The rest of the credit file demonstrated that Mr R was meeting his credit commitments, 
generally speaking, well (albeit running his credit close to his limit).
Having considered this information Im satisfied 118 118 Money shouldve completed further 
checks to verify Mr Rs outgoings. Whilst 118 118 Money is correct it is entitled to rely on the 
information it is provided, this is only so far as there is evidence to support that information. 
In this instance the credit report suggested that Mr R had higher outgoings than those 
declared, and in particular that the declared £64 for his credit commitments was unlikely to 
be accurate. Im therefore satisfied 118 118 Money shouldve done more to verify Mr Rs 
outgoings.
I also note this loan was for debt consolidation; and that the total amount being borrowed 
was not sufficient to cover all of Mr Rs debts. 118 118 Money has highlighted that Mr R did 
not need to clear all of his balances in order for the loan to be affordable, but Im also 
satisfied it shouldve done more to understand which debts Mr R was planning on 
consolidating in order to better determine if he could reasonably afford it. 
As 118 118 Money did not do further checks it follows that Im satisfied it did not complete 
proportionate checks in this instance.
As 118 118 Money did not complete reasonable and proportionate checks, I have to 
consider what it wouldve done had it done so, and whether it therefore made a fair decision 
to lend.
In this instance, based on the information which has been provided to me Im not satisfied 
118 118 Money acted fairly when it lent to Mr R. 
The information which has been provided demonstrates that Mr R was more than likely 
already struggling to meet his current financial commitments. And that further lending 
(regardless of the declared intention) would not have been sustainable for him. I note that Mr 
Rs credit card limit had increased in the months leading up to this loan application from 
£500 to £1,000 and that Mr R had immediately reached the limit of this card. I can also see 
that Mr R had begun to take on cash advances including over £1,000 in the 12 months 
leading up to this application (as noted above he had also made seven advances in the last 
six months). 
Im satisfied that this pattern of lending demonstrates that Mr R was likely becoming reliant 
on credit to supplement his income in order to meet his necessary outgoings. I note that 
whilst this loan was for debt consolidation it was not for the full amount, and as such 
wouldve left Mr R still having to make repayments to existing credit providers. I also note 
this loans repayments were substantial at £200 per month. Im satisfied based on the 
information which has been provided that Mr R more than likely could not have afforded to 
do this sustainably (based on the pattern described above); and as such 118 118 Money 
made an unfair decision to lend to him.Ive not seen any further information which suggests 118 118 Money acted unfairly in any 
other way.
Putting things right
Mr R has lost out financially as a result of 118 118 Moneys actions. As such it needs to put 
things right. From the transaction statements it appears as if the loan has since been settled 
as there is a zero balance pending. 
As such in order to do put things right I require 118 118 Money to:
Refund all interest and charges paid by Mr R in relation to this loan;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
Remove any negative information in relation to this loan from Mr Rs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if they ask for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against Madison CF UK Limited trading as 
118 118 Money. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 December 2022.
