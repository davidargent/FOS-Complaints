Ms H and Mr M are concerned at the amount outstanding on their secured loan account with 
OneSavings Bank Plc (OSB). They think the balance is higher than it should  be, and 
believe charges  may have  been  added unfairly.
background 
Ms H and Mr M took out a secured loan in late December 2006. While its now owned by 
OSB, it was originally taken out with a different provider.
Ms H and Mr M borrowed £33,500, with fees for the application and their broker  totalling 
£1,225 added to the loan. Interest was charged  at a variable rate, initially 8.60%.
The loan was to be repaid  by 120 monthly payments, which  started one month after the loan 
was advanced.  So Ms H and Mr M began  making their payments on 1 February 2007. These 
were £432.40.
Ms H and Mr Ms account fell into some  significant arrears after missed payments began  to 
accrue in late 2011 and through 2012.  By January 2013, these totalled around £2,000 and 
the original loan owner referred the account to solicitors. The following month, Ms H and 
Mr M set up an arrangement to start reducing the arrears  paying £100 a month  on top of 
the contractual monthly payment (CMP) of £483.21.  So the original loan owner  halted  the 
legal action.
The arrangement was reviewed in 2014 and from July, Ms H and Mr M agreed  to pay £150 
each week (or £600 a month) with a view to clearing  the arrears  within  the remaining term of 
the loan.
Ms H and Mr Ms loan was transferred from the original loan owner to OSB in November 
2015. The payment arrangement continued.
Ms H and Mr M received  a letter from OSBs solicitors in November 2016. This said that the 
loan was due to end in December 2016  but that there  was still an outstanding  balance of 
£6,122.87. 
Ms H and Mr M complained.  They  couldnt  understand why the balance was so high. They  
said theyd been  assured  that by paying the higher amount of £600  each month,  the loan 
would be paid off on time.  But OSB didnt think anything was wrong. It said the account  had 
been in arrears, resulting in additional interest and charges being added  to the loan. 
Not being satisfied with this, Ms H and Mr M referred their concerns  to us.
my provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on Ms H and Mr Ms complaint in January. For the most  part, I 
didnt think OSB (or its predecessor) had done anything  wrong.  I did, however, think  that 
some charges had been unfairly  applied   which I thought OSB  should refund to the account 
now. In summary, I said:
The limits  to our jurisdiction meant that we couldnt consider any aspect  of Ms H and 
Mr Ms complaint that related to anything that happened before 1 April 2014.
Ref: DRN21891912Id reviewed the account at the time the payment  arrangement of £600  a month had 
been set up. That was back  in July 2014. The account balance was around  £17,000.  
Interest was being charged at 10.9%. By my calculations,  monthly  payments of £600 
wouldve been enough to pay everything off within the remaining term of just under 
two and a half years  taking  into account  the additional interest that was also being  
charged as a result of the payments that had been  missed  in the past. So I didnt 
think Ms H and Mr M had been misled  about  the amounts theyd need to pay to 
ensure the loan was settled within the agreed  term. 
I thought the main  issue here was that unfortunately, Ms H and Mr M hadnt been  
able to make the agreed £600 payment each month.  Thered been  several  occasions  
between August 2014 and January 2017 in which Ms H and Mr M had paid 
substantially less (for example, they only paid £230 in November 2015 and £330 the 
following month). And while theyd sometimes made up those shortfall  amounts, 
theyd not always  been able to. So over the remaining  term, the payments theyd 
made were around £2,600 less than had been  due under the arrangement.  
Those missed payments were the major  cause  of the outstanding balance  at the end 
of the loan term. Those  amounts had also attracted additional interest. Where 
payments had been made later than expected  or not at all, the balance  had been  
higher than anticipated for longer. So interest  had been charged  on a higher amount 
 and more had therefore been charged  to the account than had been  envisaged  
when the arrangement was agreed. The £600 payment was only going to be 
sufficient if it was always received by the end of the month  which it hadnt been. 
While  I could appreciate that having  to pay this extra  interest would have felt like an 
extra burden for Ms H and Mr M, I didnt think it was unreasonable  for it to have 
accrued on the amount that was outstanding. That was common practice, and was 
provided for under the terms and conditions of the loan.
Additional charges  had also been  added to the account over the years. I could only 
review those applied  since 1 April 2014 due to the limits of our jurisdiction. Since 
then, fourteen  administration  fees (totalling £560) and a debt counselling fee of £48 
had been applied. And theyd incurred interest. These extra amounts wouldnt have 
been foreseen when the £600  a month arrangement  was set up and accounted for 
some of the balance  still outstanding when Ms H and Mr M reached the end of the 
scheduled term.
The charges  had been applied  in line with the terms and conditions  of the account. 
But Id also considered whether the charges had been fairly applied   taking into 
account Ms H and Mr Ms wider  circumstances and the way the account  had been 
managed by both parties. Looking at the internal notes of contact and payment 
history for Ms H and Mr Ms account, I thought there were  a number of months where 
the original loan owner had continued to apply charges to the account  even  where 
Ms H and Ms M had made payments in line with an agreed arrangement and for 
more than the CMP. For example, despite  receiving payments of £583 in March,  April 
and May 2014  (being £100  more than the CMP), a fee of £40 was applied  in April, 
May and June 2014.
Ref: DRN21891913Accordingly, I thought OSB  ought  to refund the £40 administration  fees applied in 
April 2014, May 2014, June  2014, September 2014,  April 2015 and the £50 fee 
applied in October 2015, along with the interest they accrued.
I thought the remaining charges had been  reasonably applied,  given the amount of 
additional work that the relevant lender had carried out in managing the account  
when payments arrangements hadnt been adhered  to.
OSB replied to say that it accepted my provisional  decision. Ms H and Mr M didnt reply.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, and with no further information  or evidence to consider from either party, I 
see no reason to reach a different conclusion. So this decision confirms the findings and 
settlement I proposed  in my provisional decision,  as Ive summarised above.
my final decision
I uphold Ms H and Mr Ms complaint in part and require OneSavings Bank Plc to reverse  the 
arrears administration  fees applied to the account  in April 2014, May 2014,  June 2014,  
September 2014, April 2015 and October  2015 along with the associated  interest.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms H and Mr M to 
accept or reject my decision  before  10 May 2019.
