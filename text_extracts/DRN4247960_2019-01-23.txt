K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that MEM Consumer Finance Limited (formerly trading as Payday UK) made 
short-term loans to him when it shouldnt have.
background 
Under the rules  by which we are bound, the Financial Ombudsman Service  can only deal 
with complaints against one firm at a time. 
Before 28 February 2015, MEM  Consumer Finance Limited (MCF) traded as Payday UK. 
In 2013 and 2014 Mr S had 4 loans  from MCF.  I will call them loans 1, 2, 3 & 4. Mr S repaid 
them all in 2014.
From 28 February 2015, another  company  (the successor company) traded as Payday UK. 
Between September 2015 and March 2016,  Mr S had 4 loans from the successor company. 
I will call them loans 5, 6, 7 & 8. Mr S repaid loans 5, 6 & 7. But he didnt repay loan 8 in full. 
The successor company  has said there is an outstanding balance of about £650.00.
In 2017, Mr S complained that Payday UK hadnt  checked that he could afford  to repay  the 8 
loans  which he says he couldnt.
our adjudicators opinion
Our adjudicator dealt  with Mr Ss complaint as though he was complaining  about  8 loans 
from MCF trading as Payday UK. He recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in 
part. He thought that Payday UK had been  wrong  to give Mr S loans 3 and 4. The 
adjudicator recommended  that Payday UK should:
1.refund  all interest and charges that Mr S paid on Loans 3 and 4;
2.pay simple  interest of 8% a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
3.remove any negative information  about these loans from Mr Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Payday UK to take off tax from this interest. It 
must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one. 
If Payday  UK intends to apply  the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it 
must do so after deducting  the tax.
By the above  footnote,  the adjudicator implied that Payday UK could use its refund on loans 
3 and 4 towards  repaying the balance  on loan 8.
my (first) provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr S 
and to Payday  UK on 8 November 2018.  I summarise my findings:
Im dealing with a complaint against  MCF not the successor company. But the 
successor company  speaks on behalf  of MCF. 
Ref: DRN42479602I was minded to find it fair and reasonable to order  MCF to refund Mr S each of the 
three amounts of £125.00 (the total of £375.00) he paid in interest on loans 3 and 4.
I was minded to find it fair and reasonable to order  MCF to add interest on each such  
refund at our usual  rate from the date of each payment.
As loans  1-4 and loans  5 -8 are separate chains of loans from separate lenders, I 
wasnt minded to find it fair and reasonable to allow the refund on loans 3 & 4 to be 
applied to repay part of loan 8. 
As I didnt  think MCF  shouldve made  loans  3 and 4, I intended to order  it to remove  
from Mr Ss credit  file any adverse information  relating  to those loans.
Subject to any further information from Mr S or from Payday UK, my (first) provisional  
decision was that I was minded to uphold this complaint in part. I intended to order  MEM 
Consumer Finance Limited  (formerly trading  as Payday UK) to (in relation to its loans to Mr 
S on and after 24 July 2014):
1.refund  Mr S (without deduction  or set-off) each of the 3 amounts of interest  that he 
paid totalling £375.00;
2.pay Mr S simple  interest on each such amount from the date he paid it to the date 
MCF refunds it. If MCF  considers  that its required by HM Revenue  & Customs to 
withhold income tax from that interest,  it should tell Mr S how much  its taken off. It 
should also give Mr S a tax deduction  certificate  if he asks for one, so he can reclaim 
the tax from HM Revenue  & Customs if appropriate;  and
3.remove from Mr Ss credit file any adverse information about those loans.
MCF disagreed with the (first)  provisional decision.  It said in summary, the following:
It had already refunded Mr Ss bank  account  with the full amount of interest on loan 4 
and £40.00 on loan 3 (both with 8% simple interest).
That leaves £85.00 to be refunded with 8% interest of £28.81 less a 20% tax 
deduction of £5.76   a total of £108.05.
Payday UK is still of the opinion that the redress  should be offset  against  the 
outstanding balance (on loan 8). 
There is currently a default  registered on Mr Ss credit  file and the longer the balance  
remains outstanding  the longer this will continue to affect his credit profile.
He is currently making  repayments of around  £2.00 per month; the period  for 
repayments would be shorter against  a reduced balance.
Payday UK will also ensure any adverse data about loans 3 and 4 is removed if 
applicable.
Mr S agreed with the (first) provisional decision. In answer to the adjudicators question 
whether the lender had already refunded £40.00 on loan 3 and about £250.00 on loan 4, Mr 
Ref: DRN42479603S said Payday  UK had not made  any payments to him since  he received  the provisional  
decision. 
my (second) provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a (second) provisional  decision on this complaint 
to Mr S and to MCF on 12 December 2018. I summarise  my findings:
I was satisfied that MCF had already refunded to Mr S the two interest payments of 
£125.00 he paid on loan 4 and its deferral,  with 8% interest. 
I was satisfied that MCF had already refunded (with  8% interest) £40.00 out of the 
£125.00 interest Mr S had paid on loan 3. That leaves a balance of £85.00 (with 8% 
interest). 
Subject to any further information from Mr S or from MCF, my (second) provisional decision  
was that I was minded to uphold this complaint  in part. I intended  to order  MEM Consumer 
Finance Limited  (formerly trading as Payday  UK) to:
1.refund  Mr S (without deduction  or set-off) £85.00 interest  on its 
loan made on or about 24 July 2014  (loan  3); and
2.pay Mr S simple  interest on such amount from the date he paid 
it (22 August 2014) to the date MCF refunds it. If MCF 
considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to 
withhold income tax from that interest,  it should tell Mr S how 
much its taken  off. It should also give Mr S a tax deduction 
certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from 
HM Revenue  & Customs if appropriate;  and
3.remove from Mr Ss credit file any adverse information about 
its loans made on or about 24 July 2014  (loan  3) and 22 
August 2014 (loan 4).
Mr S accepts the (second) provisional  decision  
MCF accepts the (second) provisional  decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im dealing with a complaint against  MCF not the successor company. But the successor 
company speaks on behalf of MCF. 
Before agreeing to lend to Mr S, MCF had to check each time that he could  afford to repay  
the loan. Affordability checks should  be proportionate. Whats  proportionate depends on 
Ref: DRN42479604things like  but not limited  to  the size of the loan repayments and the information MCF 
had about Mr S.
From its records, the MCF  loans to Mr S were as follows:
loan No. loan date loan amount (£) date loan repaid
1 28.12.13    500.00 24.01.14
2 24.01.14    600.00 02.06.14
3 24.07.14    500.00 22.08.14
4 22.08.14    500.00 24.10.14
Before loan 1, Payday  UK recorded  Mr Ss net monthly income as £1,500.00. 
Loan 1 was going to require a repayment of about £625.00. That was almost  half Mr Ss net 
monthly income. So I think that proportionate  checks wouldve been more  than asking Mr S 
his normal monthly income,  monthly living costs and regular financial commitments.  I think 
proportionate checks wouldve  included asking Mr S about his short-term  financial 
commitments as well.
Mr S repaid  loan 1 within time. But I think that, after loan 1, MCF shouldve maintained the 
same level of checks for loan 2.
Before loan 2, MCF  recorded Mr Ss net monthly  income as £1,700.00.  
Theres not enough evidence that MCF  asked  Mr S about his short-term  financial  
commitments before  loans 1 and 2. So Im not satisfied that it did proportionate checks.
Therefore Ive thought about  whats likely to have happened  if MCF  had done such checks. 
From what  Ive seen, Mr S had no other outstanding short- term borrowing when he applied  
for loan 1. And when he applied for loan 2, his other outstanding short-term borrowing was 
only about £160.00. 
So I think that proportionate checks (including  on his short-term financial commitments) 
before loans 1 & 2 wouldnt have shown  MCF  that Mr S couldnt afford repayment of those 
loans. In other words,  I dont think MCFs  failure to do proportionate checks led it to make  
loans 1 & 2.
From the dates and the transaction summary,  I think Mr S deferred repayment  of loan 2. 
After he repaid it, a couple of months  went by before loan 3. That was going to require 
repayment of about  £625.00.  That was a significant proportion  of Mr Ss recorded net 
monthly income of £1,700.00. And MCF shouldve seen  that hed struggled to repay  loan 2.
So I think that  before loan 3  proportionate checks  wouldve been enough checks to get a 
full picture of Mr Ss financial  circumstances.  That mightve included  asking him for copies of 
documents such as payslips, bills and bank  statements.
Mr S repaid  loan 3 on time. But he straightaway asked for loan 4. So I think that after loan 3, 
MCF shouldve maintained the same  level of checks for loan 4.
Before loan 4, MCF  recorded Mr Ss net monthly  income as £1,700.00.  
Ref: DRN42479605Theres not enough evidence that - before loans 3 & 4 - MCF  did enough checks to get a full 
picture of Mr Ss financial  circumstances. So Im not satisfied that it did proportionate checks.
Therefore Ive thought about  whats likely to have happened  if MCF  had done such checks at 
that time.  I think MCF wouldve seen what Ive seen.  In addition  to normal monthly living 
costs and regular  financial commitments  - Mr S was losing hundreds of pounds  each month  
on gambling. So he couldnt afford  to repay  loans  3 & 4 in a sustainable way  that is without 
further short-term borrowing.
I find that if it had done proportionate checks before loans 3 and 4 MCF  wouldnt have made 
those loans.
But MCF  did make loans 3 and 4. And Mr S paid interest on them. I find that his interest 
payments were as follows:
loan 3 interest payment  22.08.14 £125.00
loan 4 interest payment (deferral) 24.09.14 £125.00
loan 4 interest payment 24.10.14 £125.00
total £375.00
So I find it fair and reasonable for MCF to refund Mr S each of the three payments of 
£125.00 (the total of £375.00) he paid on loans 3 and 4, with simple interest at our usual  
yearly rate of 8% on each such amount from the date Mr S paid it to the date of  MCFs 
refund of it. 
Loans 5, 6, 7 & 8 werent  made  by MCF   they were made  by the successor  company. So 
Im not going  to make any findings  in this decision about whether the successor company 
shouldve made  those loans. By way of background I think they were as follows:
loan No. loan date loan amount (£) date loan repaid
5 18.09.15    930.00 10.12.15
6 25.12.15 1,000.00 30.01.16
7 09.02.16 1,000.00 23.02.16
8 06.03.16 1,000.00 not yet
So, after he repaid loan 4, there was a gap of nearly  a year before Mr S took loan 5. 
The successor company  sent us a file in June 2018.  It contained  a document labelled  RRP 
(Regulatory Repair Programme).  But it was only in response to the (first)  provisional decision 
that the successor company said that this document is evidence  that on about 3 May 2016 it 
made a redress payment  into Mr Ss bank account. That was for refunds of interest  he had 
paid on loans 3 and 4.
In the case of loan 3 the refund was of £40.00 out of the £125.00 interest Mr S had paid. 
And to the £40.00 the company  added 8% interest  of £5.69. 
In the case of loan 4 and the deferral of that loan,  the refund  was of the total of the two 
amounts of £125.00  interest Mr S had paid. And the company added 8% interest  of £16.86  
on the first amount  and £16.04 on the second amount.
Ref: DRN42479606The total refund was therefore £328.59. And Mr S had already sent us a copy of a bank 
statement which shows that he received that refund on 5 May 2016.
Ive found it fair and reasonable  for MCF to refund Mr S each of the three  interest payments 
of £125.00 (the total of £375.00) he paid on loans  3 and 4, with simple  interest  at our usual 
yearly rate of 8% on each such amount of £125.00  from the date Mr S paid it to the date of 
MCFs refund of it.
Im satisfied that MCF has already refunded to Mr S the two interest  payments of £125.00  he 
paid on loan 4 and its deferral, with 8% interest. 
And Im satisfied that MCF  has already refunded (with 8% interest)  £40.00 out of the 
£125.00 interest Mr S had paid on loan 3. That leaves a balance of £85.00 (with 8% 
interest). 
Therefore I find it fair and reasonable  to order MCF to refund  £85.00  plus interest  at our 
usual rate of 8%.
The successor company  says theres  a balance  outstanding on loan 8. And it says that 
balance is about  £650.00. Thats a lot more than the £85.00  plus interest I will order MCF  to 
pay Mr S. So I have  to consider whether  its fair and reasonable to allow  MCF to apply its 
refund to settle  the outstanding balance  rather than paying  the refund to Mr S. 
As loans  1-4 and loans  5 -8 are separate chains of loans from separate lenders, I dont find it 
fair and reasonable to allow the refund  on loan 3 to be applied  to repay part of loan 8. 
As I dont think MCF  shouldve made  loans  3 and 4, I will order it to remove from Mr Ss 
credit file any adverse  information relating to those loans.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct MEM Consumer Finance Limited (formerly trading as Payday UK) to:
1.refund  Mr S (without deduction  or set-off) £85.00 interest  on its loan made  on or 
about 24 July 2014 (loan 3); and
2.pay Mr S simple  interest at a yearly rate of 8% on such  amount from the date he paid 
it (22 August 2014) to the date MCF refunds it. If MCF considers that its required by 
HM Revenue  & Customs to withhold income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr S 
how much  its taken  off. It should  also give Mr S a tax deduction certificate  if he asks 
for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate; and
3.remove from Mr Ss credit file any adverse information about its loans made on or 
about 24 July 2014 (loan 3) and 22 August  2014 (loan 4).
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 February  2019.
