DRN-1490420
The complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) wont refund the cost of some 
counterfeit golf clubs he purchased.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The PayPal Buyer Protection terms explain that it isnt a warranty and doesnt 
guarantee a refund once a dispute has been raised. The terms form part of Mr S 
agreement to use PayPals services.  
PayPals response to Mr S says the condition of the golf clubs was used which meant 
it wasnt willing to approve a refund. 
The terms say PayPal has sole discretion when deciding the outcome of a dispute. 
Ive noted everything Mr S said in response to our investigator but the terms here 
advise PayPal will have the final say. 
I havent found that PayPal made a mistake when it decided to decline his refund 
request  it was entitled to take that decision. As a result, Im not telling PayPal to 
take any further action. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 May 2020.
