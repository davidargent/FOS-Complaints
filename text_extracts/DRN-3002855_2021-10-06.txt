The complaint
Mr B complains that TransUnion International UK Limited included information on his credit 
file about a third-party. Mr B wants TransUnion to remove the data not belonging to him.
What happened
Mr B noticed information relating to a third-party on his credit file. After complaining to 
TransUnion, it removed most but not all the third-party data. Mr B pointed this out to 
TransUnion but didnt receive a reply, so he came to this service for help.
The investigator recommended that Mr Bs complaint be upheld and asked TransUnion to 
remove two searches carried out in the name of the third-party which appear to relate to    
Mr Bs brother. 
Mr B accepted the investigators recommendation, but TransUnion hasnt responded to say 
that it will remove the searches, so the complaint has come to me for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand that ideally Mr B would have liked TransUnion to investigate how the third-party 
data came to appear on his credit file. Particularly as hes anxious to avoid something like 
this happening again. I appreciate Mr Bs concerns about his credit report but as the 
investigator explained  this service doesnt regulate or supervise the businesses that we 
cover. If Mr B isnt happy with TransUnions explanation of why the problem happened, it 
would be for the regulator - the Information Commissioners Office to investigate further.
I dont think theres any dispute that TransUnion made a mistake as part of its data matching 
process. I assume this is likely to have happened because Mr B shares the same surname 
as the third-party. My decision will focus on whether TransUnion should do more than it has 
already done to put things right.
As I dont have any evidence to suggest that Mr B lost out financially as a result of the data 
matching problem, I dont require TransUnion to pay compensation. But I agree with the 
investigator that TransUnion should remove the two insurance searches in the third-partys 
name. The surname on the searches is the same as Mr B, but the address, first name and 
date of birth are different. It appears the information appeared on Mr Bs credit file as a result 
of the same data matching problem that TransUnion said it had fixed in early 2021. 
It seems fair that TransUnion should take steps to make sure that the searches are removed 
as they dont have anything to do with Mr B. 
Putting things right
TransUnion International UK Limited should amend Mr Bs credit file to remove the two 
insurance searches carried out in the name of the third-party.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint and direct TransUnion International UK Limited 
to take the step outlined above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 November 2021.
