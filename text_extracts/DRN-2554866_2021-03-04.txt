The complaint
Mr R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) gave him poor service.
What happened
Mr R had a loan from NatWest. In March 2020, a repayment deferral of three payments was 
agreed. A direct debit for one payment was claimed in that time. Mr R closed the loan 
account in October 2020.
Mr R complained about many things that happened. He contacted NatWest about the 
problem with the loan payments and wasnt called back as promised. Other call backs that 
were promised werent honoured. He was given an incorrect number to call. He was given 
conflicting and incorrect information about his loan agreement. In July 2020, NatWest called 
Mr R to request a manual payment to his loan  without contacting him in writing about the 
end of his payment holiday. The direct debit to his loan was stopped in error. And in their 
final response letter dated 6 July 2020, NatWest said this behaviour and language on a call 
was inappropriate  he said this wasnt the case. Overall, Mr R said he felt intimidated and 
threatened by NatWest.
NatWest admitted  in an email dated 23 July 2020 and their final responses dated 30 June 
2020 and 6 July 2020  that their service had fallen short on many occasions. They 
apologised to Mr Rs about his various complaints. On the issue of Mr Rs alleged 
inappropriate language, theyd listened to the calls hed made and couldnt find evidence of 
this behaviour. For this they paid compensation of £150. Including this, they paid total 
compensation of £785.68.  
Mr R brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator agreed there had been a 
catalogue of errors by NatWest. She listed the various issues that had arisen. Mr Rs main 
complaints arose when a direct debit payment was made to his loan  even though a 
payment holiday had been agreed. And then NatWest contacted him and asked for a manual 
payment to be made, without writing to him first. For this, they paid compensation of £255.68 
(the amount of the loan payment). There were further issues with the loan account direct 
debits  and compensation of £290 was paid for those. Calls werent returned  
compensation of £90 was paid. And NatWest said they couldnt say that Mr R did use 
inappropriate language on calls  and paid £150. Total compensation of £785.68 had been 
paid. She felt that NatWest had dealt with Mr Rs complaints and that the compensation paid 
for their various errors was right.
Mr R asked that his complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I want to say that Ive read Mr Rs file in depth and listened to the calls where they were 
available. Mr R feels aggrieved at the poor service he received from NatWest. Hed agreed a 
three-month payment holiday on his loan account from March 2020  and all the various 
problems stemmed from what happened with that. NatWest made many errors  all of which 
they admitted to and apologised to Mr R. As our investigator said  these can be 
summarised as:
Loan account direct debit errors: £290 compensation paid
Calls not returned as promised: £90 compensation paid
Loan account payment taken manually without writing to Mr R: £255.68 
compensation paid
Error in saying Mr R had used inappropriate language: £150 compensation paid.
I dont propose to go into each issue separately  I can see that Mr R accepted the 
compensation and apologies from NatWest in his reply to their email dated 23 July 2020.
But  I think Mr Rs outstanding issue is that overall  he feels intimidated by what happened 
and in particular, by NatWests letter dated 6 July 2020 when they said hed used 
inappropriate language on calls to them. We asked NatWest about this and asked for the 
calls in question. They couldnt locate them. I listened to one call and while Mr R was 
frustrated, he didnt use bad language or behave inappropriately. To be fair, NatWest later 
retracted what theyd said in their letter  and apologised and paid further compensation of 
£150. On this issue, I think NatWest did what they needed to do.
What Ive seen here is a catalogue of errors by NatWest  all of which compounded each 
other and led to more problems. And Mr R was unfortunately on the receiving end of all of 
that. But to be fair to NatWest, theyve apologised at every stage  and paid a significant 
amount of compensation of £785.68 for their errors. This is in line with what we would expect 
to see for what happened here. So, I wont be asking them to do anymore here.
I can sense from Mr Rs correspondence with us and NatWest that he wont be happy with 
this outcome. But  if I may say  Id advise him to put the whole episode behind him  
rather than remaining frustrated at what happened. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 April 2021.
