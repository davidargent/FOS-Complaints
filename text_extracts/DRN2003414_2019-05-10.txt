Mr W says CashEuroNet UK LLC (Quick Quid) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 26 April 2019. Ive attached a copy of my 
provisional decision and it forms part of this decision.
Mr Ws representative said they had no further  comments to make. Quick Quid  responded 
with a number  of points, including the following:
As Mr W was able to repay  all of his loans early, didnt incur any late payment fees 
and had breaks of borrowing of up to 41 days between  loans,  this suggests that 
Mr W was not struggling to repay his loans.
Mr W didnt  declare  that he had any other credit  commitments  and Quick Quid 
wasnt aware of Mr W having any other  credit  commitments.
Mr W applied  for loans to be repaid over multiple pay periods, so in essence says 
Mr W wouldve  been able to save up his money over the course of the loan to repay 
the larger final repayment. 
Because of the above, Quick  Quid doesnt agree that it lent irresponsibly and that it 
carried out proportionate checks to ensure that Mr W could afford to repay the loans.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. And Ive used this approach to help decide what  to do 
about Mr Ws complaint. 
Although Mr W did repay loans early and didnt incur late payment fees, this on its own 
doesnt necessarily  mean  that Mr W was able to repay the loans sustainably  which  is what 
the rules on lending at the time required,  for the lending to be responsible.  And given that the 
final repayment on loan 3b of £673.20 took up nearly all of Mr Ws disposable  income, I dont 
think agreeing  this additional  borrowing of £200  only 3 days after hed borrowed £300 - 
was responsible.
Quick Quid said that there  were  gaps between Mr W repaying loans and borrowing again. Id 
like to reassure Quick  Quid  that Ive looked  closely at the gaps between  all of the loans. And 
I can see that after loan 3b was repaid, there  was a gap of around six months before Mr W 
borrowed again. And because of this I have taken the view that Quick Quid could essentially 
treat loan 4 as fresh borrowing  rather than a continuation of previous  borrowing.  
However, I note that from loan 9 onwards the gaps between loans were short  and as I 
explained in my provisional decision,  I think Quick Quid shouldve realised that by loan 9 
Mr W was no longer  relying on high cost short-term loans as they were intended to be used. 
Instead it was clear by that stage that he was essentially stuck in a cycle of borrowing 
frequently over a long period of time at very high interest rates  and therefore  I dont think  it 
was responsible that Quick Quid continued  to lend to Mr W from that point onwards. 
Ref: DRN20034142Finally, Ive considered  Quick Quids point that Mr W couldve saved up his disposable 
income to be able to afford the final larger loan repayment. I think its important to remember 
that for a loan to be repayable in a sustainable manner, a borrower should be able to make  
repayments on time throughout the term of the loan. But the fact that Mr W was, more often 
than not, borrowing further amounts before hed even repaid the initial amount borrowed, 
suggests that he was in no position to save up his disposable income  to repay  the larger 
final loan repayment,  in a sustainable manner.
Therefore, having  considered what Quick Quid has said, my thoughts on Mr Ws complaint 
remain the same and I think that loans 3b and loan 9 onwards shouldnt  have been lent.
putting things right  what Quick Quid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loan 3b and loans 9 and onwards
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 3b from Mr Ws credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 9 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 9 onwards should be removed from 
Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest.  Quick Quid  must give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
Because of the reasons  given above and in my provisional decision, I uphold  this complaint 
in part and require CashEuroNet UK LLC to do what I have said above to put matters right.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 June  2019.

Ref: DRN20034144Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ws complaint and thought loans 3b and 9b shouldnt  have been given. 
Quick Quid  disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  And 
Ive used this approach to help decide what to do about Mr Ws complaint.  
Having done so, I currently think  that the complaint should be upheld in part. I will explain why. 
Quick Quid  needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr W could  repay  the loans 
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Quick Quid should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Quick  Quid was required to establish whether 
Mr W could  sustainably  repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being  without undue  
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting  
other reasonable  commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. And it 
follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont 
be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments 
without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
As our adjudicator  explained, a proportionate check for loan 3b would most likely have shown that Mr 
W had other short term commitments with other lenders. And not only was it the fourth advance in 
around 5 weeks but the repayment was going  to take a significant proportion  of Mr Ws declared  
income and the final payment of £673.20  was going to take up virtually all of Mr Ws monthly 
disposable income.  So had Quick Quid  been aware  of those short term commitments, it wouldve 
seen that Mr W didnt  have enough disposable income to sustainably repay  loan 3b when it was due 
for repayment.
Ref: DRN20034145Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Quick Quids lending history with Mr W, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point at which Quick Quid should reasonably have seen that further lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Quick Quid should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further  loans. 
It looks like there was a gap in Mr Ws borrowing from Quick Quid after loan 3b of around 6 months.  
However, it seems  that Mr W then continued  to borrow frequently from July 2016 onwards.  And 
looking at Mr Ws borrowing  history, I can see that by loan 9 hed had 8 advances  between  June  and 
December 2016  all of which had been multiple  repayment loans.
So given the particular circumstances  of Mr Ws case, I think that Quick Quid should  reasonably  have 
seen that further lending was unsustainable by loan 9. I say this because:
The amount borrowed was higher  than the typical amount Mr W had previously  borrowed 
from Quick Quid.
From loan 9 onwards  Mr W was provided  with new loans within  weeks, and often  days, of 
settling a previous one. So Quick Quid ought to have  realised upon each loan application that 
Mr W was more likely than not having to borrow further amounts  to cover  the hole that 
repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ws indebtedness was 
unsustainable.
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads  to the amount  he owed Quick Quid. For example, Loan 
15 was taken out 21 months after Mr Ws first loan and the amounts he was borrowing  
werent necessarily decreasing over time either. So Mr W had paid large amounts of interest 
to, in effect, service  a debt to Quick Quid over an extended period of time.
I think  that Mr W lost out because Quick Quid  continued to provide borrowing  from loan 9 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number of loans was likely  to have had negative implications on Mr Ws ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So Im also intending to uphold the complaint about loans  9 onwards and Quick Quid  should  put 
things right.
putting things  right  what Quick  Quid needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr W paid on loan 3b and loans 9 and onwards
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loan 3b from Mr Ws credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 9 onwards means any information  recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  loans 9 onwards should be removed from Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest.  Quick Quid  must give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
