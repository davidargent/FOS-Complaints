Our adjudicator considered Mr Bs complaint  and recommended it be upheld  in part. He 
thought that Mr B had shown signs of financial difficulty in repaying loan 2, which was repaid 
about eight weeks  later than scheduled.  So, having  considered the lending history  up to 
July 2016, the adjudicator didnt think loan 3, or any subsequent  loan, shouldve  been 
approved.
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending  including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. QuickQuid  needed 
to take reasonable steps to ensure  it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, this means  it 
should have carried  out proportionate  checks to make sure Mr B could repay his loans in a 
sustainable manner.  Additionally, there may come a point where  pattern  of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances  of this particular  complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same  reasons.
Ref: DRN11497132Looking at how Mr B managed loan 2, in particularly  the delayed settlement, I think 
QuickQuid shouldve realised Mr B was likely to be experiencing financial difficulty. Loan 2 
was originally scheduled to be repaid in May 2016 but wasnt repaid until July  about  two 
months late. Although Mr B had declared income  of around £1,700 it seems that he was 
unable to repay a loan which had a largest payment  of just £174 on time. He ultimately 
required a total of three months to repay QuickQuid a total of £170  (which was only about 
3% of his declared  income across that period). So, despite the loan being  a small 
percentage of his income, he had to extend  it significantly. In my view, this means  it was 
likely QuickQuid didnt have a clear picture of Mr Bs circumstances and proportionate 
checks for any potential loan (if taken  shortly after loan 2) would include it obtaining a clearer  
picture of Mr Bs income and expenditure. This didnt  happen,  as the checks QuickQuid 
carried out for loan 3 were no different than for loan 2.
Having repaid QuickQuid on 15 July 2016,  Mr B borrowed  loan 3 just 15 days later  and 
asked for three times as much as loan 2. From  what Ive seen (from the credit  report  he 
provided), Mr B already  owed other  short-term  lenders around £640  at this time.  QuickQuid  
says its own credit checks showed Mr B actually  had total credit  commitments of £981.  So 
Mr Bs existing  credit commitments  were  already  38%-58% of his declared income, 
depending on whose  figures I use. Wherever in that range Mr Bs commitments fell, it was a 
substantial portion of his income to be committed solely to repaying credit   to the extent that 
I think hed likely struggle  to repay any additional loans sustainably. I note that this is borne 
out by the way in which  Mr B managed loan 3  which, like loan 2 was repaid  later than 
originally scheduled.
Ive not seen that there was a real break in the borrowing  after loan 3. Mr B continued to 
borrow in a way which suggested repaying loans was leaving  a hole in his finances which  
caused him to have  to borrow again and meant his indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably. By the time of his final QuickQuid loan, QuickQuids credit  checks continued 
to show Mr B had a high level of overall  indebtedness, with monthly credit commitments  (not 
including his QuickQuid  loans) of £985  about  half his declared income.
Because QuickQuid  continually  lent to Mr B without significant breaks  between  the loans, he 
wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed it. Loan 9 was taken out 30 months 
after Mr Bs first loan and was for a larger amount. So Mr B had paid large  amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to QuickQuid over an extended period.
I think that Mr B lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 3 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time
the number  of loans and deferrals  was likely to have had negative  implications on
Mr Bs ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans
QuickQuid made a number of points in response  to the adjudicator.  For example, it says it 
lent responsibly from March 2015  and provided  information about its general lending  
process. But, it hasnt explained why this applies specifically  in Mr Bs case. It also says 
Mr B ought  to have  saved  to meet his repayments for loan 3. But, the lending  relationship  
(particularly the conduct of loan 2) showed  this wasnt  a reasonable basis  on which  to make 
Ref: DRN11497133a lending decision. So these points dont change  my decision.  And Im therefore  upholding  
the complaint  about loans 3 to 9.
Putting things  right  what  QuickQuid needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 3 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove all entries about  loans 3 to 9 from Mr Bs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr B a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Bs complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps  
set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 August 2019.
