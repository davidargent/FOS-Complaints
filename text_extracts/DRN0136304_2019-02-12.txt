K821x#15complaint
Mr W says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  my provisional  decision on this complaint  on 12 March  2019. A copy of it 
is attached and it forms part of this final decision.  The full background to the complaint is set 
out in it, so I wont reiterate that here.
I explained why I was planning  to uphold the complaint and asked QuickQuid and Mr W for 
their comments. Mr W said he was happy with the outcome. QuickQuid didnt accept it, 
saying:
I had said that, the number of instances of lending, in and of itself, is evidence that a 
borrower is reliant on High-Cost  Short  Term  (HCST) lending  and therefore such  
lending is unsustainable.
I had therefore  suggested that CONC restricts lending to a specific number of loans 
to a consumer, which  it does not, and after which  point any subsequent lending  is de 
facto unsustainable. [My] view effectively  constitutes unauthorised rulemaking.
Consequently, if [I] conclude that QuickQuid breached CONC 5.3.1(6)  by providing 
unsustainable loans  to Mr [W], then it is incumbent upon [me] to demonstrate how.  
The mere number  of loans is an insufficient basis to conclude  the loans were in fact 
unsustainable.
Ive considered the points made  my QuickQuid and set out my findings below.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
I have to say Im disappointed  by QuickQuids response  which  focuses almost exclusively 
on the Financial Conduct  Authoritys (FCA) Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC). 
QuickQuid wasnt subject  to FCA regulation   and by extension CONC  until April 2014,  
which is some three years  after the last loan it approved for Mr W. CONC therefore  isnt 
directly relevant to Mr Ws complaint and I did not conclude  QuickQuid breached  CONC.
I do however acknowledge there is overlap  between  CONC and the ILG. CONC at times 
specifically refers back to the ILG. For example,  CONC 5.3.1(6), cited  by QuickQuid, refers 
back to paragraphs  4.3 and 4.4 of the ILG and the definition  of sustainability is similar.
Id also add that it is not my role to determine whether theres been a technical  breach of any 
particular rule. I take regulation into account.  But DISP 3.6.1R says, The Ombudsman will 
determine a complaint by reference  to what is, in his opinion, fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of the case. Thats what Ive done here.
Id now like to directly  address QuickQuids  point that the number of loans isnt in itself a 
relevant factor.  ILG, at paragraph 6.25, says the following is likely to be a deceptive or unfair 
practice:
Ref: DRN01363042Repeatedly refinancing (or 'rolling over') a borrower's existing credit commitment  for a short-
term credit  product in a way that is unsustainable  or otherwise harmful.
It then goes on to say:
The OFT considers  that this would include a creditor allowing a borrower  to sequentially 
enter into a number of separate  agreements  for short-term loan products, one after another,  
where the overall effect is to increase  the borrower's indebtedness in an unsustainable  
manner.

The purpose of payday loans is to act as a short-term solution to temporary  cash  flow 
problems experienced by consumers. They are not appropriate for supporting  sustained  
borrowing over longer periods, for which  other products are likely  to be more  suitable.
So relevant  guidance at the time indicated that allowing a creditor to sequentially enter into a 
number of loans,  one after the other, was potentially unfair.  The ILG also stated that payday 
loans were not generally suitable for long-term  borrowing.  I therefore  think its perfectly 
reasonable to conclude  that the number of loans and/or  the length of a chain of borrowing 
are relevant  factors to be taken into account.  And I dont think QuickQuid  is acting fairly  
when disregarding these as relevant factors.
But this was not the only factor I took into account  in my provisional  decision. I also took into 
account the repayment difficulties Mr W had experienced when repaying loans 1-3  the 
loans were extended so many  times  that these three loans alone ran for about a year.
I also noted that Mr W had actually contacted QuickQuid after loan 3, explaining to it in 
April 2010 that he was struggling  to afford  a repayment. QuickQuid hasnt addressed  this 
point at all.
I would also like to highlight that the approach Ive taken is consistent with both DISP  3.6.1R  
and previous decisions from this service1, which QuickQuid will be familiar with and ought to 
take into account.2
Overall, I dont  think that QuickQuid really  engaged  with any of the points made  in my 
provisional decision. And so its response has not changed my provisional findings. My final 
decision is that I uphold  the complaint, for the reasons given above and in my provisional 
decision.

Ref: DRN01363043what QuickQuid  needs to do to put things right
QuickQuid should:
refund  the interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 4-9
add interest at 8% simple per year to the refund, from when the interest and charges 
were paid (if they were) until the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  loans 4-9 from Mr Ws credit history
I now understand loan 9 was passed  to a third party, which could  mean QuickQuid will need 
to take different steps to those set out above.  
QuickQuid will need to ensure that Mr W is in the same financial position hed be in as if the 
repayment for loan 9 was capped at the principal amount of £550. And if hes already paid 
more than this, it will have  to refund the overpayments with interest as set out above.  If Mr W 
has paid less than the principal, QuickQuid  can only offset what  Mr W still owes it from his 
redress if it buys back the debt.
If QuickQuid cant buy back the debt, it could:
(a)make  a payment  to the debt owner  which has the effect of removing any interest  
included on the loan; or
(b)pay the amount  in (a) directly to Mr W. If QuickQuid does this, it will be up to Mr W to 
pay (a) to the debt owner. He will also have to make any principal payment still due.
Whatever steps QuickQuid takes, it will need to explain  this clearly to Mr W. QuickQuid will 
also have to liaise with the debt owner to arrange  for the removal  of any adverse information 
it recorded about loan 9. Although it may well be, given the time thats passed, the 
information is no longer reported to credit reference agencies  anyway.
HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right put taking the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 March  2019.

background
QuickQuid approved nine loans for Mr W. Only loans  4-9 form part of the complaint  as Mr W withdrew 
his complaint about the first three loans. As loans 1-3 still form part of the lending history,  I may refer 
to them at times.

my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive taken into account the law, good industry  practice and any 
relevant regulations at the time.
Relevant regulation (as of March 2010)  included  the Office of Fair Tradings (OFT) guidance  on 
irresponsible lending (ILG). The ILG made it clear lenders had a duty to lend responsibly  this 
included undertaking proportionate affordability checks to ensure customers  could  repay  loans 
sustainably. The definition of a sustainable repayment included that payments should be made from 
income and/or savings,  without undue difficulty and while meeting other reasonable commitments. 
Theres no prescriptive  list of the sort of checks a lender should carry out, but the guidance says 
lenders may wish to take into account factors such as the type of credit,  a customers credit history 
and their existing financial commitments.
With this in mind, Ive considered whether  QuickQuid  acted fairly when  it approved loans 4-9.
QuickQuid has provided some evidence  of the checks it undertook before lending. These included 
carrying out credit checks (although I havent seen the full results of these) and asking Mr W about  his 
income, employment and residential  status. It seems  Mr W declared that he was employed, his net 
income was £2,200 a month and that he rented.
In the circumstances of loans 4-9, I dont think QuickQuid did enough to check  whether  the loans 
were sustainably  affordable.  The loans Mr W was taking out were  intended for short term use, but by 
April 2010 hed been indebted to QuickQuid without break for about  a year.  And during that year, hed 
demonstrated difficulties  paying back his loans on time.  Loans 1-3 were all subject to extensions, 
meaning Mr W would have  paid back much more in interest than originally  intended. The gaps 
between the loans up to and including  loan 4 were only a matter of days, suggesting  Mr W was 
potentially reliant on this type of credit and/or was struggling to repay  the debts  whilst also meeting his 
other commitments.
Ref: DRN01363045So I think QuickQuid ought to have realised, from the pattern of borrowing and repeated repayment 
extensions, that there were  signs Mr W was experiencing financial difficulty  by the time he asked for 
loan 4.
At this point Id usually go on to consider  what proportionate checks wouldve  looked like and what 
they wouldve likely shown. But I dont  think thats necessary in Mr Ws case. Ill explain why.
Ive already explained that QuickQuid ought to have taken into account  that Mr W wasnt able to repay  
any of his first three loans within the original agreements. Ive also noted  that Mr W actually contacted 
QuickQuid about struggling to afford the repayment for loan 3. In an email of 11 April 2010 he said he 
wanted to complain about  a late payment charge  and that he had tried to tell QuickQuid in the week 
before the loan was due that he couldnt  afford  the repayment. In the email Mr W says he was told 
QuickQuid wouldnt help him until the due date. So as well as the pattern  of borrowing, Mr W had 
actually been in touch  with QuickQuid and had mentioned  having difficulties  with his repayments   
specifically saying that he couldnt  afford them.
Mr W then asked for loan 4 only 11 days after repaying  loan 3  a loan he told QuickQuid hed 
struggled to repay.  I think  by this time QuickQuid was on notice that Mr W was in financial difficulty  
and that further loans were therefore not appropriate. The loans extensions  and contact from Mr W, in 
my view, suggested  that loans  1-3 had not been repaid without undue difficulty. The year-long length 
of the lending relationship up to this point reinforces my view that Mr W was struggling with his 
finances.
That Mr W was likely  to be in financial difficulty is borne out by the way he continued to borrow. There 
were no, or just minimal, gaps between loans 4-9. And the amounts he was borrowing each month 
were on an upwards trend. In April 2010 he borrowed  £500, then £550 in June,  £950 in July and 
finally £1,200 in December.  This sort of pattern  reinforces  my view that Mr W wasnt sustainably 
clearing his debts, so was borrowing further funds when left with a shortfall. 
Had QuickQuid looked further in to the reasons why, I think (from  his bank statements) its likely  it 
wouldve seen Mr W was heavily indebted to a number of other lenders. But I dont think  QuickQuid 
actually needed  to do this to realise  Mr W was in financial difficulty. I think the pattern of lending  and 
the contact  from him ought to have been enough on its own for QuickQuid to realise  this.
Overall, I dont think QuickQuid acted fairly when  it approved  loans 4-9. So Im planning to uphold 
Mr Ws complaint.
what QuickQuid needs  to do to put things  right
I plan to say QuickQuid should:
refund the interest and charges Mr W paid on loans  4-9
add interest at 8% simple per year to the refund,  from when the interest and charges were 
paid (if they were) until the date of settlement
remove any adverse  information about loans 4-9 from Mr Ws credit history
Id be grateful if when responding to this decision  QuickQuid  could confirm  the current status of loan 
9. If it has still not been repaid, or has been sold, this will need  to be taken  into account if my final 
decision is the same as my provisional  decision.  
my provisional  decision
I plan to uphold this complaint in part and to tell CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right as set out 
above.
