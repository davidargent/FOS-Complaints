The complaint
Ms S complains about Lloyds Bank PLC holding her liable for transactions she says she 
didnt authorise.
What happened
In August 2019, a series of transactions were made from Ms Ss account which she says 
she didnt make. She said she received a suspicious phone call from who she thought was 
Lloyds telling her that her card had been blocked. And around the same time, she received 
an email stating her TV licence direct debit had been cancelled  so she followed the link 
and entered her card details to reset her direct debit. Around a week later she received a 
text message from Lloyds stating her online banking had been changed. At this point, Ms S 
called Lloyds and she found out her account had been used and money had been taken. 
Lloyds held Ms S liable for the fraud. They said they didnt know how a fraudster would have 
got hold of her bank details and so there hadnt been a point of compromise. Ms S remained 
unhappy and brought the complaint to our service.
Our investigator didnt uphold it. She confirmed that Ms S hadnt given her card to anybody 
and hadnt shared her PIN so she couldnt find a reasonable explanation as to how the 
physical card was used if it wasnt Ms S or somebody with her permission. Our investigator 
also said Ms S checked her balance on 12 August and 13 August but didnt report the fraud 
until 14 August.
Ms S responded to our investigator and queried the transactions in dispute, as some differed 
from her account statement. She also admitted to making a couple of the payments in 
question herself. Ms S also pointed out that the evidence she has shows a point of sale 
transaction  which could have been contactless rather than chip and PIN.  Ms S has also 
since provided our service with a text message to show that Android pay had been 
successfully set up on her phone  from the same number relating to the online banking 
being changed. Ms S confirmed she thought she did report the fraud prior to 14 August but 
learned that the messages she was receiving werent from the genuine Lloyds  which they 
confirmed during the phone call on 14 August 2019.
Our investigator asked Lloyds for further evidence and Lloyds confirmed they werent able to 
show the location of the payments or how they were made. Our investigator remained of the 
opinion that Ms S should be held liable. As a decision couldnt be reached, the complaint 
was passed to me to review. 
In September 2022, I issued a provisional decision. In it, I said;
Where there is a dispute about what happened, as there is in this case, I have to base my 
decision on the balance of probabilities. In other words, on what I consider is most likely to 
have happened in the light of the evidence that is available.
The relevant law surrounding authorisations are the Payment Service Regulations 2017 and 
the Consumer Credit Act 1974. The basic position is that Lloyds can hold Ms S liable for the 
disputed payments if the evidence suggests that its more likely than not that she made them 
or authorised them. If Ms S made the disputed transactions herself, it wouldnt be fair to ask 
Lloyds to refund them. But Ms S says she wasnt responsible for the payments in dispute. 
So, the key question for me to consider is whether Lloyds has provided enough evidence to 
hold Ms S responsible. Unless Lloyds can show that consent has been given, they have no 
authority to make the payments or to debit Ms Ss account and any such transaction must be 
regarded as unauthorised. 
Firstly, the technical evidence Lloyds has provided in relation to the payments which were 
made differs from the statement Ms S has provided. As it was up to Ms S to dispute the 
payments, I have based my findings on the statement provided to her by Lloyds. Ms S has 
admitted to some payments between the dates in question were made by herself, and 
therefore there is £583.49 worth of disputed transactions outstanding. I have detailed the 
disputed transactions below for the benefit of both parties.

The transfers from savings to current account 
I appreciate I havent included the online transfers from Ms Ss saving account to her current 
account in the table above despite her disputing them. Im satisfied based on the evidence, 
that these transfers were made using online banking. Ms S has confirmed she didnt share 
any personal details with anybody  and I take that to also mean her user ID number, 
password, and memorable information for online banking. Ive thought carefully about the 
scam call Ms S says she received, but I havent seen anything in Ms Ss testimony to 
confirm she shared these details. And even if she had, she is responsible to keep her 
security details safe. So, if she had shared them, I still couldnt hold Lloyds responsible for 
these transfers. Therefore, I cant reasonably uphold this part of the complaint and therefore 
dont consider these transfers to be unauthorised. 
The point of sale transactionsLloyds has provided evidence and their own testimony to say the genuine card and PIN were 
used for the transactions. Of course, if this was certainly the case, Id find it reasonable 
enough to hold Ms S liable for the transactions. I say that because, Ms S says her card was 
always in her possession and she hadnt shared her PIN details with anybody. Shes also 
admitted to making transactions in between the disputed payments, and therefore I would 
find no other explanation to persuade me that Ms S wasnt at least involved in the 
transactions in question.
However, Lloyds havent been able to provide sufficient evidence to show the genuine card 
and PIN were used for the transactions. Ms S has rightly pointed out that a point of sale 
transaction could mean the payment was made through contactless, or another method  
such as Android pay. Our investigator didnt think the payments could be made by a token 
other than the genuine card but hasnt supplied a detailed explanation for this. Ive thought 
carefully about this point, and Im not satisfied I can say the genuine card and PIN was used. 
Ms S has told us that she entered her bank details onto a website linked with TV licencing. 
She has supplied a copy of the email to our service, and it appears this was a phishing email 
based on the sender address. I find this to be a reasonable explanation as to how a 
fraudster could have accessed Ms Ss card details in an illicit way.
Ms S has also provided a copy of a message from Lloyds showing that Android pay was set 
up around the same time she received the text message relating to her online banking 
details being changed. Lloyds havent commented on this being set up, so I am unsure if this 
was a scam  or if this is a potential way the fraudster could have made the transactions 
without Ms Ss consent. I appreciate Ms S would have been responsible for reporting this 
text message if she didnt set up Android Pay but it is clear from the text messages she 
received, she wasnt aware of when she was talking to the real Lloyds and when she wasnt. 
Based on the evidence, Ms S has provided a reasonable explanation as to how her details 
could have been used to set up an Android pay token. And as Lloyds cant provide evidence 
to show how the transactions were made (through chip and PIN, or contactless), I find this to 
be a reasonable explanation as any other persuasive evidence is lacking.
Reporting the fraud
Ms S checked her account balance through ATM machines on a couple of occasions before 
reporting the fraud. I appreciate she is responsible to report any fraud on her account 
straight away. Ive explained above why Ms S was sometimes confused about when she 
was communicating with the real Lloyds and when she wasnt. She was under the 
impression her card had been blocked and only learned through a phone call on 14 August, 
that wasnt the case. I recognise Im giving Ms S and her testimony the benefit of the doubt 
here  but having considered the lacking evidence from Lloyds on the transactions, and 
Ms S's consistent story, I find it more likely than not she believed the contact from the Lloyds 
scam were genuine. Therefore, I dont think reporting the transactions late is enough on its 
own to hold Ms S responsible for them.
Overall
I accept this is not a clear-cut case and Lloyds have rightly raised several points that could 
suggest Ms S authorised the transactions herself or allowed somebody else to make them 
on her behalf. However, having considered the circumstances of this complaint and the 
evidence which is available, Im satisfied that its more likely than not Ms S didnt authorise 
the transactions Ive listed above. And therefore, I think Lloyds should reimburse her for 
these amounts.I dont consider Lloyds are entitled to make any deductions to the refunds for contributory 
negligence. Contributory negligence carries a high bar and I dont think Ms S is at fault for 
the circumstances of this complaint.
I also think a compensation amount of £150 is appropriate due to the trouble and upset this 
whole situation has caused Ms S. I say this because, although I appreciate a large part of 
the distress Ms S suffered was caused by the fraudsters, I think Lloyds have held her 
responsible for transactions made without clear-cut evidence which has meant she has been 
without her money for a prolonged period of time.
So, I thought Lloyds should:
Reimburse Ms S for the disputed transactions totalling £583.49.
Calculate interest at 8% simple per year on this amount.
Pay Ms S £150 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Lloyds responded to my provisional decision and accepted it.
Ms S responded to my provisional decision and overall agreed with it  however pointed out 
that some transactions were missing from the disputed payments. Ms S explained that a 
further two payments were made to First Bus  Mobile, and a further three payments to 
Appleton Mini Mark. This meant the total in dispute was £661.99, rather than £583.49.
I reached out to Lloyds to inform them of the additional payments in dispute, and after 
reviewing things again, Lloyds agreed to refund the £661.99, plus 8% and pay £150 
compensation. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both parties have agreed with my provisional decision, and the further points raised by 
Ms S have been accepted by Lloyds, I see no reason to depart from the original findings and 
the reasons as stated above. 
Putting things right
Having considered the circumstances of this complaint and the evidence which is available, 
Im satisfied that its more likely than not Ms S didnt authorise the transactions in question. 
And therefore, I think Lloyds should reimburse her for these amounts.
I dont consider Lloyds are entitled to make any deductions to the refunds for contributory 
negligence. Contributory negligence carries a high bar and I dont think Ms S is at fault for 
the circumstances of this complaint.
I also think a compensation amount of £150 is appropriate due to the trouble and upset this 
whole situation has caused Ms S. I say this because, although I appreciate a large part of 
the distress Ms S suffered was caused by the fraudsters, I think Lloyds have held her 
responsible for transactions made without clear-cut evidence which has meant she has been 
without her money for a prolonged period of timeMy final decision
For the reasons explained, I uphold this complaint. To put things right, Lloyds Bank PLC 
should do the following: 
Reimburse Ms S for the disputed transactions totalling £661.99.
Calculate interest at 8% simple per year on the amount they refund Ms S. They 
should calculate this from the date the money was taken to the date they refund.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Lloyds Bank PLC to withhold income tax from the 
above-mentioned interest. Lloyds should give Ms S a certificate showing how much 
is taken off if Ms S asks for one.
Pay Ms S £150 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2022.
