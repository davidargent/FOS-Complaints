K821x#15complaint
Mr and Mrs M are unhappy that Nationwide  Building  Society surrendered their endowment 
policy early to repay their mortgage despite it not being due. 
background
Mr and Mrs M originally  had their mortgage  with Cheshire  Building Society,  which was 
incorporated into Nationwide  in 2013.  In 1997, Cheshire extended the term of their mortgage 
by a year to coincide with the maturity date of their endowment policy. 
Mr and Mrs Ms policy was originally  held with Allied  Dunbar, later to become  Zurich. In late 
2018 they were  keeping  a close eye on the performance of their policy as they didnt want  to 
lose out on growth and looked into surrendering  it; they wanted  to be able to choose to 
surrender their policy at any point  until its maturity date of 1 May 2019.  
Zurich informed them they would need  a letter of no further interest from Nationwide. They 
enquired about  this and was told a letter would be sent as it didnt have any interest  in the 
policy. But this was wrong as Nationwide did hold an interest and instead it asked Zurich for 
the proceeds of the policy; according to its records the policy matured in May 2018.  
Zurich sent the policy  proceeds  of £66,437.13 to Nationwide. And Nationwide enquired with 
Mr and Mrs M about whether they wanted  the proceeds to repay  all of an additional 
borrowing or to reduce  the main mortgage account.  Mr M opted for a reduction  of the main 
mortgage, which was subsequently reduced  to £10,155.97.  But Mr and Mrs M also 
complained about the surrender of the policy as this had been done without their knowledge  
or consent; they had missed out on potential growth and were now without life cover for 
some of their mortgage. 
Nationwide upheld their complaint in part. It didnt think  it had done  anything wrong by 
surrendering the policy  as its records  showed the policy  matured in 2018 and it hadnt been 
told it had been  extended. But it did agree it provided Mr and Mrs M with incorrect 
information about the letter of no further  interest. It therefore offered them £200 
compensation. Mr and Mrs M further  complained  about not getting  a copy of its response 
and they werent  happy with the outcome.  Nationwide  stood by its overall decision but 
offered another £50 for the delay  in its further  response.  
Our investigator initially upheld the complaint as she was satisfied Nationwide  had done 
something wrong in surrendering the policy early. However, following receipt of further 
information from both parties about the prospective maturity value of the policy and the costs 
of the actual mortgage and what the mortgage  would  have  cost if the policy  had run to term, 
she was satisfied Mr and Mrs M hadnt suffered a financial  loss. 
Mr and Mrs M believed they had suffered a loss and so asked for the matter to be referred to 
an ombudsman. 
I issued my provisional decision on 17 February  2020, explaining why I was minded to 
uphold this complaint.  Mr and Mrs W agreed with the outcome reached. Nationwide  also 
agreed but thought the difference between  the positions was £1,604.31. 
Ref: DRN51323822my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Im satisfied Nationwide ought to have known Mr and Mrs Ms policy wasnt due to mature  
until May 2019. They have provided  a copy of a letter which  shows  that Cheshire  Building  
Society agreed to a years extension to the mortgage so that it matched the term of their 
endowment policy.  It follows Im satisfied it shouldnt  have surrendered  the policy  when it did. 
The policy was set up with a sum assured of £70,000 and as it was an endowment  it 
provided Mr and Mrs M with that amount of life cover. It must have been particularly worry 
for them to find out they no longer had this cover, even though their mortgage  hadnt been 
fully repaid. 
Nationwide doesnt  believe Mr and Mrs M suffered  a financial loss as a result  of surrendering 
the policy early. In fact, it is of the view they have  saved over £1,600 as a result.  But Mr and 
Mrs M dont  agree and neither do I. Nationwide has provided calculations to show  that as 
events happened  the repayment of the mortgage  cost them  £76,679.27.  But it says, had 
they left the policy  until maturity,  their mortgage would have cost them £78,282.78 to repay. 
However, the sum of £78,282.78 includes the prospective maturity value of £69,996.63  
(Zurich was able to calculate the maturity  value as at the intended  maturity  date of the 
policy). Nationwide  failed  to take into account,  that although Mr and Mrs M would have paid 
premiums to the policy of £706.60, the maturity  value is made up of the growth those 
premiums would have  achieved and so arent a cost to them.  The difference  between  the 
maturity value and the surrender value taking account of the premium cost was £,2852.90. 
In order to fairly establish whether Mr and Mrs M have  suffered a loss, we need to compare 
what they did pay, with what they would have paid, if the policy  had run to term. I have set 
this out in the table below. At the time of the policy being surrendered there  was £76,543.45 
outstanding on this mortgage  account.  Had the mortgage run to term, there  would have been 
approximately £76,539.61 outstanding (taken  from Nationwides  figures). 
Policy surrendered in 
November 2018  - £66,437.13Policy matured May 2019 - 
£69,996.63
Monthly interest 3 payments of £270.45 5 payments of £270.45
Shortfall (the amount 
required to fully repay the 
mortgage from Mr and 
Mrs M)£9,430.79 £6,542.98
Policy premiums £0 5 premiums of £141.32
Total cost £10,242.14 £8,601.83
Difference + £1,640.31
Nationwide is right that the figure  in my provisional  decision was wrong.  But it wasnt what 
Nationwide said either. I was wrong  by a matter of pence and have rectified the table above. 
The table shows it cost Mr and Mrs M approximately  £1,640.31 more to repay  their mortgage 
because the policy was surrendered early. I have also rounded the monthly  interest 
payments to five on the maturity side of the calculation as the policy  would have matured on 
Ref: DRN513238231 May 2019  and so likely been used to reduce  the mortgage balance a very short  time later;  
within a matter of days. I find this to be broadly fair. 
I therefore find that Mr and Mrs M have suffered a financial  loss of £1,640.31 as a result  of 
Nationwides actions.  
putting things right
As I have found Nationwide  caused Mr and Mrs M a financial loss, I require it to:
Pay Mr and Mrs M £1,650.31 for the loss they have  suffered. 
Add 8% simple interest to that sum from March  2019 when the mortgage was repaid, 
to the date of settlement, to compensate them for the loss of use of that money. 
Pay an additional  £200 (in addition  to the £250 already offered) for the distress and 
inconvenience this matter has caused. 
I am minded to require the additional compensation payment as Mr and Mrs M have been  
put to some  considerable trouble in relation to this matter. It must have been stressful to find 
that Nationwide had surrendered their endowment policy without their knowledge or consent.  
And as a result of that they were left without  life cover for their mortgage  which  I know was 
worrying for them. 
my final decision
For the reason  given,  my final decision is I uphold this complaint and require Nationwide 
Building Society to compensate Mr and Mrs M in accordance with the above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs M to 
accept or reject my decision  before  15 May 2020.
