The complaint
Mr D complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles (Marbles) registered a default against 
him in July 2020  when it shouldve been registered in 2018.
What happened
Mr D had a Marbles credit card with a limit of £2,200. In 2017, he was struggling to pay his 
debts. The last payment was on 13 August 2017. In October 2017, Marbles sent him a 
Notice of Default. No more payments were made until March 2018. In April 2018, Marbles 
transferred the collection of the payments to a debt collection agency (DCA) and agreed a 
payment plan of £50 per month. These were made until December 2019, when they 
stopped. The account was defaulted in July 2020. The debt was then sold to another DCA.
Mr D complained  he said his account shouldve been defaulted in 2017 or 2018  when he 
was behind with payments and when his debt was passed to a DCA. As the later default was 
registered more recently, he was having trouble borrowing money.
Marbles said the last payment made by Mr D was in December 2019, when his account was 
being managed by the first DCA. Arrears then built up until a default was registered on 31 
July 2020. They accepted theyd not updated Mr Ds address when he contacted them in 
2020  and offered to pay compensation of £50 for that.
Mr D brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said he considered the default shouldve 
been registered in 2018. At that time, Mr D was six months in arrears and collection of the 
debt had been passed to a DCA. So, in line with industry guidance, that was when the 
default shouldve been made. He said that Marbles should register the default at that time, 
and not in July 2020.
Marbles disagreed. They said that a payment plan was agreed with Mr D in April 2018  for 
£50 per month, and he made those payments from then on  until the end of 2019. Theyd 
agreed this in an effort to help Mr D  rather than registering a default against him then  as 
this wouldve been damaging to his credit standing. Marbles asked that Mr Ds complaint be 
looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr D cant easily get credit now because of the default which was registered in July 2020. 
He admits he was struggling with his debts in 2017  and agrees that he didnt pay Marbles 
for a period at that time. And as a result, he thinks that Marbles shouldve registered a 
default against him at that time, and not in 2020. If this was the case, the six-year period for 
the time a default is on Mr Ds credit file would start more than two years earlier.
Marbles say that they agreed to Mr Ds offer of £50 per month in April 2018  and he then 
kept to that agreement. In doing that, they say they were genuinely trying to be helpful to Mr 
D in not registering a default at that time  to give him breathing space to sort things out. I 
can see where Marbles are coming from  this does appear to be a well- intentioned action 
by them. We asked Marbles for a copy of what was sent to Mr D about the payment 
arrangement  but they didnt send us anything. So  its not clear if anything was given to 
Mr D about the terms of the plan, for example  if he was advised that a default wouldnt be 
registered at that time.
Ive looked at what happened. In 2017, the last payment made by Mr D was £30.34 on 14 
August 2017. Ive seen that no payments were made thereafter in September 2017, October 
2017, November 2017, December 2017, January 2018 and February 2018. In December 
2017, the arrears were £392.59.  The account was passed to a DCA on 7 December 2017 to 
collect payments. Marbles told us that Mr D next made a payment of £50 on 2 March 2018. 
On 6 April 2018, Marbles notes record that £50 a month was agreed. 
A Notice of Default was sent to Mr D on 31 October 2017 with the arrears at £140.61. This 
said this amount had to be paid by 22 November 2017, and if not: Well terminate your 
credit agreement with us, close your credit card account and ask you to pay the full account 
balance immediately. If we terminate your credit agreement, we may sell your account to a 
third party. We will also share details of the status of your account with credit reference 
agencies which may make it harder for you to get credit in the future. And  Mr D didnt 
make the payment. But  his account was passed to a DCA.
The next payment was made on 2 March 2018. This was over six months after the last 
payment. The arrears were still £231.84. The guidance for dealing with defaults is laid down 
by the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). This says when a consumer is at least three 
months behind with their payments then a default may be registered. And it would expect a 
default to be registered by the time the consumer is six months behind with their payments. 
It is the business responsibility to put an entry on the credit file. This cannot be taken off 
unless it is an error. So  in this case, Marbles shouldve registered a default on Mr Ds 
credit file on or around end of November  or when the debt was passed to the DCA on 7 
Decemvir 2017.
I appreciate what Marbles have said  about trying to be helpful to Mr D in April 2018  but in 
this case, I agree with our investigator  that the default shouldve been registered earlier.  
Marbles apologised to Mr D and offered him £50 for not updating his new address when he 
advised them in 2020. Mr D doesnt want compensation  his request is that the default is 
changed to the earlier date, rather than 2020. And  I agree that this is a fair way to resolve 
his complaint.
Putting things right
Marbles should amend Mr Ds credit file to delete the default registered on 31 July 2020 and 
instead, register the default in December 2017. 
My final decisionI uphold this complaint.  NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles should amend Mr Ds credit file to 
show registration of a default in December 2017, and delete the default registered in July 
2020.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 July 2021.
