DRN-2842522
The complaint
Mr E complains that he had long wait times when calling PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
(PayPal).
What happened
Mr E couldnt access his PayPal account so called them three times in February 2021. The 
three calls lasted 47 minutes, 54 minutes and one hour 25 minutes, with no answer.
Mr E complained about the wait times  this was a waste of his time and was poor service 
from PayPal. He asked for compensation of £100.
PayPal apologised for the frustration caused and offered a goodwill payment of £25 as a 
PayPal credit.
Mr E didnt accept PayPals offer and brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator 
said that call centre wait times are not always predictable. What happened was unfortunate 
and frustrating, but he believed that PayPals apology and offer of £25 was right, so didnt 
uphold Mr Es complaint.
Mr E didnt agree and asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered what happened here from both the perspective of Mr E and PayPal. Mr E 
was locked out of his PayPal account - so couldnt use the chat function. He wanted to 
withdraw some money, so had to call PayPal. Ive seen that the three calls he made were 
indeed very long. And that must have been very frustrating for him. But equally, PayPal cant 
predict accurately the demands on their call centres and there are some periods when wait 
times are too long. Id also observe that weve seen a lot of this during the pandemic  where 
businesses have had to reorganise how they handle customer calls, with staff working from 
home. And the volume of calls has gone up  because more customers have been dealing 
with things online. PayPal are affected by that also.
Against that, Mr E argues that PayPal should be able to predict caller demand and at least  
put a message on their system which tells customers about the likely waiting time  this is a 
fair observation.
But  having looked at what happened, I cant say that Mr Es complaint has been badly 
handled by PayPal. They apologised and have offered compensation of £25. I think thats 
about right, and what this service would expect to see here. So, in all the circumstances, I 
wont be asking them to do anymore.
If Mr E wishes to accept PayPals offer, he should get in touch with them to arrange for the 
credit to his PayPal account.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2021.
