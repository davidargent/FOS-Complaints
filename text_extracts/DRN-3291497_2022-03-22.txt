The complaint
Miss F complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA didnt refund her for an item, after 
she raised a claim under its Buyer Protection scheme.
What happened
Miss F used her PayPal account to purchase some material from a seller online. Miss F says 
that when she received the material it was dirty. 
Miss F says she attempted to resolve the matter with the seller with no success. She raised 
a claim under PayPals Buyer Protection Scheme, choosing the category significantly not as 
described. Miss F says PayPal closed the case and directed her to her bank. Miss F says 
she didnt receive a response to the complaint she made to PayPal. So, she asked our 
service to look into the matter for her.
Our investigator looked into Miss Fs concerns but didnt think her complaint should be 
upheld. He was satisfied PayPal had acted in line with its Buyer Protection terms. He didnt 
think it had acted unfairly by not providing Miss F with a refund.
Miss F disagreed with our investigators view. So, the complaint has been passed to me to 
decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Miss Fs complaint. Ill explain why.
PayPals user agreement says that buyers may be eligible for a refund under its Buyer 
Protection scheme in certain circumstances, including where the item is Significantly Not as 
Described. It goes on to explain PayPals online dispute resolution process, which includes 
the wording:
Comply with PayPals shipping requests in a timely manner, if youre filing a 
Significantly Not as Described claim. PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the 
item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to 
provide proof of delivery.
PayPal has provided us with a copy of a message it sent to Miss F which says:
To receive the refund, youll need to initiate the return shipment and upload the tracking 
information in the Resolution Centre before 16 August 2021.. The returned item must be in 
the same condition as when you received it and youre responsible for any costs associated 
with the return.
PayPal says Miss Fs claim was denied because Miss F informed it that the item had been 
altered and could not be returned in the same condition as when she received it.  And, I can 
see from PayPals contact notes that Miss F said she wasnt able to return the material to the 
seller as it had to be used.
Miss F has explained that there was a tight deadline for the material to be supplied to a third 
party because there had previously been issues with two other suppliers that shed 
attempted to get the material from. I appreciate this put Miss F in a difficult position, where 
she felt she had no option other than to make use of the material shed received. I also 
understand why she feels she shouldnt have had to pay for material that wasnt to the 
standard shed expected. But I can only consider PayPals actions in my decision, not the 
actions of the seller. And I dont think it was unreasonable for PayPal to have declined    
Miss Fs Buyer Protection claim, when she said she wasnt able to return the material to the 
seller, as was required by the terms. 
I know my answer will be disappointing for Miss F. But Im satisfied that PayPal has acted 
fairly and in line with its user agreement. So, I dont require it to do anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Miss Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss F to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 April 2022.
