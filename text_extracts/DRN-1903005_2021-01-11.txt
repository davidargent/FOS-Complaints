DRN-1903005
The complaint
Mr G complains about the amount that hes been charged by PSA Finance UK Limited, 
trading as Free2Move, for a missing service history when he returned a car at the end of his 
hire agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mr G under a hire agreement with Free2Move that he 
signed in November 2016;
it was agreed that he would return the car to the dealer when the agreement ended in 
November 2018 and it was collected from there by a third party, on behalf of 
Free2Move, in January 2019 and it also inspected the car;
the inspection report identified damage to the front bumper and an alloy wheel and a 
missing service history and service book and recommended charges totalling £563;
Mr G was charged that amount, which he paid, but he complained to Free2Move 
about those charges  it offered to remove the charge of £65 for the damaged wheel 
as a gesture of goodwill;
Mr G wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service - our 
investigator didnt consider that Free2Move had acted fairly in charging Mr G for the 
missing documents so she recommended that the charge of £400 for the missing 
service history should be refunded  and that it should also refund him the £65 for 
the wheel;
Mr G has accepted those recommendations but Free2Move has asked for this 
complaint to be considered by an ombudsman as it says that the investigators 
recommendations are unfair;
Mr G says that the service history was with the car when he returned it and the 
dealer says that the service book was on the passenger seat and that the servicing 
was up to date;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the cars service history was present when 
Mr G returned the car to the dealer and Im not persuaded that its fair or reasonable 
in these circumstances for Free2Move to have charged him £400 for the missing 
service book;
I consider that Free2Move should refund to Mr G the £65 that it charged him for the 
damage to the wheel and which it has offered to refund to him; 
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Free2Move to refund to Mr G the £400 
that hes paid for the missing service history and the £65 that hes paid for the 
damage to the alloy wheel; and 
Mr G has accepted the other charges so I dont consider that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Free2Move to refund them to him  or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Free2Move to pay £465 to Mr G.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Gs complaint and I order PSA Finance UK Limited, trading 
as Free2Move, to pay him £465.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 February 2021.
