The complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) has treated him unfairly in 
relation to data connected to his PayPal account.
What happened
The background of this complaint is well known to both parties, so Ive summarised events.
Mr M holds a PayPal account. In early August 2021 he submitted a subject access 
request (SAR) in connection to this account. PayPal says it provided this 
information initially though an online portal in August 2021. Mr M said he was unable 
to access the data which PayPal attributed to his online connection.
Mr M brought the matter to the attention of the Information Commissioners Office 
(ICO). Following its involvement, PayPal agreed to send the relevant information to 
Mr M on a USB memory stick which included copies of three telephone calls. Two 
between Mr M and PayPal, and another unrelated call with a third-party by mistake. 
Mr M complained, saying he wanted all the calls hed had with PayPal as there were 
more than two. He also wanted it to investigate whether his data was shared with 
anyone else, and a compensatory sum to account for its mistakes. 
PayPal apologised for its mistakes and delays and offered £30 in compensation. I 
understand it has since shared the remaining calls with Mr M and has said it is 
investigating whether his data has been shared any wider.
Our Investigator looked into the complaint. She agreed PayPal had made mistakes 
and caused delays in providing the data. She was persuaded £30 was fair 
compensation in the circumstances. And she said PayPal should keep Mr M updated 
as to any updates or issues once it has completed its investigation.
Mr M disagreed, saying he wanted at least £150 in light of its delays.
So, the complaint has been passed to me for an Ombudsmans final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
It is not the role of this Service to determine whether PayPal has breached any data 
protection laws in its handling of Mr Ms SAR. Thats a matter for the Information 
Commissioners Office (ICO) to determine. 
However, I can look at whether PayPal treated him fairly, taking into account the impact any 
mistake has had on them. Its important to understand our awards are designed to 
compensate consumers  not fine or punish businesses. We look at the impact any mistakes 
have had on the consumer concerned and give careful consideration to individual 
circumstances when deciding if an award for trouble and upset is warranted. And in doing 
so, we look at what actually happened as a result of a mistake, not what couldve happened.
The key facts about this complaint are not in dispute. PayPal seemingly has agreed it made 
mistakes in sharing a third partys data with Mr M, and in not sharing Mr Ms data sooner. 
And it has offered £30 compensation as well as investigate any potential data breach. So, 
the issue I have to decide is whether the things it has done to put things right, including the 
amount of compensation its offered, is fair and reasonable.
Mr M has said he is concerned that his data may have been shared with a third party in light 
of the data hed received. I understand PayPal is still investigating this matter, but at this 
time Ive been given nothing that persuades me Mr Ms details have been shared with 
anyone else. So, Im satisfied this is a reasonable course of action on its part.
Mr M has described his frustration at PayPals actions and made reference to it not meeting 
its obligations. I can understand why this would be frustrating, but Ive been given no details 
of any wider impact to him or financial losses hes suffered as a result of PayPals actions. 
Based on what Ive been given, the impact of not receiving these calls earlier than he wanted 
appears limited. It follows Im satisfied £30 is fair compensation in the circumstances.
My final decision
For the above reasons, Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 June 2022.
