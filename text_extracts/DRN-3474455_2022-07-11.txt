The complaint
Mr S complains about the interest that hes being charged by Shawbrook Bank Limited 
under a fixed sum loan agreement that he used to pay for some furniture. He also complains 
that the loan agreement was mis-sold to him.
What happened
Mr S used a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank that he electronically signed in 
June 2016 to pay for some furniture. The price of the furniture was £2,500, he paid a deposit 
of £220 so the amount of the loan was £2,280. Mr S agreed to make 120 monthly payments 
of £49.04 to repay the loan, with the first payment due after twelve months.
He says that he contacted Shawbrook Bank in 2019 when he was moving house about the 
interest rate on the loan and he complained to it in March 2021. Shawbrook Bank said that it 
believed that Mr S was provided with sufficient information to be able to make an informed 
decision both prior to and following signing the loan agreement. He wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ss complaint should be upheld. He said that he 
havent seen anything to suggest that Mr S wasnt provided with all the necessary 
information to enable him to have made an informed decision about entering into the loan 
agreement and he thought that Shawbrook Bank had acted reasonably in the execution of 
the agreement.
Mr S has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that he 
wouldnt have signed the agreement if it had been explained to him at the time and that the 
discussion with the supplier was about the furniture and not the loan agreement.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Shawbrook Bank has provided a copy of the loan agreement that was electronically 
signed by Mr S, a copy of the letter that was sent to Mr S in June 2016 and which 
included a copy of the signed loan agreement and the four annual statements that it 
sent to him between 2017 and 2020;
Shawbrook Bank has provided evidence to show that Mr S electronically signed the 
loan agreement but Mr S says that the supplier managed to obtain his signature on 
an electronic device during the product demonstration;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that the furniture was supplied to Mr S and Ive 
seen no evidence to show that Mr S thought that he was paying for the furniture by 
other means so I consider it to be more likely than not that Mr S had agreed to pay 
for the furniture using a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank and that he 
electronically signed the loan agreement;
the supplier has stopped trading so cant provide evidence about the sales process 
but Mr S was sent a letter by Shawbrook Bank in June 2016 which included a copy of 
the signed loan agreement;
that letter said that Mr Ss application for a loan had been successful and clearly set 
out his right to withdraw from the loan agreement within 14 days without giving a 
reason  Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr S tried to withdraw from the loan 
agreement during that period;
the loan agreement clearly sets out the amount of the loan, the annual and monthly 
interest rates and the APR, the total charge for credit, the total amount payable and 
the number and amount of the monthly payments;
Shawbrook Bank sent annual statements to Mr S in each July from 2017 to 2020 and 
those annual statements also set out the interest rate that was payable under the 
agreement - so I consider that Mr S would have known, or ought reasonably to have 
known, the interest rate to which hed agreed;
Mr S says that he contacted Shawbrook Bank about the interest rate in 2019 when 
he was moving house but he didnt make a complaint to it until March 2021  nearly 
five years after the furniture had been supplied to him;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan agreement was 
mis-sold to Mr S or that he wasnt made aware of the interest that hed be paying 
under the loan agreement; and
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Shawbrook Bank has 
acted incorrectly in connection with Mr Ss loan agreement so I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to refund to Mr S any of 
the interest that hes paid to it, to change the payments that remain due from Mr S, to 
pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 August 2022.
