K821x#15complaint
Mr F complains that Novaloans Ltd (trading as Cash4UNow)  was irresponsible to lend to 
him.
background
Mr F had five loans from Cash4UNow between March 2018  and July 2018 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 28 Mar 2018 £200 6m £65.95 25 Apr 2018
2 1 May 2018 £300 6m £97.36 1 Jun 2018
3 1 Jun 2018 £400 6m £130.34 28 Nov 2018 28 Jun 2018
4 28 Jun 2018 £350 6m £116.54 14 Jul 2018
5 14 Jul 2018 £340 6m £101.42 6 Aug 2018
Mr F says Cash4UNow  should never  have  provided the loans as they were unaffordable to 
him. He says he was borrowing again soon after repaying a previous loan each time.
Cash4UNow says it asked for information about Mr Fs income and expenditure and 
checked his credit file. It says short-term lending featured in Mr Fs credit file but there was 
no suggestion he was reliant on the credit. It says the repayments were affordable based on 
Mr Fs declared  income and expenditure.  Cash4UNow adds that Mr F repaid all his loans 
early and there were  no indications he was in financial  difficulty.  It says Mr F also made  a 
further nine applications that were declined.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He said the information to 
which Cash4UNow had access showed  Mr F was having problems managing his money. He 
said at the time of loan 1 Mr Fs credit  file showed he already had five other  short-term  loans 
and it was unlikely  he would have been  able to sustainably repay loan 1, or any subsequent 
loans. Our adjudicator recommended  Cash4UNow should refund interest  and charges on all 
the loans (plus 8% statutory interest) and remove any associated negative information  from 
Mr Fs credit file.
Cash4UNow did not agree with the adjudicators recommendations.
my findings
Cash4UNow was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks to make sure 
Mr F could  afford to repay the loans  before  it lent to him. Those checks  needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr F was borrowing, and his lending  history. But 
there was no set list of checks Cash4UNow had to do.
Loan 1
When Mr F applied for loan 1, he told Cash4UNow his income was £1,300 and his 
expenditure was £1,169. A credit check also showed he had recently opened five other 
short-term loan accounts. Because of this, I consider Cash4UNow should have carried  out 
better checks, especially with regard to his short-term loans. Had it done  so, I think its likely  
Cash4UNow would have  found loan 1 was unaffordable to Mr F. I say this because:
Ref: DRN50476412Mr F said his monthly disposable income  was £131. After  hed made the repayment 
on loan 1, this left him with just £65 for unforeseen expenses  each month.  Given the 
term of the loan was six months, I consider it unlikely Mr F could sustainably  make 
these repayments  for the entire  period.
Although Mr F declared  his expenditure to be £1,169, this included  a monthly 
expenditure on food of just £2. Therefore, I find it likely  that his actual expenditure 
was significantly higher;
Mr F actually had seven other  outstanding short-term loans at the time of loan 1, with 
repayments due on them  of several  hundred pounds.
So I find there were clear indications that Mr F was in financial difficulty  at the time he 
applied for loan 1 and, had Cash4UNow done proportionate checks, Im satisfied it would  
have found the loan was unaffordable to Mr F.
Loans 2 to 5
Based on the figures declared  by Mr F, the most he had left after making the Cash4UNow 
repayments each  month  was £136.  Given that he also had at least £100 of repayments due 
to other  short-term loan companies each month, Im satisfied that none of the loans were 
affordable to Mr F.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Novaloans Ltd (trading  as Cash4UNow) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr F paid on the loans;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about the loans from Mr Fs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash4UNow to take off tax from this interest. 
Cash4UNow must give Mr F a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for 
one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 November  2019.
