The complaint
Mr C complains that Novaloans Ltd (trading as Cash4unow) was irresponsible to approve his 
loans. 
What happened
Mr C had seven loans from Cash4unow between October 2016 and July 2019 as shown 
below:

1 13 Oct 2016 £100 3m £44.01 23 Dec 2016 On time

7 20 Jul 2019 £200 4m £73.24 31 Oct 2019 On time
Mr C says the loans were unaffordable and Cash4unow did not carry out proper 
affordability checks. He says the loans caused him to enter a debt spiral which worsened 
his financial situation.
Cash4unow says it conducted a credit check and asked Mr C about his income and 
outgoings before each loan. It says the information supported its decision to approve loans 
1 to 5. But it accepted that some of the checks indicated further enquiries were appropriate 
before agreeing to loans 6 and 7. As these loans were approved without additional checks, 
Cash4unow agreed to uphold Mr Cs complaint about those loans and refund the interest 
and charges (plus statutory interest). It also offered to remove all the loans from Mr Cs 
credit file. Mr C did not accept this offer.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. She didnt consider 
the available information or the pattern of lending indicated the repayments were 
unsustainable for Mr C.
Cash4unow confirmed its original offer is no longer available to Mr C who then requested an
ombudsmans decision.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mr C and to Cash4unow on 19 August 2021. The relevant 
guidelines were outlined in the provisional decision, so I wont repeat them here.
I summarise my findings:
I was satisfied that Cash4unows checks went far enough for loans 1 to 4 and there 
was nothing in the available information to indicate the loans were unaffordable;
So I didnt conclude that Cash4unow was wrong to have approved loans 1 to 4;
I considered Cash4unow should have carried out a full financial review for loan 5 
because the loan amounts remained high and the number of loans could be an 
indication that Mr C was becoming reliant on the lending;
However, as Mr C hadnt provided any additional details about his circumstances at 
the time of loan 5, I couldnt see there was anything in the available information that 
should have indicated to Cash4unow that further lending was unaffordable;
I thought that Cash4unow should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable by loan 6 because:
oWhen Mr C applied for loan 6, hed been in debt to Cash4unow for over 16 
months;
oThese loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an 
extended period of time;
oThe sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on 
Mr Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for 
high-cost loans;
oAlthough loans 6 and 7 were for lower amounts, there were clear indications 
that Mr C was struggling to manage his money:
Hed repaid loan 5 late;
His credit file showed three delinquent accounts;
There were now four defaulted accounts on his credit file;
He was starting to use other short-term loan providers.
So my provisional decision was to uphold Mr Cs complaint about loans 6 and 7.
Mr C responded to say he accepted the provisional decision and Cash4unow confirmed it 
had no additional information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I need to take into account the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice as 
outlined in my provisional decision.
As neither party provided any additional information, I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional decision.
My final decisionMy decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. Novaloans Ltd (trading as Cash4unow) 
should:
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr C towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 6 and 7;
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr C which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr C originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled;
C. Pay Mr C the total of A plus B;
D. The overall pattern of Mr Cs borrowing for loan 6 onwards means any information 
recorded about those loans is adverse, so Cash4unow should remove loans 6 and 7 
entirely from Mr Cs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash4unow to deduct tax from this interest. Cash4unow
should give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 October 2021.
