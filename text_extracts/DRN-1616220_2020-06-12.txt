The complaint
Mr E says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr E says by Sunny continuing to lend to him he got into further debt and suffered 
financial hardship as a result.       
What happened
This complaint is about 52 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mr E between February 2015 
and June 2019. Mr Es borrowing history for the first 15 loans is as follows:

Mr E continued to borrow a further 37 loans between August 2016 to June 2019. The 
amounts borrowed ranged between £50 and £600. I understand loans 52 and 53 are still 
being repaid in line with the loan agreements. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Es complaint and thought the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been given as it was clear Mr E was having problems managing his 
finances  he was also borrowing from other short-term lenders. 
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicator but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan 43 and 
willing to pay redress. We put the offer to Mr E, but he declined to accept it.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me to decide in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr E could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr E could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr E didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to three shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr E had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Es complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why.
When Mr E returned for more borrowing at loan four, loans one and two were still 
outstanding, so he had three loans with Sunny and his monthly repayments would increase 
accordingly. In response to the adjudicator Sunny said that its product allows its customers 
the flexibility to manage their own money and it allowed for up to four loans to be taken at 
any one time. But if Sunny had carried out the proportionate checks at this stage in the 
borrowing relationship, it would have seen that Mr E also had outstanding loans with at least 
two other short-term credit providers. So, in fact Mr E had a total of five outstanding loans. 
And I think this was a clear indication that Mr E was having problems managing his money 
effectively. 
I note Mr E was repaying his loans well before the agreed term of six months. This would 
have saved Mr E interest charges, but it can equally be an indication that Mr E was 
struggling with his finances and was juggling his money to make ends meet. As it was clear 
that he was also borrowing from other short-term credit providers I think this is most likely to 
be the case. And I think this is further shown by the fact that Mr E repaid loan two early on 
30 April 2015 but returned a few days later on 2 May take out further borrowing. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr E, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Es case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr E was not managing to repay his loans
sustainably. Mr E had taken out six loans within six months. So Sunny ought to have
realised it was more likely than not Mr E was having to borrow further to cover the
hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Es
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.Mr Es first loan was for £400 and loan six was for the same amount.  At this point
Sunny ought to have known that Mr E was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary
shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need.
Mr E continued to be provided with a new loan within days or weeks of settling a
previous one. As examples;
oloan six was taken out the same day that Mr E repaid loans four and five. And
it was for double the amount of the earlier two loans combined.
oLoan 27 was taken the same day that loan 26 was repaid and it was for
double the amount,
oand loan 32 was taken the day after loan 30 was repaid and again, was for a
larger amount.
I think this behaviour makes clear that the borrowing was unsustainable for Mr E and he was 
persistently reliant on this type of credit. 
Mr E wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 52 was
taken out over four years after Mr Es first. Mr E had paid large amounts of interest
to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr E lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Es indebtedness by allowing him
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr E borrowed was likely to
have had negative implications on Mr Es ability to access mainstream credit and so
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans four to 52 and Sunny should put things 
right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr E paid on loans four to 52;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans four and five from Mr Es credit file;
the number of loans taken from six onwards means any information recorded about
them is adverse. So, all entries about loans six to 52 should be removed from Mr Es
credit file. HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr E a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Es complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 July 2020.
