The complaint
Mrs M complains about the way that some replacement windows, that she paid for using a 
fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank Limited, were sold to her. Shes being 
represented in her complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mrs M used a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank that she electronically signed 
in August 2016 to pay for some replacement windows. The loan was for £10,807 which she 
agreed to repay by 120 monthly instalments of £183.71. She also signed the suppliers 
purchase order.
The supplier has stopped trading and Mrs Ms representative complained to Shawbrook 
Bank in July 2019 about the way that the replacement windows and the loan agreement 
were sold to her. It set out in detail its reasons for rejecting her complaint but Mrs M wasnt 
satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She considered 
Shawbrook Banks response to Mrs Ms claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. She said that she was unable to agree that Shawbrook Bank had acted unfairly by 
declining Mrs Ms section 75 claim so she was unable to agree that it needed to do anything 
more in response to her claim.
Mrs Ms representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. Her representative says, amongst other things, that Mrs Ms comments 
regarding commission have been ignored and that the documentation used by Shawbrook 
Bank breaches section 61 (1) of the Consumer Credit Act because its not accurate or in line 
with the sales contract signed by the Mrs M.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mrs M used credit provider by Shawbrook Bank to pay for the replacement windows 
and, in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim 
against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Ms complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be satisfied 
that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the 
replacement windows and that Shawbrook Banks response to her claim under 
section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Ms 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mrs M signed the suppliers purchase order form which showed an order price of 
£12,786 for some replacement windows and that a lifestyle account had been 
arranged for her which gave a subsidy of £2,699 so reduced the cost to £10,087 (it 
also said that if she chose not to take that account she wouldnt qualify for the 
subsidy and the cost would be £12,786); 
Mrs M also signed a portfolio agreement and subsidy analysis in which she agreed to 
participate in a portfolio promotion and it set out figures relating to the order price and 
marketing subsidy - which dont all appear to be correct  but the portfolio price 
including the lifestyle account subsidy was shown as £10,087;
Mrs M electronically signed the fixed sum loan agreement in August 2016 and it set 
out that the amount of credit was £10,087 (which was the reduced cost shown on the 
purchase order) and the other required information including the interest rate, the 
total amount payable and the number and the amount of the monthly repayments;
Mrs Ms representative says that the loan agreement isnt accurate so doesnt comply 
with section 61(1) of the Consumer Credit Act  but Mrs M had agreed to pay 
£10,087 for the windows which was the amount of credit provided to her under the 
loan agreement, and Im not persuaded that any errors in the other documents would 
be enough to cause the loan agreement not to comply with section 61(1) or not to 
have been properly executed (but that would be for a court to decide);
Shawbrook Bank says that it assessed Mrs Ms creditworthiness and she satisfied 
the required conditions so it made the loan to her  it also says that she maintained 
her contractual repayments and there was no indication that the loan wasnt 
affordable for her;
the windows were installed so Mrs M received the replacement windows that shed 
agreed to pay for  but shes complained about the sales tactics that were used by 
the supplier - she agreed to pay £10,087 for the replacement windows that were 
described on the purchase order which included the subsidies that were shown on 
the order form and in the portfolio agreement and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the supplier misrepresented the windows or the loan 
agreement to Mrs M at that time or that it used sales tactics that would cause 
Shawbrook to have any liability to Mrs M under section 75;
the order form said that the supplier would accept a cancellation of the contract if it 
received notice in writing within 7 days and the loan agreement said Mrs M could 
withdraw from the loan agreement within 14 days  but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mrs M tried to cancel the order or withdraw from the loan within those 
periods  and her complaint wasnt made to Shawbrook Bank until July 2019 (nearly 
three years later) and, if she wasnt happy with the way that the windows had been 
sold to her, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have complained 
soon after she signed the order form;
Mrs Ms representative has provided a report about some legal proceedings against 
the supplier in which it was convicted of using high-pressure sales tactics  but it 
hasnt provided a copy of the court judgment so Ive not been able to fully consider 
those proceedings  but those legal proceedings arent enough to show that the 
supplier used those high-pressure sales tactics when selling the windows to Mrs M;  
the purchase order included a ten year guarantee from the supplier  but the supplier 
has since stopped trading so Mrs M says that she wont have the full benefit of the 
guarantee  but Ive not seen any evidence to show that Mrs M has tried to make a 
claim under the guarantee or that theres an issue with the windows that would be 
covered by the guarantee  so I dont consider that shes suffered a loss and, if she 
does need to make a claim under the guarantee, she should contact Shawbrook Bank under section 75 (and if shes not satisfied with its response she may then be 
able to make a complaint to this service);
Mrs Ms representative says that Mrs M wasnt made aware of any commission that 
was paid to the supplier by Shawbrook Bank for arranging the loan and that the 
commission should have been disclosed to her  Ive not been provided with 
information about the amount of commission that was paid but I consider it to be 
unlikely that it exceeded a level that Shawbrook Bank would have been required to 
disclose and Im not persuaded that the supplier acted incorrectly in introducing the 
loan in these circumstances  nor am I persuaded that its likely that Mrs M would 
have acted any differently if shed been made aware of any commission payment; 
I sympathise with Mrs M for the issues that she has with the guarantee and for the 
way that she clearly feels about her dealings with the supplier, but Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier; and
I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to Mrs Ms section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for 
me to require it to end the loan agreement, to refund to Mrs M any of her monthly 
payments, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2022.
