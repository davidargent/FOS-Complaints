K820x#14Complaint
Miss L complains that NewDay  Ltd increased  her credit limit without checking if it was 
affordable for her. Shes now in financial difficulties and her debt with NewDay  isnt 
decreasing because of the interest and charges  being added to her account.
Background
Miss L successfully applied for a credit card with NewDay  in April 2015 with a credit limit of 
£100. Over the next two years her credit limit was increased five times  to £4,200 by 
March 2017. Miss L says NewDay  didnt check whether she could afford  the additional 
credit. Shes told us shes caught in a spiral of debt and has to use the card to meet  priority  
bills such  as food and council tax. She says she asked  NewDay  for help in 2018, but it didnt 
reply. She wants it to either write  off the debt, or to refund  all of the interest  and charges. 
Shes also very worried about the impact of the information recorded on her credit file and 
would like NewDay to remove any negative information.
NewDay says that the credit limit increases were in line with its responsible lending policy 
and that all interest and charges are as set out in its terms  and conditions.  It says its written  
to Miss L many  times to ask her to contact it if shes in financial difficulties.
Our investigator didnt  recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He couldnt 
conclude that NewDay had lent irresponsibly. And he thought NewDay  had offered to help if 
Miss L was in financial difficulties.
Miss L didnt  agree,  so the complaint has been passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay has obligations to lend responsibly  and to treat customers  who are in financial 
difficulties positively and sympathetically. Ive considered whether NewDay  fulfilled  these 
obligations, when  Miss L applied  for the credit card, when it increased her credit limit and in 
response to finding  out she was in financial difficulties.
The credit card application
Miss L applied for an Aqua credit  card in April 2015. There  isnt a set list of checks NewDay 
was required to complete  as part of the application  process. But it needed to carry out 
proportionate checks to satisfy itself that the product  was affordable.  NewDay  has explained 
this card is aimed at consumers who have a poor credit history  or who are new to credit.  
NewDay asked for details of Miss Ls employment  and salary  and it carried  out a check  of 
her credit file. It satisfied itself that there were no defaults on Miss Ls credit  file and that she 
had settled all pay day loans. On this basis it agreed  to open an account  with an initial  credit 
limit of £100.  I consider NewDay acted reasonably in assessing Miss Ls circumstances and 
agreeing to open the account. 
Ref: DRN56122032Increases in the credit limit
NewDay periodically increased the credit  limit on the account as follows:
Application, April 2015 £100
May 2015 £450
October 2015 £1,050
April 2016 £2,050
September 2016 £3,100
March 2017 £4,200
Before each increase,  NewDay  satisfied itself that Miss L could  afford the new limit by 
reviewing her use of the card and how she was managing other credit commitments.  On 
each occasion  it satisfied itself that Miss L could  afford the increased credit limit. And I can 
see that Miss L was, in the main,  making the required  repayments on the card  there was 
just one late payment  in October 2016. She wasnt making excessive cash withdrawals, and 
she hadnt exceeded the credit limit.
I conclude that NewDay did enough to make  sure the credit limit increases were affordable.
I can also see that on each occasion NewDay wrote to Miss L to offer the increased limit. It 
gave her the opportunity to think about  the increase and whether to accept it  the letters  
said: 
Before you decide what to do you should  ask yourself if you can afford  to pay back  the new 
limit and if anything is likely  to change that may mean you would have difficulty in paying 
back.
On each occasion Miss L phoned NewDay in response to say that she wanted the limit 
increased. So, bearing this in mind and without any information to suggest that the increases 
would be unaffordable,  its difficult for me to say that NewDay  should have done anything 
differently here. Whilst the increases did mean  that the limit rose considerably from the point 
the card was taken  out, NewDay has demonstrated that it carried out proportionate checks 
and there  was nothing else to suggest  Miss L might have struggled to maintain  the 
borrowing.
Financial difficulties
When Miss L brought her complaint to this service,  she explained that she was in financial 
difficulties. I can see that things have been  very difficult for her and I am sorry for the 
position in which she finds herself. But I think, overall, NewDay fulfilled its obligations to treat 
Miss L positively and sympathetically. Ill explain  why.
In early 2018, Miss L exceeded the credit limit on the card. She phoned NewDay in March to 
tell it she could only afford a nominal  payment  that month. She said she wouldnt be 
spending on the card, she wanted  to repay  the balance  and she wanted the interest frozen.  
NewDay said it would call her back to discuss her options. But theres no record of whether a 
call back took place  and it doesnt  appear  that Miss L got back  in contact with NewDay. I 
dont think it was clear from the call that did take place whether Miss L was in financial 
difficulties. And she seems to have  managed  to make the monthly  payments from May 2018 
until December 2018, when spending  on the account caused her to exceed the credit limit on 
the card again.
Ref: DRN56122033In February 2019,  a similar conversation to the one in March  2018 took place. Miss L 
phoned to say she wanted  to repay  the balance, but needed the interest  on the account 
freezing. She told NewDay she wasnt struggling to repay yet. NewDay  agreed to call her 
back to discuss her options, but there  was no answer. It wrote to her to ask her to get in 
contact again,  but it didnt  hear back from her. Again, I dont  find there was enough in this 
call to indicate to NewDay that Miss L may have  been in financial difficulties.
So I dont  think there was any obligation  on NewDay to do anything  in response to what 
Miss L had told it. It asked her to get back in contact to discuss her options and she doesnt  
seem to have done this.
But shortly  afterwards  in mid-March 2019, NewDay sent Miss L a persistent debt  letter. 
This explained that, because shed only been making the minimum monthly payment for 
around 18 months, it would take a long time to repay the balance  and she should consider 
increasing her payments.  The letter also gave  details of organisations that could help if 
Miss L needed guidance on how to manage  her debts.
Miss L complained to NewDay  shortly after this letter  was sent and this was the first time 
NewDay became aware that Miss L may have been  experiencing  financial difficulties. It gave 
her a number to call to discuss her financial position  further and said it could consider a 
reduced repayment plan. And it provided  details  of organisations  that could help her.
Miss L told us that she was in a spiral of debt and was using this card to repay others and to 
meet priority debts, such as council tax and utility bills. But from the statements Ive seen, I 
cant see that the card was being  used to meet  other credit cards  or lending. There  was a 
direct debit set up for a telecommunications  company and there  were  three  occasions  when  
a payment was made to Miss Ls local council. But I dont think this is enough for NewDay  to 
have been prompted to take any action.
I dont find NewDay was obliged to do more, until it found out more  about Miss Ls income 
and expenditure.  And whilst it could have considered refunding or freezing charges and 
interest, I dont find there wasnt  any obligation  on it to do so.
I understand that interest and charges were  frozen  from October 2019 and the account was 
passed to a debt collection agency in January 2020. That seems  like a fair response  to the 
situation. This should mean that Miss L can make  more  affordable  payments moving forward 
without further  interest and charges  being  applied.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 June  2020.
