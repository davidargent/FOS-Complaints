The complaint
Mrs H is unhappy Covea Insurance plc declined a claim she made under her landlord 
insurance policy for damage caused by a tenant.
What happened
Mrs H made a claim to Covea after she discovered damage to her property. Shed rented it 
to a tenant whod turned it into a cannabis farm. A loss adjuster investigated the claim and 
said Mrs H had failed to meet a policy condition relating to the tenants bank details.
Unhappy with this, Mrs H asked Covea to reconsider its position. After further investigation, 
the loss adjuster maintained the condition hadnt been met. They said a second condition, 
relating to regular inspections, hadnt been met either. The claim was declined.
Mrs H complained about the outcome of the claim and the way it had been handled. Covea 
said the loss adjuster acted fairly. Mrs H asked our service to consider her complaint. An 
investigator was satisfied Covea had shown the two conditions hadnt been met and thought 
it was fair for the claim to be declined. And she didnt consider Covea had treated Mrs H 
unfairly in the way it dealt with the claim. Mrs H disagreed, so the complaint has been 
passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Both parties have made a number of detailed points. Ive read and considered them all but 
will only mention those I think are key to explaining my decision.
The policy covers malicious damage caused by tenants, provided six conditions are met. 
Covea accepts the tenant caused malicious damage when converting Mrs Hs property for 
use as a cannabis farm. Its declined the claim because it says two of the conditions havent 
been met. So Ill focus on those two conditions only. In summary the policy says Mrs H must:
Carry out internal and external inspections of the property at least once every six 
months and maintain a log of these inspections
Obtain and record details of the tenants bank account and verify those details by 
receiving at least one payment from that account
Inspections condition
I understand Mrs H let her property out in September 2017. The damage was discovered in 
December 2018. Mrs H says she inspected her property in March and October 2018 to 
comply with the condition. I understand there may have been other visits in 2018 too.
Covea wasnt satisfied Mrs H had carried out those inspections. In part this was because 
Mrs H accepted she hadnt kept a log of them. She was able to say with some confidence 
she had visited at specific times based on other records, such as when tenancy agreements 
were signed, her diary entries, and communication with the Police, which came about due to 
the actions of the tenant. But she hadnt recorded any inspections as the condition required.
Covea was also concerned that the extent of damage and plant growth at the property didnt 
match Mrs Hs account. The loss adjuster made notes of a call with a Police officer. The 
notes say the plants were around 12-16 weeks old at the time they were discovered in 
December. Because of that, the loss adjuster questioned whether Mrs H had inspected the 
property in October  much less than 12 weeks earlier. No evidence of what the Police 
officer was asked or said have been provided  only the loss adjusters notes.
Ive seen an e-mail conversation between Mrs H and a Police officer when she said she 
would be visiting the property in October. Ive also seen notes made by a Police officer of a 
conversation with Mrs H in which she said shed inspected the property in October 2018 and 
everything was in order. These notes, which include comments by the Police officer who 
discovered the cannabis farm, dont offer any opinion on the extent of plant growth found. In 
the statement the loss adjuster took from Mrs H, she said she went in every room of the 
house during this inspection. Nothing was damaged and no growing equipment was there.
Overall, Im persuaded the evidence provided supports Mrs H. She told two different Police 
officers, close to the relevant time, that she inspected her property. I havent seen any 
evidence from the Police which casts doubt on that. Im satisfied its more likely than not that 
Mrs H carried out the inspection in October and found no damage or cannabis growth.
Theres much less evidence or comment about the March inspection. Theres been no 
suggestion there was damage or cannabis growth at that time. And if the October inspection 
didnt reveal a problem, Im not persuaded an inspection in March, six months earlier, would 
have either.
Mrs H accepts she didnt keep a record of the inspections, so the condition wasnt met. But 
as Im satisfied she carried them out and found no problems, Im not persuaded keeping the 
record would have made a difference. So I dont think it would be fair for Covea to rely on a 
breach of that condition to decline the claim.
Bank account condition
The first part of this condition required Mrs H to obtain and record the details of the tenants 
bank account. Mrs H says she was shown bank cards by the tenant and recorded the 
account details by writing them on a piece of paper. I understand she didnt take any other 
records of the bank account details or documents such as bank statements.
The second part of this condition required Mrs H to verify those details by receiving at least 
one payment from the account. Mrs H accepts this didnt happen. She did receive regular 
payments for the rent, albeit from several different accounts using different references. But 
without receiving a payment from the tenants account, Mrs H failed to verify those bank 
details. Its for this reason Covea consider Mrs H failed to meet the condition.
Mrs H says she was misled by the tenant. And shes questioned whether meeting the 
condition would have made a difference.
Mrs H received picture messages from the tenant. They showed a screenshot of an online 
banking application at the stage where payment details have been entered but the payment 
hasnt been made. The tenant had prepared a payment using the details they gave Mrs H, 
as if they were going to pay her the rent from their account. Shortly after she would receive a 
payment into her account, giving the impression the payment shown in the picture had been made. But the payments came from other accounts. This could be seen in her bank 
statements and I understand Mrs H did notice a change of account in 2018.
I agree it appears the tenant misled Mrs H. And they later caused damage to her property. 
So I can appreciate why she may feel shes been deceived and its unfair for that to go 
against her. However, I must bear in mind the conditions set out in the policy. Covea is 
entitled to limit the risk it takes on when offering insurance by requiring conditions to be met.
Where insurers cover these kinds of claims, in my experience most tend to include similar 
conditions to the ones found in Coveas policy  including the requirement to verify a 
payment. Insurers have found that tenants who intend to use a property as a cannabis farm 
are generally less likely to be prepared to do this. Amongst other things, it may reveal theyre 
not legitimate tenants or link them more closely to a crime. So it can act as a deterrent.
I accept we cant be sure what would have happened had Mrs H insisted on verifying this 
payment came from the tenants bank account. But doing this would have reduced the risk of 
the property being rented to somebody who is likely to turn it into a cannabis farm. The 
tenant took steps to conceal how the rent would be paid. So I think requiring them to be 
more open about it would have acted as a deterrent. Because of this, not meeting the 
condition does have an impact on the claim. And so Im satisfied its fair for Covea to decline 
the claim because the condition wasnt met.
The way the claim was handled
Mrs Hs complaint was also about the way the claim was handled. One loss adjuster initially 
declined it on the bank account condition only. After Mrs H asked Covea to reconsider its 
position, it asked a different loss adjuster to look into the claim. They invited Mrs H to an 
interview, during which she was required to give a statement. I understand it lasted nearly 
four hours. The outcome was to decline the claim for the inspections condition as well as the 
bank account condition.
Mrs H has questioned why the loss adjuster was changed and why further investigation was 
necessary after the claim had already been declined. Shes described how the interview 
process made her feel like a criminal, which was more upsetting given the distress that shed 
already suffered as a result of the damage to her property.
When asked to reconsider its position, I dont think it was unreasonable for Covea to have a 
different loss adjuster review the claim. Similarly, I dont think it was unreasonable to carry 
out further investigation and reach a revised outcome based on that. Covea was entitled to 
do both of these things. I havent agreed with its view about the inspection condition, but it 
did have the right to consider that point and make reasonable enquiries about it.
I think Covea could have handled things more sensitively and the length of the interview was 
perhaps disproportionate to the issues involved. But overall Im satisfied the way it handled 
the claim didnt amount to treating Mrs H unfairly.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 March 2021.
