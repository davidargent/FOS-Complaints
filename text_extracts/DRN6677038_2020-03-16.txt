One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint. He partially upheld Mr Ws complaint and 
thought loans two and loans eight to 11 shouldnt have been given. Loan two because the 
repayments would have left Mr W with a disposable income of around  £25 a month  so it was 
unlikely Mr W would  have been able to sustainably repay this loan. And by loan eight, 
Mr Ws pattern  of borrowing  would suggest that he had become persistently reliant on short-
term loans. 
Sunny did make an offer for loan two but didnt agree that loans eight to 11 shouldnt have 
been given. The offer for loan two was put to Mr W but he rejected this. 
Sunny later made an offer of £133.12  as a gesture of goodwill.  Again, this was put to Mr W 
but he didnt accept it.  
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
Ref: DRN66770382repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr W didnt comment  on the adjudicators opinion that loans one and three to seven 
shouldnt be upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about 
these loans. And Sunny has already made  an offer for loan two. So, I wont be making a 
decision about this lending. But the loans were  part of the borrowing relationship Mr W had 
with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when considering loans eight to 11.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, there was a break in lending of eight months between loans 
two and three so there were two chains of borrowing, loans one to two and then loans three 
to 11. 
Like the adjudicator,  Ive looked at the overall  pattern  of Sunnys lending history  with Mr W, 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Ref: DRN66770383Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan eight. 
I say this because  by this time Mr W had developed  a pattern of quickly  reborrowing after 
previous loans were  paid off  loan six was taken the same day that loan three was paid off 
and loan seven  was taken the following day after loan four was repaid, as examples. So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr W was having to borrow further  
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in his finances and that Mr Ws 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Sunny has commented  that some of Mr Ws loans were repaid early and this wasnt 
consistent with someone  in financial  difficulty. While I agree that repaying loans early can 
save interest costs, it can equally be a sign that someone is reborrowing  to pay off existing 
debt and I would suggest this pattern is evidenced by the rapid reborrowing I have referred 
to above. 
For the second chain of borrowing  loans three  to 11  Mr Ws first loan in this chain was for 
£400 and loan eight was for £600.  At this point  Sunny ought to have known that Mr W was 
not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in their income but to meet an ongoing 
need. 
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 11 was taken out 
eight months after Mr Ws first loan in the second  chain of borrowing. Mr W had paid large  
amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan eight 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans which Mr W borrowed was likely to have  had negative  
implications on Mr Ws ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, like the adjudicator Im also upholding the complaint about loans eight to 11 and Sunny 
should put things right.
Ref: DRN66770384putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do  Ive included loan two for 
completeness 
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans eight to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan two from Mr Ws credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan eight onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  eight to 11 should be removed 
from Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 April 2020.
