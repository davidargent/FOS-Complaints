The complaint
Mr C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) restricted and closed his 
bank account unfairly, and then took long to release the money held within it to him.
What happened
Mr C held a personal current account with NatWest. Mr C is the director of a company, which 
Ill refer to as L, which also banked with NatWest. 
In early July, following a Bounce Back Loan application from Mr C on Ls behalf, NatWest 
began a review of the accounts held by Mr C and his company. The banks review of Ls 
facilities are the subject of a separate complaint.
Following its review, NatWest decided to withdraw its services from Mr C. The bank wrote to 
him on 9 July 2020 to say that it would be closing his account in 14 days time. It gave Mr C 
a funds release form to complete and return in order to transfer the account balance. 
While the account remained open, NatWest had applied a restriction to it meaning that Mr C 
couldnt access the balance of around £1,100. The account was belatedly closed on 25 
August 2020, but the balance was only released to Mr C on 12 May 2021.
Our investigator thought Mr Cs complaint should be upheld in part. She said that NatWest 
had acted in line with its legal and regulatory obligations when reviewing and restricting the 
account. But she thought there had been an unreasonable delay in releasing the balance to 
Mr C. From what shed seen, she thought NatWest had received Mr Cs funds release form 
on 19 February and that there was no reason for it to then have taken until 12 May to give 
Mr C his money. So she recommended that NatWest compensate Mr C for the impact of 
being without his money by paying 8% interest on it for this period along with £150 for the 
inconvenience it had been caused.
NatWest accepted our investigators view, but Mr C didnt. So the matter was passed to me 
to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has a number of legal and regulatory obligations to meet in providing banking 
services to its customers. Banks are required to keep accounts and their use under review, 
and may need to suspend access or services in order to do so. The terms and conditions of 
Mr Cs account gave NatWest the power to take such steps.
NatWest has explained that it reviewed and restricted Mr Cs account in order to comply with 
its regulatory obligations and, from what Ive seen, Im satisfied that this was the case. So I 
dont think it did anything wrong in reviewing its relationship with Mr C or  in light of the 
findings of its review  restricting the account until its closure.
In terms of the decision to close Mr Cs account, that was a choice NatWest was entitled to 
make. The terms and conditions allowed NatWest to close the account immediately in 
certain circumstances and Im satisfied that it was entitled to do so here. In the event, the 
account remained open but restricted, which amounted to much the same thing. 
As Ive not found that NatWest did anything wrong in reviewing, restricting or closing Mr Cs 
account, it follows that I dont think its responsible for any impact they might have had on 
him. So while I dont doubt that this will have been concerning and disruptive for Mr C, I dont 
think this is something that NatWest needs to compensate him for.
I do, though, think that NatWest delayed the release of Mr Cs account balance unduly. The 
evidence I have suggests that the bank received Mr Cs funds release form on 19 February 
2021. It then didnt release the funds to Mr C until almost three months later, on 12 May. And 
Ive not seen good reason for that. 
As Ive not seen that the matter caused Mr C any other financial losses, I think it is a matter 
of compensating him for being deprived the use of his funds for this period  which NatWest 
has now agreed to do by paying 8% simple interest, in line with our usual approach to 
matters of this nature. Mr C was also inconvenienced by having to chase matters up, 
including by way of complaint  for which I think the £150 that NatWest has also now agreed 
to pay represents fair compensation.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mr C:
8% simple interest on the closing account balance for the period 19 February 2021 to 
12 May 2021; and 
£150 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 October 2022.
