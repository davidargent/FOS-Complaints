Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ss complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because he had a few outstanding loans with Lending Stream as 
well as other short-term lenders and his borrowing pattern indicated he was reliant on this 
type of loan. Lending Stream disagreed and asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an 
Ombudsman. So, the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure     
Mr S could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing 
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Lending Stream needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 
3. Mr S didnt respond to the view. As there is no dispute about these loans, I wont be 
making any findings on them.
Lending Stream says it carried out checks before it lent loan 4 to Mr S and the results of 
these checks didnt raise any concerns. But as this was Mr Ss fourth loan in nearly three 
months, I think Lending Stream should have been looking to build a clearer picture about    
Mr Ss finances before lending to him again. 
I say this because I think when Mr S applied for loan 4 there was a sufficient enough 
suggestion from his borrowing behaviour that he was having problems managing his money. 
Loans 1, 2 and 3 were still running at this point so by further borrowing Mr Ss monthly 
repayments would be increasing. And he was becoming further indebted to Lending Stream. 
Lending Stream has told us its product allows its customers the flexibility of taking more than 
one loan at a time subject to its affordability and creditworthiness checks. But I think it can 
equally be the case that by taking four loans at the same time could be an indication a 
customer was have problems managing their money. And I note that loan 3 was the largest 
loan taken out and Mr S then returned three weeks later for a smaller sum. This would 
suggest to me that he was juggling his finances to make ends meet. Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Lending Streams lending history with Mr S, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Lending Stream should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7. I say 
this because: 
at this point Lending Stream ought to have realised Mr S was not managing to repay 
his loans sustainably. Mr S had taken out seven loans in less than six months. So 
Lending Stream ought to have realised it was more likely that Mr Ss indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably. 
Mr Ss first loan was for £70 and loan 7 was for £150. By now, Lending Stream ought 
to have known that it was unlikely Mr S was borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall 
in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 7 onwards Mr S was provided with a new loan within weeks  sometimes 
days - of taking out a previous one. 
He also wasnt really making any inroads to the amount he owed Lending Stream. 
Loan 12 was taken out ten months after Mr Ss first  and was for a larger amount. 
Mr S had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Lending 
Stream over an extended period.
I think that Mr S lost out because Lending Stream provided borrowing for loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ss ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding Mr Ss complaint from loan 4 onwards and Lending Stream should put 
things right. 
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 4 to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4 to 6 from Mr Ss credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 7 to 12 should be removed from Mr Ss 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending Stream 
must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.My final decision
As explained, Im partially upholding Mr Ss complaint. Gain Credit LLC should put things 
right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 August 2020.
