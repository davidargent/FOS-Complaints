The complaint
Mr M and Miss T complain that National Westminster Bank Plc indicated that their mortgage 
application would be accepted if they returned a government grant paid during the pandemic 
to Mr Ms business. But when they did that, it still said no. They want the grant money back.
What happened
Whilst this complaint is brought by both Mr M and Miss T, as the mortgage is in both their 
names, our dealings have been with Miss T. So Ill mainly refer to her in this decision. 
Miss T told us she and Mr M applied through a broker to remortgage with NatWest. Their 
application was turned down because Mr M had received a government grant during the 
pandemic. But Miss T said NatWest told her broker that if they returned this grant, then their 
application would be accepted. So they returned the grant of £1,440. But NatWest still 
wouldnt lend to them. 
Miss T said the only reason they returned this money was to get the NatWest mortgage. 
They couldnt claim it again now. So Miss T said they were worse off now, and she wanted 
NatWest to pay the grant money back, plus compensation for the trouble it had cause them.
NatWest has written to Miss T four times about this complaint. In summary, it has accepted 
that its business development manager spoke to Miss Ts broker. But it has said repeatedly 
there was no guarantee given that returning the grant would lead to the mortgage application 
would be approved. It has gone further than this, and said that it didnt set any expectation 
that the mortgage would be approved. Decisions on whether to lend are taken by its 
underwriters, and NatWest said its business development manager is clear on that. 
NatWest said that its underwriter had declined the lending on the basis that the banks 
lending criteria werent met. It said that because it had never guaranteed it would lend, it 
wouldnt make any payment to Miss T and Mr M. 
Miss T remains adamant that it was NatWests suggestion to repay the grant, and that it said 
this would mean their application was accepted. So she asked our service to look into this.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He thought information had 
been cross-wired somewhere and thats what resulted in Miss T and Mr M returning the 
£1,440 grant. He didnt think someone working for NatWest had said the loan would be 
approved if the grant was returned. He stressed that this was unlikely, as so many things 
can go wrong with a lending application. Here, NatWest had applied its own lending criteria, 
and he didnt think that it was unfair for NatWest to decline the lending. 
Miss T replied, to say she wasnt happy. She said it was NatWest who suggested the grant 
be returned, and she thought it had accepted this in its letter to her. She said if NatWest 
hadnt suggested this, they would just have applied for lending elsewhere. And she said it 
wouldnt make sense for NatWest to continue with their application, if it was clearly its policy 
not to accept any applications where grants had been given. Miss T said that no one in their 
right mind would return this kind of money if there wasnt a guarantee that the mortgage 
would be accepted. 
Miss T felt that we were doubting her version of events. But she said NatWest was at fault 
and should be penalised for the way this was handled.
Our investigator didnt change his mind. He said there just wasnt any direct evidence from 
NatWest supporting what Miss T said. And she hadnt heard NatWest offer any guarantee, 
she was relying on what her broker told her. Our investigator had listened to a call recording 
where the broker asked why the loan was declined. NatWest confirmed that it had a policy to 
decline the application based on the grant being taken. Miss Ts broker said he would speak 
to Miss T and Mr M and then come back to NatWest to see how the application could move 
forward. 
Our investigator said it just wasnt likely that NatWest would proactively suggest that 
returning the grant would result in the application going ahead. He thought it was more likely 
that their broker had continued to pursue this application. He didnt think it was unfair for 
NatWest then to decline the application.
Miss T still felt we werent believing her. She said her broker had also confirmed that he was 
told the application would be accepted if they returned the grant. She couldnt understand, if 
NatWests policy was that it wouldnt accept customers who had taken government grants, 
why it would then drag the application out further.
Miss T said after the application was declined, her broker called and said NatWests 
business development manager had advised him they should return the grant as NatWest 
had accepted cases where this had been done before. She said the call we had wasnt this 
call, so it was useless. She wanted NatWest to prove this never happened.
Because no agreement was reached, this case was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator.
Miss T says NatWest should prove that it didnt say it would agree to lend to them, if they 
returned the grant. NatWest says it cant do that, its sent us the only call recording it can find 
between Miss Ts broker and its business development team. 
Just because NatWest doesnt have a recording of the call Miss Ts broker says he had with 
NatWest, doesnt mean Miss T and Mr Ms complaint will be upheld. It just means that there 
isnt any evidence of what was said. So I still have to decide here whats more likely to have 
happened. 
Miss T has said she and Mr M wouldnt have returned this grant money if they hadnt got a 
guarantee that their lending would be approved. I do accept that this is what Miss T and Mr 
M had understood  that returning the grant guaranteed their lending. But that doesnt mean 
this is what NatWest said. NatWest has been adamant that it did not guarantee it would approve any lending. Its said 
this just isnt something its business development manager would say  she knows that 
applications have to be underwritten, and its the underwriters who make the decision. 
I also havent been able to see anything that suggests to me NatWest had guaranteed 
lending would be made. Its internal notes dont suggest that at all. The policy described to 
Miss Ts broker doesnt offer any suggestion that a grant claimed in the last three months 
can be disregarded. Even the wording in the email from Miss Ts broker (which is not direct 
evidence of what NatWest said) only goes so far as to say that the business development 
manager had indicated that they would approve lending, which also falls rather short of the 
guarantee Miss T has described.
Because NatWest has accepted that its business development manager did speak to the 
broker, I think its likely that there was a conversation about whether the application could 
proceed at all, which we dont have a recording of. I think its likely that NatWests business 
development manager did say exceptions had been made in the past, where grants had 
been returned. Its also likely that she indicated this application might still succeed, if the 
grant was returned here. But its just not likely that she would guarantee this. 
As our investigator said, there are a large number of reasons why lending can be refused. 
So it isnt likely that a business development manager would offer any guarantee of lending 
to a broker. 
I realise that Miss T has understood there was a guarantee. I dont know where this 
misunderstanding crept in, and for the purposes of this decision, I dont need to decide that. 
What I do need to decide is whether what went wrong here is NatWests fault. And I dont 
think its likely that it was. 
I also realise that NatWest did then reconsider this application. I think thats in line with what 
Ive decided its likely NatWest did say, that exceptions have been made to its policy in the 
past. But just because NatWest has decided to make an exception in the past, doesnt mean 
it has to in this case. And here, it reviewed Mr M and Miss Ts application, and decided to 
stick to its policy of refusing to consider a business income when a grant has been taken in 
the last three months. 
Miss T also told us Mr M was entitled to and claimed the government grants offered during 
the pandemic and that he returned the latest grant which suggests hed had other grants 
prior to this. And she referred to how repaying this money had affected Mr Ms business 
account during tough times. I understand that the pandemic period was an exceptionally 
difficult time for small businesses like Mr Ms, but I dont think it was unreasonable or unfair 
for NatWest to decline to make an exception to its policy in this case, and to decide not to 
lend to Miss T and Mr M. 
I know that Mr M and Miss T will be very disappointed, but I dont think this complaint should 
be upheld.My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M and Miss T 
to accept or reject my decision before 12 October 2022.
