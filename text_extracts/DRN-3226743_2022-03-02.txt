The complaint
Mr and Mrs K complain about several issues they have had with their National Westminster 
Bank Plc (NatWest) mortgage in regard to a term extension.  They say:
NatWest took an unreasonably long period of time to respond to their initial request 
to extend the repayment of their mortgage during exceptional times in relation to the 
Covid-19 pandemic
NatWest didnt follow the procedures they said they would over the telephone and 
confirmed in an email, that a term extension period would commence from when an 
application had completed
They contacted NatWest numerous times to complete an application, no appointment 
had been made for them, so no formal application was completed
They didnt have the opportunity to discuss all repayment options as to how they may 
be able to extend the term under unprecedented circumstances they were 
experiencing
Their requests for a callback or email was ignored by one of NatWests advisers and 
NatWest were unable to explain their failures
Mr and Mrs K would like a 12-month mortgage extension, but NatWest are only allowing 
them six. They are unhappy about this.
What happened
Mr and Mrs K took out a NatWest One account in 2002. A One account is normally a current 
account which is linked to the mortgage. The original term of this mortgage ended in 2014. 
NatWest have extended the mortgage term on numerous occasions to allow Mr and Mrs K 
time to review their options and plans for the repayment of the mortgage. 
During the pandemic, Mr Ks business had closed, and he said that both he and Mrs K were 
experiencing financial difficulties. They said they contacted NatWest on 1 April 2020 to 
discuss extending the term of their mortgage by 12 months, but they didnt ask for a payment 
holiday. 
Mr and Mrs K spoke to an adviser on 8 April 2020 who assured them they would be very 
understanding of the situation and Mr K said they exchanged emails over the next few 
months. NatWest sent an email dated 19 June 2020 where they told Mr and Mrs K that 
someone would be in touch in July 2020 to arrange an appointment and discuss their 
situation. 
Mr and Mrs K said that NatWest didnt contact them until the middle of August 2020, but Mr 
K was at work and unable to speak to them. Mr K said he then sent an email to NatWest 
apologising that he was unable to speak to them and explained he would call back  which 
he did on 26 August 2020. But the adviser wasnt able to access Mr and Mrs Ks details and 
so couldnt arrange an appointment. 
Mr K said he called NatWest again on 7 September 2020 to discuss arranging an 
appointment and he was told that a term extension wouldnt commence until after an 
application was made. Mr K said that they received an email on 15 September 2020 
confirming that there had been a response from NatWests lending team about the 12-month 
term extension, but the team said the extension would be six months from the application. 
Mr K said the adviser who sent the email said he could arrange an appointment for them to 
complete the application. Mr and Mrs K didnt hear anything. Mr K said they complained to 
the adviser about how things were being handled and asked the adviser to speak to the 
lending team about how they could extend the term of the mortgage  but again they didnt 
hear anything from NatWest. They said NatWest told them in writing that an extension of six 
months would be considered from when an application was completed. But Mr and Mrs K 
said that NatWest didnt give them the opportunity to complete the application. 
Mr and Mrs K said they didnt have the opportunity to discuss other alternatives available to 
them, so they made a complaint and received NatWests final response on 20 October 2020. 
NatWest explained that the term of Mr and Mrs Ks mortgage expired in August 2020. They 
confirmed they would only allow a further six-month extension due to the circumstances 
surrounding the pandemic. 
NatWest agreed that they could have dealt with things better in how they communicated with 
Mr and Mrs K, and offered £300 as an apology which they paid into Mr and Mrs Ks NatWest 
One account.
Mr K said he tried to call the adviser between October and December 2020 to explain that no 
application had yet been made and that they still didnt have the opportunity to discuss their 
options with NatWest. Mr and Mrs K said they were still having a challenging time and did 
not accept the compensation that NatWest offered. They said they received a letter from 
NatWest on 12 November 2020 which explained they tried to contact Mr and Mrs K, but they 
were not able to. Mr and Mrs K do not understand how they were not able to make contact. 
Mr K said that due to the work that he does, it wasnt possible for him to focus on cashing in 
on his investments or sell assets or explore equity release  due to the restrictions with 
surveyors being allowed to visit properties.
Mr and Mrs K would like NatWest to discuss options available to repay the mortgage and 
would like to submit a formal application to extend the term of their mortgage for 12 months. 
Mr and Mrs K have said that since bringing their complaint to our service, they received a 
letter from NatWest dated 31 March 2021 demanding immediate payment of the outstanding 
balance on the mortgage. They felt that the threat of action being taken against them and the 
fact that credit reference agencies would be informed, both unacceptable and threatening.  
They dont understand why its been sent when all they have been trying to do is 
communicate with NatWest about options for their mortgage. 
Mr and Mrs K said they have continued to attempt to speak to someone at NatWest, but 
nothing has transpired. So, they wrote another letter of complaint to NatWest who offered Mr 
and Mrs K £100 for the poor service. Mr and Mrs K have said they do not accept this. 
As they were unhappy, they brought the complaint to our service where it was looked at by 
one of our investigators. Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint about the term 
extension as she felt that NatWest had done enough. But she thought that NatWest should 
pay a further £200 for the trouble and upset caused to Mr and Mrs K. So she thought the 
total amount to be paid to Mr and Mrs K should be £600.
NatWest agreed with what our investigator said but Mr and Mrs K disagreed. They said they 
are exploring different repayment options which include equity release. But their property is 
unique and very valuable so its taking some time to organise. Mr and Mrs K said 
considering all the issues they have had, they consider financial compensation to be an 
insult and will not accept such money being offered. They are not looking for compensation 
and all they are after is to be treated fairly and with courtesy. They said that NatWest have 
failed to do this. They will not accept any financial compensation as they consider themselves to be above this. Mr and Mrs K said they have asked NatWest for three simple 
things:
NatWest to apologise for the threatening letter they sent 
assurance that the credit reference agencies are not involved in the matter
the opportunity to discuss the term extension with a senior person in authority at 
NatWest 
As Mr and Mrs K disagreed with our investigator, the case has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs K have provided very detailed information regarding their complaint and I 
understand they feel very strongly about it. I want to assure Mr and Mrs K that I have taken 
into account everything they have said, but if there is something that I havent mentioned, its 
not because it hasnt been considered  it has, and I have thought very carefully about the 
arguments they have made. 
Term extension
The crux of the matter here is that Mr and Mrs K wanted to arrange a further 12-month 
extension on their mortgage before it expired in August 2020. They contacted NatWest in 
April 2020 to try and arrange this with enough time before the term ended. There have been 
a number of issues regarding the service that NatWest provided which I will touch on later in 
the decision. 
Mr and Mrs K were experiencing some financial difficulties as a result of Covid-19, so they 
wanted to give themselves more time in order to sort out their finances and pay off the 
mortgage. 
Having looked at the information and emails that have been provided by NatWest, its seems 
that the information provided to Mr and Mrs K via email suggested it may have been possible 
for NatWest to offer Mr and Mrs K a 12-month term extension  which is what Mr and Mrs K 
wanted.
However, I have seen an email from NatWest dated 21 July 2020 explaining to Mr and Mrs K 
that NatWest had given them a final term extension in 2019 to allow Mr and Mrs K time to 
seek independent financial advice on alternative methods of repaying the mortgage. 
NatWest acknowledge that due to the uncertain times surrounding the pandemic, they were 
prepared to offer Mr and Mrs K a further six-month term extension. And that if Mr and Mrs K 
wanted to do this, they could speak to an adviser to complete an application.
There is a further email dated 15 September 2020 to Mr K to explain that NatWest would 
only be able to extend the term by six months. The email then tells Mr K to let NatWest know 
when it may be a convenient time to complete the application. 
I understand that there were issues in getting this application completed, but NatWest did 
make it clear that they were only able to provide a six-month term extension, so even though 
Mr and Mrs K wanted one for 12 months, this wasnt possible. NatWest had informed Mr and 
Mrs K that they were not able to offer an extension for 12-months so based on what Ive 
seen, Im satisfied that NatWest were clear they could only offer one for six months. 
I appreciate that Covid-19 had an impact on Mr and Mrs K and this especially affected Mr 
Ks business. But Mr and Mrs K had already had a term extension in August 2019, so they 
had up until August 2020 to think about ways of repaying their mortgage. I know the 
pandemic made things difficult for them, but NatWest would have agreed a further six-month term extension taking the term to February 2021. I think this was fair and reasonable for 
NatWest to do given the situation that the country was in at the time, and this is what we 
would have expected them to do. 
I understand there were issues in getting the application done and Mr and Mrs K feel that 
they were not given the opportunity to do so, but those six months have now passed, and 
the situation still remains the same. And even if the 12-month extension had been agreed by 
NatWest, that term would have ended in August 2021. Mr and Mrs K have had this extension 
informally while our service has been investigating their complaint. I do completely 
understand that things were very difficult during the pandemic, but things have started to 
ease so I do believe that Mr and Mrs K would have been able to look at other viable options. 
I think whats more important to point out is that Mr and Mrs Ks original mortgage term 
ended in February 2014 and NatWest extended the term by a further three years to allow 
investments to mature. NatWest said they were aware that the repayment of the mortgage 
was going to be made from the sale of Mr Ks business and paintings. The term was due to 
end in March 2017 and then the term was extended again until March 2018. NatWest said 
that Mr and Mrs K asked for a further term extension for two years but only a further 12 
months was agreed  taking it to August 2019. The term was then extended further taking it 
to August 2020. So taking this all into account, Mr and Mrs Ks mortgage term has been 
extended a number of times, giving them the opportunity to try and repay it. NatWest have 
every right to ask for the mortgage to be repaid. The original mortgage offer set out the 
terms of the mortgage and Im satisfied NatWest have given Mr and Mrs K enough time to 
try and think about this and put things into action. 
I understand that Mr and Mrs K feel very strongly about their complaint, but I wont be asking 
NatWest to provide a further term extension. I think that Mr and Mrs K have had ample time 
to try and get things sorted out and I fear agreeing to any further term extensions is just 
delaying the situation. Mr and Mrs K may want to seek independent financial advice to 
discuss options that may be available to them.
Customer service
I think there isnt any doubt here that NatWest have fallen short in their communication with 
Mr and Mrs K so I am not intending on going into detail here about what has happened as 
both parties agree that things could have gone much better. 
Mr and Mrs K have tried very hard to try and get a term extension on their mortgage and 
they made numerous attempts to speak to NatWest in order to get this arranged. An 
application was never made, and I do understand that Mr and Mrs K are very unhappy about 
this  because they were told that they could get a six-month term extension if they applied 
for one. And I do agree that they havent been given the opportunity to discuss various 
options with NatWest, but NatWest did make it clear that they would only offer six months. 
NatWest should have informed Mr and Mrs K sooner than they did what they needed to do in 
order to apply for a term extension and they didnt give Mr and Mrs K the chance to speak to 
someone which is what they wanted to do at the time. 
NatWest did offer Mr and Mrs K £400 overall for the trouble and upset they caused, and our 
investigator told NatWest to increase this by a further £200  making it £600 in total. I do 
think under the circumstances, this is fair and reasonable as the actions of NatWest did 
impact Mr and Mrs K.  NatWest have acknowledged that their communication could have 
been better, and I think this amount reflects that. 
I appreciate that Mr and Mrs K have made it very clear that they do not want any 
compensation and that they will not accept it. It will be entirely up to them to decide if they 
accept or reject this decision. 
Mr and Mrs K have explained to us what they would like NatWest to do, and they explained 
this in the three points as detailed above in the decision.I am not able to ask NatWest to apologise for the letter that was sent regarding the balance 
that needed to be paid or ask NatWest to contact the credit reference agencies to withdraw 
any information they provided to them. This is because the term of the mortgage had expired 
and like I already mentioned, NatWest had every right to ask for the mortgage to be repaid 
as per the terms and conditions of the mortgage contract. The mortgage term had ended in 
August 2020, so I think it was reasonable for NatWest to send this letter out. I understand Mr 
and Mrs K found the actions that NatWest wanted to take threatening, but I think that 
NatWest were explaining next steps and what they intended to do  as the mortgage hadnt 
been repaid.  Had an extension been granted for six months, this would have taken the term 
to February 2021, so I think its reasonable that NatWest waited until after that period to 
send the letter. 
I understand why Mr and Mrs K dont want NatWest to contact the credit reference agencies, 
but their mortgage term has now ended so NatWest are not unreasonable in informing them 
of this.
Mr and Mrs K already have their answer from NatWest so its not for me to ask a senior 
member of NatWest to discuss this matter with Mr and Mrs K. NatWest has issued their final 
answer on the matter and we wouldnt reasonably expect further discussions to take place 
about a complaint that has been referred to our service while were in the process of making 
a decision.  This case has been passed to me to make a final decision and its been left with 
me to decide the outcome of this complaint. I am satisfied that NatWest have given Mr and 
Mrs K enough time to put plans in motion to repay the outstanding balance. 
Mr and Mrs K and NatWest should liaise with each other to agree how this mortgage will 
now be repaid. NatWest may be entitled to take recovery action if no agreement is made or 
the mortgage is not repaid.
I understand that Mr and Mrs K will be disappointed with my decision, but I wont be asking 
NatWest to do anything further than what I have already stipulated in this decision. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and require National Westminster Bank 
Plc to pay Mr and Mrs K a further £200 for the trouble and upset they have caused taking the 
total compensation to £600.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K and Mr K to 
accept or reject my decision before 29 March 2022.
