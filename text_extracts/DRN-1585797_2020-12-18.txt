The complaint
Mr G complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) gave him a loan when it 
shouldnt have.
What happened
In late June 2014 Mr G says that he approached NatWest as he needed some help with his 
overdraft. After discussions with NatWest, he took out a loan and a credit card with it.
In 2019, Mr G complained to NatWest and said it shouldnt have have given him this loan. 
He said that he only wanted the interest on his overdraft frozen and felt forced into taking out 
the loan. He was concerned that NatWest had recorded that the loan was for a car, when he 
didnt need or want a car at that time. Mr G felt that the loan actually worsened his financial 
position and he says he started to gamble as his debts increased.
NatWest responded to say that it didnt think it had acted wrongly when it provided the loan. 
It said that the application for the loan went through all of its usual checks for affordability 
and satisfied its criteria for lending. It explained that Mr G would have given the information 
about the loan purpose and that he didnt make it aware that this was a mistake at the time.
Mr G referred his complaint to this service, where our investigator said that NatWest had 
acted fairly in giving him the loan too. He felt that NatWest had performed proportionate 
checks into the affordability of the loan and that on that basis, it was fair to give Mr G the 
loan.
Mr G disagreed and so the case has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill start just by briefly addressing the fact that Mr G has asked us to look into a credit card 
NatWest provided him too. Our investigator has explained that as this wasnt covered as a 
part of this complaint when it was raised with NatWest  so NatWest has asked to be able to 
first consider this before this service looks into the matter. So my decision here will focus on 
the complaint about the loan.
Generally, it is a matter for a business to decide who it lends to and, if it does lend to 
someone, how much and on what terms. But a business should perform proportionate 
checks into the affordability of any lending it is providing. Those checks will depend on a 
number of factors, there are no set tests a business has to follow. So Ive looked at what 
NatWest did here in terms of checking whether this loan was affordable.
Ive seen that NatWest performed a number of checks here. It took account of Mr Gs 
income and expenditure and then performed its usual internal checks and followed its 
processes to ensure the application met its internal criteria. Based on the information Ive 
seen, this showed that the loan was affordable. It also looked at his credit file and 
considering all of the information it had, decided to lend. This seems reasonable and 
proportionate in the circumstances here.
Mr G says that he didnt complete any such document giving details of his income and 
expenditure, but NatWests records would suggest that it took account of this. NatWests 
checks seem to have also taken into account the conduct of his current account which he 
held with it and decided, based on this that the loan was affordable. Having seen the 
statements for this account, that doesnt seem like an unreasonable conclusion to have 
made.
In any event, I note that Mr G didnt raise any concerns with NatWest about this at the time 
as Id expect someone to if there were clear mistakes made in an application. Instead it took 
Mr G several years to do that. I realise that Mr G has been in financial difficulties and may 
have only recently thought about this, but overall here, Im satisfied that NatWest did take 
into account his income and expenditure at the time, in what looks like a reasonable way.
Mr G says that he also provided details of the rent he was paying at the time. But theres no 
evidence that NatWest was told about this during the application. And NatWest has said 
there was no clear evidence of rental payments on his credit file either. So without being told 
about this, or knowing about the payments in any other way  such as from his account 
statements, I cant see how NatWest couldve been aware of this. 
Ive taken on board Mr Gs comments that the adviser in the branch put the purpose of the 
loan down as for a car. I asked NatWest about this and it explained that its records show that 
the purpose was for a used car. That seems strange, if the loan was intended to be used by 
Mr G to consolidate his overdraft.
The loan was provided so long ago, its difficult to get any other evidence other than 
NatWests historic records here. Those show that the loan was credited to Mr Gs current 
account and did repay his overdraft. It may be that the loan was intended to be used to buy a 
car, or not. But ultimately, it wasnt used for that purpose here from what Ive seen. Thats 
not a reason, by itself, to say that NatWest shouldnt have lent. I say that as ultimately, the 
loan was used in line with how Mr G wanted to use it  to reduce his existing borrowing, 
which the statements show it did.
Its clear from the statements that Mr G fell back into his overdraft fairly quickly after the loan 
was approved, but that seems to have been as a result of a number of transactions and 
payments he made. Most of these are categorised as point of sale transactions, without any 
more information than that  so they appear to be normal transactions and payments. I dont 
think this wouldve been foreseeable for NatWest at the point he applied for the loan. 
Mr G has mentioned gambling as a reason that NatWest shouldnt have lent too. But theres 
no obvious signs of significant gambling transactions before the loan was approved and any 
gambling transactions only show after the loan was approved. Again, I dont see how that 
couldve been foreseeable for NatWest.
As Mr G didnt make payments to his loan in line with the terms, it was closed and 
transferred to a debt recovery agent, where its been for a number of years. While that will 
have an impact on Mr Gs credit file, this has meant that hes been able to make reduced 
repayments to the debt in a way thats suitable for him  without the balance increasing any 
further. That is a positive approach to have taken here to help with his difficulties.
So overall here, Im satisfied that NatWest did act responsibly when it provided Mr G with 
this loan. It performed proportionate checks into the affordability of it and acted positively when Mr G couldnt make his payments. It follows that theres nothing more I can ask 
NatWest to do here.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 January 2021.
