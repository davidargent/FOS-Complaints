The complaint
Mr C complains about the amount that he's been charged by LeasePlan UK Limited for 
damage to a car that he returned when his hire agreement ended.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the hire agreement - which was signed by Mr C - said: "if, when this agreement,
ends, the Vehicle is for any reason in a condition not consistent with the performance
of your obligations (fair wear and tear as defined by the British Vehicle Rental and
Leasing Association excepted), we shall be entitled to reclaim from you a sum
equivalent to the actual or estimated cost of repairs ...";
the car was collected and inspected in July 2019 when the agreement ended and a
report was prepared which identified damage to two of the wheels, the rear bumper
and the tailgate, it included photos of the damage and it estimated that the total
repair cost was £415;
Mr C accepted the charges of £70 for the damage to each of the two front wheels
and offered to pay 50% of each of the £100 charged for the rear bumper and the
£175 charged for the tailgate - and he says that he has been paying for the car based
on a total mileage of 75,000 over three years but he's driven less than 50,000 miles
in the car so LeasePlan has  already been more than adequately compensated (the
car's mileage was recorded in the inspection report as 49,624);
as Mr C has accepted the charges for the damage to the wheels, I won't be
commenting on those charges;
I consider that the photos in the inspection report show that the car's rear bumper
and tailgate were damaged when the car was returned by Mr C and that the damage
is more than would reasonably be considered to be fair wear and tear in these
circumstances - so I find that it's fair and reasonable for LeasePlan to charge Mr C
for that damage;
the hire agreement included an annual mileage allowance of 25,000 miles after which
excess mileage charges would be applied - but the fact that Mr C had used the car
for less than the mileage allowance doesn't mean that he isn't liable for any damage
to the car that's more than fair wear and tear; and
DRN-1214962I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that LeasePlan has acted
incorrectly in connection with these charges - so I find that it wouldn't be fair
or reasonable for me to require it to reduce or waive the amount that it's charged Mr
C for the damage to the car or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2020.
