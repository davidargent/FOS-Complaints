Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Hs complaint in part and thought the loans from July 2010  (loan  
3) onwards shouldnt  have been given.  QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint was passed  
to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN22052892But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading (OFT) guidance defined  sustainable  as 
being without  undue  difficulties  in particular without incurring or increasing problem 
indebtedness, over the life of the credit  agreement,  out of income  and/or  savings  and without 
having to realise  security or assets.  And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought 
fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments 
sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Mr H has confirmed that he accepts  the adjudication that loans  1 and 2 werent incorrectly  
lent. As there isnt a continuing dispute  about  these loans, Ive focussed my decision on the 
loans that remain  in dispute  loans 3 to12.
QuickQuid says that before it lent any of the loans to Mr H, it checked his income,  
employment and housing status.  It also says that it searched his credit  file but hasnt 
provided the results  of its searches.  Mr H has provided a copy  of his credit file and bank 
statements, and from what I can see there were no adverse entries like defaults or county 
court judgements (CCJs)  recorded on his file.
There was a break of nearly six months  between the repayment of loan 2 and the start of 
loan 3. Given that Mr H had a short history of borrowing from QuickQuid at this stage and 
hed repaid his previous loans without  any obvious repayment difficulties, I think  this gap in 
lending was sufficient  to break  the lending chain and QuickQuid could  reasonably believe 
Mr H wasnt reliant  on the loans.
Ref: DRN22052893So Ive thought about QuickQuids checks before  approving loan 3 and I dont think its 
checks went far enough. I think in addition to checking Mr Hs income  QuickQuid should 
have been checking his normal  living costs  and regular credit commitments. I say this 
because Mr H was borrowing nearly half of his declared income  of £2,216  and QuickQuid 
shouldve been  concerned that there was a high risk hed struggle to repay  it. Loan 4 was 
similar in amount and by the time of this loan Mr H had shown  some  signs of repayment 
difficulties as he repaid  loan 3 late, so I think QuickQuid  should also have taken its checks  
further and checked Mr Hs normal living costs and short  term credit  commitments.  The 
repayments for both these  loans were significant  compared to Mr Hs income  he was due 
to repay  a total of £1,450  for loan 3 and £1,400 for loan 4.
From the bank statements Mr H provided,  I can see that around the time of loan 3 his regular 
credit commitments  were around £843   without  taking  into account reasonable living costs 
such a food, housing,  travel,  I think QuickQuid would likely have found that Mr H couldnt 
sustainably repay  this loan as the repayment was due to take up a significant part of his 
income. I understand that Mr H could repay the loan over two periods and he was due to 
repay £1,450 in total which meant in effect he was repaying an average  of £725 per month  
over the repayment  period. Even with the repayment  averaged out, I think  Mr H wouldve 
struggled to repay this loan in the circumstances, as he was left with less than £650 to cover  
his essential monthly  living costs and other  necessary expenses. Mr H told QuickQuid that 
he was renting at the time and he has told this service his rent was around £900 and his 
other essential expenses including things  like food and travel were over £250. Mr H was in a 
similar position at the time of loan 4 and I dont  think he could afford  to make the repayments 
to loan 4 either.
So QuickQuid shouldnt  have  lent Mr H loans 3 and 4 because  proportionate checks  would 
likely have shown that Mr Hs expenses  exceeded  his income. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
5. I say this because by loan 5, Mr H had been borrowing from QuickQuid without any 
significant breaks for around 7 months.  The loan amounts had stayed the same  in this 
lending chain and so Mr H was consistently borrowing close  to half of his monthly income.
From loan 5 onwards Mr H was provided  with a new loan within  a short time of settling  a 
previous one. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr H was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr H wasnt making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid. By loan 12, Mr H 
had been borrowing from QuickQuid over a period of four years and the loan amounts and 
frequency of borrowing  increased throughout the period. Loan 12 was for £1,400, seven 
times more  than loan 1. Mr H had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt 
to QuickQuid over an extended period and encountered payment difficulties.
Ref: DRN22052894QuickQuid continued  to provide borrowing from loan 5 onwards  and I think  that Mr H lost out 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Hs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5 to 12 and QuickQuid should put things 
right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 3 to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 and 4 from Mr Hs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 to 12 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
should pay Mr H compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 September 2019.
