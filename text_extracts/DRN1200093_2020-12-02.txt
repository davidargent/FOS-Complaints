K822xcomplaint
Mrs B has complained that AvantCredit of UK LLC lent to her irresponsibly.
background 
I issued a provisional decision about this complaint  in November 2020 that I summarise 
below.
Mrs B was given a loan of £4,000  by AvantCredit in July 2016. The loan was due to be
repaid in 36 monthly instalments of about  £189.  If the loan ran to term, the total amount
repayable including interest  was just over £6,811. 
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, in particular the checks  that 
AvantCredit needed to do such as the amount being lent, and the consumers income and 
expenditure. 
AvantCredit needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend to Mrs B
irresponsibly. I considered  some key questions in order  to decide whats fair
and reasonable in the circumstances of this particular  complaint:
Did AvantCredit carry out reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself that 
Mrs B was in a position to sustainably repay the loan? If not, what would reasonable 
and proportionate checks have shown at the time? Did AvantCredit make  a fair 
lending decision?
Did AvantCredit act unfairly or unreasonably towards Mrs B in some other way?
AvantCredit was required to establish  whether Mrs B could sustainably  repay  her loan - not
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesn't automatically follow  this is the case. This
is because the relevant  regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to
make their repayments without borrowing further.
I carefully considered  all the evidence, arguments and information Ive seen about  this
matter and what it means for Mrs B.
AvantCredit asked  Mrs B for information  about  her income and it acquired a credit  report
which AvantCredit says it used to identify any pre-existing debt obligations. AvantCredit 
cross-referenced these  amounts to Mrs Bs net monthly income to assess the affordability
of its loan.
AvantCredits Affordability Report doesnt  show significantly adverse information but it does 
show that Mrs B had opened  5 new accounts in the previous 3 months and that she had 5 
card accounts and 2 loan accounts. Whilst I could see from Mrs Bs application form that 
AvantCredit asked  about her income,  Id not seen what checks AvantCredit  carried out to 
assess Mrs Bs regular  monthly total expenditure. 
Ref: DRN12000932Mrs B was applying to AvantCredit for a costly  loan, and she had to maintain her repayments 
every month for three years. Taking everything  into account, I would have expected the 
lender to want to obtain a thorough understanding of Mrs Bs financial circumstances - 
including an independent check of her regular  monthly expenses  - to satisfy itself that she 
could sustainably meet her loan repayments  over the whole loan term. Overall,  from what  Id 
seen, I couldnt  fairly  say that the checks AvantCredit carried  out were  fair, reasonable and
proportionate.
So as well as asking  Mrs B about  her income  and acquiring a credit check, I thought
AvantCredit should have carried out more detailed and independent checks into Mrs Bs
financial circumstances - for example by asking to see her bank statements.
Mrs B provided us with copies of her bank statements for the months leading up to her
loan application  so I could determine what better  checks might have shown AvantCredit at 
that time.  And I considered this information in light of what  Ive set out above.
Of course,  different checks  might show different things. But I thought  if AvantCredit had 
carried out what I consider to be proportionate checks, I thought  its likely it would have 
discovered more about Mrs Bs financial position. The bank  statements Ive seen for the 
month prior to Mrs Bs loan show signs of financial distress: Mrs B was significantly 
overdrawn, she had exceeded her overdraft  limit and had received emergency funding  from 
her bank. The statements  also appear  to show that Mrs B was spending a considerable 
amount in regular  betting transactions as well as borrowing from other lenders, including  a 
£2,000 loan taken in early  June.
I thought that Mrs B was already having serious  difficulties managing her finances  when she 
applied for her loan with AvantCredit. And as Id explained, AvantCredit was required to 
establish whether  Mrs B could sustainably make her loan repayments over the entire loan 
term. I thought if AvantCredit had carried  out proportionate checks on Mrs Bs finances it 
ought reasonably  to have realised that she was having problems managing  her finances and 
that she was most likely borrowing as a result of gambling - and would also most likely need 
to borrow elsewhere  to repay her loan from AvantCredit. I would have  expected AvantCredit 
to realise that it was unlikely that Mrs B would be able to sustainably  repay  her loan. So it 
ought reasonably  to have concluded that it was not appropriate  to lend to her.
Overall, Id not seen  anything which  made me think that AvantCredit  treated Mrs B unfairly
in any other  way. But I didnt think that she should  have been  given  the loan. So I thought
AvantCredit should put things right for Mrs B.
I invited both parties to send me any further comments or evidence. Both Mrs B and 
AvantCredit responded and said they accepted my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to thank both parties for all the information  that has been provided about  this matter 
and for responding to my initial findings. As both parties have accepted  my provisional 
Ref: DRN12000933decision, I confirm  the conclusion  I reached in my provisional decision and I uphold  this 
complaint. 
Putting things  right
Mrs B has told us that the loan has been  repaid.  I think its fair and reasonable for Mrs B to 
repay the principal  amount that she borrowed, because she had the benefit  of that lending. 
But she has paid interest and charges on a loan that shouldnt have been provided to her. 
So AvantCredit should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges  from the loan and treat all the payments Mrs B 
made as payments towards the capital.
If reworking Mrs Bs loan account results  in her having effectively made payments 
above the original capital  borrowed, then AvantCredit should refund  these  
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments,  from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen,  to the complaint is settled*.
If reworking the account does still leave  an amount of capital to be paid, then
AvantCredit should try to agree  an affordable repayment plan with Mrs B, bearing in 
mind its obligation  to treat her positively and sympathetically in these discussions.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mrs Bs credit  file in relation to the 
loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to deduct tax from this interest. AvantCredit
should give Mrs B a certificate  showing how much tax its deducted, if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I uphold this complaint  and direct AvantCredit of UK LLC to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 January 2021.
