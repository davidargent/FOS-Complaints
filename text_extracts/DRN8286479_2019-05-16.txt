K820x#14complaint
Ms W says Lloyds  Bank Plc (Lloyds) mis-sold  her Silver,  Platinum  and Premier  packaged  
bank accounts.  Shes  used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to complain.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  into Ms Ws complaint and didnt think  Lloyds had
mis-sold the accounts.  The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Ms Ws complaint. 
Having carefully looked  at everything  provided,  Im not upholding Ms Ws complaint. Id like 
to explain the reasons  for my decision.  I think Ms W chose to take the accounts. She 
appears to have had identifiable needs  for the main  benefits on them Silver account and she 
couldve used some of them too. 
So overall I dont  think that clearer information wouldve changed Ms Ws decision  to accept 
what looks to have  been a fair recommendations made by Lloyds. And, in these 
circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Ms Ws complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Ms W to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 June 2019.
