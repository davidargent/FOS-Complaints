Loans 1, 2 and 3 were structured as two repayment  loans. The highest repayments are 
shown in the table and the first smaller repayment is the difference between that and the 
total sum due. 
Loan 4 had instalments due of around £302  on 28 February, £260 on 31 March  and £1,285  
on 28 April 2017. 
Loan 5 had instalments due of around £234  on 28 April, £198 on 31 May and £930 on 
30 June 2017.
Loan 6 the instalments were around £18 due on 28 April, £40 on 31 May and £186 on 
30 June 2017.
Loan 7  around £26 on 31 July, £50 on 31 August and £246  on 29 September 2017. 
Mr A received a warning  of him being in default  on 1 September  2017 in relation to the late 
payment of instalment two on Loan  7. It remains outstanding.
Mr A complained to QuickQuid in June 2018. Its final response letter  to Mr As representative  
was fairly  short.  
Upon receipt of Mr As complaint at this service QuickQuids submissions to us were  more 
detailed. I refer to this more thoroughly in the my findings section below. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint and he thought that QuickQuid should put 
things right in relation  to Loans  2 to 7. 
QuickQuid did not agree and sent to us the thirteen page document  to which its affordability 
review relates and has asked us to consider its statement that we regret to inform  you that 
Ref: DRN88625232we cannot agree to FOS recommendations. QuickQuid goes on to say that it provided us 
detailed information  why the loans  were responsibly  lent in the first set of submissions.  
I refer to these more thoroughly in the my findings section of my decision below. 
Mr As representative received our adjudicators opinion and apart from acknowledging it, 
has not added anything further. So I do not think that Mr A disagrees with the adjudicators 
opinion in relation to Loan 1.
The disputed loans  seem  to be Loans  2 to 7 which I will review.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner 
without it adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. The 
key element was that any checks needed  to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different  things,  including how much was being lent and when  the sum being  
borrowed was due to be repaid. 
I have decided to uphold Mr As complaint in relation to Loans 2 to 7 and I give my relatively 
brief reasoning here. 
QuickQuid gave details  of the checks,  credit bureau searches and calculations it did for Mr A 
taking this research  into account and presented a table to show  how it came to Mr As 
estimated disposable income -  EDI.  These  EDI figures were as follows (rounded):
Loan 1 £1,291
Loan 2 £1,291
Loan 3 £475
Loan 4 £597
Loan 5 £442
Loan 6 £133
Loan 7 £140
QuickQuid said since 01 March  2015, QuickQuid implemented [an] affordability review, 
which involved collecting  and validating income  and expense details from customers, in line 
with the FCA Handbook.  As such, we believe Mr [As] loans issued post 2015 were 
affordable.
In relation to these  submissions I have not received  the copies of any results of searches  or 
figures to substantiate  these calculations leading to these EDI figures. So I am less inclined 
to proceed on those figures.  
Ref: DRN88625233However, if I were to proceed  on those EDI figures I can see that QuickQuids own 
calculations demonstrated  that the EDI figures  were lower than the instalment sums 
(highest) Mr A was due to pay to QuickQuid on the loan structures devised by QuickQuid.  
Yet these  have been assessed by QuickQuid as affordable following its post-2015 
affordability review assessments. 
The affordability review  document  has been  sent to this service many times  and I have  
seen it before. QuickQuid  will be aware that we consider this to be an overview of the 
lending approach it says it carried out from March 2015, but we always  make the point that it 
is too general to be specifically  applicable  to the individual complainant  here Mr A. 
Loans 2 and 3 
The loan structure was for two instalments and the second being most  of the sum due  here 
the second instalment was about  £1,138   and QuickQuids  EDI figure  for Loan 2 does not 
accord with the information we have about  Mr As financial  situation.  Our understanding from 
looking at his bank  statements  is that Mr A owed  about £1,181 to one other short term lender 
at the time he applied  for Loan  2. These were four payments to that other  lender  and likely  
repayment s for the credit to him in mid-June 2016  of £925. 
So the QuickQuid  EDI calculations  after validating various factors  do not seem  to equate 
with this. But as I have not received any substantiating facts from QuickQuid for these EDI 
figures then I am going to proceed  with what I can see from Mr As bank statements. And 
I calculate that Mr A would not have had enough to repay Loan 2. So I uphold  Loan 2. 
The same situation  arises in relation to loan 3. I am able to see that Mr As regular income 
with his new job around this time was around £1,800  and his outgoings plus his outstanding 
other short term loans  meant that he would have had about £390 left over.  This would not 
have been enough to repay the second (highest) instalment. 
It is QuickQuids assertion to defend the complaint  about these loans that Mr A would have 
been asked to sign a declaration that he took the loan knowing that his EDI figure was less 
than the second or third instalment. And by doing this QuickQuid is relying on consent.  
I do not agree. As I have  already outlined the EDI figures  are presented  to us with no 
substantiating facts. And the example acknowledgment declaration is not specific to Mr As 
case or any of his loans  in particular. So I have no information about  this apparent 
acknowledgment by Mr A. 
And even  if the acknowledgements for Mr As specific  loans were  produced  to me, even on 
its own research (unsubstantiated to me) and calculations  the EDI figures would not be 
enough for Mr A to pay for the instalments and ostensibly put away additional amounts in 
order to be able to cover the cost of the final instalment.
And for Loans  2 and 3, considering Mr As debts to other lenders, then I doubt that he would  
have had the financial space to put some money  aside to ensure he had enough to reach 
the second instalment figures of £1,138  and of £628  for Loans  2 and 3 respectively.
I uphold Mr As complaint  for Loans  2 and 3. 
Loans 4 and 5
Ref: DRN88625234Loan 4 had two instalments of around  £302 and £260 (briefly outlined  just underneath the 
loan table)  and Mr As apparent EDI was £597.  The final instalment was due be £1,285.  
Using Loan 4 to demonstrate the consent point again, QuickQuid says Mr A had £597  
available for him to use for instalment one of £302  on 28 February, instalment two of £260 
on 31 March and instalment three of £1,285 on 28 April 2017. Assuming Mr A notionally  was 
to apply all of that £597 over three  months  to the total sum payable  (£1,848) then still Mr A 
would have been about £57 short.  And for Loan 5, applying  the same  logic, Mr A would have 
been about £36 short. 
I uphold Loans  4 and 5. 
Loans 6 and 7 
QuickQuids own EDI figures  for Loans  6 and 7 shows a marked drop and I would have 
expected it to want to know  the reasons why. QuickQuids own calculations for EDI show  
that between late November 2016 and mid-April  2017 Mr As EDI was less than a third of 
what it was. And although the principal borrowed for Loans 6 and 7 were lesser  amounts of 
£150 and £200 respectively, the EDI calculations  as well as being much  lower than before 
 were also too low to cover the second (of three) proposed instalment figures. And as 
I have said even on its own research  (unsubstantiated  to me) and calculations the EDI 
figures would  not be enough for Mr A to pay for the instalments  and ostensibly  put away 
additional amounts in order to be able to cover  the cost of the final instalment.
Our research from viewing Mr As bank  statements for the periods just before Loans 6 and 7 
shows that Mr A had a great deal of debt outstanding with other  short term lenders  about  
£1,188 and £800 respectively. And with this level of debt I do not consider that QuickQuid as 
a responsible lender would have lent to him. 
 
I uphold Mr As complaint  for Loans  6 and 7. 
putting things right
Because QuickQuid  should not have  given Mr A the loans  he took, its not right that Mr A     
should have to pay interest  or charges on these, or have them affect his credit file in a 
negative way. 
Then I think  it should do as follows:
refund  any interest and charges  already  paid by Mr A for Loans 2 to 7;
apply 8% simple interest  per year to any interest  and charges refunded from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse payment information  about  the loans from Mr As credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest and it must  
give Mr A the certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN88625235my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr As complaint in part and direct  that CashEuroNet UK 
LLC put things  right in the way I have said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 May 2019.
