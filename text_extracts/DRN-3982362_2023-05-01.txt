The complaint
Mr H complains that Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited mishandled his claim on a motor 
insurance policy. 
What happened
The subject matter of the claim and the complaint is a sports utility vehicle, first registered in 
2011.
Mr H had the vehicle insured on a comprehensive policy with Admiral for the year from April 
2022. Any claim for damage (except a windscreen claim) was subject to an excess of 
£310.00.
Unfortunately, in May 2022, an accident damaged the car. Admiral said it was a total loss.
Admiral said that the cars pre-accident value had been £6,910. After deducting the excess 
of  £310.00, Admiral paid Mr H the balance of £6,600.00.
Mr H complained to Admiral that it was under-valuing the car.
By a final response dated 9 June 2022, Admiral turned down the complaint. Admiral referred 
to figures in the trade guides as follows:
CAP £6,625.00
Glasss £6,910.00
Mr H brought his complaint to us on about 3 December 2022.
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld in part. He thought that  
£7,075.50 was a fairer valuation than £6,910.00. He recommended that Admiral should pay 
Mr H:
1. an additional £165.50; and
2. 8% simple annual interest on £165.50, calculated from 26 May 2022 until the date 
the payment is made.
Admiral accepted the investigators opinion.
Mr H disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. He says, in summary, that:
He waited three months for the vehicle to be built in 2011. It was one of only 10,500 
built that year. It had an extensive specification.
Admiral said that he would be able to afford an exact replacement with their 
settlement. The policy wording is misleading and has caused him to be 
disadvantaged.
In early 2022, the car was in great condition with a complete and full service history. 
That included the 10-year anniversary work. The gearbox oil change and the cam 
belt change are significant additional costs and are not just annual routine service 
costs. Those extra costs should be a component factor in assessing the condition of 
any vehicle. If those two service items had been missed on a vehicle for sale, then it 
would not be unreasonable to expect that vehicle to be comparably cheaper than 
others on the market, given that £1,000.00 or so of work was immediately due.
The car had only one owner.
He was unable to find a replacement with anything approaching the same 
specification in 6 months with the offered settlement. On only one occasion, he was 
able to find a potential, closer replacement vehicle with either the gearbox oil change 
or the cam belt replacement completed.
Using averages of averages to determine a value will not adequately value a best of 
the best vehicle. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Ombudsman Service deals with an individual consumers complaint about 
regulated activities of regulated financial firms. Where we uphold a complaint about an unfair 
act or omission, we look at its impact on that consumer and we direct the firm to take steps 
to put that right. We dont direct the firm to change its terms of business for consumers 
generally.
Admirals policy terms said that the most it would pay would be the market value of the 
vehicle. The policy terms included the following definition: 
Market value
The cost of replacing your vehicle; with one of a similar make, model, year, mileage 
and condition based on market prices immediately before the loss happened. Use of 
the term market refers to where your vehicle was purchased. This value is based on 
research from industry recognised motor trade guides.
I cant say thats unclear or unfair. In any event, we expect an insurer to assess the value of 
a used vehicle by reference to the retail figures in certain trade guides. We usually find those 
guides persuasive as they are based on extensive research into likely selling prices.
Compared to the trade guides, we usually find advertisements less reliable as they show 
asking prices that may be negotiated downwards.
Ive noted the make, model, year, mileage, specification and condition of Mr Hs car. For a 
vehicle like that, our investigator found retail figures in the trade guides as follows: 
CAP £6,625.00
Glasss £6,910.00
Cazoo £7,222.00
Auto Trader £7,545.00The investigator recommended  and Admiral has now offered  a valuation of £7,075.50 
which is the average of those figures.
I accept that Mr Hs car had a full service history including the change of cambelt and 
gearbox oil. However, I dont consider that this added significantly to its value. Rather I 
consider that a purchaser would expect such work to be up to date - or expect to negotiate a 
lower price.
I accept that Mr H couldnt find a vehicle to replace his like-for-like for around £7,000.00.
Nevertheless, I consider that the figure of £7,075.50 is in line with the trade guides and not 
unfair. I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Admiral to increase it any further. 
Putting things right
To give effect to the increase from £6,910.00 to £7,075.50, I will direct Admiral to pay a 
further £165.50. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited to pay Mr H (in addition to its payment of 
£6,600.00) :
1. a further £165.50; and
2. simple interest on £165.50 at a yearly rate of 8% from 26 May 2022 to the date of 
payment. If Admiral considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to take 
off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr H how much its taken off. It should 
also give him a certificate showing this if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax 
from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 May 2023.
