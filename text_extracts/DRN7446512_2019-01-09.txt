K821x#15complaint
Mr J complains that Uncle Buck  Finance LLP (Uncle Buck)  didnt carry out proper 
affordability checks and shouldnt have agreed to lend him the loans as he couldnt pay them  
back.
background
Mr J took out 9 short term loans between June  2014  and November 2015.  A summary of his 
borrowing is as follows;

Uncle Buck  says it took into consideration Mr Js monthly income, his expenditure and 
carried out a credit search when it assessed his loan applications. It says Mr J had enough 
disposable income and could afford the loans.
Our adjudicator felt this complaint should be partly  upheld. She said the checks  Uncle  Buck 
carried out for loans  1 and 2 were proportionate  and affordable for Mr J. 
At the point of the application  for loan 3 and beyond, our adjudicator says Uncle  Buck 
shouldve carried out a full review of Mr Js finances. She said if it had done more  checks  for 
these loans it wouldve  seen Mr J couldnt  afford  to repay them. She thought  these loans 
werent affordable  or sustainable  and that Mr J shouldnt have been given them. Our 
adjudicator also made  suggestions for Uncle Buck to put things right regarding  these  loans.
Uncle Buck  didnt agree and set out in detail the information it had taken into account and 
why it considered the loans affordable. It did offer a refund on loans 3 and 4 together  with 
the offer it had previously made in relation to loan 5. But it didnt set out how much this 
refund would be. As both parties still cant agree, this complaint  has been passed  to me to 
make a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN74465122I think the overarching  questions I need  to consider  in deciding  whats  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint are:
Did Uncle Buck, at the time it lent, complete  reasonable and proportionate checks  to 
satisfy itself that Mr J would be able to repay  in a sustainable way?
oIf not, would  those checks have shown that Mr J would have been 
able to do so.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Js indebtedness in a way that was otherwise 
unsustainable or harmful?
Did Uncle Buck act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some other way?
If I determine that Uncle Buck did not act fairly  and reasonably in its dealings with Mr J and 
that he has lost out as a result, I will go on to consider  what  is fair compensation.
Uncle Buck  was required to lend responsibly. It needed to make checks  to see whether Mr J 
could afford  to pay back the loans before it lent to him. Those  checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr J was borrowing and the length of the 
agreement. But there was no set list of checks Uncle Buck  had to do.
Uncle Buck  says it asked  about Mr Js income and expenditure and did a credit check. It 
says it relied on the information he gave.
I think the checks Uncle Buck carried out on loans 1 and 2 went  far enough. He was a new 
customer and the repayments for these loans were  relatively small.  The loan repayments 
appeared affordable on the information Uncle Buck had available. I dont think it would have 
seen anything that would have alerted it to carry  out any further checks  at this stage and 
from the information it had, I think it would have  seen that these loans were affordable  for     
Mr J. 
Mr J took out loan 3 on 10/11/2014  this was his largest request and the amounts had been 
increasing with each loan. There hadnt been  a significant break in the lending. I think Mr Js 
pattern of borrowing at this point suggested he mayve been becoming reliant on these 
loans. I think it wouldve been  reasonable and proportionate for Uncle  Buck to have asked 
more questions and carried out more checks. I think that by this stage it wasnt  enough just 
to rely on what Mr J was saying about  his income and outgoings  as his pattern of borrowing 
suggested he might be reliant on this sort of borrowing.
Uncle Buck  should  have  been looking to carry out a complete review of Mr Js finances  for 
loans 3 onwards.  One way it could have  done  this would be to look at his bank statements. It 
didnt have to ask for bank statements and could have verified Mr Js financial situation in 
other ways.  If it had done this, it would have seen  he had a number of other payday loans 
and other  financial  commitments on top of his expenditure. And when these  additional 
amounts are considered alongside Mr Js normal living costs,  he had no disposable income  
to repay  any of the loans from 3 to 9. These  loans  werent sustainable. 
Taking everything into account  I dont think Uncle Buck has shown its checks for loans 3 to 9 
were sufficient or proportionate  given Mr Js borrowing history or, the amounts borrowed.  I 
consider proportionate  checks would  have shown Uncle Buck that Mr J couldnt afford to 
Ref: DRN74465123repay the loans.  On balance I dont think these loans shouldve  been granted. So Uncle  
Buck should  put right what it did wrong.
putting things right
I dont think Uncle Buck should  have agreed to give Mr J loans 3 to 9 inclusive. So Uncle  
Buck should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to each of these loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Js credit file in relation to the refunded 
loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Mr Js complaint and direct  Uncle  Buck Finance LLP 
to put things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 February  2019.
