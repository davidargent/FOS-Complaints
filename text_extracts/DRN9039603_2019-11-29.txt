K820x#14complaint
Mr B says National  Westminster Bank  Plc unfairly closed his bank accounts.  He wants 
NatWest to reopen his accounts and pay him compensation for the trouble and upset hes 
been caused due to the closure of his accounts. 
Mr B is represented by his mother, Mrs B.
background
Mr B had three accounts with NatWest.
In January 2018, NatWest carried out a review of Mr Bs accounts. Following the review, it 
decided to close Mr Bs accounts.  And gave him 60 days notice to make  alternative banking 
arrangements. 
Mrs B complained to NatWest on behalf of her son. She said Mr B had been  a good 
customer of the bank for nearly 10 years. And he had always maintained his account 
properly. She said NatWests behaviour was unfair. And that Mr B has been caused a great  
deal of trouble  and upset as a result  of NatWests actions. In particular, Mrs B says Mr B 
hasnt been able to open another bank account,  his health has been  affected, and the 
closure has had a detrimental effect  on his ability to work.
NatWest said it hadnt  done anything wrong  when it closed the accounts and had acted in 
accordance with the terms  and conditions. NatWest also said it wouldnt reopen  Mr Bs 
accounts. Mrs B wasnt happy with this response. So, she brought the complaint to our 
service.
An investigator looked at Mr Bs complaint.  He said NatWest  hadnt done anything wrong 
when it closed Mr Bs accounts. Mrs B disagreed. She says Mr B hasnt done anything  
wrong and NatWest shouldnt have closed  his accounts. As no agreement  could be reached  
the matter has come  to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear from what Mrs B has told us and NatWest that she feels  strongly about her 
complaint. And I can understand that Mrs B is upset  that NatWest  has closed her sons 
accounts. She says Mr B has been a loyal customer of the bank since he was a young man 
and she cant believe how NatWest has acted.  
NatWest has provided me with a copy of its letter dated 31 January 2018.  This says it has 
decided it was no longer going  to provide Mr B with banking facilities. And that he needed to 
make alternative arrangements within 60 days. 
I acknowledge the impact the account being  closed  had on Mr B. And that Mrs B says Mr B 
hasnt done anything wrong.  That may well be the case. But NatWest has acted  within the 
terms and conditions of the accounts.  It was entitled  to close the accounts having given Mr B 
60 days notice. And it wasnt required to give Mr B a reason. So, whilst I appreciate Mrs B 
will be disappointed, I cant say NatWest has done  anything wrong when it decided to close
Ref: DRN90396032Mr Bs accounts.  
In summary,  I appreciate  Mrs B feels NatWest has treated  Mr B unfairly. But the bank can 
make commercial decisions  about who it offers banking services  to. They cannot unfairly 
discriminate against  a customer.  But they can say they no longer wish to do business with 
individuals. Thats because theyve got the commercial freedom to decide  who they want to 
contract with. And Im satisfied that NatWest has exercised its commercial decision  
legitimately when it decided to close Mr Bs accounts. 
Overall, Im satisfied NatWest has acted fairly, and I cant ask it to do anything further in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 December  2019.
