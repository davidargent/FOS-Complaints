The complaint
Miss B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) irresponsibly provided her 
with an overdraft and that the interest and charges put her in financial difficulty. Miss B is 
also unhappy NatWest closed her account.
What happened
Miss B was approved for a £160 overdraft in March 2014. Miss B raised a complaint over the 
phone on 28 February 2017 in relation to the overdraft charges applied to her account. 
NatWest didnt uphold Miss Bs complaint as it said the charges were applied correctly in line 
with the terms and conditions of use, but as a gesture of goodwill it refunded and waived 
£150 worth of charges. NatWest issued a summary resolution communication for this 
complaint by email on 1 March 2017. 
On 19 June 2020 NatWest issued Miss B with a notice of intent to close her account and 
gave her 60 days to make alternative banking arrangements. Miss B last used her account 
on 17 August 2020, but two further credits were made to her account, £20 on 15 October 
2020 and £33 on 6 August 2021. Following this Miss B had an outstanding overdraft balance 
of £85.47. Due to the outstanding overdraft debt on the account the account wasnt closed 
until NatWest took the decision to write off the remaining debt on 16 August 2022 and 
reported this on Miss Bs credit file.
Miss B complained to NatWest about this in May 2023. NatWest didnt uphold Miss Bs 
complaint. It says the account was closed in line with the terms and conditions of the 
account and that it wasnt obliged to give a reason for closing her account. NatWest was not 
willing to pass Miss B the credits received into the account as there was a balance 
outstanding. 
Miss B was dis-satisfied with this and brought her complaint to this service.
One of our adjudicators investigated Miss Bs concerns and reached the conclusion that we 
couldnt look at the element of her complaint that related to the overdraft lending and 
charges as NatWest had already issued a final response to her regarding this in 2017 and 
Miss B failed to bring her complaint to us within six months of this.
And they didnt think NatWest had done anything wrong in closing Miss Bs account as the 
correct notice was provided and NatWest is under no obligation to continue offering an 
account to a customer if it doesnt want to.
Miss B disagreed and has asked for an ombudsmans decision.
Why I can only look at part of Miss Bs complaint
I cant look at all the complaints referred to me. The rules applying to this service say that 
where a business doesnt agree  I cant look into a complaint if its been referred to us more
than six months after the business sends the consumer its final response letter, telling them
they can refer their complaint to us. This is Dispute Resolution rule 2.8.2R(1)  and it can be
found online in the Financial Conduct Authoritys handbook. And in this case NatWest 
doesnt agree we can look at Miss Bs complaint regarding the overdraft lending and charges 
applied to her account.
Miss B first raised a complaint over the phone about overdraft lending and charges on 28 
February 2017. This complaint was resolved during the telephone call and a summary 
resolution communication was issued by email on 1 March 2017.
Within this email NatWest confirms that Miss B has accepted the resolution and understands 
how the outcome was reached. And Im satisfied it fits the meaning for a final response as 
defined in the DISP rules - including the referral rights setting out the six month time limit. 
This means Miss B had until 1 September 2017 to refer the matter to the service. But she 
didnt do so until May 2023. 
So I conclude this element of Miss Bs complaint was referred to us out of time under the 
rules that I have to apply.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered everything provided, Ive decided to not uphold Miss Bs complaint. 
My role is to look at the problems Miss B has experienced and see if NatWest has done 
anything wrong. If it has, I would seek  if possible - to put Miss B back in the position they 
wouldve been in if the mistakes hadnt happened. And I may award compensation that I 
think is fair and reasonable.
NatWests terms and conditions say that it can close an account immediately where certain 
conditions arise and it is not obliged to provide a reason. In Miss Bs case NatWest gave her 
60 days notice on 19 June 2020 of its intention to close her account and confirmed that all 
banking facilities would be withdrawn. Miss B stopped using her account prior to the account 
being closed and within the 60 day notice period.
I appreciate the inconvenience the closure of Miss Bs account has caused her but who 
NatWest decides to provide its banking services to is a commercial decision and it isnt 
something for me to get involved with. So providing NatWest provided her with sufficient 
notice  in this case 60 days  I cant say NatWest made a mistake.  
Ultimately, NatWest took the decision to close Miss Bs account  which it was entitled to do. 
And Im not persuaded that the 60 days notice Miss B was given wasnt sufficient and that 
she should be compensated for that. 
Miss B is also unhappy that the credits received into her account amounting to £53 were 
used to reduce her overdraft balance and the outstanding debt she owed NatWest. But I 
think it is perfectly fair and reasonable for NatWest to use this money to reduce Miss Bs 
debt to it. Miss B had the use of the overdraft funds and failed to pay it back and I dont think 
it would be fair to ask NatWest to refund these sums when she owes it money.
Miss B is also unhappy about what NatWest has reported on her credit file. But NatWest 
does have a duty to make sure the information it reports on its customers affairs to the credit reference agencies it subscribes to is factually accurate. So again, I cant say that NatWest 
has done anything wrong.
So overall and having considered everything, I do not uphold Miss Bs complaint as NatWest 
has not made any mistakes and I dont think it has treated Miss B unfairly.  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained Ive decided not to uphold Miss Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 August 2023.
