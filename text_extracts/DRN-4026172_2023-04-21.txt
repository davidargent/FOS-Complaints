The complaint
Mr M complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) didnt refund a duplicated 
payment.
What happened
On 25 November 2022, Mr M made a purchase for £32.19 at a high street retailer (who I will 
call A). Later that day, he noticed there were two amounts of £32.19 deducted from his 
account. He contacted RBS to investigate what had happened. An amount of £32.19 was 
debited to Mr Ms account on 30 November 2022. 
RBS placed a temporary credit of £32.19 to his account on 6 December 2022 pending the 
investigation. On 8 December 2022, RBS emailed Mr M about the outcome of the 
investigation. On 15 December 2022, RBS debited £32.19 to Mr Ms account.
Mr M complained that he hadnt had the refund. And his account had been debited without 
any contact from RBS. He said this left him short of money for Christmas.
RBS explained the process that had taken place. They said that when a payment is made 
using a debit card, the amount is authorised by the bank immediately. The available funds 
on a customers account are then reduced by the same amount. If the retailer (A) then 
processes the debit, it appears on the customers statement.
RBS said that in Mr M s case, A processed two amounts of £32.19 and these were then 
shown as pending on his account and reduced his available balance by the total amount 
(i.e. £64.38). But A then only processed one of the payments, and that was debited to Mr 
Ms account on 30 November 2022.
RBS said that following Mr Ms contact, they found out there was only one debit to his 
account and therefore re-debited his account with £32.19 on 15 December 2022. Theyd 
emailed Mr M on 8 December 2022 to say they intended to re-debit his account but hadnt 
had a response.
RBS said that when Mr M raised the issue, there was a disclaimer which said the amount 
would be re-debited to his account if no duplicate transaction was found.
Mr M brought his complaint to us and our investigator said RBS acted reasonably in dealing 
with his complaint. Only one amount of £32.19 had been paid to A. The credit of £32.19 was 
placed to Mr Ms account on 6 December 2022, and his account was re-debited with the 
same amount on 15 December 2022. So  only one payment of £32.19 was made.
Mr M didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint, and so it has come 
to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear what happened here. Mr M made a payment of £32.19 to A on 25 November 2022. 
In those circumstances, the process is that A then asks RBS to authorise the payment. 
RBS then does so and the amount of £32.19 is then withheld from Mr Ms balance 
immediately. A then (later) claims the money from RBS and Mr Ms account is debited with 
the amount  which happened on 30 November 2022. 
Only one amount of £32.19 was debited to Mr Ms account. The process Ive described is 
normal banking practice and followed by all banks - as well as RBS.
What happened in Mr Ms case is that for some reason  we dont know why  A claimed 
two amounts of £32.19 on 25 November 2022. So  RBS authorised two payments and the 
total amount (£64.38) was withheld from Mr Ms balance that day  and therefore he 
wouldve seen his available balance go down by the total amount. But  I can see that his 
actual statement balance didnt change.
Mr M became concerned and raised a dispute with RBS. As part of that process, RBS 
credited his account with £32.19 while they investigated it. Then, when RBS could see there 
hadnt been two amounts of £32.19 claimed by A, they correctly debited Mr Ms account with 
£32.19  on 15 December 2022. So  Mr M only paid one amount of £32.19 to A.
Mr M has said he wasnt aware that his account was going to be debited. We asked RBS 
about that and they said theyd emailed Mr M on 8 December 2022 to advise him of the 
outcome of the investigation. This said :We are unable to locate the duplicated payment on 
your account based on the information you SuppliedPlease provide a detailed covering 
letter which includes other transactions related to this dispute and your attempts to resolve 
with the retailer within the next xxxx working days. This can be sent to 
retaildisputes@natwest.com... If we do not hear from you, we will arrange to reverse any 
temporary refunds made to your account If your claim has been resolved do nothing If you 
no longer dispute this charge, then theres no need to respond to this email. Arrangements 
will be made to reverse any temporary refunds made to your account.
But unfortunately Mr M didnt respond, and so  in line with the email - they debited his 
account with £32.19. This was contained in the dispute terms which Mr M agreed to when he 
opened the dispute. These say: .We reserve the right to reverse any upfront refunds that 
we may give you while our investigation is ongoing. So  Im satisfied that RBS did advise 
Mr M about the debit to his account and acted reasonably.
In summary, Mr M only paid one amount of £32.19 to A. And RBS acted reasonably in 
dealing with Mr Ms disputed transaction and advised him about the debit of £32.19 ahead of 
it being debited to his account.
Therefore, I am not asking RBS to do anything here (continued).
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2023.
