The complaint
Mrs P has complained about St Jamess Place UK Plc. She is unhappy about the way it
dealt with payments which were due to her late husbands estate.
What happened
Mrs P asked St. Jamess to provide a proper account of all payments due to her late
husband's estate after his death in 2019. She says that poor communication and delays
have caused her a great deal of stress and anxiety.
St Jamess made payments to the estate for two plans it held, but Mrs P has identified other
plans which she feels St Jamess was unable to fully account for.
St Jamess didnt uphold the complaint and said the correct payments had been made.
However, it did make a goodwill offer to pay interest for any delay in payment and £500 for
any trouble and upset caused.
Mrs P didnt accept, and the complaint was considered by an investigator at this service. He
didnt think the complaint should be upheld. His view was that the correct sums had been
paid to the estate and the offer St Jamess had made was fair in all the circumstances.
Mrs P didnt agree and asked for a decision from an ombudsman.
I considered the complaint and made a provisional decision. I said (Ive partially redacted the 
policy numbers):
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I agree with the investigator. On the assumption that the offer St Jamess made is still
available for acceptance, I dont intend to uphold this complaint. Ill explain why.
Mrs P has raised concerns in relation to four plans which Mr P had held with St Jamess. Ill
consider each of those plans in turn and set out my understanding and my findings in
relation to each one.
Plan *****G71
St Jamess says that this policy had lapsed and been made paid up because premiums had
stopped. It says the last premium was paid in 2002 and has provided a schedule of premium
payments which include premiums identified as being paid by Mr Ps employer.
There is no evidence that premiums had been paid since 2002. So, Im satisfied that the plan
will have lapsed and no life cover would be payable. The fund value has been paid to the
estate, this was £44,377.10.
It may be the case that Mr P left or changed employment in 2002 which led to the premium
payments stopping? But in any event, there is no evidence that premiums were kept up and
Im satisfied with the explanation St Jamess has provided.
Its also apparent from the wealth statements from 2017 and 2018 that this plan had a fund
value but no life cover. These statements appear to have been sent to Mr P and there is no
suggestion that he queried them at the time.
Plan *****J64
This was a reviewable plan. Mrs P has provided the policy terms which confirm this. It
appears to have been set up with life cover of £200,000 (not £190,373) but the cover was
reviewed in 2008. Mr P was given the option to increase the premium payable to maintain
the life cover at £190,373. St Jamess say that he didnt respond and so the cover was
reduced automatically to £147,699.00. Mr P maintained the premiums up to the time of his
death and this sum has been paid to the estate.
The plan also had a fund value of £10,019.86 which has been paid to the estate.
Again, the wealth statements from 2017 and 2018 identify this plan and set out the value of
the life cover and the fund value.
There has been some inconsistency in the original life cover amount. It has been described
both as £200,000 and £190,373. I think Mrs P is right and the original amount was £200,000.
However, by 2008 it was £190,373 which suggests there may have been an earlier review.
This is quite probable as plans like this are often reviewed on the fifth anniversary.
There has also been some inconsistency about the status of a phone call in 2009. I dont
think the records provided evidence that there was a call to Mr P about the review in 2008.
However, I dont think this has any bearing on the issues I need to decide. Im satisfied that
the review letters were sent in 2008. Its most likely that Mr P received them and elected not
to increase the premium he paid. The reduction in life cover would have been apparent in
the wealth statements sent to him. Again, if Mr P had any concern about the reviewable
nature of the life cover in this plan, I would have expected him to be alerted to that in 2008
when the plan was reviewed (or earlier if there had been another review) or subsequently
when he received his annual statements setting out the reduced life cover.
Plan *****J70
St Jamess hasnt located this plan. Its said;
Plan *****J70  I cant find anything for this one as I am assuming that the DSS stopped
paying contributions and the charges on the Plan resulted in a nil balance so nothing has
transferred over to BD.
This comment suggests this plan was probably set up to receive SERPS contracted out NI
contributions. These DSS contributions would have stopped if Mr P was out of employment
and contracting-out like this ended in 2016 in any event.
I think its likely that the plan lapsed as St Jamess has said, but I ask it to clarify what
records it does have to confirm the precise nature of this plan, was it a SERPS policy? Im
also unclear about the reference to BD? Is this a reference to an internal system?
However, my current view is that its probable this plan had lapsed with no value and so
nothing was payable on Mr Ps death. There is no reference to this plan in the wealth
statements.Plan *****F80
St Jamess say this plan was cancelled and rewritten as *****J64 (referred to above).
There is no evidence that this plan was in force at the time of Mr Ps death. Again, its not
referred to in the wealth statements from 2017 and 2018.
The Wealth Statements 2017 and 2018.
I think these documents are important. These statements clearly set out the fund values of
*****J64 and *****G71 and the life cover on *****J64. The wealth statements are
intended to include details of all the plans Mr P held at that time. These statements dont
refer to any other plans. If any plans had been missing then I would have thought Mr P may
have raised a query about that at the time. I think that the fact that he didnt tends to suggest
he understood the statements to be an accurate account.
The Retirement Account - *****J64 and *****G71
St Jamess says these two plans were merged to form one retirement account in 2019. Its
provided a letter from 2019 which confirms this. Im satisfied that the sums that were paid out
for the plans are consistent with the values set out in the earlier wealth statements and so
theres nothing to suggest Mr P lost out due to the creation of the Retirement Account.
Conclusion
The sums paid out to the estate from were;
£147,699.00 life cover from *****J64
£10,019.86 fund value *****J64
£44,377.10 fund value *****G71
Im currently satisfied that these were the only sums payable to Mr Ps estate by St Jamess.
St Jamess appears to accept that it could have been clearer in its communications. Its also
made an offer to pay compensatory interest for any delay. Its offered a total of £1,703.44. I
think that offer is fair.
St Jamess responded and said that it couldnt confirm further details of Plan *****J70 and 
explained that BD was a reference to an internal system.
Mrs P didnt respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given the above response, I see no reason to change my provisional conclusions and 
confirm them here.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. I think the offer St Jamess Place has made is fair. Mrs P 
should confirm if she wishes to accept that offer.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or reject my decision before 8 June 2021.
