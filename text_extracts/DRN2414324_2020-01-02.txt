Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Hs complaint in part and thought loans 5-8 shouldnt have been 
given. MYJAR didnt agree. So the complaint was passed to me, an ombudsman,  to make a 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN24143242There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
MYJAR needed to do more when it approved loan 1-4. This was early on in the lending 
relationship between the two parties and the loan repayments for each one of these loans 
seemed affordable based on what Mr H had told MYJAR. So I dont think  MYJAR was wrong  
to give these four loans  to Mr H.
However I dont think MYJAR  carried out proportionate checks  for loan 5. Had it done so, I 
think MYJAR would  most likely have made a different lending decision.  By loan 5 there were 
clear signs  that Mr H was struggling to repay  his loans. I say this because:
Loan 5 was for £350. This amount was for £100  more that the first loan Mr H took out 
with MYJAR and there were no indications that the amount he was asking for was being  
reduced at all.
This was Mr Hs fifth loan in less than four months. He was repeatedly asking for a loan 
shortly after repaying  his previous one. This shows me that he was most likely unable  to 
repay previous  loans  without taking out a new one and was borrowing again  to fill a gap 
in his finances. 
I think when I consider these points,  it shows that there was a significant risk that Mr H would 
be unable to meet his repayments for loan 5 because he was showing signs that he was 
struggling to repay in a sustainable way.
It follows that I dont think MYJAR should have given loan 5 and every loan agreed after this 
point to Mr H.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of MYJARs lending history  with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR  should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN24143243Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached at loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point MYJAR  ought to have realised Mr H was not managing  to repay  his 
loans sustainably. Mr H had taken  out seven loans within 6 months. So MYJAR  
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr H was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan(s) was leaving in his finances and that 
Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed MYJAR.  MYJAR ought 
to have known  that Mr H was not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. Mr H had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect; service a debt to MYJAR over an extended period.
I think this pattern of lending should have alerted MYJAR to the likelihood that Mr H 
was having problems managing his money. I think that MYJAR  shouldve been 
concerned that Mr H might be borrowing elsewhere to repay its loans, again 
increasing his indebtedness unsustainably.
I think that Mr H lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Hs ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5-8 for the reasons given above.  
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
Refund all interest  and charges Mr H paid on loans 5 to 8;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
Remove any negative  information about loans 5 and 6 from Mr Hs credit  file.
The number of loans  taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse, so all entries about  loans 7 and 8 should be removed from Mr 
Hs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN24143244my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. MYJAR Limited 
(trading as MYJAR) should pay Mr H compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 February  2020.
