Complaint
Miss B has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) irresponsibly 
increased her overdraft limit and then unfairly added interest, fees and charges when she 
was in financial difficulty.
  
Background
One of our adjudicators looked at this complaint and thought NatWest should have realised 
that Miss B was experiencing difficulty by April 2019 and so it needed to refund all the 
interest, fees and charges it added from this point. 
NatWest didnt accept our adjudicators view and instead agreed to refund the interest from 
September 2020 onwards. As Miss B didnt accept NatWests offer and instead argued that 
the fees from January 2018 should be refunded, the complaint was passed to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.   
  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at whether a bank treated a customer fairly and reasonably when applying 
overdraft charges. So I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, I also think NatWest acted unfairly when it 
when continued adding interest, fees and charges from April 2019. 
I want to start by saying that just because any overdraft charges were applied in line with the 
terms and conditions of the account it doesnt automatically follow that NatWest will have 
acted fairly and reasonably. And Im incredibly disappointed to see that this was one of the 
arguments NatWest made for not accepting our adjudicators assessment.
In any event, by April 2019 NatWest would have seen a significant deterioration in Miss Bs 
account conduct. Miss B might have previously had a high salary but it is clear that she 
hadnt seen a credit balance on the account for over six months. Miss B also applied for 
seven limit increases during this period, which took her limit from £1,250.00 to £15,000.00. 
She was then immediately using the maximum agreed amount of funds almost immediate 
after an increase was granted. So Miss B was clearly hardcore borrowing and the significant 
amounts leaving the account so rapidly ought to have been of concern to NatWest. 
Equally, while NatWest says there was no payday lending until late 2019, I can see 
payments to at least one payday lender as well as another high cost lender earlier than this. 
So while Miss B might have had an above average income, its clear that the credits going 
into the account werent bringing her overdraft balance down within a reasonable period of 
time. On the contrary her account activity suggested that her debt both with NatWest and 
elsewhere was rapidly spiralling out of control.
In reaching my conclusion Ive thought about Miss Bs argument that she should be refunded 
all the fees she paid since January 2018. But I think that this is an argument borne more out 
of frustration with NatWests failure to accept our adjudicators view. In any event, I see no 
reasonable basis for saying that NatWest ought to have taken corrective action in relation to 
the overdraft in January 2018.
 
Miss Bs overdraft limit was only £1,250 at this stage. And the account was seeing credits 
well in excess of this which often brought it into a positive balance. Equally, the funds going 
into the account suggested that the overdraft could have been repaid within a reasonable 
period of time. So I dont think that NatWest ought to have taken action in January 2018 or 
that it unfairly failed to take action in relation to Miss Bs overdraft prior to April 2019. 
Overall and having considered everything, I think that by April 2019 NatWest should have 
realised that Miss B was struggling and offered her assistance rather than adding even more 
fees and charges to an account she was clearly already struggling to manage. 
As NatWest didnt react to Miss Bs account usage and instead continued charging in the 
same way, I think it failed to act fairly and reasonably towards her. And as this led to Miss B 
paying additional interest, fees and charges when she was already experiencing difficulty, 
Im satisfied that she lost out as a result of NatWest failing to act fairly and reasonably 
towards her. So NatWest needs to put things right.
  
Fair compensation  what NatWest needs to do to put things right for Miss B
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Miss Bs complaint for NatWest to put things right by:
Reworking Miss Bs account balances so that all interest, fees and charges 
applied to it (and not already refunded) from April 2019 are removed.
AND
If an outstanding balance remains on the overdraft once these adjustments have 
been made NatWest should contact Miss B to arrange a suitable repayment plan 
for this. If it considers it appropriate to record negative information on Miss Bs 
credit file, it should reflect what would have been recorded had it started the 
process of taking corrective action on the account from April 2019.
OR
If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer 
being an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments 
and returned to Miss B along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from 
the date they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement. If no 
outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, then 
NatWest should remove any adverse information from Miss Bs credit file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NatWest to take off tax from this interest. NatWest must 
give Miss B a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
 
 
My final decisionFor the reasons Ive explained, upholding Miss Bs complaint. National Westminster Bank 
Plc should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 November 2021.
