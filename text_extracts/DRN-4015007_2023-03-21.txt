The complaint
Mr R complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he and his wife paid for some holiday club 
membership points.
What happened
Mr R and his wife entered into a trial membership agreement for a holiday club in May 2009. 
The purchase price was £3,995, Mr Rs wife made a payment of £1,595 using her credit card 
and they entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with a finance provider for an interest free 
loan of £2,400. They agreed to make 12 monthly repayments of £240 to the finance 
provider. 
Mr R and his wife entered into a membership agreement in February 2010 to upgrade their 
membership of the holiday club. The purchase price of that membership was £12,995 and 
they traded in their trial membership which was given a value of £3,995 so the balance due 
from them was £9,000. Mr R entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance for a loan of £9,000. He agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £136.16 to 
Barclays Partner Finance.
Mr R and his wife entered into another membership agreement in November 2010 to further 
upgrade their membership of the holiday club. The purchase price of that membership was 
£19,500 and they traded in their existing membership which was given a value of £14,000. 
They agreed to pay a total of £6,099 to the holiday company and Mr Rs wife entered into a 
fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of £6,099. She agreed to 
make 180 monthly repayments of £91.91 to Barclays Partner Finance. The loan that was 
made to Mr R and the loan that was made to his wife were both repaid in September 2011.
Mr Rs and his wifes representative made a claim to Barclays Partner Finance in November 
2016 under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the holiday company 
didnt conduct a proper assessment of Mr Rs and his wifes financial position and ability to 
repay the loan, applied considerable pressure to them to procure their agreement to the loan 
and breached EU Law. It also asked Barclays Partner Finance to confirm the amount of any 
commission paid to the holiday company.
Barclays Partner Finance responded to that claim in December 2016 and set out the 
reasons that it didnt consider that it should be upheld. It said that Mr R and his wife had 
surrendered their membership of the holiday club in December 2013. It said that there had 
been no misrepresentation of the memberships and they hadnt been mis-sold. It provided 
the credit applications that had been made for Mr R and his wife in which they had declared 
a significant monthly income which met its lending criteria and it said that it was under no 
legal or regulatory obligation to disclose any commission that it paid to the holiday company. 
Mr R and his wife werent satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service 
about the undisclosed commission and the relationship between Mr R and his wife and 
Barclays Partner Finance being unfair under section 140A. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr R and his wifes complaint should be upheld. She 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale, she hadnt seen 
enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr R and his wife and Barclays Partner 
Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that 
the relationship was unfair. She didnt think that Barclays Partner Finance had acted 
incorrectly in relation to any commission that it had paid to the holiday company and she 
said that she hadnt seen any persuasive evidence to show that the lending was 
unaffordable for Mr R and his wife.
Mr Rs and his wifes representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It has referred to a decision thats been issued by this service 
on another complaint in which it was found that the inclusion of charges, hidden within the 
terms, was unfair pursuant to section 140A and it says that the charges that Mr R and his 
wife were required to pay are also unfair so their agreements are unfair. It has also provided 
a generic submission from counsel in relation to the holiday company.
The February 2010 loan was made to Mr R and he is an eligible complainant to make a 
complaint about Barclays Partner Finance relating to that loan agreement. The November 
2010 loan was made to Mr Rs wife and she is an eligible complainant to make a complaint 
about Barclays Partner Finance relating to that loan agreement. There are two separate 
complaints and in this decision Im only considering Mr Rs complaint about Barclays Partner 
Finance. Mr Rs wifes complaint about Barclays Partner Finance will be considered in a 
separate decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I consider that Mr Rs complaint shouldnt be upheld for these reasons:
Mr Rs complaint is that his relationship with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and 
his representative says that the holiday company didnt conduct a proper assessment 
of his financial position and ability to repay the loan, it applied considerable pressure 
to him to procure his agreement to the loan, it breached EU law and Barclays Partner 
Finance paid an undisclosed commission to the holiday company;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Rs claim under section140A as only a court 
would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finance 
response to his claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided the credit applications that had been made 
for Mr R and his wife in which it says that they had declared a significant monthly 
income which met its lending criteria;
those credit applications arent dated and its not clear to which of the loans they 
related but they show that Mr R and his wife had a joint annual income of £54,000 
and were homeowners with only an insignificant mortgage;
I consider that it would have been reasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to have 
concluded on the basis of that information that a loan with monthly repayments of 
£136.16 was affordable for Mr R at the time of the loan in February 2010;Barclays Partner Finance has provided account statements which show that the loan 
that was made to Mr R in February 2010 and the loan that was made to his wife in 
November 2010 were repaid in September 2011;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr R when it was 
made to him in February 2010 or that hes experienced any financial difficulties since 
then  nor have I seen any evidence to show that he complained to Barclays Partner 
Finance about the assessment that it made about the affordability of the loan before 
November 2016, more than six years after the loan was made to him, and I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained about any issues with 
the affordability of the loan before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr R and his wife were 
unduly pressured into entering into the acquisition agreement in February 2010, that 
Mr R was unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement in February 2010 or 
that the holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against them  Mr R 
didnt complain to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues until November 2016 
 more than six years after he entered into the loan agreement and I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect him to have complained to Barclays Partner Finance 
about any such issues before then;
if Mr R and his wife felt that the holiday company had applied excessive pressure to 
them in connection with the membership agreement that they signed in February 
2010, I dont consider it to be likely that they would have agreed to upgrade their 
membership in November 2010;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
has breached the membership agreement or any applicable EU law in any significant 
way or which would be likely to cause Mr Rs relationship with Barclays Partner 
Finance to be considered to be unfair; 
Mr Rs representative says that Barclays Partner Finance paid an undisclosed 
commission to the holiday company  but Ive not been provided with any evidence 
to show what commission, if any, was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the 
holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr R 
risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
I dont consider that Mr R has complained about the charges that were payable for 
his and his wifes membership and they agreed in the February 2010 membership 
agreement that they accepted and agreed to pay the annual membership fee in 
accordance with the rules of occupation;
Mr Rs representative has referred to a decision thats been issued by this service on 
another complaint in which it was found that the inclusion of charges, hidden within 
the terms, was unfair pursuant to section 140A  but this service considers each 
complaint on its individual merits and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that any annual membership fees or other charges that were payable under 
the agreements are likely to cause his relationship with Barclays Partner Finance to 
be considered to be unfair;Mr Rs representative has also provided a generic submission from counsel in 
relation to the holiday company  but Im not persuaded that that submission is 
enough to show that Mr Rs relationship with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair;
Im not persuaded that Mr R has provided enough evidence to show that his 
relationship with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be 
likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr R 
and Barclays Partner Finance in these circumstances;
I consider that Barclays Partner Finances response to Mr R and his wifes claim was 
fair and reasonable and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
it has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr R; and
I sympathise with Mr R and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their 
membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays 
Partner Finance to refund to Mr R any of the money that he paid under the loan 
agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
this complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 April 2023.
