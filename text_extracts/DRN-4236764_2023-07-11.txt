Ms W, through her representative, complained to Lending Stream who responded with its 
final response letter (FRL) on 27 September 2022 in which it upheld her complaint in relation 
to loan 5. The calculated refund was £33.20 and it said that as part of the offer it would 
remove adverse information from the credit file for Ms W in relation to loan 5. 
Ms Ws representative referred the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service the day 
after the FRL was issued which was on 28 September 2022. Later we have discovered from 
Lending Stream that on 15 November 2022 Ms W accepted that FRL offer and activated the 
electronic link in that FRL to credit her account with the £33.20. We discovered this in 
April 2023. I plan to come back to this in the main part of the decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and did not consider loan 5 as she had seen 
the offer to put things right for loan 5 from Lending Stream in the FRL and could see it 
agreed with the complaint for loan 5.
Our adjudicator considered the other four loans and did not think that Lending Stream had 
done anything wrong. So, she did not uphold the complaint. Ms Ws representative 
responded to say it disagreed and wanted an ombudsman to review it. Lending Stream told 
us that Ms W had accepted the offer in its FRL for loan 5 in November 2022 but had failed to 
tell us until April 2023. Ms Ws representative had also failed to tell us. 
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about this type of lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Lending Stream had to assess the lending to check if Ms W could afford to pay back the 
amounts shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Lending Streams checks couldve considered a number 
of different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and 
Ms Ws income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks 
might have been proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Lending Stream should 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Ms W. These factors 
include:
Ms W having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Ms W having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms W coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms W. 
Lending Stream was required to establish whether Ms W could sustainably repay the loan  
not just whether she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having 
enough money to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Ms W was able 
to repay her loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without 
having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, 
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it 
follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and
thought about what this means for Ms Ws complaint.
Potential dismissal of the complaint
As we have found out that Ms W has accepted the offer in the FRL then I considered 
dismissal of the whole complaint on the basis that Ms W had accepted the offer made in that 
FRL. However, the time frame is such that we did not know of it until recently and Ms W 
accepted the offer in November 2022 which was after Lending Stream had sent to us its 
complete file for investigation. 
And having looked at the merits its clear that Loans 1 to 4 were not irresponsibly lent. So, the expeditious way forward at this stage of the complaint history was to review the 
merits and issue a decision  which is what follows. 
Irresponsible lending
In view of the FRL and Ms Ws acceptance of the loan 5 offer I have not reviewed loan 5. 
Ms W applied for loans having declared a good income ranging from £1,600 a month for 
loan 1 to £2,300 a month for loan 4. Ms W declared expenditure figures of £967 for loan 1 
through to £800 for loan 4. 
Ive taken time to list the individual monthly repayments as scheduled for each loan in the 
table at the start of this decision. And from that I think its was clear that Lending Stream 
could see Ms W was able to afford the loan repayments.
As the lending relationship developed then Lending Stream would have factored into its 
creditworthiness assessment the early repayment history. So, by the time Ms W was 
applying for loans 3 and 4 it would have recognised that she had a good repayment history. 
Lending Stream carried out a credit search. I have reviewed the results of that search done 
for each loan. The record for loans 1 to 3 did not reveal anything that would have led 
Lending Stream to decline the applications or consider that Ms W was unable to afford the 
repayments. 
I have seen that for the later loans, the credit record had deteriorated and that may well have 
been the reason for Lending Stream deciding that it would make an offer to Ms W for loan 5. 
But as loan 4 was only for £100, and considering the good repayment record plus the low 
value for loan 4 then I do not think it likely that the first indication of a lesser credit record 
would have led Lending Stream to decline the application for loan 4. In the circumstances 
I do not uphold the complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold the complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 August 2023.
