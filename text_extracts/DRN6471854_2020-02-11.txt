Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Vs complaint in part and thought loans  5-8 and 11-25 shouldnt 
have been given. Ferratum didnt agree. So the complaint was passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to make a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
Ref: DRN64718542complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ferratum needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr V 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Ferratum  should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Ferratum was required to establish 
whether Mr V could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because initially the Office  of Fair Trading and then latterly the FCA through  
its Consumer Credit  Sourcebook (CONC)  defines  sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Vs complaint.
Loans 1-8: September  2014 to July 2015
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
Ferratum needed  to do more when it approved loans 1-4. This was early on in the lending 
relationship between the two parties and the loan repayments for each one of these loans 
seemed affordable based on what Mr V had told Ferratum.  So I dont think Ferratum  was 
wrong to give these four loans to Mr V.
Ref: DRN64718543However Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern  of Ferratums  lending  history with Mr V, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point within this lending chain at which  Ferratum  should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Ferratum should  have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Vs case, I think  that this point  was reached at loan 
5. I say this because:
At this point Ferratum  ought to have realised  Mr V was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr V had taken out and repaid  4 loans in 8 months  and was 
asking for his fifth loan in this time. So Ferratum ought to have realised it was more  
likely than not Mr V was having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his 
previous loan(s) was leaving in his finances and that Mr Vs indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr V wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Ferratum. The amount  
Mr V had requested  by the time he asked for loan 5 had not reduced at all. He had 
asked for exactly the same amount for a fifth time. Ferratum ought to have known 
that Mr V was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in his income but to 
meet an ongoing  need. Mr V had paid large  amounts  of interest to, in effect; service a 
debt to Ferratum over an extended period  of time.
I think this pattern of lending should have alerted Ferratum to the likelihood  that Mr V 
was having problems managing his money. I think that Ferratum  shouldve been  
concerned that Mr V might be borrowing elsewhere to repay  its loans, again 
increasing his indebtedness unsustainably.
I think that Mr V lost out because Ferratum continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Vs indebtedness by allowing  
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Vs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
Loans 9-25: February 2017 to April 2018
There was a gap of around  20 months before Mr V asked Ferratum for another loan. So 
because there was a fairly lengthy  amount of time that had passed here, I have considered 
the loans taken out by Mr V from this point  forward as a new lending  relationship.  When  Mr 
V did approach Verratum again in February 2017,  it again did a number  of checks. It asked  
him for details of his income  and his normal expenditure. It also gathered data from credit  
reference agencies.  From the information  it did gather, again there was nothing  to indicate it 
needed to do more when it approved loan 9 and again when he asked for loan 10. These 
two loans seemed  affordable for him and there  was nothing within  the credit search results 
that I think should have alerted Ferratum to find out more.
By loan 11 though, the amount Mr V had asked for had increased from his previous two 
loans. And as well as increasing  the amount he was borrowing,  this was also the third loan 
taken out by him in only 2 months.
Ref: DRN64718544So I think Ferratum couldve realised at this point that Mr V may have some longer term 
financial problems rather than just using the loans  to help with a temporary cash flow 
problem. It shouldve at this stage become concerned about whether it knew  enough about 
Mr Vs true financial situation.
I think that it wouldve  been proportionate  to fully review Mr Vs financial situation before 
approving loan five. And I think that Ferratum  needed to verify the information it found  out 
where possible. This is to make sure Mr V was in position to make  the repayments  
sustainably. I dont  think Ferratum did this. So I need to think  about what  it wouldve  seen  if it 
had carried out proportionate checks. 
Mr V has provided some  information about  his financial circumstances which  includes some  
bank statements and a recent credit  report. This shows  that Mr V was having problems 
managing his money. Ferratum wouldve found  out hed been repaying a significant amount 
to a number of short term lenders at the time he applied for loan 11. 
I think that Ferratum wouldve found out this information if it had made proportionate checks. 
So I think that Ferratum  shouldnt have given loans  to Mr V at this point (loan 11) and for any 
loans after this point  too.
Ive again looked at the overall  pattern  of Ferratums lending history with Mr V now in this 
second loan chain, with a view to seeing  if there  was a point which  Ferratum  should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. 
I think that this point was reached in the second  loan chain at loan 15. I say this because:
Mr V had taken out and repaid  6 loans in 5 months and was asking for his sixth loan 
in this time. So Ferratum ought to have realised  it was more likely than not Mr V was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan(s) was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Vs indebtedness was again increasing  unsustainably.
Mr V wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Ferratum. Mr V was 
asking for persistently  the same  amount  of money  each time. Ferratum  ought to have 
known that Mr V was not likely borrowing  to meet  a temporary shortfall  in his income 
but to meet  an ongoing need. Mr V had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect; 
service a debt to Ferratum over an extended period of time.  I think  that Ferratum 
shouldve been concerned that Mr V might  be borrowing elsewhere to repay its loans, 
again increasing his indebtedness unsustainably.
I again think that Mr V lost out because Ferratum  continued to provide borrowing from loan 
15 for the same reasons  that I made  when I considered the overall pattern of lending for the 
first loan chain. The loans from loan 15 onwards had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Vs 
indebtedness by allowing  him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an 
extended period  of time. 
So for the reasons I have given above,  Im upholding  Mr Vs complaint about loans 5-8 and 
11-25 and Ferratum  now need to put things right.
putting things right  what Ferratum needs to do
Refund all interest  and charges Mr V paid on loans 5-8 and 11-25;
Ref: DRN64718545Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
Remove all negative  information recorded on Mr Vs credit file for loans 11-14;
The number of loans  taken from loan 5-8 and 15-25 means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse, so all entries about  these  should  be removed from Mr Vs 
credit file.
Mr V still owes Ferratum  some of the principal balance he borrowed on loan 25. Ferratum 
may deduct the outstanding balance of loan 25 from the compensation that is due to him. 
But, to be clear, that outstanding balance should  be recalculated  to remove  any interest and 
charges, whilst taking account  of any repayments  Mr V has made on that loan as though 
they were applied against the principal sum borrowed.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Ferratum to take off tax from this interest.  Ferratum must give   
Mr V a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Vs complaint. Ferratum  UK Limited 
should pay Mr V compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 March  2020.
