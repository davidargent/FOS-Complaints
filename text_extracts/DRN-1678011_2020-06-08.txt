The complaint
Mr G complains that National Westminster Bank Plc asked for his personal information but 
wouldnt say why. Mr G also complains that NatWest closed his current account. 
What happened
Mr G had a current account with NatWest and in July 2019 it asked him to provide 
information about his financial circumstances. NatWest asked for details about Mr Gs 
income and assets, but hes told us he wasnt comfortable providing that information. Mr G 
asked NatWest why it wanted the information it had requested but says it wouldnt say. 
Mr G complained and NatWest responded on 18 July 2019. NatWest said it needed 
information from Mr G to keep its records up to date and that failure to provide it could lead 
to his account being closed. NatWest didnt uphold Mr Gs complaint. Mr G, didnt 
subsequently give NatWest the information it asked for. 
On 6 August 2019 NatWest wrote to Mr G and gave him two months notice of its intention to 
close his account and end its banking relationship with him. Mr G complained and NatWest 
responded on 15 August 2019 but didnt agree an error had been made. NatWest said its 
decision to close Mr Gs accounts had been taken and didn't agree to leave it open. 
Mr G referred his complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. But they 
thought NatWest's decision was reasonable and that it had dealt with Mr G's complaint fairly. 
Mr G didn't agree so his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Mr G only had a current account with NatWest and that any debts or assets 
were held with other businesses. Mr G has explained that he felt NatWest had no legitimate 
need for the information it asked for. Im sorry to disappoint Mr G but I dont agree. 
Businesses are obliged to ensure up to date records are held and maintained. NatWest 
explained to Mr G that the records it held were not up to date and that it needed the 
information it requested. I wouldnt expect a business to give a specific explanation about a 
request of this nature beyond what NatWest told Mr G. 
Mr G didnt provide the information NatWest requested and in August 2019 it notified him of 
its intention to close his current account. I understand why Mr G is upset at NatWests 
decision. But NatWests terms and conditions say it can close an account by giving two 
months notice. In this case, NatWest gave Mr G 64 days notice of its intention to close his 
account. Im satisfied NatWest could decide to close his account and end its banking 
relationship with Mr G and that it gave reasonable warning of its intention to do so. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr G but I havent found that NatWest made a mistake and Im 
satisfied it dealt with his complaint fairly. As a result, Im not telling it to do anything else. My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2020.
