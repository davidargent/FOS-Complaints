The complaint
Mr M complains about PayrNet Limiteds actions when closing his account and withholding 
his funds.
What happened
In April 2021, PayrNet blocked Mr Ms account and held the money which was in it, PayrNet 
asked Mr M for proof of entitlement to some of the funds in the account  Mr M provided 
some information but PayrNet wasnt satisfied; so it held on to the money.
Mr M also learned that in November 2020, when a different provider closed another of his 
accounts, it sent the money left in that account to PayrNet. PayrNet didnt credit this money 
to Mr Ms account, despite his entitlement to it.
PayrNet returned the money left in the account to the original sources; and the money from 
Monzo remained unfound.
Our investigator reviewed things and was satisfied Mr M hadnt provided sufficient evidence 
to prove his entitlement to some money in the account  but recognised PayrNet hadnt 
asked Mr M for entitlement to some of the other credits it returned to source. In summary, 
our investigator asked PayrNet to:
Refund two credits (£594 and £350) which had been returned to source back to Mr M 
as he hadnt been asked to prove any entitlement to these funds.
Refund £2,313.51 credit which had been sent to PayrNet from another provider for 
Mr M.
Pay 8% simple interest on the above funds.
As Mr M no longer has a bank account in his name, it was agreed PayrNet would return the 
money to Mr Ms partners bank account. However, Mr M is still to provide a copy of the bank 
statement where he would like the money returned.
Mr M wanted the additional money which had been returned to source refunded to him too. 
He explained this payment (around £3,400) was in relation to a car he had previously 
purchased with his business partner. Mr M didnt provide any additional evidence for this 
payment.
PayrNet agreed to refund the £2,313.51 credit plus 8% simple interest but said it couldnt 
return the other payments as the money had already been returned to source. PayrNet said 
it doesnt have the facilities to allow a customer to show proof of entitlement to some of the 
funds.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Reviewing Mr Ms account
PayrNet are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet its legal and 
regulatory obligations. It is also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of new and existing 
relationships. That sometimes means it needs to restrict customers accounts  either in full 
or partially while it carries out the review. Having looked at whats happened, Im satisfied 
PayrNet was complying with its legal and regulatory obligations when it reviewed Mr Ms 
account in April 2021. So, I cant fairly say theyve done anything wrong.
Should PayrNet have returned the money in Mr Ms account to source?
While PayrNet are entitled to carry out a review, wed expect it to do so in a timely manner 
and without undue delays. PayrNet have shared some information with our service in regard 
to the actions it took during the review. When financial institutions carry out reviews, its 
common practice across the banking industry that the review will require additional 
information from the account holder. Often, the information required is related to the 
consumers identity, proof of entitlement to recent payments or more details on what the 
account is used for. Based on the evidence Ive seen, and alongside Mr Ms testimony, 
PayrNet asked Mr M questions relating to some recent payments as part of its review  but 
not all.
PayrNet made the decision to return four payments back to the original source. Ive only 
seen evidence to show that Mr M was questioned on one of these payments  and I think It 
would have been helpful if PayrNet asked Mr M for proof of entitlement to all of these funds 
as part of the review. It didnt  and therefore, Ive had to consider whether it was fair to 
return the money to source. 
Ive carefully considered PayrNets limited evidence and arguments on its reasons why it 
returned the money to source. However, it only appears one payment was in question  and 
with the absence of any thorough investigation relating to the other payments in question, 
Im not satisfied PayrNets actions were fair. I appreciate PayrNet said it doesnt have the 
facilities to allow a customer to show proof of entitlement to some of the funds, but I havent 
seen any evidence to support this  especially as it appears the review was manual. 
Ultimately, PayrNet would have to be satisfied that Mr M wasnt entitled to the money to 
return it back to the original sender. And as it didnt ask Mr M for these particular proofs of 
entitlements, I dont find any plausible explanation as to how it satisfied itself that Mr M 
wasnt entitled to it.
I am satisfied one of the payments (which Mr M was questioned on), was rightfully returned 
to source. And thats because it asked Mr M to show his entitlement, and it wasnt satisfied 
with the evidence. Having considered that evidence, Im satisfied PayrNet made a fair 
decision.
It therefore follows that I think PayrNet should refund Mr M the full balance of three 
payments which was returned to source. I also dont think its reasonable that Mr M has been 
without his money for a long period of time. So, like our investigator, I think 8% simple 
interest should be paid on this amount.
The missing money
It appears a payment of around £2,300 was sent to PayrNet from another payment provider 
in November 2020. This money should have been credited to Mr Ms account, but it wasnt. 
PayrNet have now been able to locate the money and agreed to repay it to Mr M. I do consider PayrNet should also add interest to this amount (from November 2020 when it 
received it) to recognise the time Mr M has been without this money.
Putting things right
Overall, I find PayrNets decision to review Mr Ms account fair. But I dont think it did enough 
to satisfy itself that Mr M wasnt entitled to three payments in the account  so I think it 
should refund him as he is now at a loss. And I think adding interest to the amount it refunds 
him fairly compensates Mr M for the loss of use of his money. PayrNet should also refund 
the money which should have credited his account in November 2020.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint. PayrNet Limited should do the following:
Refund Mr M three payments which were returned to source - £0.01, £594, £350.
Calculate interest at 8% simple per year on the above amount. It should calculate this 
from the date it refunded the money to source up to the date it refunds Mr M.
Refund Mr M £2,313.51.
Calculate interest at 8% simple per year on the above amount. It should calculate this 
from the date PayrNet received the money (around November 2020) up to the date it 
refunds Mr M.
HM Revenue & Customs requires PayrNet Limited to withhold income tax from the 
above-mentioned interest. PayrNet should give Mr M a certificate showing how much 
is taken off if Mr M asks for one.
Mr M needs to provide an up to date statement (dated in the last three months) to allow 
PayrNet to make the settlement. PayrNet have agreed to pay this to Mr Ms partners 
account as Mr M doesnt have an account in his name. If Mr M provides the statement after 
2 December 2022, Im satisfied the interest payment should be capped at 2 December 2022. 
If Mr M isnt able to provide an up to date statement in either his or his partners name, I find 
it reasonable for PayrNet to keep the money until a valid up to date statement is provided in 
Mr Ms name.
PayrNet must pay the compensation within 28 days of the date Mr M provides the up to date 
statement. If it pays later than this it must also pay interest on the compensation from the 
date of receipt of the statement to the date of payment at 8% a year simple.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2022.
