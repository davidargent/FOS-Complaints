The complaint
Mr and Mrs F complain that Shawbrook Bank has rejected the claims that theyve made 
under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre being represented in their complaint by a 
professional representative.
What happened
Mr and Mrs F had a timeshare for a one bed unit with a timeshare company and they 
entered into a purchase agreement with the timeshare company in August 2007 to trade-in 
that unit and upgrade to a studio with high/red season availability. The membership 
admission fee for the upgrade was £7,150 and they entered into a fixed sum loan agreement 
with a credit provider to pay that amount to the timeshare company. 
Mr and Mrs F upgraded their timeshare again in July 2008 and entered into another 
purchase agreement with the timeshare company for an apartment that sleeps six people 
with high season availability. The cost of that upgrade was £7,184 and they entered into 
another fixed sum loan agreement with the credit provider for a total amount of credit of 
£14,839.83, which included the amount that was outstanding from them under the August 
2007 loan agreement. Mr and Mrs F were notified in July 2016 that the loan had been 
transferred to Shawbrook Bank. 
Mr and Mrs Fs representative made a complaint to the credit provider in December 2018 
about the August 2007 timeshare purchase and said that the timeshare was misrepresented 
to them, a commission was paid by the credit provider to the timeshare company that wasnt 
disclosed to Mr and Mrs F and that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs F 
and the credit provider. The representative said that Mr and Mrs F claimed a refund of the 
£7,150 that theyd paid for the upgrade (together with all interest payments and the 
commission paid, with interest on those amounts).
The credit provider sent the complaint to Shawbrook Bank and it responded to it in May 2019 
and set out the reasons that it didnt consider that the complaint should be upheld. Mr and 
Mrs F made a complaint to this service in March 2019 which referred to the August 2007 
agreements and said that the timeshare company and the credit provider failed to conduct a 
proper assessment of Mr and Mrs Fs ability to afford the loan, the credit provider paid a 
commission to the timeshare company which wasnt declared to Mr and Mrs F and the 
timeshare company unduly pressured Mr and Mrs F into entering into the purchase 
agreement and the loan agreement, all of which rendered the agreement unfair pursuant to 
section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Fs complaint should be upheld. He said 
that a claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act was time-barred under the 
Limitation Act 1980 and he set out the reasons that he considered that the timeshare hadnt 
been misrepresented to Mr and Mrs F and that the relationship between them and the credit 
provider wasnt unfair. Mr and Mrs Fs representative has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
the claim that was made to the credit provider in December 2018 by Mr and Mrs Fs 
representative related to Mr and Mrs F upgrading their timeshare in August 2007 and 
was made under sections 75 and 140A and the complaint form that they provided to 
this service said that they were complaining about the transaction that took place in 
August 2007 because the loan agreement was unfair pursuant to section 140A and 
they claimed a refund of the £7,150 that theyd paid for the upgrade (together with all 
interest payments and the commission paid, with interest on those amounts);
Mr and Mrs Fs complaint to this service is about Shawbrook Banks response to the 
claims that had been made under sections 75 and 140A about the August 2007 
agreements so Im not determining the outcome of those claims in this decision  as 
only a court would be able to do that - but Im considering whether or not Shawbrook 
Banks response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr and Mrs Fs claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented to 
them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them - 
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Shawbrook Bank would be 
expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr and Mrs F could have made a claim to the timeshare company or 
the credit provider about the misrepresentations that they say induced them into 
buying the timeshare in August 2007 as that was the latest time that the 
misrepresentations would have been made  its also the time that any loss would 
have been incurred as that was when they also entered into the loan agreement with 
the credit provider;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or the credit 
provider  but they didnt make a claim under section 75 until December 2018, more 
than eleven years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation 
Act so I consider that their section 75 claim is now time-barred;our representative also considered whether the alleged misrepresentations caused 
the relationship between Mr and Mrs F and the credit provider to be unfair under 
section 140A;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor  and I dont 
consider that Mr and Mrs Fs section 140A claim is time barred;
Mr and Mrs F had an existing timeshare for a one bed unit with the timeshare 
company and they entered into a purchase agreement in August 2007 to trade-in that 
unit and upgrade to a studio with high/red season availability;
our investigator set out in detail the reasons that he didnt consider that the timeshare 
had been misrepresented to Mr and Mrs F and he said that hed considered what 
theyd said about the misrepresentations and had examined the supporting 
documents  and their representative has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman but has provided no further information about the alleged 
misrepresentations or explained why it considers our investigators findings to be 
unfair or unreasonable;
having carefully considered what Mr and Mrs F (and their representative) have said 
about the misrepresentations and having carefully considered the supporting 
documents, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
timeshare was misrepresented to Mr and Mrs F and I dont consider that its likely 
that a court would conclude that it was misrepresented to them or that the alleged 
misrepresentations caused the relationship between Mr and F and the credit provider 
to be unfair;
Mr and Mrs Fs representative says that the credit provider failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr and Mrs Fs ability to afford the loan  but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that the loan was unaffordable for them at the time that it was made to them or 
that they complained to the credit provider about the affordability of the loan or the 
affordability assessment that was conducted before December 2018  as the loan 
was made to them in August 2007, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
them to have complained about those issues before then and I consider it to be more 
likely than not that any complaint about the affordability assessment would now be 
time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Fs representative has said that the credit provider should have told them 
about any commission that it paid to the timeshare company for arranging the loan  
but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was 
paid by the credit provider to the timeshare company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that the credit provider 
wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  and I dont consider 
that it was under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid 
in these circumstances or that the level of commission that was normally paid in this 
type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that the credit provider should have 
appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr and Mrs F risked the 
relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs F were 
unduly pressured into buying the timeshare or entering into the loan agreement or 
that the timeshare company used unacceptable commercial practices against them  
Ive seen no evidence to show that they complained about those issues before 
December 2018  more than eleven years after they entered into the loan agreement and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have complained about 
any such issues before then;
Mr and Mrs F upgraded their timeshare again in July 2008 and entered into another 
purchase agreement with the timeshare company  if the August 2007 purchase 
agreement had been misrepresented to them or the timeshare company had unduly 
pressurised them into entering into the August 2007 purchase agreement or had 
used unacceptable commercial practices against them, I dont consider it to be likely 
that they would have agreed to another upgrade of their timeshare with the timeshare 
company less than a year later;
Im not persuaded that its likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr and Mrs F and the credit provider in these circumstances 
and I consider that it was fair and reasonable for Shawbrook Bank not to uphold the 
claims that were made to it; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs F for the issues that theyve had with their timeshare 
and the difficulties that theyve experienced, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Shawbrook Bank to refund to 
them any of the money that they paid under the loan agreement, to pay them any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F and Mrs F to 
accept or reject my decision before 7 November 2022.
