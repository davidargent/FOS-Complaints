The complaint
Mr M complains that Nationwide Building Society (Nationwide) treated him unfairly by closing 
his accounts. He would like an apology and his accounts reopened.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree the conclusions reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons: -
Its clear from what both Nationwide and Mr M have told us that Mr M has 
complained about several issues with Nationwides service culminating in five 
separate complaints in 2021. Of course, Mr M does have the right to complain and 
should do so if he has problems with the service provided. 
I dont agree with Mr Ms assessment that he has been discriminated against for 
raising concerns. It seems to me that Nationwides assessment of the situation which 
is that its not providing the level of service Mr M would like and the relationship has 
broken down is reasonable. So, I dont think its decision to close Mr Ms accounts 
was unreasonable
I have seen Nationwides terms and conditions  these allow for account closure after 
two months notice. As Nationwide gave the appropriate two months notice so 
Nationwide has followed its own process correctly for account closure.
As I dont find Nationwide is at fault, I cant reasonably ask it to apologise or to ask 
Nationwide to consider reinstating Mr Ms accounts as he would like.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 November 2021.
