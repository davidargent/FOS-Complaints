Miss H complains that NewDay Ltd has increased  the interest rate on her credit  card 
account. 
background
Miss H told us that NewDay had previously  increased the interest  rate on her account to 
32% in 2017.  But she said she only found out that NewDay had increased the interest rate 
on her account a second time, to 39.9%, when  she spoke  to NewDay  on 16 March 2018. 
NewDay said that it had written to Miss H about  this increase on 1 December 2017. She had 
the option then to accept  the increase and continue  to use the card,  or to opt out. If she 
opted out she would have  to stop using the card, and would repay the debt at the old interest 
rate. But she had to tell NewDay if she wanted  to do that, by 4 February 2018.
Miss H said that she hadnt got that letter. But NewDay said that the same information  was 
shown on her January  statement, issued on 3 January 2018. It was also repeated  on her 
February statement, although as that was issued on 4 February,  and 4 February  was the last 
date for Miss H to opt out of the increase, that may not have  assisted her greatly.  
NewDay said that it was too late now for Miss H to opt out. It said that it has the right under 
its terms and conditions  to increase the interest rate. It said it has increased a number of 
customer rates, in response  to rising costs.  It said that it had given Miss H the required 
notice of the interest rate change, and an option  to close her account instead. But NewDay 
said that Miss H was still using her account. 
Miss H said that the new interest rate meant  that she was now struggling,  on her income, to 
make her payments.
Our investigator upheld  this complaint.  He said that Miss H was over her credit card limit 
when the increase in her interest rate was made.  He said that NewDay  was entitled  under its 
terms and conditions to increase the interest rate. But he also thought that NewDay had a 
positive duty to consider individual customers circumstances. And he didnt think that 
NewDay had done that for Miss H. He thought that there were signs  on her account that she 
may be in financial  difficulties. And he thought  that NewDay had made that worse  by 
increasing her interest rate. 
Our investigator said that NewDay should  put the interest rate back down to the initial  rate 
that Miss H was paying, of 24.8%, and refund all of the interest over that amount that she 
had been charged. He also wanted NewDay to allow Miss H the option to close  her account 
at that rate. He said that NewDay should refund any over limit or late payment  fees since  the 
first interest rate increase  was applied, and it should pay £200 in compensation. 
NewDay didnt agree with that. It said that it had increased the interest  rate for a number of 
accounts. And being over limit doesnt  stop an account being selected  for an interest rate 
increase. NewDay said that it was its business  policy that the two points arent  related.  
NewDay also said that Miss H couldve opted  out of the proposed increase, or she couldve 
asked for her account to be closed, which would have frozen  her existing interest  rate. And 
shed continued  to use the card. 
Ref: DRN81938452Our investigator said that he hadnt  changed his mind. The case was then passed  to me for 
a final decision.
my provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I proposed  to uphold it. 
This is what  I said then: 
-Before reaching a provisional  decision  in this complaint, I wrote to NewDay  to ask for 
further information. And I wrote  to Miss H, to tell her that my initial  view was that I would  
be unlikely to reach exactly the same view as our investigator. I didnt think it was likely 
that I would  ask NewDay to reset her interest  rate back  to the level that it was at before 
the first rate rise. But having requested further  information from NewDay,  I found that this 
was an unusual case.
-Miss H provided further representations following this, to tell me that the opportunity  to 
repay her card at below  30%,  as it stood before the first interest rate rise, would be ideal. 
She had struggled  after the first rate rise. But she said that it was the current rate of 
interest, at 39.9%  which  was insupportable. She repeated  that she didnt get the letter 
NewDay sent telling her about the interest rate change, and that she wouldve opted then 
to freeze  her account and repay at the previous rate of 32%. She said that NewDays 
responses to her complaints since then had been  generic, and unhelpful.
-Miss H explained that her personal circumstances had changed,  making it very difficult to 
repay this debt. She said shed frequently told NewDay  in advance that she was going to 
have to pay late, but she was still charged  a late payment fee. And she said that shed 
been charged over-limit fees several times in the last few months. She said that this was 
primarily because of interest which had been applied  to her account. She said shed 
delayed negotiating a repayment plan with NewDay to see the outcome of this case, and 
wondered if these fees could be repaid. 
-NewDay sent us contact notes for Miss H going  back to late 2016, and some  of her 
statements going back to 2016.  Unfortunately these werent complete, but I thought they 
provided enough information  for me to decide  this case.  I then started to consider this 
complaint. 
-I explained that Credit  card providers do sometimes raise interest rates. NewDay  has 
reserved the right to do that under the terms and conditions  of Miss Hs account. But 
there are some rules  a card provider has to follow when  it makes a rate increase. 
-NewDay focussed on the second  rate rise on Miss Hs card, made at the start of 2018.  
But I wanted to consider  the first rate rise, made in early  2017. I thought NewDay may 
have made a mistake  when it raised her interest rate that first time. I said I would explain 
why I thought that. 
-In January 2017, Miss H started to have difficulties making her payments. She told 
NewDay that she was experiencing illness, and was struggling to make her payments. 
-Miss H spoke to NewDay again about this problem on 3 February. She did make  the 
minimum payment for January, but it was made a few days  late, also on 3 February. She 
persuaded NewDay to refund some fees onto her account as well. Miss Hs statement 
Ref: DRN81938453for March says that NewDay wrote to Miss H on the same day, 3 February 2017, to tell 
her that her interest rate would be increasing  on 11 April 2017.  
-Miss Hs March statement shows that she didnt make a full payment for February. In 
fact, Miss H only seemed to have paid £17 herself.  The remaining £48 credited to the 
account appeared to be refunds of fees made by NewDay.  Her March statement  says 
that Miss H owed £56.23 for the preceding month, and that the minimum payment for 
March, and arrears for February,  added up to £123.97.  That payment of £123.97 was 
due by 30 March.  Miss H managed to pay only £75 for that month.  
-The interest rate on Miss Hs account  took effect on 11 April 2017. We didnt have her 
full statement for April, but her May statement  said that she was then in arrears by two 
months.
-The rules on increasing  interest  rates state  that a lender cant increase rates if someone 
is two months in arrears. It wasnt  clear  if Miss H was quite two whole months in arrears 
when her interest rate was increased, or whether she wouldve been without the refunds 
NewDay had recently made onto her account.  However, it was clear  that she had failed 
to make full payments  for the last two months.  And she had already had a number of 
conversations with NewDay about her difficulties making payments. If she wasnt  quite 
two full months in arrears on 11 April 2017,  when  her interest rate was raised, then she 
was certainly close to that, and NewDay was aware that her arrears  were likely to 
increase. Her statements  made  clear that she was two months in arrears  very shortly 
thereafter. 
-If Miss H wasnt quite  two whole months in arrears when her interest rate was increased, 
then NewDay would  have followed  the letter of the law on interest rate increases. But 
given how close Miss H must have been to being  two months in arrears, and that shed 
been discussing her ongoing payment problems with NewDay  for some  time, I thought it 
wasnt fair and reasonable for NewDay to raise Miss Hs interest rate at this time. 
-Miss H had now indicated that she wouldve preferred to freeze her account  and repay  at 
her previous rate. I thought that NewDay should freeze Miss Hs account, and refund any 
interest she has paid over the amount  which was applicable in March 2017. It should  
also refund any overlimit fees where  those have been incurred due to the increase in her 
interest rate. It should then allow Miss H to repay  her debt at the rate which  was 
applicable in March 2017. 
-I also thought  that NewDay  had caused  Miss H some distress by raising her interest rate 
at a time when she had already  told NewDay she was having  difficulty  meeting her 
payments. I thought  that NewDay should pay Miss H £100 in compensation to make up 
for that. I said that NewDay  could use this amount to reduce Miss Hs debt to it.
-I didnt have enough information to tell whether there were  similar  problems with the 
interest rate rise in early 2018.  It seemed, from what I did have, as if Miss H was 
managing to make larger payments at that time. But it also seemed as if she was still 
receiving refunds from NewDay, without which it wasnt  clear  whether Miss H would 
actually have been up to date with her payments.  She also seemed to have been over 
her credit  limit at this time. 
-I didnt think it would  be reasonable to allow a second interest rate increase to stand, 
when the first rate increase should  not have been made. NewDay  seemed  to have made 
Ref: DRN81938454those increases at least partially in response to difficulties that Miss H was having  
making her payments. So I thought  it was relevant that the first interest rate rise in early 
2017 (which Id decided, on balance, should  not have been made)  would have 
contributed to the problems Miss H told us she had making her full payments before the 
second rate increase.
-Miss H also asked  whether a number of recent fees could be refunded.  She said shed  
frequently told NewDay in advance that she was going to have  to pay late, but she was 
still charged a late payment fee. Unfortunately, the notes I had seen of her discussions 
with NewDay didnt  seem to me to show that this had been the cause  of her late 
payment fees in 2018. Those notes suggested shed offered other  explanations  to 
NewDay, and didnt  suggest she was regularly contacting it in advance  of her payment  
being due. Miss H also said that shed been charged over-limit fees several times in the 
last few months primarily because of interest which  had been  applied to her account. If 
that was the case,  then my proposed award  would  mean those fees will be refunded. 
-Miss H also said that shed delayed negotiating a repayment  plan with NewDay to see 
the outcome of this case, and wondered  if fees during this time could be repaid. Her 
account notes  did suggest shed been facing some  difficulties with making  payments in 
2018. In those circumstances, I would expect  NewDay to have offered Miss H some help 
and support in coping with possible financial difficulties. What Miss H said made  me think  
that the possibility of a repayment  plan had been  discussed  between NewDay  and 
Miss H. So it seemed likely NewDay had done  what I would expect it to. I didnt think it 
had to refund further fees, if Miss H preferred to wait until this complaint was resolved to 
put a plan in place.
I invited the parties  to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
NewDay said it had nothing further to add. Miss H wrote to remind  us of her circumstances, 
and to raise some specific questions on my proposed award.  
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I havent changed my mind.
Miss H reminded  us of the circumstances  she was now in, and the difficulties she was 
having repaying the card after the interest  rate increases, including her health and her 
personal and family circumstances. She said that being able to repay  the outstanding 
amount at a lower  rate of interest would  be very helpful for her. 
Miss H also said that she had delayed discussing a repayment plan because she was 
anxious not to commit  to a repayments  under a plan which  might  be set at a higher interest 
rate than this decision might have said was fair. She asked whether the fees that had been 
applied to her account  in the meantime could be refunded.  
I explained in my provisional decision  that I didnt think  that it would be reasonable to ask 
NewDay to waive fees, in circumstances where Miss H has preferred  not to make payment 
in advance of this decision. 
Miss H also asked me to clarify whether late fees and overlimit fees applied  to her account 
should also be returned, for the time that Id said that NewDay  needed  to refund interest.  Ive 
said that NewDay should refund any overlimit  fees where those have been incurred due to 
Ref: DRN81938455the increase in her interest rate. But I dont  think that NewDay has to refund fees where  
Miss H has paid late, or where the overlimit  fee isnt due to the changes in her interest rate.
Miss H said that she was upset that her credit  score,  which  had previously been good,  was 
affected by this issue. She noted  that said the proposed decision offered only £100 in 
compensation, whereas the previous view had suggested that NewDay should pay £200 in 
compensation. She suggested that lowering this amount  would send a message to NewDay  
that its behaviour  hadnt been so unprofessional  or unsympathetic after all. She wanted me 
to address that point. I think its worth mentioning here that the decision I have made,  
although it reaches  a similar outcome to the previous investigators  view, has been  made  for 
different reasons. I havent  found  that NewDay has been unprofessional or unsympathetic  to 
Miss H. And I still think that a compensation payment of £100 is the appropriate  amount in 
this case.
Ill now make  my proposed award.
my final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd must freeze  Miss Hs credit card account. It must refund 
any interest she has paid over the rate which  was applicable prior to 11 April 2017. It must 
also refund  any overlimit  fees where  those have been incurred due to the increase in her 
interest rate. It must then allow Miss H to repay her debt at the rate which  was applicable in 
March 2017. 
NewDay Ltd must also pay Miss H £100  in compensation. It can use this amount to reduce 
Miss Hs debt to it.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 March 2019.
