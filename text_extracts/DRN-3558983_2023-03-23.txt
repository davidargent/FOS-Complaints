The complaint
Mr D complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he and his wife paid for some holiday club 
membership points. Hes being represented in his complaint by a claims management 
company.
What happened
Mr D entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in January 
2011 to pay for his and his wifes purchase of a trial membership of a holiday club. The price 
of the trial membership was £3,995 and Mr D agreed to make 36 monthly payments of 
£143.86 to Barclays Partner Finance. They entered into an acquisition agreement to 
upgrade their membership by buying some holiday club membership points in July 2011. 
The purchase price of the points was £17,768 and they traded-in their trial membership 
which was given a value of £6,000 so the balance due from them was £11,768. Mr D 
entered into another fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of 
£13,371 (which included £1,603 to settle the loan that had been made to him in January 
2011). He agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £200.34 to Barclays Partner Finance. 
Barclays Partner Finance says that the loan was repaid in September 2012 when Mr D and 
his wife again upgraded their membership but that the purchase of that upgrade was 
financed by a loan from another finance provider.
Mr Ds representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in July 2017 about the July 
2011 purchase under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the points 
were mis-sold and, but for the misrepresentations made, Mr D and his partner wouldnt have 
purchased the points nor entered into a loan agreement. It said that the terms of the 
agreement were unfair as an undisclosed commission was paid and they were pressured 
into entering the loan agreement. A statement from Mr D was provided. 
Barclays Partner Finance responded to that claim in August 2017 and said that the product 
was never misrepresented and that the product and the finance werent mis-sold to Mr D. 
Mr D wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. His 
complaint form says that the holiday company and Barclays Partner Finance failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan, the holiday company unduly 
pressured him into entering the agreements and Barclays Partner Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to him, all rendering the 
agreements unfair pursuant to section 140A.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ds complaint should be upheld. She considered 
his claims about the January 2011 and the July 2011 loans separately. She didnt think that 
Barclays Partner Finances decision to turn down his claim under section 140A about the 
January 2011 loan was unfair or unreasonable. She didnt think that its decision to turn down 
his claims under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act about the July 2011 loan 
for misrepresentation and an unfair relationship was unfair or unreasonable. She said that 
she hadnt seen anything to persuade her that the lending was unaffordable at the time of 
the loans and she explained why she didnt consider that Barclays Partner Finance had 
acted incorrectly in connection with any commission that it paid to the holiday company
Mr D representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded to our investigators recommendations in detail and sets out 
further reasons that it considers that there were misrepresentations and an unfair 
relationship, including that:
the burden of proof is on the creditor to prove that there were no misrepresentations;
verbal representations were made to Mr D and his wife about the nature, extent and 
benefits of this timeshare product and they were induced to make a transactional 
decision based on those misrepresentations and Barclays Partner Finance is liable to 
Mr D under section 75;
the misrepresentations include that they would achieve or acquire enhanced benefits 
to better accommodation at resorts, priority or better rights for booking 
accommodation, wider availability of accommodation and ability to use the exchange 
system, and a discounted price which was only available that day;
Mr D and his wife werent given sufficient information about management charges 
payable to make an informed decision about the product;
the holiday company was able to unilaterally increase charges payable and to 
terminate ownership for non-payment;
theres no effective right of withdrawal (or termination) from additional liabilities/costs 
imposed as management charges;
there was unfair pressure to complete and insufficient time to consider on the date of 
purchase; and
the holiday company has given misstatements about additional points remedying 
deficiencies in availability and standards of accommodation in existing points held by 
Mr D and his wife before their purchase of more points in September 2012.
It has also described its concerns about the way in which the finance was sold to Mr D.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ds complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
Mr Ds claim was made under section 140A but Im not determining the outcome of 
that claim in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im considering 
whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to that claim was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
I consider it to be clear from Mr Ds representatives letter to Barclays Partner 
Finance in July 2017 and the complaint form that was sent to this service that Mr Ds claim was made under section 140A and that no claim was made under section 75  
our investigator referred to a claim under section 75 but, as Mr Ds complaint was 
made about Barclays Partner Finances response to his claim under section 140A, I 
havent considered any complaint about Barclays Partner Finances response to a 
claim under section 75 in this decision;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Mr Ds representative described in the letter that it sent to Barclays Partner Finance 
in July 2017 the ways that it says that the membership was mis-sold to Mr D and his 
wife in July 2011 and the ways that it was misrepresented to them  it says that they 
were advised that the purchase would provide them with an exclusive holiday product 
with excellent value for less money and that they would have a better chance of 
booking any holiday they wanted than non-members but it says that theres a lack of 
availability, Mr D and his wife couldnt book the holidays they wished, the holidays 
werent exclusive and holidays are available online at the same resorts for much less 
money;
Ive not been provided with a copy of the trial membership agreement that Mr D and 
his wife entered into in January 2011 but I consider that its reasonable to conclude 
that it hadnt been misrepresented to them as they chose to trade-in that membership 
and upgrade their membership six months later by buying some membership points  
and the loan agreement that Mr D had entered into in January 2011 was repaid by 
the loan that he took out in July 2011;
Mr D and his wife signed documents in July 2011 including the acquisition agreement 
(which included its terms and conditions), a members declaration, a separate 
standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given, a standard information 
form and they each signed a credit application  Mr D also signed the loan 
agreement;
the standard information form that was signed by Mr D and his wife says: The 
purchase of membership  is for the primary purpose of holidays and is neither 
specifically for direct purposes of a trade-in nor as an investment in real estate;
the members declaration that was signed by Mr D and his wife says: We 
understand that [the holiday company] aims to provide personal service to our 
members and its prices will be comparable to but not necessarily cheaper than other 
providers of the same services;
Mr D and his wife also confirmed in the members declaration that that they 
understood their liability for the annual management fee and the individual 
management charge and the consequences of non-payment;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the exclusivity or 
availability of the resorts was misrepresented to Mr D and his wife or that they were 
told that the holidays would be cheaper than other equivalent holidays;
Ive carefully considered what Mr D has said in his statement and the other 
information that his representative has provided (including its detailed response to 
our investigators recommendations) but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the membership points were misrepresented to Mr D and his 
wife by the holiday company in July 2011 or that they were induced into entering into 
the acquisition agreement by any misrepresentations;
nor am I persuaded that the terms of the acquisition agreement are unfair or that the 
membership points were mis-sold to Mr D and his wife;Mr D and his wife again upgraded their membership in September 2012 and I 
consider that many of the points raised by Mr Ds representative relate to 
misrepresentations that it says were made at that time as reasons for them to 
increase their points holding  but as that upgrade wasnt paid for using finance 
provided by Barclays Partner Finance, it wouldnt be liable for any misrepresentations 
that were made at that time;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr D and his partner complained to the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance about any of those issues until July 2017  
about six years after they entered into the acquisition agreement and if they 
considered that the membership points had been misrepresented or mis-sold to them 
in July 2011, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them not to have 
entered into further agreements with the holiday company;
Mr Ds representative says the holiday company and Barclays Partner Finance failed 
to conduct a proper assessment of Mr Ds ability to afford the loan but Barclays 
Partner Finance has provided copies of the credit applications that were signed by 
Mr D and his wife  they show that they were both employed and homeowners and 
that Mr D had an annual income of £40,000 and that his wife had an annual income 
of £20,000;
I consider that it was reasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to conclude, on the 
basis of that information, that Mr D could afford a loan with monthly repayments of 
£200.34 - he repaid the loan in September 2012 and Ive seen no evidence to show 
that the loan wasnt affordable for him when it was made to him in July 2011;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr D asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its affordability assessment before July 2017 and its account notes 
show that he contacted it in January and August 2012 to request settlement figures 
but theres no reference in the notes to him raising any concerns about the 
affordability of the loan or asking for information about its affordability assessment  
as the loan was made to him in July 2011 and was repaid in September 2012, I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have raised any concerns 
about the affordability of the loan before July 2017;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr D and his wife were 
unduly pressured into buying the trial membership in January 2011 or the 
membership points in July 2011, that Mr D was unduly pressured into entering into 
the loan agreements or that the holiday company used unacceptable sales practices 
against them  Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr D complained to Barclays 
Partner Finance about those issues until July 2017 (about six years after the July 
2011 loan had been made to him) and I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect him to have complained to Barclays Partner Finance about any such issues 
before then;
Mr D and his wife had signed the separate standard form of the withdrawal notice 
that could be given and if they felt that theyd been unduly pressured into entering 
into the agreements in July 2011 or didnt want to continue with the purchase for any 
reason they could have given notice to withdraw from the agreements  but Ive seen 
no evidence to show that they contacted either the holiday company or the finance 
provider during the withdrawal period about withdrawing from the agreements;
Mr Ds representative says that Barclays Partner Finance paid an undisclosed 
commission to the holiday company  but Ive not been provided with any evidence 
to show what commission, if any, was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the 
holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr D 
and his partner risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Im not persuaded that Mr D has provided enough evidence to show that his 
relationship with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be 
likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr D 
and Barclays Partner Finance in these circumstances  nor am I persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the loan agreements were mis-sold to him;
I dont consider that Barclays Partner Finances response to Mr Ds claim was fair or 
reasonable but I consider that, if it had properly considered his claim, it would have 
concluded that it shouldnt be upheld; and
I sympathise with Mr D for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr D any of the money that 
he paid under the loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2023.
