K821x#15complaint
Mrs W complains about 12 loans CashEuroNet  UK LLC gave to her. She has said the loans 
were unaffordable and she was trapped in a debt spiral.
background
CashEuroNet objected  to this service looking into Mrs Ws complaint about her first three 
loans and so Mrs W withdrew her complaint about those loans.
I issued a provisional decision about this complaint  on 19 February 2019 and I set out in 
some detail the background to this complaint.  Ive attached my provisional decision as an 
appendix to this decision.
Because I was introducing new findings, I gave both parties an opportunity to provide further 
comments before I reached a final decision. Both parties and have now responded.
This is now my final decision on this complaint and if Mrs W accepts my decision, it becomes 
legally binding.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Mrs W responded to my provisional  decision saying she had no further comments to add. 
But CashEuroNet didnt  agree with my provisional  decision. In summary, the lender said 
that:
It carried out appropriate and proportionate checks before lending loans 9 to 12 and 
that Mrs W had a good lending and repayment history.
It concedes that it should  have done  more before lending loan 4 as Mrs W already 
had an instalment loan she was repaying.
Mrs W was advised  about the loan repayment amounts and she confirmed  that she 
was able to afford the repayments.
CONC. 5.3.1 (6) (in relevant part) defined  sustainability such that the repayments
under the regulated credit agreement can be made  by the customer (a) without
undue difficulties, (b) over the life of the agreement, (c) out of income and savings
without having  to realise security or assets.   It is therefore not possible  to have
made a determination  as to the sustainability of each instance of lending that
QuickQuid made to Mrs W without analysing whether the specific  repayments for
each loan were  made without undue difficulty over the life of each loan out of her
income and/or savings.  There is no possible  way to have made such  an assessment
without looking at the particular circumstances surrounding each instance of lending
thereby determining ...the harm on the customer, as stated within  your view.  Said
view suggests that CONC restricts lending to a specific number of loans to a
consumer, which it does  not, and after which point any subsequent  lending is de
facto unsustainable. Your view effectively constitutes unauthorised rulemaking.
Ref: DRN23733962In my provisional decision,  I agreed with CashEuroNet that its checks  for loans 11 and 12 
went far enough. But I didnt think CashEuroNet did enough before agreeing to lend the 
other loans  and I went into some details  about why I thought this was the case. I said:
Ive carefully thought about what CashEuroNet  has provided and what it has said. But 
overall given everything it knew  about  Mrs W, I think it wouldve been  proportionate for 
CashEuroNet to carry out additional  checks before giving Mrs W loans 4 to 10.
By the time Mrs W was taking out loan 4, I would have expected CashEuroNet  to look to 
build a clearer picture of her financial circumstances and independently verify some of the 
information provided. I say this because Mrs W had difficulties repaying her last two loans 
and by the time she was requesting loan 4, she had a continuous  borrowing  history of about 
a year with CashEuroNet. I think that may have suggested that she was dependent  on this 
type of borrowing and struggling  to repay  them.
the regulations  in place
CashEuroNet quoted from the FCAs consumer  credit handbook (CONC) in its response to 
my provisional decision. But the FCA was the regulator when Mrs W borrowed loans 9 to 12. 
The previous  loans were granted  when  the OFT was the regulator.
For reference, CONC 5.3.1G (6) (a) - in full  states that:
For the purposes of CONC  sustainable means  the repayments under  the regulated credit
agreement can be made by the customer:
(a) without undue difficulties, in particular:
(i) the customer should be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting
other reasonable commitments; and
(ii) without having to borrow  to meet the repayments;
(b) over the life of the agreement, or for such an agreement which  is an open-end
agreement, within a reasonable period; and
(c) out of income and savings without having  to realise security  or assets; and
unsustainable has the opposite meaning.
The OFT defined sustainability in much the same way as the FCA later did. Section 4.2 of
the OFTs Irresponsible  Lending Guidance (ILG) says:
Whatever means and sources of information  creditors employ as part of an assessment  of
affordability should be sufficient to make an assessment of the risk of the credit  sought  being
unsustainable for the borrower in question. In our view this is likely to involve more than
solely assessing the likelihood of the borrower being able to repay the credit in question.
We consider that before  granting credit, significantly increasing the amount of credit, or
significantly increasing the credit limit under  an agreement for running  account credit,
creditors should take reasonable steps  to assess a borrowers likely ability to be able to meet
repayments under the credit agreement in a sustainable manner.
Ref: DRN23733963And Section 4.3 says:
The OFT regards in a sustainable manner in this context as meaning  credit that can be
repaid by the borrower:
without undue difficulty  in particular without incurring or increasing  problem
indebtedness 
over the life of the credit agreement or, in the case of open-end agreements, within a
reasonable period of time
out of income  and/or  available savings,  without having to realise  security  or assets.
And Section 4.4 defines undue difficulty as the borrower being able to make repayments:
while also meeting  other debt repayments and other normal/reasonable outgoings
and;
without having  to borrow further to meet these repayments.
So, the first question I considered when making  my provisional decision on Mrs Ws case  
was:
did CashEuroNet complete reasonable and proportionate checks when  assessing  each
of Mrs Ws loan applications  to satisfy itself that she would  be able to repay the loan in a
sustainable way? And if not, would those checks have shown that Mrs W would have
been able to do so?
I concluded in my provisional decision  that CashEuroNet  didnt carry out proportionate 
checks for loans 4 to 10. I looked  into what CashEuroNet would likely have found out for 
loans 4, had it carried out such checks.  And I concluded that it would have learnt  that Mrs W 
wasnt likely to have been able to afford to repay the loan in a sustainable  way.
I didnt go on to look into the remainder of the loans (5 to 10) in such  detail because there
were other considerations which brought me to the provisional conclusion that it wasnt
responsible of CashEuroNet to have  agreed them.
CashEuroNet said in its response to my provisional decision that it wasnt possible for me to 
have concluded  that Mrs Ws loans were unsustainable for her without analysing whether or 
not the specific repayments  for each loan were made without her incurring undue  difficulty. 
And, as I didnt do this, I was in effect  making up the rules.  I strongly  disagree with this.
Firstly, the definition of sustainable in both CONC and ILG includes that the borrower should 
not have to borrow again to meet repayments. And ILG includes that borrowers should  be 
able to repay credit without incurring or increasing  problem indebtedness. Bearing this in
mind, if a consumer borrows again  within a short period of time after repaying a short-term
loan, and continues  to do so, I think its reasonable to consider that this might  be an
indication that they have  to borrow again to fill the gap in their finances that the repayment
left. This is unsustainable in my opinion.
I also think its reasonable to consider that problem indebtedness would include paying  a
high cost for a relatively low amount  of short-term credit over a period  of time and still having
a need for that credit  in other  words,  paying interest without  being  able to pay off the
original capital borrowed. So the determination of whether or not credit  was sustainable
Ref: DRN23733964would need to include more than simply analysing  the ability  of the consumer  to meet  the
specific repayments for each loan.  This was set out clearly in Section 4.2 of the OFT
guidance which I quoted above.
Also, the rules  and guidance  in place at the time covered not just what  was required
of lenders before entering into a credit agreement but what was required after this. I can
understand why CashEuroNet is focussed on considerations about affordability assessments
but my consideration of Mrs Ws complaint includes  all of the regulations  in place  at the time,
alongside consideration of the law and good industry practice.
The OFT guidance  also covers other considerations too. Section  6 deals with contractual 
and post-contractual  issues and sets out specific examples of what  the OFT considered to 
be irresponsible lending practices. Section 6.25 says that an example of deceptive and/or  
unfair practice would  be:
Repeatedly refinancing (or rolling over) a borrowers existing credit commitment  for a
short-term credit product  in a way that is unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
The guidance then goes on to say:
The OFT considers  that this would include a creditor allowing a borrower  to sequentially
enter into a number of separate  agreements  for short-term loan products, one after another,
where the overall effect is to increase  the borrowers indebtedness in an unsustainable
manner.
The general purpose of short-term loans, such as payday loans, is to provide borrowers
with a cash advance  until their next pay day and they are usually about 30 days, or just over,
in duration. However, in certain  circumstances, the borrower can elect  to renew the loan for
a fee and delay payment for a further agreed  period of time.
The purpose of payday loans is to act as a short-term solution to temporary  cash  flow
problems experienced by consumers. They are not appropriate for supporting  sustained
borrowing over longer periods, for which  other products are likely  to be more  suitable.
And so in my provisional decision, I took into account the short term purpose of the loans 
provided, and considered  whether the overall  pattern  of lending increased Mrs Ws 
indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
I cannot agree that considering this question constitutes unauthorised rulemaking. And Ive 
reconsidered this question again in coming to my final decision on this case.
CashEuroNet said in its response to my provisional decision that asking the above  question 
suggests that the regulations restrict lending to a specific number of loans to a consumer 
after which point any lending is de facto unsustainable and that this was not the case. I 
agree with CashEuroNet that the relevant regulations are not prescriptive about the number 
of loans. However, as Ive pointed out, the regulations do say that allowing a borrower to 
sequentially enter into a number of separate agreements for short-term loan products, one 
after another, where the overall effect is to increase  the borrowers indebtedness in an 
unsustainable manner is an example of irresponsible lending.
Ref: DRN23733965In their lending relationship CashEuroNet should  have considered that continuing  to lend to 
Mrs W might  be irresponsible because her level of indebtedness was continuing and not 
decreasing. The pattern  of continuous  lending suggested that Mrs W had an ongoing need 
for a certain level of credit and that she was not managing to repay  this without borrowing 
again. Its worth noting that CashEuroNet states  on its website that its loans arent  meant as 
a long term financial solution. And I can see that Mrs W was borrowing from CashEuroNet  
continuously for more  than three  years  I think that suggests that the loans  were  being used 
as a long term financial  solution.
In its response to my provisional decision,  CashEuroNet goes on to say Mrs W was aware 
that her repayments for some of the loans exceeded  her monthly disposable  income but I 
dont know the context within which this advice was given.  But irrespective of this, advising 
Mrs W that she may need to take some action  in order to be able to make  a repayment that 
is more than the money she would usually have available  to her does not take away  
CashEuroNets own responsibility to assess whether or not the loan was going to be 
sustainably affordable for Mrs W. 
If CashEuroNet felt Mrs W needed to take some  extra action to meet her loan repayments 
when they were due, this suggests that it understood that there was a risk that she wouldnt 
be able repay her loan the way it was structured  unless  preventative  action was taken. It 
then left this to Mrs W to address. It didnt, for example, offer to structure  the loan 
repayments to reflect  its expectations of Mrs Ws money management. 
CashEuroNet seems  to be suggesting  that Mrs W would have saved over the previous 
months before she needed to make the balloon repayment but it hasnt specifically said why 
it thought this would be reasonable in Mrs Ws specific circumstances.  I consider that Mrs W 
was dependent on these  loans because she had a continuous need for these  loans and 
there was a gap in her finances  that she needed  to fill with these loans.
So having  reconsidered  this complaint and while I know my decision will be disappointing for 
CashEuroNet, my conclusions remains the same. Mrs Ws circumstances at the time of loan 
4 suggested that she was unlikely to be in a position  to afford the loan repayment  and 
CashEuroNet has acknowledged  it should  have done more before agreeing to lend her this 
loan.
From loans 5 to 10, Mrs W was dependent on these  loans  and CashEuroNet  shouldve 
realised that the loans  werent being used for their intended purpose  over a short term and 
so it shouldnt have  lent Mrs W those loans.
putting things right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs W paid on loans 4 to 10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about the loan taken in May 2012 (loan 4) from 
Mrs Ws credit file;
the number  of loans taken from December  2012 to May 2015  (loan  5 to 10) means  
any information recorded about  them is adverse. So all entries  about  these  loans 
should be removed  from Mrs Ws credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet  to take off tax from this interest. 
CashEuroNet must  give Mrs W a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks 
for one.
Ref: DRN23733966my final decision
I uphold Mrs Ws complaint  in part and require CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right as 
stated above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 April 2019.

Mrs W has complained about short term loans  taken  with CashEuroNet UK LLC. Mrs W says the

CashEuroNet has said Mrs Ws complaint about some  of the loans has been made more than six 
years after the loans were  taken and as such this service doesnt have  the power to consider them. 
Mrs W has withdrawn her complaint about those loans. 
While most  of the loans were payday loans, loan 4 was an instalment loan  to be repaid over 12 
monthly instalments. And loan 8 was a flex credit loan, typically repaid  over ten monthly instalments.
When Mrs W complained to CashEuroNet it upheld  her complaint  in part. It said it thought she had 
grown dependent on these  types of loans and offered to refund  charges plus interest on the flex 
credit. Mrs W didnt accept this offer and referred her complaint to this service.
One of our adjudicators  looked  at what Mrs W and CashEuroNet said and they thought  
Mrs Ws complaint  should  be partially upheld. They  thought CashEuroNet  hadnt done  proportionate 
checks before lending loans  6 to 10 and if these  checks had been done CashEuroNet  wouldve seen 
it shouldnt have lent them to Mrs W. Our adjudicator thought  proportionate checks  were  carried out 
on loans 11 and 12 and didnt  recommend that these should be upheld.
CashEuroNet didnt agree in full with the adjudicators recommendation. It said it thought  its checks  
for loans 9 and 10 were sufficient and offered  to refund the fees and charges plus interest on loans  6 
 8. Because the complaint hasnt been resolved, it has been passed to an ombudsman  for a final 
decision.  
my provisional  findings
CashEuroNet has said this service is unable  to look into the complaint  about loans that were taken  
out more than six years  before Mrs W complained. As Mrs W has withdrawn her complaint about  
Ref: DRN23733968those loans, my decision  only focuses  on the loans  that were taken within six years  of Mrs Ws 
complaint. Mrs W complained to CashEuroNet  in December 2017  and so Ive looked at the loans she 
was given  from May 2012 (loan 4) onwards.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and 
good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
Before lending  money  to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand whether  
the consumer will be able to repay what theyre borrowing in a sustainable  manner, without it 
adversely impacting on their financial  situation.  
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and Mrs Ws income and expenditure at the time. With this in mind,  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount  to be repaid takes up a substantial  portion of their 
income 
the amount, or amounts, due to be repaid  are higher 
there  is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period of time during  which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind,  I think that there are three key questions for me to consider in order to fairly 
and reasonably determine  Mrs Ws complaint. These questions are:
1.did CashEuroNet, each  time it lent, complete reasonable  and proportionate checks  to satisfy 
itself that Mrs W would be able to repay in a sustainable  way? If not, would those  checks 
have shown that Mrs W would have  been  able to do so?
2.taking into account  the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern  of 
lending increase Mrs Ws indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise  
harmful?
3.did CashEuroNet act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  all of these questions and what they mean  for Mrs Ws complaint.
CashEuroNet says it checked Mrs W income   which it recorded as varying from £1,450 to £1,840.  It 
also checked  her expenses from loan 9 onwards   this varied from £875 to £1,225, and searched her 
credit file before  agreeing to lend. And based on what CashEuroNet saw from these  checks, it thought  
it reasonable to lend to Mrs W as a result.
CashEuroNet hasnt provided the full results of its credit search, but Mrs W has provided a copy  of her 
credit file. From the summary  CashEuroNet  has provided  and the file Mrs W has sent to this service,  
Mrs W didnt  have existing defaults or county court judgements (CCJs) on her file. 
Did CashEuroNet, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself 
that Mrs W would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks  have  shown that 
Mrs W would  have been  able to do so?
I think  the checks carried  out for loans 11 and 12 went far enough. I say this because  by the time Mrs 
W was borrowing loan 11 onwards, she hadnt borrowed from CashEuroNet for more  than two years.  I 
Ref: DRN23733969think this was a significant break in the lending relationship that may have led CashEuroNet  to think 
that she wasnt dependent  on short  term loans and that her circumstances may have changed. 
Also, the loan repayments represented a small  proportion of Mrs Ws declared income.  I can see that 
her declared  income  was £1,840 and expenses were around  £1,225. This suggests  that Mrs W had 
sufficient disposable income to afford to sustainably  repay these loans. So I dont think  CashEuroNet 
did anything wrong by giving Mrs W these two loans.
Although Im not looking  at whether loans 1 to 3 were affordable  for Mrs W, I have  taken them  into 
account as they form part of her lending  history with CashEuroNet. Mrs W was borrowing  almost 
immediately after repaying a loan. I can see she took out loan 4 on the same day she repaid loan 3 
and the amount she was borrowing was more than she had previously taken. Also,  Mrs Ws lending 
history shows  that she didnt  repay loans  2 and 3 when they were due and incurred late payment 
charges on those loans.
Ive carefully thought about  what  CashEuroNet has provided and what  it has said. But overall given 
everything it knew about Mrs W, I think it wouldve been proportionate for CashEuroNet to carry  out 
additional checks before giving Mrs W loans 4 to 10.
By the time Mrs W was taking out loan 4, I would have expected  CashEuroNet to look to build a 
clearer picture of her financial circumstances  and independently verify some of the information 
provided. I say this because Mrs W had difficulties  repaying her last two loans and by the time she 
was requesting loan 4, she had a continuous  borrowing  history of about a year with CashEuroNet. I 
think that may have suggested  that she was dependent on this type of borrowing  and struggling to 
repay them.
Had CashEuroNet carried out further checks before  lending loan 4 as I think it should have, its likely 
to have found  that Mrs W couldnt sustainably  afford to repay this loan. Ive used Mrs Ws bank 
statements and credit  file to reconstruct her circumstances at the time.  From the information provided, 
I can see that in the month before loan 4 was approved,  Mrs Ws income was around £1,520 and her 
regular living costs including  her regular  credit commitments were more than £1,100.  I can also see 
that she was borrowing  and repaying other short term lenders  in the month before this loan was 
agreed, Mrs W repaid  around  £430 to other short term lenders and I can see that she continued to 
borrow and repay loans to other short  term lenders. There was at least £400 outstanding in other 
short term loans when this loan was granted.
In my opinion,  this wasnt a sustainable position and Mrs W seemed  to be borrowing  to repay other  
loans and she was unable to sustainably  afford her loan repayments  of around £158 over the 12 
month term. It follows that I dont think CashEuroNet  should  have given  her this loan.  
I havent recreated  individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans  5 to 10 because I dont think  
that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of lending 
increase Mrs Ws indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of lending.  Ive looked to see if there was a point at which  
CashEuroNet should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful. And so CashEuroNet should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further 
lending. Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 5. I say this because:
by the time she was given loan 5, she hadnt fully repaid loan 4  this means that she was 
repaying her instalment  and payday loans to CashEuroNet at the same time.  CashEuroNet 
ought to have  realised  it was likely  her indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN237339610Mrs W was demonstrating repayment  difficulties from quite early on in her borrowing  
relationship and I can see that she rolled  over the repayments  of some of her loans beginning 
with loan 2. 
I think  that Mrs W lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 to 10 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mrs Ws indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit  over an extended period of time. Her borrowing was continuous  for nearly  
three years from loans 5 to 10. 
the number and frequency of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mrs Ws 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market  for these high-cost loans
So Im upholding Mrs Ws complaint about loans 5 - 10 because the overall  pattern of lending 
increased her indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and she lost out as 
a result.
Did CashEuroNet act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  everything provided. Having  done  so, Ive not seen anything  here that 
leads me to conclude CashEuroNet acted unfairly  or unreasonably towards  Mrs W in some other way.  
putting things  right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mrs W paid on loans  4 to 10;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information about the loan taken in May 2012 (loan 4) from 
Mrs Ws credit file;
the number of loans taken from December  2012 to May 2015 (loan 5 to 10) means  any 
information recorded  about them  is adverse. So all entries about  these loans should be 
removed from Mrs Ws credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs  requires CashEuroNet  to take off tax from this interest.  CashEuroNet  must 
give Mrs W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im intending to uphold  Mrs Ws complaint. Im minded to ask 
CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right as set out above.
