The complaint
Mr and Mrs W complain that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt inform them 
about cheaper interest rates that were available to take out on their mortgage. As a result, 
they feel theyve been charged the standard variable rate (SVR) unfairly for a number of 
years.
 
What happened
Mr and Mrs W had a mortgage with NatWest which was originally taken out on a fixed rate of 
interest for an initial period. They later took out some additional borrowing which was set up 
as a sub-account, again taken on an initial fixed rate deal. As set out in the mortgage offers, 
the main mortgage reverted to the SVR in 2013, and the additional borrowing reverted in 
2016.
 
In 2019 Mr and Mrs W had a mortgage review with a NatWest advisor to discuss taking out 
some additional borrowing. Mr and Mrs W say that it was during this conversation they 
discovered there were much cheaper interest rate deals available to them that would 
significantly reduce their monthly payments.
Mr and Mrs W discussed this with NatWest and eventually complained that they hadnt been 
made aware of these cheaper rates sooner. They said as a result of NatWests failure to 
inform them of these deals, theyve overpaid on their mortgage by more than Â£26,000 since 
it moved onto the SVR. They explained they felt let down as theyd been loyal customers, 
and they had trusted NatWest to have their best interests at heart.
NatWest sent their final response letter in July 2019. They said that Mr and Mrs Ws 
mortgage offer made clear when their fixed rate products ended, and that the mortgage 
would revert to the SVR afterwards. They also said the bank had contacted Mr and Mrs W 
before the rates expired to remind them about this. They said its the customers 
responsibility to be aware of the end dates of any fixed rates, and to ensure they select a 
new mortgage rate to meet their needs. They didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr and Mrs W brought their complaint to our service and asked us to look into things. They 
said that NatWest had failed in its regulatory responsibilities as set out by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA). Our investigator looked into things, and explained that he didnt 
think NatWest had treated Mr and Mrs W unfairly. He was satisfied NatWest had made it 
clear when Mr and Mrs Ws fixed rates were ending, and it was their choice whether to ask 
NatWest about new interest rate products. He said Mr and Mrs W hadnt asked NatWest 
about cheaper interest rate products, and NatWest werent required to pro-actively contact 
them. So he didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr and Mrs W responded and asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint as they 
disagreed with the outcome reached. They said when their mortgage reverted to the SVR, 
their monthly payments went down, so they recognised that as a good thing. Despite being 
aware their mortgage remained on the SVR, as was noted on their annual statements, they 
were not aware there were cheaper fixed rate options available as NatWest had not told 
them. Mr and Mrs W still felt that NatWest had not acted in line with the Principles set out by 
the FCA.
The investigator wasnt persuaded to change his opinion, so the complaints been passed to 
me to issue a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There is no dispute here that Mr and Mrs W were aware their mortgage was on the SVR 
since their fixed rate products expired in 2013 and 2016. Theyve said they recognised the 
reversion as a good thing at the time, as their monthly payments had gone down. So the 
decision I need to make is whether NatWest should have done more to make Mr and Mrs W 
aware that there were other fixed rate options available that were lower than the SVR they 
were paying. And if theyd done so, would that have made a difference to the amount of 
interest Mr and Mrs W have paid on their mortgage as a result.
As a starting point, Mr and Mrs W have referred to the regulatory obligations NatWest had as 
set out by the FCA. Ive thought carefully about the relevant regulation that applied at the 
time. There werent any rules that required mortgage lenders to pro-actively contact 
borrowers when cheaper interest rate deals were available for them to apply for. The rules 
do state that the lender must make available clear and comprehensible information about the 
types of interest rates available to borrowers. But notably, having this information available 
on the lenders website is considered sufficient for the purposes of the rule. NatWests 
literature from the relevant time period directs borrowers to their website for more 
information about the interest rates available. So, Im satisfied NatWest sufficiently made 
available clear and comprehensible information on the interest rates they had available for 
borrowers.
 
However, the FCAs overarching Principles for businesses (PRIN 2.1) also set out what is 
required by all businesses regulated by the FCA. Amongst other things, they say that firms 
must pay due regard to the interest of its customers and treat them fairly, and must pay due 
regard to the information needs of its customers, communicating in a way that is clear, fair 
and not misleading. Mr and Mrs W feel that NatWest have not acted in line with these 
Principles.
Before Mr and Mrs Ws mortgage reverted to the SVR in 2013, and the additional borrowing 
reverted in 2016, NatWest wrote to them to inform them of the change in interest rate 
applied to the mortgage. Both of these letters explained that there were other interest rate 
products available for Mr and Mrs W to choose from, and how to get in touch if they wanted 
to discuss these further. The letters also directed Mr and Mrs W to NatWests website where 
they would be able to find details of the rates. Im satisfied these letters were set out clearly, 
and the next steps for how to act on this information was clearly explained.
So whilst I appreciate Mr and Mrs W were pleased with a reduction in their mortgage 
payments when the mortgage reverted to the SVR, as Ive said above, Im satisfied NatWest 
had made information available to Mr and Mrs W about other rates they could apply for, and 
Im also satisfied NatWest brought this information to Mr and Mrs Ws attention when they 
wrote to them when the fixed rates ended. It was then up to Mr and Mrs W to decide if they 
wanted to apply for a new rate with NatWest, remain on the SVR, or look at deals offered by 
other lenders. Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest had communicated with Mr and Mrs W 
clearly about the position of their mortgage and their options at the time the sub-accounts of the mortgage reverted to the SVR. It was then Mr and Mrs Ws responsibility to make a 
decision about how they wanted to manage their mortgage.
Mr and Mrs W didnt contact NatWest until 2019 when they wanted to discuss some 
additional borrowing. But they feel NatWest should have reached out to them earlier than 
this to invite them for a review of their mortgage and interest rate.
 
Ive thought carefully about this. Mr and Mrs W were likely to have qualified for a new 
interest rate product had they contacted NatWest to ask for one, and I havent seen anything 
that discouraged them to apply. And I think, in these particular circumstances, even if 
NatWest had written to Mr and Mrs W to invite them to apply for new interest rates, Im not 
persuaded this would have made a difference.
 
NatWest had told Mr and Mrs W what they needed to do if they wanted to apply for a new 
interest rate both in 2013 and in 2015 (before the mortgage reverted to the SVR in 2016). 
But on neither occasion did Mr and Mrs W act on these letters to enquire about what rates 
may have been available for them. Instead, their mortgage remained on the SVR. As a 
result, its difficult for me to conclude that had NatWest written to Mr and Mrs W again in 
more recent years, they would have acted differently following that letter than they did to the 
previous two.
I appreciate that Mr and Mrs W feel theyve lost out as a result of being loyal to NatWest and 
trusting the bank were acting in their best interests. But Im satisfied NatWest did treat Mr 
and Mrs W fairly by writing to them to let them know there were deals available, and how to 
apply for them when their mortgage reverted to the SVR. Mr and Mrs W didnt contact 
NatWest, and so their mortgage remained on the SVR for several years.
Considering all the circumstances, Im not satisfied Mr and Mrs W have overpaid interest as 
a result of unfair treatment by NatWest.
My final decision
Considering everything, for the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W and Mr W 
to accept or reject my decision before 16 September 2021.
