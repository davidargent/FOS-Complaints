K821x#15Complaint
Mrs K complains that shes been overcharged by NewDay Ltd (trading as Debenhams) after 
it refunded a payment that had been made to her account. 
Background
On 30 July 2018 Mrs K made a payment to her Debenhams account using her husbands 
debit card. But a chargeback was raised as Mrs Ks husband didnt recognise the payment 
and his bank refunded  the payment to the account on 3 August 2018. 
Mrs K has sent her husbands bank statements to us. They  show  that on 24 August 2018 his 
bank debited the account for £349.02 again.  On 13 September 2018 the statements show  a 
refund of £349.02  was received and annotated as Refund from NewDay  Limited. 
Mrs K complained and NewDay responded on 13 December 2018. NewDay  said payments 
had been correctly refunded and didnt agree it had made errors. Mrs K referred  her 
complaint to our service and it was passed  to an investigator. The investigator initially  didnt 
uphold Mrs Ks complaint.  But after Mrs K sent in some bank statements the investigator  
changed her mind and wrote to NewDay to uphold the complaint. 
The investigator said Mrs Ks account  hadnt  been correctly administered  by NewDay and 
that it had overcharged her by £325.97. NewDay didnt agree so the complaint  has been 
passed to me to make a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed the bank statements provided  by Mrs K I can see that both the payments 
that were taken from her husbands accounts  have  been refunded. The first payment was 
taken on 30 July 2018 and was re-credited to the account on 3 August 2018. On 24 August 
2018 the statements show the payment was debited  again but a refund was received from 
NewDay on 13 September 2018.  The credits  and debits shown on Mrs Ks husbands current 
account cancel  each other out and Ive seen no evidence  that hes been overcharged. 
But I agree  with the investigator that this case should be upheld.  NewDay has sent us 
Mrs Ks statements  from August, September and October 2018. The statements show  that 
on 30 July 2018  a payment of £349.02 was received but then reversed. That meant  Mrs K 
had to make  that payment up again. But In August 2018 Mrs K spent £38.95 and also 
received a refund for £62. This put Mrs Ks balance  at £325.97. 
On 29 September  2018 Mrs K made a payment of £325.97 to clear her balance (which 
included the reversed 30 July 2018 payment). But the 7 October  2018  statement shows the 
£349.02 payment  reversal  was applied  for a second time which increased Mrs Ks 
outstanding balance again. Mrs K also spent £58.63 on 21 September 2018 and NewDay  
said she owed a total of £407.65. But, like the investigator, Im satisfied NewDays  
statements show its charged Mrs K again despite her clearing the £349.02 payment during 
the previous month. I can see that Mrs K has been overcharged by NewDay, in line with 
what the investigator said. 
Ref: DRN00375712In response to the investigator NewDay said it had sent the payment back to Mrs Ks 
husbands bank  twice but thats not what its system notes say. NewDays  system notes from 
12 September 2018 say refund not actioned previouslyhave  now processed this.  I think  
the notes are clear  in showing  that the first refund wasnt actioned.  
To resolve  the complaint  the investigator  asked NewDay to retrieve Mrs Ks account from a 
third party whos recently  contacted her. NewDay has explained that the third party  is acting 
on its behalf to collect the outstanding balance but it hasnt  sold or transferred the debt. Im 
pleased the debt remains with NewDay. I have removed this part of the settlement as 
unnecessary. 
For the reasons  Ive set out above,  I agree with the investigator that Mrs Ks complaint  
should be upheld.  I also agree that the only balance  that remains  to be paid is £58.63. 
NewDay should allow Mrs K to make that payment to repay the outstanding  balance. If 
NewDay has registered adverse information  about Mrs K with the credit reference agencies  
it should take steps to remove it as its not an accurate portrayal of how the account has 
been run. And, given the errors Ive seen, the distress caused by being  contacted  by a third 
party and the trouble  and upset this matter has caused I think the investigators 
recommendation that NewDay  pay Mrs K £100 is fair. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and direct  NewDay  Ltd to settle as follows: 
-Remove any adverse  information reported to the credit reference  agencies
-Allow Mrs K to clear  the outstanding £58.63
-Pay Mrs K £100 in respect  of the distress  and inconvenience caused
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 December 2019.
