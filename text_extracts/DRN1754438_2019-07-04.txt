K821x#15complaint
Mr E says PDL Finance Limited  (trading  as Mr Lender) lent to him irresponsibly. He says the 
loans trapped  him in a debt spiral and the repayments took up most of his income  and so he 
had to borrow again.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. Mr Lender disagreed  with the adjudicators 
opinion so the complaint has been  passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Es case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Es complaint in part and have explained why below.
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr E 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Es income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN17544382But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully thought  about what all this means  for Mr Es complaint.
Mr Lender has said before agreeing to lend any of the loans, it searched  Mr Es credit  file 
and there  was nothing within the file that was concerning  it hasnt provided this service 
with the detailed results  of its search and I havent seen a copy of Mr Es credit file so I cant  
say if there  were concerning entries  on the file. It also said it asked Mr E about his income  
which he declared as £2,300. And Mr Lender requested  Mr Es payslips to verify  his income. 
Mr Lender also checked  Mr Es living costs and other credit commitments  which  Mr E 
declared as £1,808 monthly. And it was based  on the outcome of its checks it lent to Mr E.
I think the checks Mr Lender carried out before agreeing to lend loan 1 went  far enough. It 
was Mr Es first loan and considering his declared him, the loan amount of £400  and its 
repayment was relatively  low compared to his income, it suggests that Mr E could afford the 
loan. 
I can see that Mr E rolled over this loan twice  before  repaying  it. I think this suggests  that he 
wasnt in a position to afford this loan sustainably and needed some breathing space for the 
repayment. And so when  Mr E applied to borrow loan 2 within  a day of repaying  loan 1, I 
think Mr Lender  should  have been concerned for a number of reasons and it should have 
taken its checks further for this and subsequent loans.
Firstly, he was borrowing within 24 hours  of repaying a loan which it seems he struggled to 
repay. Also, he was borrowing  more than his previous loan. I think there was an indication 
here that Mr E didnt  sustainably repay  loan 1 and the repayment of that loan had left a hole 
in his finances that he needed to borrow again so quickly to fill.
In those circumstances, Mr Lender shouldnt have been lending loan 2. I can see that Mr E 
also rolled over loan 2 twice before  managing to repay it and borrowed loan 3 within two 
days of repaying loan 2. This became a pattern in Mr Es borrowing  where  he borrowed a 
new loan within a short time of repaying  a previous loan.
Mr Lender ought to have  been aware  that this pattern  demonstrated that Mr E couldnt 
sustainably afford the loans and it shouldnt have continued to lend to him.
Ref: DRN17544383And by loan 5, Mr E had been  indebted to Mr Lender for around  17 months without any 
significant breaks in the lending relationship. And Mr E had become dependent  on these 
loans and it should have concerned Mr Lender  that he was using the loans as a supplement 
for his income - something  these  loans arent  suitable for. I say this because:
the amounts Mr E was borrowing were generally increasing, and Mr Lender ought to 
have realised it was likely their indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr E wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed Mr Lender. And was in 
effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended  period  
Mr E was in a lending relationship with Mr Lender for more  than three  years  without 
any significant breaks. I say this because although  Mr E had a break of around five 
months after repaying loan 9 and borrowing loan 10, I dont think that gap was 
sufficient to allow Mr lender  reasonably believe that his circumstances had improved 
-  particularly as hed been  borrowing  for around  36 months by this stage.
Mr E was demonstrating repayment  difficulties from loan 1.
As Mr Lender continued to provide  borrowing, Mr E lost out because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Es indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time,
the number of loans (loans and deferrals)  was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Es ability  to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the 
market for these  high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Es complaint about  loans 2 to 10 because the overall  pattern  of lending 
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  and he lost 
out as a result.
Ive also carefully thought  whether Mr Lender acted unfairly or unreasonable  in some other 
way. Having done so, Ive not seen anything here that leads me to conclude  Mr Lender 
acted unfairly or unreasonably towards  Mr E in some other way.  
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr E paid on loans 2 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were  paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
for loan 10, remove any fees and charges  added to the capital and treat all payments 
made by Mr E as repayments  towards the capital. If a capital balance is still 
outstanding then Mr Lender may use the redress above to offset this. Mr Lender can 
only offset if it still owns the loan.
remove any negative  information about loans 2 to 5 from Mr Es credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards  means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 10 should be removed from Mr 
Es credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender  to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
must give Mr E a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN17544384my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Es 
complaint. PDL Finance Limited should  pay redress as Ive set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 August 2019.
