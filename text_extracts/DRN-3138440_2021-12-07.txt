The complaint
Ms G (through her representative) complains that Short term Finance Limited (STFL) lent to 
her irresponsibly.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on 29 September 2021 in which I used information from STFL 
to create a table of the loans approved for Ms G. Since then, STFL has written to alter that 
information and apologise to us. So here is the amended loan table which includes a final 
loan 31 and alteration of the approval date for loan 30. 
STFL has confirmed that all the loans have been repaid and so Ms G does not owe it any 
money.

The final response letter (FRL) after Ms Gs complaint in April 2020 was not issued until
July 2021, by which time the complaint had been referred to this Service.  In that FRL, STFL 
indicated that it is not going to uphold her complaint.
Since I issued my provisional decision STFL has said that there were some mistakes in the 
FRL and so I have not duplicated any paragraphs from that FRL. 
Ms G has described that
In 2019 was struggling with 3 kids - every time a loan finished they kept giving them 
to me. And the thing with SFT loans is if you had taken a £1250 loan and only had 
£250 left to pay they would continually harris [sic] you by text by phone call, and 
when you are struggling financially with having young children you take it, and 
I strongly feel I have been taken advantage off. Then if I had missed a payment 
because I couldn't afford it they would call and come knocking at my door
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and thought that additional checks ought to 
have been carried out from loan 5 but she had nothing from Ms G to give her the details of 
Ms Gs financial position around that time. Our adjudicator also thought that from loan 8 
STFL ought to have ceased lending.STFL disagreed and said:
We believe that there was nothing wrong with the way we dealt with [Ms G] during 
the time that she had credit from us. We believe that we adhered to all the 
requirements required by guidelines, regulations and our own policies and 
procedures which fell within good industry practices at the time.
The complaint remained unresolved and was passed to me to decide.
As I have explained earlier, I issued a provisional decision on 29 September 2021. Those 
provisional decision findings are set out in the next section under its own heading and with 
smaller type size to differentiate it. But the reader must note that it was based on there being 
30 loans (as we were originally informed) and since then STFL has made some corrections. 
Both parties have received my provisional decision and how they responded to it is set out 
later in this decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
STFL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms G could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure.
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that STFL should 
fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the 
consumer. These factors include:
having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting 
the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable);
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
STFL was required to establish whether Ms G could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. The 
earlier loans approved for Ms G was when the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) had issued itsLending Guide (ILG). That gave clear guidelines for lenders to follow about lending 
responsibly.
From 1 April 2014 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulatory body and built 
on the irresponsible lending concepts set out in the OFTs ILG. It issued the Consumer 
Credit Sourcebook (CONC) in which sustainable is defined as being the ability to repay 
without undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet
the repayments.
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further
in order to do that.
My provisional decision findings dated 29 September 2021
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context and 
what this all means for Ms Gs complaint.
The evidence from both parties for loans 1 to 11.
STFL has nothing at all to send to us for the loans approved more than six years before the complaint 
was made in April 2020  so it has sent us nothing for loans 1 to 11.
Ms Gs evidence is perplexing. She has brought an irresponsible lending complaint. Her only 
evidence supplied to this service is a Claim Audit Form (signed in March 2020) in which Ms G has 
said that STFL agents did ask her for her proof of earnings, and did ask her about her outgoings and 
expenses, and that her financial circumstances were re-checked each time she borrowed. Ms G, in 
that form, has supplied information about what she received as income and what her expenses were 
which demonstrate she was able to afford the loans.
Having said that, I have usually said in past decisions that Id prefer that these figures in complainants 
Claim Audit Forms were backed up by other documents to support them rather than simply accepting 
them on the Audit Form. And so, I take the same line here with Ms Gs Audit Form. Ms G has the time 
to send to me additional evidence for the period 2012 to 2020 if she wishes.
Therefore, for loans 1 to 11, I can only rely on the little information I have which is unverified financial 
information from Ms G which indicates she was able to afford the loans. So, I do agree with the 
adjudicator that more comprehensive checks ought to have been carried out by STFL earlier than 
they were, but without more from Ms G I can only rely on the information I have. And that, albeit 
unverified information, shows me that she was able to afford these loans.
So, on current evidence, I am planning not to uphold loans 1 to 11.
The evidence from both parties for loans 12 to 30
The evidence from Ms G is the same  solely her Claim Audit Form information. And her 
representatives complaint letter includes this paragraph:
To the extent there is any discrepancy in the information contained in the Claim Audit Form 
and information given to you previously by [Ms G] we contend that repeat borrowing should 
have caused you to undertake further checks to assess the of that information.
STFL has sent to us details of the application forms in which Ms Gs figures for her income and 
outgoings are set out. Each of them demonstrates that Ms G was able to afford the loans. But there 
are other elements about the information on those applications forms, plus the additional evidence 
I have from STFL about Ms G, which leads me to think that the reality did not correlate with the 
application form figures.Some of the entries on the application forms show me that Ms G has ticked, or the STFL agent has 
ticked for her, answers such as
Agreement reason  subsistence
How much can you afford to spend each week?  Nil or None
These answers do not suggest that Ms G was taking these high cost loans for a good reason and 
also suggest that she had no additional money. And so the two sections of the application forms do 
not appear to match: calculated affordable and yet Ms G is saying she could not afford anything and 
was asking for the loan for subsistence.
And in the figures, often the section for weekly outgoings on other loans (Loans/credit) were N/A, or 
£10 or if it was a larger figure like £100 a week then it had a notation by it to show it was an STF 
repayment figure. These facts appear to be incorrect as I know from records that we have for Ms G, 
that she was taking loans from at least one other lender from April 2010 to November 2015 and from 
January 2014 they were for £800 or more with that other lender.
In some instances, the STFL agent was marking down that Ms G was already paying £100 a week to 
STFL for existing loans and yet was continuing to arrange additional loans and further debt for her.
STFL has sent to us an Assessment of Affordability document dated June 2019 in which her 
outgoings were listed as including information from a credit report showing Ms G was paying £217 a 
month to a home credit company and £719 a month for a hire purchase company. Whereas her 
income was made up of benefits, carers allowance, disability allowances and child tax credits and job 
seekers allowance.
None of this presents a picture of a person sustainably able to repay and/or to take on more debt. And 
yet STFL lent to her consistently and continuously for eight years. And these are the background facts 
which underpin the fact that I do agree with our adjudicator that there is evidence of unsustainable, 
repeat lending. On current evidence I think that STFL ought to have ceased lending to Ms G from loan 
12. I say this because:
From Loan 12 onwards Ms G was provided with a new loan within days (often the same day) 
of settling a previous one. So STFL ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms G 
had an ongoing need and that Ms Gs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ms G wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed STFL. Loan 29 was taken out 
more than 7 years after loan 1 (£100) and was for £1,300. Loan 30 was taken out 8 years 
after Ms Gs first and was for £500. Ms G had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, 
service a debt to STFL over an extended period.
I think that Ms G lost out because STFL continued to provide borrowing from loan 12 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Gs indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Ms Gs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about loans 12 to 30 and STFL should put things right.
What did both parties say in response to the provisional decision?
Ms G, through her representative, has accepted my provisional decision. From that it seems 
she does not dispute the outcome for loans 1 to 11 and has sent us no additional information 
about her finances. So, my decision on those is that I do not uphold Loans 1 to 11. STFL has replied with some corrections to the information it had sent to us earlier and some 
additional information about obtaining credit searches and retention of any credit search 
results. It has sent to us a set of results from a credit search it says it carried out for Ms G in 
November 2019 and July 2020. These demonstrate Ms G had defaults and County Court 
Judgments at the time and so this set of facts supports my findings that Ms G was not able 
to keep accepting credit from STFL. 
STFL refers to an 8 week gap between loans 30 and 31. But it does not explain in its 
response to us what relevance that 8 week gap has on the outcome. Ive thought about what 
STFL might be trying to say but it has made no difference to my outcome. It had been 
lending to Ms G for so long that I do not think an 8 week gap would have made a difference. 
And in any event, as I explain in my next paragraphs, there were several months when Ms G 
could not apply to borrow from STFL as its lending was suspended.
STFL has sent to us a detailed Report which it has confirmed it wanted me to consider in 
relation to the last two loans. The Executive Summary of the Report tells me that STFL was 
issued with a Skilled Person Requirement Notice on 21 October 2019 by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA). The Notice required STFL to appoint a Skilled Person under s166 
of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) to undertake various phased 
Reviews. It goes on to explain that STFL ceased lending following the Phase I report in 
order to implement required changes. Following a five-month period of not lending and in 
line with our recommended changes, STF implemented its updated lending policies and 
processes and recommenced lending on 20 July 2020.
Loans 30 and 31 were issued just after that restart of its lending in July 2020. My 
understanding is that STFL wanted me to consider the fact that the Report demonstrates 
that loans 30 and 31 were approved after it had updated its lending approach. So, I interpret 
that to mean that STFL is submitting to us that the loan approvals for loans 30 and 31 must 
have been satisfactory.  
But having read the Report then its clear that the individual cases looked at were a sample 
and theres no indication here that Ms Gs two loans were part of that sample. The 
description in the report is that STFL and the FCA agreed a sample of 40 files would be 
sufficient to identify if STFs lending practices were compliant with the regulators rules and 
principles.
And even if the lending approval of loans 30 and 31 for Ms G was one of those sampled 
files, I do note that I have the credit search information sent to me which Ive referred to 
earlier which shows significant evidence of Ms G having financial troubles around that time. 
And, I note that these loans were approved by STFL after Ms G had complained to it about 
its lending on 17 April 2020. And so, within the context of an applicant applying to it for two 
more significant loans after she had complained about it lending to her irresponsibly in the 
past, then I would have expected additional checks to have been undertaken by STFL 
before approving them. If those additional checks showed she had CCJs, defaults and 
delinquent accounts, then I dont consider that the Report is going to persuade me that 
STFLs decision to lend loans 30 and 31 was a responsible one. 
I repeat all my provisional decision findings here which demonstrate Ms Gs situation and the 
repetitive nature of the lending was such that STFL ought to have ceased lending at loan 12. 
The Report appears to support my provisional findings about many of those loans. 
All these points add to my resolution that I think that STFL should put things right for Ms G 
from loan 12 to loan 31. The longevity of the lending relationship, and the repetitive nature of 
the lending over many years has been explained in my provisional decision. Putting things right
In deciding what redress STFL should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms G from loan 12, as Im satisfied it ought to 
have. Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms G may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct.
From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real 
and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Ms G in a 
compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Ms G would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options.
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFLs liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right.
STFL ought to do as follows:
refund all interest and charges Ms G paid on loans 12 to 31;
pay interest of 8% simple a year* on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from 12 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 12 to 30 should be removed from 
Ms Gs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STFL to take off tax from this interest. It must give Ms G
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Gs complaint in part and I direct that Short Term 
Finance Limited does as I have outlined above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 January 2022.
