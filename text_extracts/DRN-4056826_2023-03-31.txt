The complaint
Mr H complains Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.K.) Limited (Sun Life) mis-sold 
him a unit-linked reviewable whole of life plan.
Mr H is represented in this complaint by a claims management company (CMC) but, for 
ease, Ill refer to Mr H directly throughout my decision.
What happened
In 1988, Mr H took out a Design for Life unit-linked reviewable whole of life plan 
recommended by an adviser from a predecessor of Sun Life. Mr H paid into the plan a 
monthly premium of £20 with an annual premium increase of £2 for the first five years.
The plan was set up on a maximum investment basis meaning it provided the minimum 
amount of life cover available, £10,321. The plan was surrendered in 1999.
In November 2020, Mr H complained to Sun Life that the plan had been mis-sold. He said 
whilst the plan was set up on a maximum investment basis there is no evidence he 
required a whole of life savings plan, nor was there evidence other alternatives were 
discussed or his attitude to risk being having been established.
Sun Life didnt uphold the complaint. They said whilst they were unable to determine how 
long Mr H wished to save for, he was already contributing to long term plans at the time and 
the plan recommended could have been cancelled after five years without charge.
Sun Life also said whilst they cannot determine Mr Hs attitude to risk, the funds selected 
would indicate a discussion had taken place and noted hed had several years experience of 
the type of investment recommended.
Because the plan was a suitable means of primarily saving over the medium to long term, 
with the life cover the minimum required to make the plan qualifying for tax purposes, Sun 
Life said the recommendation was appropriate for Mr Hs circumstances at the time.
Mr H remained unhappy, so referred his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. 
One of our Investigators looked into things but didnt think the advice given was unsuitable, 
so didnt think Sun Life needed to do anything to put things right.
As no resolution could be reached, this case has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
After reviewing the complaint, I didnt fully agree with our investigator. So, I issued a 
provisional decision on 2 March 2023. In this I said:
Ive considered all the evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont currently agree with our investigators view. Ill explain why.
Firstly, its important to say there is limited information available relating to the sale of the 
plan to Mr H, which is unsurprising as it was taken out some 35 years ago and surrendered 
some 24 years ago. We do have some point-of-sale documentation; however, I consider it 
reasonable that not everything might be available from the time. 
In the absence of further records from the time of advice, the information Mr H has provided 
as part of his complaint submission and what I do have available from the time is evidence 
Ive considered to help build a picture of his circumstances. 
I recognise its possible I may not be able to fully establish the events leading to Mr H taking 
out the plan - but Im also conscious that over thirty years have passed since then. 
Ultimately, I need to reach a decision on the balance of probabilities  and this is what Ive 
done using all of the information provided by both parties to the complaint.
Mr H says he was seeking a savings plan which seems reasonable given his circumstances 
at the time as a married 36-year-old with no dependants. The fact find from the time 
supports this identifying building capital as his primary objective. It seems Mr H had no real 
need for life assurance also supported by the fact find which identifies this as his third 
objective albeit with the caveat that it was included virtually free.
But the plan brochure makes it clear that it is a life assurance and investment plan with 
even the maximum investment basis which was selected describing the plan as also 
providing an amount of life cover sufficient to meet the typical needs of most people.
I asked Sun Life to provide me the cost of the life cover provided but theyve been unable to 
provide me this information. Due to the passage of time thats past, this is understandable 
however without it, Im unable to say with any certainty it was virtually free and didnt have 
an impact (maybe even a significant one) on the value of the plan.
Mr H raised the issue of his attitude to risk not being established. The plan was set up to 
invest in three of the available funds with his premium being split 25% into a cautious fund, 
50% into a balanced fund and 25% into an aggressive fund. The plan offered an option for 
the premium to be invested in a managed fund, but this wasnt what happened. Im satisfied 
on balance, a discussion regarding Mr Hs attitude to risk is more likely than not to have 
taken place and that he was open to some, albeit a low to medium level of risk.
But Ive seen nothing to suggest Mr H wanted to invest long-term. As Sun Life note, he was 
already contributing to long-term savings plans at the time and as Ive said Mr H was 36 and 
married with no dependants. Ive seen no evidence he wouldnt have needed access to the 
capital should changes in his circumstances such as parenthood or further house purchases 
have happened. I dont think committing him to a plan of this type was suitable.
Sun Life say whilst the policy was for whole of life, it could be cancelled penalty free after 
five years. But, throughout the first two years of the policy, 0% of Mr Hs premiums were 
used to buy units and as such the fund value, once accounting for the cost of the life cover, 
was placed in a negative position.
Mr H surrendered the plan after 11 years. But the plan is designed to be held for a period of 
at least 15 years. For the plan to work as it was designed to, this time was needed for the 
fund value to grow after accounting to the associated fees and the cost of the life cover.On balance, based on what I know about Mr Hs circumstances at the time, Ive not seen 
anything to suggest he wanted to invest for that period of time or longer and I think a shorter-
term product, with lower associated fees would have been more suitable.
It follows, I dont think the advice provided to Mr H was suitable and I propose Sun Life 
should do the following to put things right.
Fair compensation
In assessing what would be fair compensation, I consider that my aim should be to put Mr H 
as close to the position he would probably now be in if he had not been given unsuitable 
advice.
I think Mr H would have invested differently. It is not possible to say precisely what he would 
have done, but I am satisfied that what I have set out below is fair and reasonable given Mr 
H's circumstances and objectives when he invested.
What should Sun Life do?
To compensate Mr H fairly, Sun Life must:
Compare the performance of Mr H's investment with that of the benchmark shown 
below and pay the difference between the fair value and the actual value of the 
investment. If the actual value is greater than the fair value, no compensation is 
payable.
Sun Life should also add any interest set out below to the compensation payable.
Income tax may be payable on any interest awarded.

Any additional sum that Mr H paid into the investment should be added to the fair value 
calculation at the point it was actually paid in.Why is this remedy suitable?
I have chosen this method of compensation because:
Mr H wanted Capital growth and was willing to accept some investment risk.
The FTSE UK Private Investors Income Total Return index (prior to 1 March 2017, 
the FTSE WMA Stock Market Income total return index) is a mix of diversified indices 
representing different asset classes, mainly UK equities and government bonds. It 
would be a fair measure for someone who was prepared to take some risk to get a 
higher return.
Although it is called income index, the mix and diversification provided within the index is 
close enough to allow me to use it as a reasonable measure of comparison given Mr H's 
circumstances and risk attitude.
Sun Life responded to say they considered Mr Hs complaint to have been raised outside of 
the time limits the rules we must follow allow.
I explained to Sun Life that Id considered our jurisdiction over this complaint prior to issuing 
my provisional decision and I was satisfied there were no time-bar issues to address. After 
considering the points Sun Life raised, I said my opinion hadnt changed and set out why.
I also said DISP 3.2.6 sets out that where the Ombudsman then decides that the complaint 
is not out of jurisdiction, he will inform the complainant and give reasons for that decision to 
the respondent.. So, unless I received evidence to change my mind on our jurisdiction, I 
would explain the reasons Ive decided this case is one we can consider, when issuing my 
decision on the merits of this complaint.
I let Sun Life know they should provide any further comments either regarding jurisdiction or 
the merits of this case by 30 March 2023. I received no further response from Sun Life.
Why I can consider this case
Sun Life said because Mr H paid into the policy £67.80 more over 11 years, in comparison to 
the surrender value he received in 1999, and then chose to invest the surrender proceeds 
into an ISA, it is reasonable to conclude that if hed been unhappy with the returns, he 
wouldve raised those concerns at the time.
But theres no evidence that Mr H was disappointed with the return upon surrender or that he 
received a different amount than he expected. Mr H may well have been disappointed his 
plan hadnt performed better at the time of surrender, but based on what Ive found, I think 
he was prepared to take some risk. 
In short, nothing happened at surrender that Mr H wouldnt have been expecting as a 
possibility. His complaint isnt about the performance of the policy. Rather that he had no 
requirement for a whole of life savings plan, nor is there evidence alternatives were 
discussed. Mr H also complains there is no evidence his attitude to risk was established at 
the time.
The performance of the policy may have been a factor in Mr H surrendering it 1999, but that 
doesnt mean he ought reasonably to have had cause for concern that the advice he 
received was unsuitable, or that alternative products were available until he was advised by 
his representative in 2020, after they completed their own assessment.For these reasons, Im satisfied this complaint is one we can consider.
Regarding the merits of this complaint Mr H confirmed to me he had nothing further to add in 
response to my provisional decision. Sun Life also didnt provide any comments for me to 
consider regarding the merits of this complaint.
Because neither party provided any comments to my provisional decision regarding the 
merits of this complaint, Ive seen no reason to reach a different conclusion to the one I 
reached previously.
Putting things right
Sun Life should do the following to put things right:

as close to the position he would probably now be in if he had not been given unsuitable

My final decision
Your Im upholding Mr Hs complaint. Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.K.) 
Limited must put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2023.
