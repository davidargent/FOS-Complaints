The complaint
Mr W complains that a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement with 
Moneybarn No. Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr W under a conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn 
that he electronically signed in October 2019;
Moneybarn, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory quality will 
depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the car and the 
price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr W was about seven years old, had been driven for 
67,941 miles and had a price of Â£9,595;
Mr W says that the car was leaking oil which was confirmed by his friend who is a 
mechanic who also identified and that there was an issue with the anti-roll bar  so 
he took the car to a garage and he says that it found an oil leak and that the right 
hand front anti-roll bar drop link was worn;
Mr W complained to Moneybarn in November 2019 and it arranged for the car to be 
inspected by an independent expert later that month  the inspection report recorded 
the cars mileage as 71,041 and concluded: 
The Vehicle is considered to be in a good condition generally, consistent with 
its age and recorded mileage.
There is no evidence to indicate that the vehicle was of unsatisfactory quality 
or unfit for its purpose at the time of sale, i.e. the vehicle physical condition 
was consistent with the vehicle that had well over 70,000 miles on the clock 
with only the expected where levels present; just some minor bodywork 
damage however is not impinging the vehicle been road legal and would not 
result the vehicle not meeting minimal MOT standards.
The vehicle had evidence of minor oil seepage on the underside of the 
vehicle and had evidence that there was an oil repaired at some point in the 
past with oil leak appears to have been repaired successfully although the oil 
residue has not been cleaned off.
Conclude that the vehicle in our opinion is currently fir for purpose road legal 
and of satisfactory quality for a vehicle its age and reported mileage ;
Moneybarn didnt uphold his complaint but said that, if the oil leak persists and Mr W 
was able to refute the independent experts findings, it would be happy to review his 
complaint  but it said in January 2020 that Mr W hadnt contacted it again about the 
oil leak;
Mr W complained to this service and our investigator didnt think that Moneybarn had 
supplied him with a car which was of unsatisfactory quality so Mr W has asked for his 
complaint to be considered by an ombudsman;
Mr W has referred to the findings of his friend and a garage which looked at the car 
and his friend has provided a written statement about the issues with the car  but 
theres no written evidence from the garage to confirm its professional opinion about 
those issues;
Moneybarn arranged for an independent expert to inspect the car less than a month 
after it had been supplied to Mr W  and in that time hed driven more than 3,000 
miles in the car  and the expert concluded that the car was of satisfactory quality;
the car had passed MOT tests in October 2018 and November 2019 when its 
mileage was recorded as 65,795 and 67,989;
Mr W clearly feels very strongly that there were faults with the car when it was 
supplied to him and I sympathise with his disappointment about the car and the 
difficulties that it has caused him  but hes not provided any other evidence in 
response to our investigators findings to show that the car wasnt of satisfactory 
quality when it was supplied to him;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr W or that it was misrepresented to him 
by the dealer;
I consider that Moneybarns response to his complaint has been fair and reasonable 
in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Moneybarn to allow Mr W 
to reject the car, to pay for it to be repaired, to pay him any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 January 2021.
