K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains that NewDay Ltd dealt unfairly with his chargeback  claim.
background
Mr R made  a purchase using his NewDay (Aqua)  credit card.  The goods werent received in 
the condition that Mr R expected. Mr R contacted NewDay to raise  a dispute. NewDay sent a 
declaration form to Mr R and asked him to provide further information. Mr R sent the 
information by fax and subsequently chased  NewDay asking for an update on his case.
NewDay says it never  received the fax from Mr R. It says the number he used was no longer 
in use. It says that because it didnt hear from Mr R with information to process the 
chargeback it closed the chargeback dispute and reinstated interest charges on the account.
Mr R isnt happy that interest  has been  applied to the transaction. He says he was told that 
interest wouldnt be added whilst  the dispute was ongoing.
Mr R also raised  another dispute regarding a transaction where he hadnt received a refund 
from the merchant. NewDay has said that because it didnt receive any evidence  to show 
that the merchant  agreed to process  a refund, it didnt raise a chargeback.
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. She said that although a chargeback  wasnt  
raised by NewDay, if it had been raised  it wouldve been raised  against  the online  payment 
service and not against the seller directly.  The investigator said it was unlikely that the 
chargeback claim wouldve succeeded  because the online payment service carried  out its 
obligations under  the contract  by transferring  the money. The investigator said that although 
the customer service provided by NewDay couldve  been better, this wouldve made a 
difference to the outcome of the dispute.
Mr R didnt agree. He said hed used the fax number supplied  by NewDay on previous 
occasions. He felt that if NewDay  had raised the chargeback when he first contacted them, it 
wouldve placed him in a stronger position  with the online payment service. Mr R also said 
that NewDay had told him that interest  wouldnt be added to his account.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
A chargeback claim is a demand  by a credit card provider  (in this case NewDay) for a 
merchant to make good the loss on a disputed  transaction.  It happened when a cardholder  
questions a transaction and asks the credit card provider to reverse it. When a chargeback  
happens the disputed funds are held back from the merchant until the dispute  has been 
determined. 
In this case, Mr R paid for the goods via an online money service on 22 April 2018.  He 
contacted NewDay  to raise a chargeback  on 10 July 2018. NewDay  sent a declaration form 
the same  day. It also sent a follow up letter on 1 August 2018. Mr R sent his information to 
NewDay by fax on 12 August but NewDay didnt receive it. The 120 day period for raising a 
chargeback dispute  ended  on 20 August 2018.  Because NewDay  hadnt received Mr Rs 
information by this date, it closed the dispute.
Ref: DRN16251352I appreciate that Mr R sent his information  by fax before the 120 day period had ended. He 
says he received a transmission report  and had no reason to believe  that the fax number 
wasnt in use. I dont doubt Mr Rs version of events. But even if NewDay had received the 
information in time,  I don think the outcome here would  be any different. I say this because  
the chargeback  wouldve been  raised  against  the online  payment service.  I cant say that the 
online payment  service did anything wrong, because it fulfilled its contractual obligations to 
Mr R by transferring the funds to the intended  recipient. So I dont think  the chargeback 
claim wouldve been successful in any event.
Mr R has asked whether NewDay should have initiated a chargeback when he first called. I 
understand why he raises  this point. But I think NewDay acted reasonably in asking Mr R to 
provide further  information before it processed  the chargeback. And for the reasons Ive 
explained above, I dont think it would have  made  any difference  to the outcome if the 
chargeback claim had been  raised,  because I dont  think the claim would have succeeded.
In relation to the interest and charges on Mr Rs account, I cant  say that NewDay  has acted 
unfairly here.  Although interest  is generally frozen whilst a chargeback claim is in dispute, if 
the cardholder  is ultimately found liable, interest  will be reinstated  from the date of the 
original transaction.  This is in accordance with the terms and conditions  of the account.
In relation to the second dispute raised by Mr R, NewDay  has said that it couldnt raise  this 
dispute under the chargeback process  because there  was no evidence  to suggest that Mr R 
had been promised a refund and not received it. I dont think NewDay  has acted unfairly  
here  it could only have raised a dispute  if the merchant had issued a credit  note saying 
that a refund  would  be issued  and then failed to issue the refund.
For the reasons  Ive explained Im unable  to uphold the complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 April 2020.
