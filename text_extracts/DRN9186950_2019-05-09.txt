K821x#15complaint
Mr J complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid)  was irresponsible  to lend 
him money.
background
Mr J took out six loans with QuickQuid between October 2012  and July 2017. A summary  of 
his borrowing is below:
Loan Date borrowed
Amount Amount due Date repaid
1 27/10/2012 £400 £475 30/11/2012
2 06/12/2012 £400 £485 20/12/2012
3 16/09/2014 £450 £563 30/09/2014
4 26/03/2015 £400 £512 30/04/2015
5 30/06/2015 £400 £499 18/08/2015
6 14/07/2017 £700 £95, £78, £784 outstanding
Mr J thinks that QuickQuid  shouldnt have lent to him as he was borrowing from a number of 
other payday lenders. Mr J would like QuickQuid to refund the interest  and charges that hes 
paid on the loans and remove them from his credit  file.
The adjudicator recommended that Mr Js complaint should be upheld in part. In summary, 
she thought that it wasnt  unfair of QuickQuid to agree loans one to five. But the adjudicator  
didnt think that it was reasonable of QuickQuid  to agree loan six.
The adjudicator recommended that QuickQuid refund  all interest  and charges that Mr J had 
paid on loan six with interest on the refund. And she said it should  remove any negative 
information about loan six from Mr Js credit file. As the balance on loan six has been 
outstanding for such a long period of time, the adjudicator also asked  QuickQuid to remove 
all entries about loan six from March 2018  onwards.
QuickQuid disagreed with the adjudicators view. It says that it carried  out adequate and 
proportionate checks. Particularly  given the significant  break  between  repaying loan five and 
taking out loan six. 
QuickQuid says that Mr J declared a monthly income of £1,960 and it points out that Mr J 
was able to repay loan six over three  months. QuickQuid says that despite incurring a late 
fee on loan six, the loan was sustainable for Mr J.
 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr J 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
Ref: DRN91869502number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that 
QuickQuid should  fairly  and reasonably  have  done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think its important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the rules  in place when Mr J borrowed loan six define sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. 
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre borrowing a 
significant proportion  of their income.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Js complaint.
loans one to five
Before agreeing each of these loans, QuickQuid asked Mr J for details of his income,  living 
costs and regular  credit commitments. 
Given the amount  of each loan repayment  and the significant gaps between some of the 
loans, I agree with the adjudicator that QuickQuids checks for loans one, two, four and five 
were proportionate. Based on the information that Mr J provided,  it appeared to QuickQuid 
that he could afford  each  of these loans.
Ref: DRN91869503Although there was a significant  gap between repaying loan two and taking out loan three,  
QuickQuid expected Mr J to repay more than before. So I think  that this shouldve prompted 
QuickQuid to find out a little bit more about Mr Js finances. 
I think a proportionate check shouldve involved QuickQuid asking about Mr Js other  short 
term lending commitments. I dont have  any evidence  to suggest that QuickQuid did this. But 
even if QuickQuid had carried out what I consider to have been a proportionate  check,  its 
likely that it wouldve still appeared that Mr J could  afford to repay loan three. 
It follows that I dont uphold Mr Js complaint about  loans one to five.
loan six
Although there had been a long break  between repaying loan five and applying  for loan six, 
QuickQuid expected Mr J to repay a significant proportion of his declared monthly income as 
a final instalment of £784. This means  that in addition to asking about  Mr Js living costs and 
regular credit commitments, I think QuickQuid  shouldve  tried to establish  whether he owed 
money to other short term lenders.
With better checks, it seems  likely  that QuickQuid wouldve discovered that Mr J had other 
short term lending commitments. But even without these kinds  of checks,  I think QuickQuid 
shouldve realised that £784  was a significant  enough proportion  of Mr Js declared  monthly  
income to mean that it was likely he would have to borrow again  to repay it. So I dont think  
that QuickQuid shouldve agreed  this loan.
Mr J made  QuickQuid aware of his financial difficulties  in September 2017.  The outstanding 
balance will have had a negative  impact  on Mr Js credit  file. It seems fair that QuickQuid 
remove any entries about loan six from March 2018  once Mr J has settled  the loan.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges that Mr J paid on loan six;
 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
write off any unpaid interest and charges on loan six;
if it chooses to, apply the refund  to any outstanding principal balance  on loan six before 
paying any remaining  balance  (if there  is any) to Mr J**; and
the length of time that the outstanding balance on loan six has remained  on Mr Js credit 
file means that any information about it from March 2018 onwards  is negative.  So once 
settled, QuickQuid should remove all entries  about  loan six from March 2018 onwards 
from Mr Js credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If 
QuickQuid intends  to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding balance,  it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
Ref: DRN91869504**If after carrying out the above steps there is still an outstanding balance,  I remind  
QuickQuid of its obligation to treat Mr J sympathetically and reasonably  if he puts forward  
any repayment proposals
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Js complaint in part and direct CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 June 2019.
