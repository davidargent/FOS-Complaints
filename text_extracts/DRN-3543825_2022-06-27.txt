The complaint
Mr B complains that BUPA Insurance Limited turned down his dental insurance claim.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. 
Instead, Ill focus on the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigators conclusions for these reasons:
When Mr B called Bupa on 2 November 2020 to advise that he had left his 
employment, Bupas adviser said his cover was still showing as active until the 
renewal date in October 2021. The adviser said Mr Bs previous employer hadnt 
asked Bupa to remove Mr B from cover. This was correct information at the time. 
Bupas adviser did ask Mr B to check with his previous employer to see if his cover 
had ended, or if it would remain active until October 2021.
Mr Bs employer advised Bupa on 16 November 2020 to remove Mr B from the 
scheme, and therefore his cover lapsed. So when Mr B submitted a claim in July 
2021, it was appropriate for Bupa to turn this down as he no longer had cover under 
the scheme. 
If Mr B had spoken to his employer as Bupa had suggested, he wouldve known that 
his cover was due to end after 16 November 2020.
As this is a group scheme, it was the responsibility of Mr Bs employer to let Mr B 
know when his cover would end, not Bupas.
However, I note that Bupa didnt respond to Mr B after it received his claim. I think 
the £50 compensation recommended by our investigator adequately reflects the 
inconvenience caused to Mr B by Bupas lack of communication.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold this complaint. I require BUPA Insurance Limited to 
pay Mr B £50 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 July 2022.
