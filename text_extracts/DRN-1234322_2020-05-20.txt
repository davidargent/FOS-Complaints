The complaint
Mr A complains about the service he received from PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
(PayPal) following the purchase of goods.
What happened
On 2 July 2019 Mr A sent a payment to a merchant for the purchase of goods. On 29 July 
2019, Mr A contacted PayPal to advise there was a problem with the items he received, not 
being as described. PayPal raised a dispute at this time, confirming this by email to Mr A and 
contacting the merchant directly. It then asked Mr A to provide evidence to support his claim 
detailing why the items were not as described.
Mr A has said he didnt intend to raise a claim with PayPal. And instead had wanted to know 
how to use the insurance associated with the transaction, and to see evidence the insurance 
was paid for.
Mr A said PayPal has acted unfairly by raising a claim and asking him for evidence. Hes 
said PayPal refused to discuss the direct debit guarantee with him and didnt accept his 
appeal on the claim decision. Mr A says PayPals actions in raising and then closing the 
case jeopardised his chances of getting a refund directly from the merchant.
Mr A raised a further point about the poor service he received when speaking to PayPal on 
the phone and when he complained. He believes PayPal is intentionally withholding the 
phone calls from our service and that it refused to send him a deadlock letter when he 
made contact to complain.
Our investigator didnt uphold this complaint. She felt that PayPal had acted fairly in raising 
and declining the claim. She didnt think there was enough evidence of poor service and that 
PayPal wasnt responsible for advising him on matters relating to his direct debit. Because 
Mr A didnt agree with our investigator, this case has been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. This includes the additional points Mr A 
raised following our investigators view. Ive reached the same conclusions on this complaint 
as our investigator, and for broadly the same reasons.
raising the claim
Mr A says he never asked PayPal to start a dispute for him, and just wanted information on 
the related insurance. Independent of the buyer protection with PayPal, Mr A hasnt been 
clear what he means by insurance, or what information he wanted beyond evidence of the 
transaction that wouldve been available on his PayPal account.
What is clear though is that PayPal processed the total payment Mr A authorised. If for 
example, further insurance was to be obtained through the chosen courier or on checkout 
with the merchant, this would be for the merchant or Mr A to do and is not PayPals responsibility. Furthermore, Im satisfied Mr A did tell PayPal that there were issues with the 
items he had purchased which led to it raising the dispute.
PayPal emailed Mr A the same day confirming hed raised a dispute because of problems 
with the items hed received. PayPal forwarded this message to the merchant for its 
response. Ive seen no evidence that Mr A contacted PayPal at that point to clarify he didnt 
want to make a claim  which Id have expected him to do if this was against his wishes.
PayPal sent Mr A a further email on 29 July 2019 to advise it had contacted the merchant 
about the claim. In this email, PayPal made it clear Mr A could cancel the claim by logging 
into his account and visiting the resolution centre  which he didnt. In fact, Ive been given 
no evidence to suggest Mr A told PayPal he didnt want to make a claim until his complaint 
came to our service. So based on the above, I dont think PayPal did anything wrong by 
raising a claim in order to help Mr A with the concerns he had with the items hed received.
outcome of the claim
PayPals Buyer Protection Programme is not an insurance cover but provides protection in 
certain circumstances to a buyer who has used PayPal to pay for goods. The terms covering 
this protection are found in the user agreement, something Mr A wouldve accepted when he 
first opened his PayPal account.
The terms of this agreement covering Buyer Protection dont guarantee a refund and state 
the claim decision is at the discretion of PayPal. They also say that PayPal may require a 
buyer to provide documentary evidence in a timely manner. But PayPal must act fairly in 
exercising its discretion and rights under the agreement.
Mr A raised concerns with PayPal about the condition of the goods he received. Having 
raised a claim, PayPal asked Mr A for evidence to support what he said about the condition 
of the goods. I dont think PayPal acted unfairly in doing this  the information it asked for 
was relevant to the decision it needed to make. Mr A didnt provide this information as he 
didnt think it was needed. This meant PayPal didnt have any further evidence to support
Mr As claim. So I think it acted fairly in denying it as a result.
Mr A is unhappy that PayPal refused to accept his appeal against the decision. Given Mr A 
has said he didnt want to make a claim at all, it is for his own reasons why he appealed the 
decision. But for the same reasons it denied the claim to begin with, Im satisfied PayPal 
acted fairly in not allowing the appeal.
PayPal closed the case when it denied the claim and Mr A was then able to receive two 
refund payments directly from the merchant. Mr A says PayPals actions nearly prevented 
him receiving a refund. But as outlined above, PayPal acted fairly and in line with the terms 
of the agreement. PayPal is not responsible for the actions of the merchant. 
Mr A says PayPal wouldnt discuss the direct debit guarantee with him. But this is not 
PayPals responsibility. The direct debit agreement that allows money to be deducted from 
the associated bank account would be the responsibility of the bank or building society the 
account is with, not PayPal. 
complaint handling
PayPal has told us it doesnt have any call recordings of its conversations with Mr A as calls 
are recorded on a random basis  this means not all calls are recorded. Mr A believes 
PayPal is lying but Ive not seen any evidence to show this. Mr A also says PayPal refused him a deadlock letter. I understand by this he means a final 
answer on his complaint. Businesses are not under an obligation to issue a final answer 
immediately and the rules allow them some time to investigate before giving a written 
answer. PayPal denied the claim on 14 August 2019 and sent Mr A a final response on 9 
September 2019. So I dont agree PayPal refused Mr A a response or that it took an 
unreasonable amount of time to do this.
Overall, based on everything Ive seen, I dont think PayPal has acted unfairly and Im not 
directing it to do anything further as a result.
My final decision
For the reasons detailed above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 June 2020.
