K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid)  lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mr G was given seven  loans by QuickQuid between November 2010  and December 2011.  
The first two loans were repayable in two instalments   the first instalment consisted  of 
interest only, with the second larger payment comprising a further interest payment and the 
principal that had been borrowed. The remainder of Mr Gs loans from QuickQuid were  
repayable in a single instalment. Mr G successfully repaid his first six loans but a balance  
remained outstanding  on the final loan at the time he made  his complaint. A summary of 
Mr Gs borrowing from QuickQuid is as follows;

Mr Gs complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. She didnt think QuickQuid 
had been wrong  to give the first loan to Mr G. But she didnt think  any of the remaining loans 
should have been agreed. So she asked QuickQuid  to pay Mr G some  compensation.
QuickQuid didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mr G accepts  my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr G could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN83785282But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading guidance on Irresponsible 
Lending defines sustainable as being  without undue difficulties and in particular 
the customer should be able to make  repayments on time,  while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. And it follows  
that a lender should realise, or it ought  fairly  and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont  
be able to make their repayments  sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their 
repayments without  borrowing  further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
QuickQuid did some checks  before  lending to Mr G. Before  each  loan it asked him for details 
of his normal income. And it also checked  Mr Gs credit file before agreeing  some  of the 
loans. I havent  seen the results of those credit  checks but Im not aware of any adverse 
information on Mr Gs credit  file that I think should  have caused  additional concerns to the 
lender.
I dont think the checks  Ive described above  went far enough before the first loan was given 
to Mr G. But in saying  that I dont think better checks wouldve provided QuickQuid with the 
sort of information that would be needed  to show the lending  was unsustainable. And there 
wasnt anything in the information  Mr G provided about his income,  or the information  
QuickQuid shouldve been aware  of, which meant  it wouldve been proportionate to start 
verifying what he was saying at that stage.  So I dont think QuickQuid was wrong to give this 
first loan to Mr G.
Ref: DRN83785283There was then a gap of around  three  months before Mr G asked to borrow again  from 
QuickQuid. But the loan he asked for this time was significantly larger  than the first. The 
largest repayment he would need  to make on this loan was a significant portion of his normal 
income. I dont think it was reasonable for QuickQuid  to conclude that it was likely  that Mr G 
would be able to make this repayment  in a sustainable manner given its size. So I dont think  
QuickQuid should  have given this loan to Mr G.
I appreciate that QuickQuid says the larger repayment on this loan wasnt due until around 
two months after the loan was taken. Ive considered  whether  it would  be reasonable to 
expect Mr G to save  some disposable  income in the first month to put towards  his final 
repayment. That would be effectively saying that I should consider the average repayment 
Mr G needed to make each month on his loan.
But I dont think that is reasonable  here.  This was a high cost loan.  I think  if QuickQuid 
expected that Mr G would be able to repay  some  of his borrowing in the first month it should 
have structured the loan in that way. That would mean that Mr G would have paid less 
interest on his borrowing.  Given the way the loan was structured I think it is fair and 
reasonable that I consider  whether Mr G could sustainably meet  each repayment in isolation.
Mr G appears  to have had problems making  the second larger  repayment on this loan. 
QuickQuids notes suggest that his payment was rejected by his bank. As a result he was 
charged a late fee and needed to defer the repayment of around half the outstanding  
principal by a month. This of course  meant that he needed to pay QuickQuid some additional 
interest.
So when Mr G asked for his third loan,  around a month after finally  repaying his second 
I think QuickQuid should have remained concerned about the sustainability  of its lending. By 
this time Mr Gs borrowing  relationship  had been ongoing for more than eight months. And it 
doesnt seem to me that he was making  any headway in addressing  the amounts that he 
owed to QuickQuid.  So I think, by loan 3, QuickQuid should reasonably have concluded  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have 
realised that it shouldnt provide any further  loans.
Following loan 3 Mr G went  on to take another 4 loans  from QuickQuid.  The amounts he 
borrowed remained relatively constant. And the frequency of his borrowing increased. He 
was now taking loans  every month.  And he was taking a new loan either on the same day, or 
within just a few days, of repaying an earlier loan. By then Mr G had paid a considerable 
amount of interest  to QuickQuid to effectively service a debt over an extended period. 
QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more likely than not Mr G was having to borrow  
further to cover the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and that 
Mr Gs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.  The 
sheer number of loans  was likely  to have  had negative implications on Mr Gs ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 2 to 7 and QuickQuid needs to pay Mr G some 
compensation.
Ref: DRN83785284putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Mr G after,  and including,  the loan that 
he took on 22 March  2011 (loan  2). So for each of those loans QuickQuid  should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr G on the loans.  
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Gs credit file in relation to loan 2.
The number of loans  taken from loan 3 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  3 to 6 should be removed from Mr Gs credit 
file. Any entries  about  loan 7 should  also be removed when the loan has been  repaid.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
If Mr G still owes QuickQuid any of the principal balance he borrowed on his final loan, 
QuickQuid may deduct this from the compensation that is due to him. But, to be clear, that 
outstanding balance should be recalculated to remove any interest and charges, but taking 
account of any repayments Mr G has made on that loan as though  they were applied  against 
the principal sum borrowed.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold most of Mr Gs complaint and direct CashEuroNet UK LLC 
to put things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 October  2019.
