The complaint
Mr S and his wife Mrs W complain that West Bay Insurance plc (formerly Zenith Insurance
plc) mishandled a claim on a van insurance policy.
Where I refer to West Bay, I refer to the above-named insurance company and I include its
engineers and others insofar as I hold West Bay responsible for their acts or omissions. 
What happened
The subject matter of the claim and complaint is a van, first registered in about 2014. Mr S
and Mrs W used the van in connection with their business.
For the year from mid-February 2021, Mr S renewed a comprehensive policy for the van
through a broker. Mr S was the policyholder and main driver. Mrs W was a named driver.
West Bay was the insurance company responsible for dealing with any claim on the policy.
By July 2021, the van had a recorded mileage of about 193,000. Unfortunately, in mid-July
2021, Mrs W was driving the van when it was involved in a four-vehicle collision. A car hit the
rear of another van, which hit the rear of Mrs Ws van which hit the rear of another car (not
necessarily in that order).
An accident management company arranged a hire vehicle for Mr S and Mrs W. On 23 July
2021, the accident management company said that the van was a total loss and that its pre-
accident replacement value had been £5,916.00.
In mid-November 2021, Mrs W complained to West Bay about delay, poor communication
and its valuation of about £3,500.00. She said she and Mr S had bought a smaller vehicle.
West Bay increased its valuation to £3,943.00. By a final response dated early January
2022, West Bay said it couldnt comment on events before it received the claim in mid-
October 2021. It didnt uphold the complaint about the valuation. But it upheld the complaint
about poor service. West Bay said that it was sending the following sums:
interest on £3,943.00 at 8% per year
14 October 2021 to 31 December 2021
net of income tax £  53.93
other redress £150.00
total £203.93
By a letter dated late January 2022, West Bay said that Mr S and Mrs W hadnt agreed the
valuation of £3,943.00. But West Bay said that, after deducting an excess of £150.00, it was
sending them an interim payment of £3,793.00. Mr S and Mrs W brought their complaint to
us in early February 2022.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld in part. The investigator
thought that West Bays valuation of £3,943.00 was fair.
The investigator said that hed been told that West Bay had paid £3,979.00 (sic) on 31
January 2022 and a further £543.10 in subsequent months to compensate for the late
payment of the settlement. He thought that the amount of about £543.00 paid was 
reasonable to compensate Mr S and Mrs Ws business for the inconvenience caused by the 
loss of expectation following West Bays erroneous offer and the delay of 6 months in the 
settlement.
But the investigator thought that West Bay was responsible for the actions of the accident
management company as its agent. And Mr S and Mrs W had been out of pocket from July
2021. So the investigator recommended that West Bay should pay 8% interest on £3,943.00
from 23 July 2021 (when Mr S and Mrs W reasonably expected to receive payment) to the
date the settlement was made.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr S 
and Mrs W and to West Bay on 23 January 2023. I summarise my findings:
West Bay hadnt appointed or authorised the accident management company.
I wasnt minded to find it fair and reasonable to direct West Bay to pay further interest 
or compensation beyond its payments of £3,793.00 and £203.93.
Subject to any further information from Mr S and Mrs W or from West Bay, my provisional 
decision was not to uphold this complaint. I didnt intend to direct West Bay Insurance plc 
(formerly Zenith Insurance plc) to do any more in response to this complaint.
West Bay agreed with the provisional decision.
Mr S and Mrs W acknowledged receipt of the provisional decision but didnt comment on it.
So I see no reason to change my view. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Ombudsman Service deals with a consumers complaint against one regulated
financial firm at a time. Im dealing with a complaint against West Bay. I make no findings
against the broker, the accident management company or any of the drivers.
As I would expect, the policy said that West Bay wouldnt pay more than the market value of
the van immediately before the accident or loss. We expect an insurer to value a used 
vehicle by reference to the retail figures in the trade guides. We find these persuasive 
because they are based on nationwide research of likely selling prices. We accept that they 
are updated at least monthly.
We place less weight on advertisements for the sale of vehicles. This is because they
contain asking prices that may not be accepted.We accept that each of the trade guides may contain a different figure, so there is often a
range of figures. Unless one of them is significantly out of line with the others, were likely to
say that any figure within that range is a reasonable figure.
Ive seen that  in mid-July 2021 - the insurer of the car that had been in front of Mrs W
contacted West Bay to make a claim against her. West Bay got Mrs W to give details and
then responded to that claim. I accept that Mr S hadnt  at that time - made a claim to West
Bay for the value of the van.
Ive looked at the accident management companys letter dated 23 July 2021. It said that the
broker had appointed that company. The letter referred to the third partys insurer as the
insurer. Among the frequently asked questions, it said the following:
We will do everything we can to prove you were not at fault but if the insurer still
refuses to accept blame you will be directed back to your own insurer (only if you
have comprehensive cover) who will deal with the claim for you.
From that, I consider that the accident management company was indicating that it wasnt
acting on behalf of West Bay in handing a claim by Mr S under his policy.
From the policy documents, I havent seen any evidence that the broker was acting as a
policy administrator or claims-handler for West Bay. I accept that West Bay hadnt appointed
or authorised the accident management company. So I dont hold West Bay responsible for
the letter or the valuation of £5,916.00.
And  crucially  West Bay didnt have to make any payment to Mr S at that time as he
hadnt made a claim on his policy.
The accident management company couldnt get the third party to admit liability. So it did
what it called a U turn in mid- October 2021. By that time, Mr S and Mrs W had returned
the hire vehicle and they expected payment for the van. However, I accept that it was only
from mid- October 2021 that West Bay could begin to deal with Mr Ss claim on his policy.
Ive noted the make, model, age, mileage and condition of the van before the accident in
July 2021. For a vehicle like that at that time, West Bay found retail figures in the trade
guides as follows:
Glasses £3,686.00
CAP £3,687.00 
Cazoo £4,199.00
Ive seen an engineers report that suggests a figure of £3,507.00. Ive also seen Mrs Ws
email in mid-November complaining about a verbal valuation of about £3,500.00. So I accept
that West Bay had made an offer that was below any of the trade guide figures. I dont
condone that.
However, West Bay increased its initial offer of about £3,500.00 by about £443.00 to
£3,943.00. West Bays final valuation of £3,943.00 was within the range of the trade guide
figures. Our investigator was able to check the lowest of those figures (£3,686.00). So I cant
say that £3,943.00 wasnt fair.
I accept that values generally increased after July 2021. But  as it wasnt dealing with the
claim before mid- October 2021 - I dont hold West Bay responsible for any delay beforemid- October 2021.
I give West Bay the benefit of the following points:
West Bay wouldve needed some time after mid- October 2021 to get an engineers 
report before making an interim payment.
Mr S and Mrs W had got another (albeit smaller) vehicle by about 10 November 
2021. So they werent without a vehicle.
Nevertheless, West Bay accepted responsibility for delay and offered interest for the 
whole of the period from mid-October to late December 2021.
That was calculated on the final valuation of £3,943.00 rather than on the net figure 
of £3,793.00.
West Bay also offered further redress of £150.00.
Having written its final response in early January 2022, I wouldve expected West Bay to pay
the claim at that time. So its disappointing that it didnt make payment until late January
2022.
I havent seen evidence that West Bay later paid a further sum of about £543.00.
Overall  keeping in mind the points of which Ive given it the benefit  I dont find it fair and 
reasonable to direct West Bay to pay further interest or compensation beyond its payments 
of £3,793.00 and £203.93.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct West Bay Insurance plc (formerly Zenith Insurance plc) to do any more in response to 
this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S and Mrs W to 
accept or reject my decision before 14 March 2023.
