Mr E complains that Ferratum UK Ltd gave him loans that he couldnt afford to repay.

16 30/06/16 28/07/16 £500
17 28/07/16 20/04/17 £1,000
18 21/04/17 2/05/17 £100
19 02/05/17 3/07/17 £200
All but the 19th loan were  repayable in a single instalment, a maximum of 37 days  after the 
date of borrowing. Loan 17 was repayable in five monthly instalments  of £310.40, with a final 
instalment of £301.06.
Mr E believes that if Ferratum had carried out appropriate checks, it would have  realised that 
he was dependent on short-term loans,  and was stuck in a cycle of borrowing. He also says 
that it failed to tell him about alternative ways of dealing with his circumstances, such  as 
details of organisations giving free debt management advice.
In its final response to Mr Es complaint, Ferratum  explained  why it didnt agree that it had 
lent irresponsibly to Mr E. But it offered to refund  £450 to him as a gesture of goodwill. Mr E 
wasnt happy with Ferratums offer. So he brought his complaint to this service.
Ref: DRN55349592Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in part. In summary,  he 
thought Ferratum had carried out detailed enough  checks before making the first loan. But 
he thought it should have  looked at Mr Es financial  circumstances in more detail before 
making the remaining loans. And he considered that if it had carried  out proportionate 
checks, it would have realised that Mr E wouldnt be able to afford  the repayments on loans 
4 to 19. So he said that Ferratum should  refund all interest and charges on those loans, with 
interest on the refund. And he said it should remove any negative information  about loans 4 
to 19 from Mr Es credit file.
Ferratum disagreed with the adjudicators view, so the complaints been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Ferratum was required to lend responsibly.  It needed to make  checks  to see whether Mr E 
could afford  to pay back the loans before it lent to him. Those  checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr E was borrowing, and his lending history, but 
there was no set list of checks Ferratum  had to do.
The Financial Conduct Authority was the regulator throughout the time that Mr E was 
borrowing from Ferratum. Its regulations for lenders  are set out in its consumer credit 
sourcebook (generally referred to as CONC). These regulations require lenders to take 
reasonable steps to assess the customers ability to meet  repayments under a regulated  
credit agreement in a sustainable  manner  without the customer  incurring financial difficulties 
or experiencing significant adverse consequences.  They define sustainable as being able 
to make repayments without undue difficulty. And explain  that this means borrowers  should  
be able to make their repayments  on time and out of their income  and savings without 
having to borrow  to meet these repayments.
Ferratums said that the fact that all the loans  were paid back  on time suggests that they 
were affordable. And it says it wasnt alerted to any financial difficulties. But the fact that the 
amounts borrowed  and the interest  paid might  have been low in comparison with Mr Es 
income, or that he managed  to repay  the loans in full and on time, doesnt necessarily mean 
the loans were affordable for him, or that he managed to repay them in a sustainable 
manner.
Ferratum has told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr E. It says it carried  out a 
credit check  and its own internal credit  policy checks to assess  the affordability  of the loans. 
And it asked  Mr E for details of his regular monthly income, which he told it was just over 
£2,250 per month.
Like our adjudicator, I think the checks Ferratum did before agreeing to the first loan were 
proportionate. The amount Mr E applied to borrow as a small proportion of his declared 
monthly income. And at this stage,  I think it was reasonable  of Ferratum to rely on the 
information Mr E had provided. So I dont think it was wrong to make the first loan. 
Ref: DRN55349593But Mr E applied for the second loan on the day he repaid loan 1. And it was for two-and-a-
half times as much. I think that in the circumstances, Ferratum should have asked Mr E for 
details of his regular monthly expenditure, to check that he could afford to repay the loan. 
But from the information I have, Im not convinced that even if Mr E had provided details of 
his regular monthly expenditure, Ferratum ought  to have concluded that he wouldnt be able 
to afford to repay the loan. My view is the same for loan 3, which Mr E took two weeks  after 
hed repaid loan 2, and which  was for less than loan 2.
But I think that by the time Mr E applied for his fourth loan from Ferratum,  a pattern of 
repeated borrowing was beginning to emerge.  Whats  more, Mr E applied for loan 4 on the 
day hed repaid loan 3. And loan 4 was his largest loan to date. So I think Ferratum  ought to 
have been doing more  to check  that Mr E was likely to be able to afford to repay the 
borrowing sustainably. At the very least,  I think it ought to have asked Mr E specifically for 
details of any other short-term loans  he had outstanding at the time,  in addition to his regular 
monthly expenditure and credit commitments.
Ive looked at Mr Es credit report and his bank statements to see what  its likely that 
Ferratum would have  discovered if it had asked  about Mr Es financial situation  in as much  
detail as I think it should have done. I can see that when he applied  for loan 4, Mr E already 
had a number  of short-term loans outstanding with other lenders. And the repayments due 
on those, alongside  Mr Es regular financial commitments, would have left him with no 
disposable income. So I think its likely that Ferratum would have discovered that Mr E was 
in no position  to take on further borrowing if it had carried out what  I consider to be 
proportionate checks.
Once again, Mr E applied  for loan 5 on the day hed repaid  loan 4. The loan was for £500, 
and marked a significant increase in the amount  Mr E was applying  to borrow. I think this 
ought to have alerted Ferratum to the possibility that Mr E was dependent on short-term 
loans. And I think that at this stage, it should  have refused to lend further without 
independently checking Mr Es true financial position. Had it done so, it would have 
discovered that Mr E was borrowing  repeatedly  from a range of short-term lenders. His credit 
report shows not only that he had several outstanding short-term  loans when  he applied for 
loan 5, but he hadnt managed to keep up with the scheduled repayments on those. Whats 
more, he was gambling heavily. So again, I think it would  have  been  clear to Ferratum  that 
Mr E was already over-committed, and wouldnt be able to repay the loan without borrowing 
further. His position remained substantially unchanged throughout the period  that he was 
borrowing from Ferratum.
I acknowledge that Ferratums commented  that the checks  it did were in line with guidelines 
drawn up by the Financial  Conduct  Authority. It says it considers it unfair  that it should now 
be expected to have done more. But in addition to considering the rules and regulations set 
by the regulator at the time of borrowing, I have to take into account the law, good industry 
practice and all available evidence and arguments to help me decide whether  I think  the 
business was at fault. And having  done so, Ive concluded that as a responsible lender, 
Ferratum should  have declined Mr Es applications  for loans 4-19.  So it needs to pay him 
some compensation.
Ref: DRN55349594putting things right
I dont think Ferratum should have agreed to give Mr E loans 4 to 19 inclusive. So for each  of 
those loans Ferratum  should:
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each of these amounts from the date 
they were  paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Es credit  file in relation to the loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Ferratum  to take off tax from this interest. Ferratum must  
give Mr E a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. I require Ferratum  UK Ltd to put things 
right by doing as Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 March  2019.
