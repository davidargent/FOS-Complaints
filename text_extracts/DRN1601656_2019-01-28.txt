K821x#15complaint
This complaint is against Pepper (UK) Limited,  trading  as Engage  Credit.  From here on, Ill 
refer to the business simply  as Engage. The complaints about fees and charges that have 
been added  to Mr P and Ms Os mortgage account. Their complaint, which is brought  by a 
claims management company, which Ill call B, is that some  of the charges have been 
applied unfairly  and should  be refunded.
background
The mortgage started in 2007, and was originally provided by a lender Ill call G. In 2015, the 
mortgage was transferred  from G to a new lender Ill call PR. Engage administers the 
mortgage on PRs behalf. The mortgage has been in arrears  for several  years. Because  of 
that, its been the subject of additional management  of the arrears and, from time to time,  
litigation work. To cover the cost of that work, arrears charges  and legal costs  have been 
debited to the mortgage. Its these costs that are the subject of the complaint. Although  
theyre allowed  for in the mortgage  contract,  B argues  on Mr P and Ms Os behalf  that 
theyve been applied unfairly.
Our adjudicator considered the complaint and initially  recommended  Engage refund fees 
totalling £760. Engage  objected on two fronts; firstly, it argued that one of the charges it was 
being asked to refund was applied more than six years before the complaint was made, 
which meant we couldnt  consider it. More generally,  it disagreed  with our general approach 
that its unfair to apply  an arrears fee in the same  month that costs  for legal work carried out 
are also levied.
The case  was referred to me, and I dealt first with the question  of the time limit. I issued a 
decision saying that our power  to consider the complaint was limited  to events that 
happened from 24 November 2010. Following this, the adjudicator explained  to the parties 
that because one of the fees shed recommended Engage refund  £40 levied on 
3 November 2010  happened outside  the time limit, the amount she was recommending  
Engage refund was now £720.
Engage still doesnt  agree  with our general approach.  It maintains  that the legal work is 
separate from and in addition to the routine  management of an account in arrears; therefore 
its fair to charge  for both in the same  month.
my findings
Engage hasnt disputed all of the proposed refunds;  its happy to refund  those monthly 
management fees that were applied in any month where the contractual monthly instalment 
(CMI)  or lower  amount if agreed  in advance  has been paid.  What  remains for me to 
decide is the fairness or otherwise of monthly management fees applied in the same month 
that other  charges were  applied  for extra work.
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
overall conclusions  as the adjudicator,  and for broadly the same reasons.
Im satisfied its fair to apply charges to cover the specific cost of specific  legal work  done  
over and above the normal routine  management  of the mortgage account. But I dont think  
its then necessary or fair still to charge  a fee for routine management in the same month. 
Ref: DRN16016562That being  so, Ive decided Engage should rework the mortgage account to remove, 
backdated for interest purposes, the following monthly management  fees.
04/12/2010 £40 when  CMI met
03/01/2011 £40 when  CMI met
04/07/2011 £40 legal  fees

my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement, I direct 
Pepper (UK) Limited, trading as Engage  Credit  to rework the mortgage  account as detailed  
above. I make no other order  or award.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P and Ms O to 
accept or reject my decision  before  28 February  2019.
