The complaint
Ms C complains that NewDay Ltd lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
In August 2015 Ms C opened a store card account with NewDay. She had an account limit of 
£1,000 which was increased to £1,300 in February 2016. 
Ms C says that NewDay shouldnt have lent to her because she couldnt afford it. She says if 
NewDay had done the checks on her which it should have done it would have realised she 
had a lot of debt and couldnt afford any more.
NewDay says that it did all the necessary and proportionate checks and these showed that 
Ms C could afford the credit that was extended to her.
Our adjudicator thought that NewDay shouldnt have lent to Ms C. They thought Ms C was 
so indebted elsewhere that NewDay should have realised she would struggle with any more 
debt. Our adjudicator thought that NewDays checks showed that Ms C had very little 
disposable income and would have struggled to make her repayments on the card in a 
sustainable way. Our adjudicator said that NewDay should refund any interest and charges 
paid by Ms C.
NewDay did not comment on the view of the adjudicator, saying it preferred to wait for the 
outcome of another complaint made by Ms C which has not yet been considered and will be 
dealt with separately. NewDay were told on 8 July that this case would be referred to an 
ombudsman and that it had until 22 July to make any comments they wished to have 
considered. NewDay did not respond substantively.
As NewDay has not agreed, the case has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible 
lending - including the key relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our 
website and Ive taken that into account when considering Ms Cs complaint.
NewDay needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms C could 
afford to repay what she was being lent in a sustainable manner. These checks could take 
into account a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment 
amounts, Ms Cs borrowing history and her income and expenditure. 
NewDay says its credit check results didnt show anything negative to suggest it would have 
been unreasonable to have provided Ms C with the credit. It says it asked her about her 
income and it also had information about other credit she had elsewhere and that none of 
this caused concern. It points also to the fact Ms C managed her account well and incurred 
only one late fee during the life of the account. 
However, I think that the results of NewDays checks should have been a cause for concern. 
Ms C told NewDay that she earned only around £1,250 net a month  although she 
described herself as a housewife/homemaker. Her accommodation costs were £342 a 
month, which seems unusually low although it may have been shared with her partner, who 
she declared had the same income as her. She declared monthly living costs of £800 which, 
after her essential expenses were paid left her with only £108 disposable income a month. 
While NewDay noted that Ms C had nine active credit accounts it noted no defaults or 
arrears, no payday loans and no CCJs, it did not know how Ms Cs unsecured debt was 
structured and, had the entire sum been owed via revolving credit accounts, sustainable 
monthly repayments at 5% would have left Ms C with almost nothing each month. 
So while NewDays check may have been reasonable I think it should have sought a better 
understanding of her financial situation before lending to her. It should have queried her 
income in light of her declared occupation and how she was meeting her existing credit costs 
from her limited income. I think it should have been evident to NewDay that Ms C wouldnt 
have had the capacity to sustainably repay the new account. It follows that I agree with our 
adjudicator that NewDay was wrong to lend to Ms C.
Putting things right
As I dont think NewDay ought to have opened the account, I dont think its fair for it to be 
able to charge any interest or charges under the credit agreement. But I think Ms C should 
pay back the amounts she has borrowed. Therefore, NewDay should:
Rework the account removing all interest and charges that have been applied.
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Ms C along with 
8% simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the 
date of settlement. NewDay should also remove all adverse information regarding 
this account from Ms Cs credit file.
Or, if after the rework there is still an outstanding balance, NewDay should arrange 
an affordable repayment plan with Ms C for the remaining amount. Once Ms C has
cleared the balance, any adverse information in relation to the account should be
removed from her credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. It must give Ms C a 
certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if she asks for one. If it intends to apply the refund to reduce 
an outstanding balance, it must do so after deducting the tax.
This compensation is standard redress in a case of this type where it is considered that an 
account should not have been opened in the first place. 
My final decision
I uphold Ms Cs complaint and direct NewDay Ltd pay redress as set out above. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2022.
