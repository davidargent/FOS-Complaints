Our adjudicator looked at the complaint and thought that Mr Lender should put things right
from the fourth rollover on Loan 1 to Loan 3, and he thought that Mr Lender ought to have
ceased lending to Mr M from loan 4.
Mr Lender disagreed and I addressed its points in my provisional decision issued 
28 August 2021. Both parties have responded to that provisional decision and each have 
nothing further to add. 
My provisional decision findings of 28 August 2021
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-
term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In practice this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M could repay the loans 
in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure.
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.
These factors include:
having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan repayments to 
a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting the risk 
that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable);
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also suggestive of 
the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Mr Lender was required to establish whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is because 
the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being the ability to repay without 
undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet the repayments.
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower 
will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
When loans 1 to 3 were approved, Mr Lender offered payday loans which meant that usually the loan 
had to be repaid the same month. In that period, rolling a loan over, which mean that the consumer 
had the choice to pay an interest only sum to delay the full repayment, was relatively common. 
Lenders might have been members of industry associations and two published lending codes in or 
around 2012 in which restricting rollovers of short term loans to three was considered good practice.
Mr M applied for and was approved for loan 1 on 2 August 2013, and I can see from that loan 
agreement that he had opted for the first month to be an interest only repayment followed by the full 
repayment and the option to pay further interest only if chosen. Mr M rolled over this loan at least 4 
times on top of the interest only first month repayment. I agree with our adjudicator that this was an 
indication that Mr M may have been having trouble to repay it. But I do not think that this, on its own, 
was enough to consider that the loan had been lent irresponsibly.
For Loan 1, and due to the passage of time which is understandable, Mr Lender has deleted some of 
the details from the application. It had some information which it shared with us: that Mr M declared 
an income of £1,350.
Mr M has said in correspondence with Mr Lender when he started his complaint in 2020 that I can't 
provide any proof for [sic] as I no longer have any bank statements and my payslips only go back 4 
years.Mr M has sent to us a copy of his personal credit file dated March 2021 and so that, in effect, covers 
six years of historic credit commitments to around March 2015. So does not cover the period before 
loan 6. So, I have little additional information about loan 1 other than Mr Ms declared income.
Mr Lender did carry out a credit search before approving loan 1. Having asked Mr Lender what one 
specific credit search truncated sentence meant (Unsecured 2 yr  True), I have thought about the 
answer. Mr Lender has said that this meant Mr Ms credit search results showed:
this was relating to a default that was added on 29th September 2010 , this account was then not 
updated by the company after July 2013. As this was for a default which was gained in 2010, we did 
not deem this as a concern especially considering no further defaults were applied and the loan was 
issued 3 years after this date.
I agree that a three year old default is not necessarily an issue for Mr Lender on a first loan 
application.
So, I have nothing further to come to any additional findings about loan 1 and it appears I am unlikely 
to receive additional financial information from Mr M going back to that 2013 date for loan 1. So, I am 
planning not to uphold loan 1.
Mr M appears to have used the loan 2 funds to assist in repaying loan 1 as the same date he was 
approved for loan 2 was the date he cleared the debt on loan 1  15 January 2014.
Loan 2 was applied for in January 2014 and I have looked at that against the loan repayment history 
for loan 1. That loan originally was due to have been repaid in 12 days (albeit with an agreed interest 
only payment at the beginning) and ultimately it took four months to repay.
Loan 2 was for a lot more money than loan 1 - £650  and was a similar structure. So, I think that 
Mr Lender ought to have made some additional checks as Mr M did appear to struggle to repay 
loan 1.
I do not think it did that, but as I have explained earlier, I do not have, and I am not likely to receive, 
any additional information from either Mr Lender or Mr M about Mr Ms financial situation in January 
2014. And so, on current evidence I am planning not to uphold Loan 2.
My findings are the same for loan 3 as I have made for loan 2 and I am planning not to uphold loan 3.
Loan 4 was a different type of loan as it was an instalment loan. Looking at how Mr M had 
approached his earlier loans then it does seem to me that Mr Lender migrated Mr M onto an 
instalment loan as that may have suited him better.
Loan 4 was for £1,000 over 6 months and with the repayment concerns during loans 1 to 3, then 
I think that Mr Lender ought to have carried out a full financial review at this stage. I do not think it did 
that. The declared income was £1,158 and Mr M appears to have declared expenditure as £387 and 
had informed Mr Lender that he was living at home with his parents. So that may have explained the 
relatively low expenditure level.
The credit search summary box I have been sent has the same truncated sentence Unsecured 2 yr 
True but as this was a year after loan 1 and the same message was appearing then I question 
whether this ought to have been an alert for Mr Lender. There is no evidence to suggest that it was 
the same default reappearing on its searches for each loan. It may have been a new piece (or pieces) 
of information. As Mr Lender has been able to provide details for the loan 1 Unsecured 2 yr True 
phrase, and as this is a provisional decision, then Mr Lender may be able to provide me with more 
details on the search results with int the two weeks reply period of this provisional decision.
I note that Mr Lender had got information to show he had one AAI outstanding which means he was 
repaying one other payday loan. AAI stands for advance against income.I do not have enough information from Mr M to be able to assess what it is Mr Lender may have 
discovered if further checks had been carried out before approving loan 4 and so I am not planning to 
uphold Loan 4.
My findings for loan 5 are the same as for loan 4. I am not planning to uphold it.
By loan 6, which was twenty months into the lending relationship, and Mr M was returning for another 
£1,000 instalment loan, then I think that different criteria ought to have applied.
I have also looked at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders lending history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Mr Lender ought to have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans.
Given the circumstances of Mr Ms case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say this 
because:
From loan 6 onwards Mr M was provided with a new loan on the same day as settling a 
previous one. So, Mr Lender ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr M was 
having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ms indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Mr Lender. Loan 13 was taken 
out four and a half years after Mr Ms first. And it was for a larger amount - £1,300. Mr M had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Mr Lender over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Mr Lender continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 to loan 13 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the sheer number of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications on 
Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-
cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about loans 6 to 13 and Mr Lender should put things right.
Loan 14
Unusually, Mr M appears to have ceased borrowing from Mr Lender after repaying loan 13 in 
December 2018 and he did not apply again until the end of May 2019. Mr Lender has said that this 
5 month gap ought to be considered. I have considered it and I do not think that after many years of 
the customer-lender relationship being in place that it necessarily broke the chain of lending. But I do 
think that a five month gap leads me to review loan 14 differently as it is not, in my view, part of the 
repetitive lending for which I have said I am planning to uphold loans 6 to 13. I recognise that there 
are shorter gaps during that time but these are short and I do not feel persuaded to alter my view on 
those short periods.
In the circumstances surrounding Mr Ms application for loan 14 I do think that Mr Lender ought to 
have carried out a full financial review of Mr Ms circumstances. That is because it had been lending 
to Mr M for many years by this point, and although Loan 14 was for a lesser sum of £750, it was going 
to be for a 12 month loan period. I do not think that Mr Lender did a full financial review.
However, using the current evidence I have, I can see that Mr Ms income had increased a great deal 
to around £2,000 per month, which had been verified by Mr Lender and that Mr M had made relatively 
modest expenditure declarations. Mr M had told Mr Lender that he was living at home. And I have 
been able to review the personal credit file Mr M has provided.I know that he had a default with another high cost short term lender around February 2016, and that 
he had several credit cards. He had taken a guarantor loan in December 2016 which was due to close 
in December 2019. The highest instalment repayment figure for loan 14 was around £150, and those 
figures decreased as the term proceeded, and overall, I do think it likely that Mr M was able to afford 
loan 14 using current evidence.
So, I am planning not to uphold Mr Ms complaint about loan 14.
This is the end of my duplication of my provisional decision. I have made my final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr M responded to my provisional decision and accepted it as fair outcome. 
Mr Lender replied to say it had nothing further to add.
So, I see no reason to depart from the provisional findings I made and for the same reasons. 
Those are repeated here and form part of this final determination. 
I uphold Mr Ms complaint for loans 6 to 13, and Ive set out below what Mr Lender needs to 
do to put things right.  
  
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Mr Lender should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it stopped lending to Mr M from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought to 
have. Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mr M may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this lender which they may not have had with others. If this wasnt a 
viable option, they may have looked to a friend or relative  assuming that was even 
possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct.
From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real 
and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Mr M in a 
compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Mr M would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options.
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Mr Lenders liability in this case for what Im satisfied it 
has done wrong and should put right.Mr Lender ought to do as follows:
 refund all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans 6 to 13;
 pay interest of 8% simple a year* on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about Loans 6 to 13 should be removed from 
Mr Ms credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. It must give
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and I direct that PDL Finance 
Limited, trading as Mr Lender, does as I have outlined above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 October 2021.
