DRN-4031514
The complaint
Mr W complains that National Westminster Bank Plc declined to lend to him.
What happened
Mr W says that NatWest keeps declining applications for credit that he makes, and he feels 
this shows they have a vendetta against him. Mr W made a complaint to NatWest, and he 
asked to meet with their Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
NatWest did not uphold Mr Ws complaint. They referred him to a previous letter they sent 
him on 8 July 2022, which informed Mr W that a recent loan application had been declined 
due to adverse data being found on his credit file during their credit reference search. They 
gave him reasons why an application may have been declined. NatWest said they did not 
have a vendetta against him, and he may be able to apply for further borrowing, but there is 
no way they can guarantee that they can accept a customers application. Mr W brought his 
complaint to our service. 
Our investigator did not uphold Mr Ws complaint. He said NatWest has not made an error in 
declining to lend to him, and they explained the reasons for this. He said it is up to NatWests 
CEO whether to meet with Mr W or not. Mr W asked for an ombudsman to review his 
complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered what Mr W has said about NatWest having a vendetta against him as they 
wont lend to him. But while it may seem that way to Mr W, NatWest have a responsibility to 
ensure any credit they lend to a customer is affordable and sustainable for them to repay. 
While Mr W may feel that he can afford to make repayments, it is a commercial decision for 
NatWest to make if they feel they can lend responsibly to a customer. This is not a process 
our service can interfere with as we cant ask NatWest to lend to a customer if they decline 
to do so. 
Mr W has been given a reason that there is adverse information showing on his credit file 
and this is a reason that they werent able to approve his borrowing. Mr W may wish to get a 
copy of his credit file, so he can see if any lenders are reporting incorrect negative 
information about how he has operated his account(s) with them. If there is any incorrect 
information on his credit file, then he should contact the lender involved and ask them to 
correct this. 
Mr W should be aware that NatWest look at a range of factors in deciding whether to 
approve credit and the information on his credit file is just one of these factors. They need to 
be satisfied that they responsibly lend to a customer, so if they have data which suggests 
lending may be irresponsible, or unsustainable for a customer, then they will decline an 
application, but this doesnt mean they have a vendetta against Mr W or that they have done 
anything wrong in declining a lending application. I know Mr W wants to discuss the issues 
with NatWests CEO, but it would be the CEOs decision whether to meet with Mr W, so I 
cant say NatWest have made an error here. So it follows I dont require NatWest to do 
anything further.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 September 2023.
