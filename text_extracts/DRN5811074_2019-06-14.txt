Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ms complaint in part and thought the loans from 4b to 11a and 
loans 15 onwards, including the second Pounds to Pocket instalment  loan shouldnt  have 
been given. 
CashEuroNet disagreed, but did offer to pay the interest and charges Mr M paid on loans 4b 
to 7, with 8% simple  interest added, towards reducing the outstanding balance on Mr Ms 
second Pounds to Pocket loan (2a). As Mr M did not accept the offer and CashEuroNet  
didnt agree with the adjudicators findings either, the complaint  was passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN58110742CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
CashEuroNet says that the number of instances that a consumer borrows  is not, in itself,  
evidence that the borrower  is reliant  on high cost short term loans. But I think  that there may 
come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending  itself clearly demonstrates that 
the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  was required to 
establish whether  Mr M could sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Ref: DRN58110743CashEuroNet says that as Mr M repaid many  of the loans early, this shows  that he was able 
to afford to repay the loans. But as our adjudicator explained, by the time Mr M had topped 
up his fourth  loan for the second  time (i.e. loan 4b), it was his sixth advance in only 4 months 
and the total amount Mr M had to repay  represented  a significant proportion  of his 
disposable income. So CashEuroNet should have been more thorough in its checks  and 
gathered a full picture of Mr Ms finances before agreeing to lend to him. And I think  this 
applies to loans 5 to 6 as well, as they were all taken out in quick succession after loan 4b 
had been repaid. Its likely that better  checks wouldve  made CashEuroNet  aware that Mr M 
was struggling financially  and that he was no longer  able to repay the loans sustainably,  
without having  to borrow again.  Because of this, I dont think that CashEuroNet shouldve 
lent loans 4b to 6 to Mr M.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of CashEuroNets lending history  with Mr M, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which CashEuroNet should  reasonably  have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so CashEuroNet should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 
7. I say this because:
By loan 7 Mr M had a consistent history  of borrowing short term loans shortly after 
repaying a previous  loan and the amount  borrowed in loan 7 was more  than double 
what hed borrowed in Loan 6;
From  Loan 7 until there was a break in lending after loan 11a, Mr M was provided 
with further loans within weeks, and often days of settling previous ones. So 
CashEuroNet ought to have realised each  time Mr M applied  to borrow  again that he 
was having to do so to cover the hole left in his finances caused by repaying his 
previous loan and that Mr Ms indebtedness  was increasing  unsustainably. For 
example Mr M incurred late fees on loans 7a and had to extend the repayment of 
loan 10 and 10a, and these are things  CashEuroNet shouldve taken into account  in 
its subsequent  lending decisions.
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed CashEuroNet.  For 
example, Loan 11a was taken out 17 months  after Mr Ms first loan. And it was for a 
larger amount. And given the timescale  involved, Mr M had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to CashEuroNet over an extended period of time.
I note that loan 11 and 11a were  repaid on 1 February 2016 and Mr M then didnt take out 
another loan with CashEuroNet until 18 March 2017. So given the gap in lending,  I think  it 
was not unreasonable for CashEuroNet to have thought that Mr Ms financial circumstances 
mayve improved in that time and therefore  carried out less thorough checks  on loan 12, 
particularly as it was for a relatively low amount of £100.
But by loan 13, I think CashEuroNet shouldve started carrying  out more detailed  checks 
before agreeing the loans,  particularly  as Mr M had topped up loan 12 three times. But 
looking at Mr Ms finances at the time,  it looks likely that proportionate checks wouldve  
indicated Mr M could  afford loans 13 and 14 and the first Pounds  to Pocket loan. 
However, I think the pattern of lending that was established by loan 15 was similar to the 
previous pattern. And the amount Mr M borrowed on loan 15 - £1,000   meant that the final 
payment would use up all of Mr Ms stated disposable income.  So it was no surprise  that 
Mr M then had to borrow again  (this time £100),  only 9 days after repaying loan 15. And 
Ref: DRN58110744Mr M took out the second instalment loan  which  Mr M was unable to repay when it fell due 
- only 16 days  after repaying Quick Quids sixteenth  loan. So in the circumstances, I dont 
think CashEuroNet shouldve lent loans 15 and 16 and the second  instalment loan to Mr M 
on the basis that the lending was clearly no longer sustainable for him.
I think that Mr M lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
up until the break in lending  (i.e. loan 11a) and loans 15 onwards, including  the second 
Pounds to Pocket instalment loan, because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Me Ms indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Ms ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about those loans and CashEuroNet  should put things 
right.
putting things right  what CashEuroNet needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on Quick Quid loans 4b to 11a, 15 and 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
I understand there is an outstanding  balance  on the second Pounds to Pocket 
instalment loan. CashEuroNet should  remove all outstanding  interest and charges 
from that loan and then treat any payments that have been made to the loan as 
capital repayments   this should then leave the outstanding capital balance. 
CashEuroNet, if it wishes to, may deduct  the outstanding capital balance  from the 
total redress due to Mr M for the prior loans.
remove any negative information  about loans 4b to 6 from Mr Ms credit file;
the number  of loans taken from Quick  Quid loans  7 to 11a and loans 15 and 16, as 
well as the second Pounds to Pocket loan, means  any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  those  loans should be removed from Mr Ms 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest.  CashEuroNet must  give Mr M 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
Because of the reasons  given above, I uphold  this complaint in part and require 
CashEuroNet UK LLC to do what I have said above to put matters  right.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 July 2019.
