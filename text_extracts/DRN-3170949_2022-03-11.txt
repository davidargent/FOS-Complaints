The complaint
Mrs G complains about the foreign exchange fees applied to her transactions by PayPal 
(Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA. She was also disappointed with the service she received.
What happened
Mrs G was unhappy about a number of unexpected foreign exchange fees that PayPal 
added to her transactions. Even though shed used PayPal for many years she still found it 
frustrating to deal with. And when she queried the fees PayPal wasnt able to explain them.
Mrs G wants a proper explanation about the foreign exchange fees. Shes unhappy with the 
service she received and the way PayPal operated as a business. It took a long time for 
PayPal to respond and she felt it couldve been much clearer and straightforward. So Mrs G 
wants compensation and she wants to know how PayPal intends to improve how it deals 
with its customers. 
PayPal apologised for any inconvenience Mrs G might have suffered. It explained any 
purchase made in a currency other than GBP would be subject to the terms set out in the 
PayPal user agreement. PayPal used a retail exchange rate if a currency conversion was 
needed. And the rates were set at the time of the transaction, including refund transactions. 
PayPal said the refunds had been completed in line with the user agreement. But it was 
sorry Mrs G hadnt been happy with the service shed received. And it paid Mrs G £30 as a 
gesture of goodwill.
Mrs G wasnt satisfied with PayPals response. So she contacted our service and our 
investigator looked into the matter. He explained our service wasnt able to tell PayPal how 
to run its service. But he could see if itd followed its procedures properly and acted fairly. He 
looked at PayPals terms and conditions in relation to the transactions where Mrs G thought 
shed been charged currency conversion fees on refunds.
Based on the information hed seen PayPal didnt charge a conversion fee on those 
transactions. Any loss arose because of different exchange rates being used when the 
money was returned to Mrs G at a later date. And he felt PayPals terms clearly explained 
that might happen. So he couldnt say any financial loss had been caused by PayPal.
But our investigator felt PayPal couldve provided Mrs G with a better service. It couldve 
given her the information shed asked for sooner. And itd couldve provided a clearer 
explanation of why Mrs G would receive a different amount due to currency rate changes. 
He could see PayPal had apologised for its service and offered £30 in compensation. But he 
felt it should offer a further £100 compensation for the frustration Mrs G had experienced.
PayPal agreed with our investigators viewed and credited Mrs G with the additional £100. 
But Mrs G felt PayPal hadnt properly explained the risk of loss on a transaction involving 
different currencies. And she felt it should be stated each time. Mrs G wanted her currency 
losses to be refunded as well. And shes asked for an ombudsmans final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear about the difficulties Mrs G has experienced and the frustration shes felt 
when trying to get more clarification from PayPal. Mrs G has raised a number of issues and 
Ive carefully considered all of them. But Ill concentrated on the issues that are relevant to 
this decision.
Its important to realise that its not the role of this service to tell PayPal, or any other service 
provider, how to run its business. Businesses that are based in this country are regulated by 
the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA has rulemaking, investigative and 
enforcement powers to regulate the financial services industry in the UK. But PayPals 
headquarters are located in Luxembourg. So its regulated by an organisation in that country.
The role of this service is to look at disputes between consumers and businesses to see if 
the business has made any mistakes or treated the consumer unfairly. And because PayPal 
has agreed to join our voluntary jurisdiction we can look into complaints such as this. But we 
dont have the power to tell PayPal how it should operate. We can only check if its followed 
its normal procedures when doing so.
When processing refunds the terms and conditions of PayPals user agreement explain how 
it will only use the same transaction exchange rate as the original payment if the amount is 
returned within one day. After that it will use the transaction exchange rate at the time the 
return is made. 
That means a PayPal customer who carried out a refunded transaction involving different 
currencies would only get back the same exact amount if the refund was made within one 
day of the transaction. Otherwise any refund would be carried out at the exchange rate on 
the day of the refund  which could be lower or higher than the original exchange rate.
I dont think thats unfair. If theres a period of time between a transaction and a refund I 
wouldnt expect PayPal to bear the cost  or reap the benefits  of any change in exchange 
rate. Thats the normal process in any currency exchange transaction over a period of time. 
For example, holidaymakers travelling abroad shouldnt expect to get the same exchange 
rate when they return from holiday and convert back any unspent holiday currency.
The terms and conditions of the PayPal user agreement highlight the risks when receiving 
refunds. The terms state that the returned amount could be lower in value than the original 
payment amount  either because the recipient doesnt make a full refund, or because of 
transaction exchange rate fluctuations. 
I appreciate the terms and conditions for any contract between different parties can be 
lengthy and complicated. But I think PayPals terms clearly explain that refunds involving 
currency exchanges wont usually return the same amount as the original transaction. 
PayPal has provided details of the various refunds and the currency exchange rates used on 
each occasion. Ive not seen anything to show PayPal has charged Mrs G any currency 
exchange fees. As she correctly points out, as a UK customer she wouldnt expect to be 
charged those fees.
I can see how strongly Mrs G feels about her complaint. And I recognise how much time and 
consideration Mrs G has put into it. I can see our investigator has also responded to a 
number of follow up questions. Mrs G still doesnt think its fair for buyers to assume the risk from exchange rate changes. 
And she doesnt think the terms are clear enough. Or that PayPal responded quickly enough 
or provided sufficient explanation. But as Ive explained, our service cant tell PayPal to alter 
the way it runs its business. So I cant ask PayPal to make changes to its service or alter its 
terms. I can only look at whether PayPal has followed its terms and conditions and 
procedures properly. And I think it has. 
I understand Mrs Gs frustration that its taken two years of correspondence with PayPal and 
she still doesnt feel shes had a clear response. And I hope this decision and our 
investigators responses have helped explain why she received slightly different amounts 
when her refunds were converted back into GBP.
Based on what Ive seen I cant say PayPal has made any mistakes in the refunds made to 
Mrs G or the exchange rates used. So I cant ask PayPal to cover any differences between 
the payments Mrs G made and the amount of refund shes received. That wouldnt be fair. 
But I do agree that PayPal couldve done more to respond to Mrs Gs queries and provide 
clearer information about the refunds and exchange rates used. And I can see PayPal has 
accepted our investigators suggestion to increase the compensation for its poor service 
from £30 to £130. I think thats the right outcome. And I wont be asking PayPal to do 
anything more.
Putting things right
To put things right PayPal should pay Mrs G an additional £100 compensation for the trouble 
and upset shes been put through. And I understand PayPal has now made this payment.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA should 
make the award described above in the section putting things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 April 2022.
