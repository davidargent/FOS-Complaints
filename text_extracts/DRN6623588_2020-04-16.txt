K821x#15complaint
Mr F says Elevate  Credit  International Limited  trading as Sunny - irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 29 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr F between  October  2016 
and February 2018. Mr Fs borrowing history  is attached at the end of this decision.
The complaint has been considered by two of our adjudicators. After the first assessment, 
Sunny offered to uphold loans 22 onwards as a gesture of goodwill. The offer was put to    
Mr F, but he rejected it. 
In the most recent assessment, the adjudicator partially upheld  Mr Fs complaint and thought 
the loans from loan 9 onwards shouldnt have been  given because  the overall  pattern of 
Mr Fs borrowing indicated he was reliant  on these loans and the borrowing was becoming 
unsustainable. Sunny  hasnt responded  to this view. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr F could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much  was being lent, the 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN66235882I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr F could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint.  Having  done so, I am partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
The second  adjudicator didnt uphold  Mr Fs complaint about  loans  1 to 8. Mr F hasnt 
provided any further evidence or arguments  for us to consider, so I wont be making  any 
further findings on these loans because  they no longer appear to be in dispute. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr F, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Fs case,  I think that this point was reached by loan 9. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr F was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr F had taken out nine loans in just over six months. So, it should  have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mr F was having to borrow further to cover  the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Fs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
The fact Mr F repaid his loans  much earlier than planned should  have caused  some 
concern to Sunny. As that might  be the sort of behaviour that would indicate 
someone was facing problems managing their money and needing to refinance loans 
on a regular basis. 
Mr F wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  29 was 
taken out 16 months after Mr Fs first. Mr F had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect; service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr F lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 9 onwards 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN66235883The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Mr F borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Fs ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr F paid on loans  9 to 29;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 9 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loan 9 to 29 should be removed from      
Mr Fs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Elevate Credit International Limited  to take off tax from this 
interest. Elevate Credit  International  Limited must give Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its 
taken off if he asks for one. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Fs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 May 2020.
