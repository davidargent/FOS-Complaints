K820x#14complaint
Mr K complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC lent to him irresponsibly. At the time of the loan 
approval in February  2015 it traded as Pounds to Pocket. A name change means it trades  
more recently as OnStride. I will refer to it as CashEuroNet. 
background
Mr K applied for one loan.  CashEuroNet approved a principal  of £1,150  repayable over 
seven instalments of just under £291 each month commencing 23 March  2015 and due to 
end 23 September  2015. Within a few weeks of the loan being approved Mr K had difficulty 
repaying it. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint and thought that CashEuroNet  did not need  
to put anything right for Mr K. He thought  that although CashEuroNet  may not have carried  
out the right checks, but if it had he did not think it would have made a difference  to its 
lending decision.  
Mr K was not content and asked for an ombudsman to review  it. Since  then, CashEuroNet 
has written to Mr K directly and has waived the outstanding balance and reduced it to £0. It 
has said that it would amend  Mr Ks credit file as well. 
Mr K wanted  the complaint to proceed. He was content with the waived principal and wished 
to claim the money  back I have  paid plus interest  and money for stress this has caused. 
The complaint was unresolved and so it was passed  to me. I issued a provisional  decision 
on 10 October 2019 and a copy  of that is attached. It forms part of this final decision and 
sets out my reasons for coming to the provisional decision which was: CashEuroNet did lend 
irresponsibly but that nothing further  needs to be done by it to redress the situation. And I did 
not think that any payment for distress and inconvenience was due to Mr K.
CashEuroNet has replied  and said it has nothing further to add. 
Mr K is content that I have  made  a provisional decision that CashEuroNet  lent irresponsibly 
but he thinks more  needs to be refunded to him and additional payments for distress  and 
inconvenience paid to him.  
my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what I consider to be 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general 
approach to complaints about  short-term  lending - including  all of the relevant rules, 
guidance and good industry  practice  - on our website. 
As both CashEuroNet and Mr K have agreed  with that part of my provisional decision 
relating to the irresponsible  lending then I do not address that part of this complaint again.  
My final decision on that is the same  as in my provisional decision  and for the same  reasons. 
The part that I address here relates  to the points Mr K has made  surrounding his wish for 
payment for distress and inconvenience. I am sorry to hear that he has been affected and 
that he has not been well. 
Ref: DRN91693062CashEuroNet have  acted  in a positive and sympathetic way as required by its regulators 
when approached by a customer  with financial concerns and expressing difficulty  to repay  a 
debt. Mr K informed CashEuroNet in May 2015 that he was in financial difficulties and it 
stopped any further interest  and charges being added to the account.  No repayments were  
made from then until January 2017  when a £20 a month repayment plan was set up and in 
April 2018 that was reduced to £2.15  a month  from around April 2018. 
Mr K complained to CashEuroNet in March 2018 and in May 2018 brought  his complaint to 
this service. In September 2018 our adjudicators view was that CashEuroNet  did not need 
to do anything to put things right. Mr K asked for an ombudsmans  review. It took time for 
that to be allocated and in the meantime  April 2019  CashEuroNet  wrote  to Mr K directly 
to explain that it had made an error.  It related to a different point to irresponsible  lending and 
some of that letter from CashEuroNet to Mr K is replicated here:   
once your complaint  was referred [to the ombudsman service],  we suspended any collection  
activities whilst we awaited  the outcome of the case as we believed  this to be in your best
interest. As a result, your loan went into arrears and was reported to the credit reference  
agencies.
As a courtesy, we will waive the remaining balance on your loan, which  will take up to 48 
hours to process.  As a result, you owe £0.00 towards this loan. Additionally, we will correct 
any adverse credit markings reported  on your credit report during this time.
So from the end of April 2019 no payments of £2.15 have been taken and Mr Ks balance 
was reduced to £0. I have not been  given a copy of Mr Ks credit  file so I do not know if the 
entry in respect  of this loan has been amended as CashEuroNet said it would. This will need 
to be checked  by Mr K. 
As I have explained in my provisional  decision,  Mr K received the principal sum of £1,150  
and was due to repay a total of £2,035.88  (£290.84 x 7). Mr K has repaid £659.74. If this 
complaint was upheld then the usual redress is that these  repayments from Mr K would  be 
reworked on the account and all put towards the repayment of the overall capital of £1,150, 
net of interest  and charges. It would leave a balance of £490.26  for Mr K to repay  to 
CashEuroNet going forward.
So in principle Mr K still owed just over £490  of that original loan to pay back. Now Mr K has 
been placed in a better position than I would normally award  as he does not need to repay it 
because of CashEuroNets actions in April 2019. And it is fair and reasonable that I take this 
into account when  Mr K is asking me to consider that additional payments are made to him 
as compensation.
CashEuroNet needs to ensure that it has amended Mr Ks credit file in the way that it agreed 
to do in April 2019. But apart from that I do not think that it needs to do more.  
And while I am sorry to hear that Mr K has not been  well, I do not think  that any money  is 
due to Mr K for distress and inconvenience caused by CashEuroNet  because of this loan. 
And the reason is that I think  CashEuroNet has done enough already. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I consider that CashEuroNet UK LLC did lend irresponsibly  but that 
nothing further  needs to be done  by it to redress the situation. 
Ref: DRN91693063Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 November  2019.

my provisional  findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide  what  is fair and reasonable  in 
the circumstances of this complaint. I have taken into account the law, any relevant  regulatory  rules 
and good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
Before lending  money  to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand whether  
the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner without it 
adversely impacting on their financial  situation.  
A lender  should gather  enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on the 
lending. Although the guidance and rules  themselves did not set out compulsory checks, they did list 
a number of things  a lender could take into account before agreeing  to lend. The key element  was 
that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to take into account a number of different things,  
including how much  was being lent and when the sum being borrowed was due to be repaid. 
Having reviewed  everything sent by both parties and in the context of the application having been  
made in February 2015,  I think  that this was an irresponsible lending decision.  And the reasons  are 
that to lend this sum of money to a relatively  recently discharged bankrupt  (eleven months earlier in 
March 2014) without carrying out a comprehensive and full check of Mr Ks financial situation was 
irresponsible. I think that its extremely likely CashEuroNets credit searches  revealed his bankruptcy  
history and so I think it proceeded to lend despite this. I have not received  any of CashEuroNets  
search results other than a list of what it carried out and as this is a provisional decision it is invited to 
send them to me.  
If CashEuroNet had done  a full financial review, prompted by the bankruptcy information which  I am 
relatively sure it would have seen, then I think it would have realised that:
Mr K earned about  £907 (after tax) each month. I have obtained  this figure  from the average 
of his three months of payslips preceding the loan decision: December 2014,  January  and 
February 2015. So this was much  less than his declared income of £1,700 each month;
that he had a history  of difficulty managing  his finances in the relatively recent past and it had 
resulted in bankruptcy;
his declared outgoings were £275 but this would  have  been after completing a short  list with 
only a few categories for the application process. Using a more  comprehensive  list of 
outgoings sent to CashEuroNet  by Mr K at a later date,  then I can see these were  realistic,  
modest and very likely to have been similar  to his situation in 2015. It included, food, council  
tax, utilities, telephone, TV licence/rental, prescriptions/health costs and life insurance. These 
amounted to £290 each month. But I think that the food  allowance of £100 was very low in 
my view as it translates  into £3.20 a day and so I think  its more likely to have been £200 a 
month = £390 in total. And I note that this list did not include rent or travel costs. But I have  
seen another document that his rent was about £71 in 2014.  He may have been successful in 
his Housing Benefit  application which he has indicated  on the form that he had applied for, 
but as this was a benefit  then it could have been refused  and or withdrawn before any loan 
was repaid. And so I think that the rent cannot be ignored and a responsible lender  would 
have factored  it into the calculations when carrying  out a creditworthiness assessment;
Mr Ks personal credit file shows me that he had an outstanding short term loan for £80 
around that time  taken February 2015 and repaid April 2015;
Mr K had a couple  of low limit credit cards and a couple of mail order and/or  rent to own 
accounts around that time which likely would  have taken  up most, if not all, of the balance. 
So my overall view is that these add up to an expenditure figure  for Mr K on a low income  with an 
expected repayment figure for the CashEuroNet loan of around £291 each month for seven months 
which would have left him with nothing or virtually nothing left each month.
Ref: DRN91693065So ordinarily  I would make  a provisional decision to uphold this complaint on the grounds of 
irresponsible lending. But the waiver of the outstanding balance leads me to explain further.
To do the calculations in this next section,  I have used the statement of account from CashEuroNet 
sent to Mr K in April 2019 with its waiver offer,  and which was forwarded  on to us by Mr K.  
Mr K was due to repay a total of £2,035.88  (£290.84 x 7). Mr K has repaid £659.74 which  was a 
mixture of capital (£99.74)  and interest repayments (£545) and a £15 late fee. 
If this complaint was upheld  then the usual redress  would be that these repayments from Mr K would 
be reworked on the account  and all put towards the repayment of the overall  capital of £1,150,  net of 
interest and charges. It would leave a balance  of £490.26 for Mr K to repay to CashEuroNet going  
forward. And the reason  for this is that it is usual  for the principal lent to be repaid as Mr K has had 
the advantage of that sum in 2015.
But because of CashEuroNets actions in April 2019, Mr Ks current balance is £0. So I do not think  it 
is fair to ask Mr K to have to repay anything going forward in light of CashEuroNets positive action 
earlier this year. 
CashEuroNet also said:  Additionally, we will correct any adverse credit markings  reported on your 
credit report during this time.
   
So I have come to a very specific provisional  decision in these particular  circumstances, which is that 
CashEuroNet did lend irresponsibly but it need not do any more to remedy this. And Mr K need  not 
repay anything further. So the balance  on the account remains at £0 and the complaint is resolved  
and the loan considered repaid. 
payment for distress  and inconvenience
Considering all the facts which I have  read carefully and taken into account, then I do not think that 
any additional  payment to Mr K for distress and inconvenience is necessary. CashEuroNet  has 
explained how it approached  the situation when  Mr K raised his difficulties and I am aware of its 
recent decision  to waive the balance. I do not think that CashEuroNet need do more.
