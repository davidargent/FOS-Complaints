The complaint
Miss C complains that CarCashPoint Limited (CarCashPoint) lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
Miss C took out a fixed sum loan with CarCashPoint in May 2019. The loan was 
repayable by way of 36 monthly payments of £97.12 with the total amount repayable 
under the agreement being £3,496.32. 
Miss C says the loan was granted irresponsibly by CarCashPoint as it was unaffordable. 
CarCashPoint didnt agree. It said it had reviewed Miss Cs income and expenditure 
when she made the application and had checked her credit file. And based on that the 
loan was affordable. But our adjudicator thought the complaint should be upheld. 
In my provisional decision dated 20 June 2023, I explained why I didnt think CarCashPoint 
had acted unfairly in providing Miss C with the loan. I set out an extract below:
Before granting the loan, I think CarCashPoint gathered a reasonable amount of evidence 
and information from Miss C about her ability to repay. I say this having noted the credit 
checks it carried out each time. Ive also noted that CarCashPoint verified Miss Cs income 
from checking several bank statements shed given covering the period from January to May 
2019. The information from the bank statements supported the income and expenditure 
details that Miss C also provided, enabling CarCashPoint to verify her monthly income and 
regular living expenses. The bank statements showed that she was receiving regular income 
each month by way of state benefits. On the income and expenditure breakdown Miss C 
provided, she said she had around £1,800 per month income with committed outgoings of 
around £950, including existing loan repayments and regular outgoings. This suggested 
Miss C had at least £800 available each month by way of disposable income. Also, 
CarCashPoints checks didnt reveal any significant adverse information about Miss Cs 
recent financial history. However, just because I think CarCashPoint carried out 
proportionate checks, it doesnt automatically mean it made a fair lending decision. So, Ive 
thought about what the evidence and information showed. 
Ive reviewed the information and evidence CarCashPoint gathered, as well as the 
information Miss C provided at the time she made her application for the loan. Having done 
so Im satisfied that the checks that were completed showed the agreement was likely to be 
affordable to Miss C. 
Ive seen that when responding to our adjudicators initial finding that CarCashPoint had 
made a fair lending decision, Miss C sent in bank statements covering broadly the same 
period as those she used in her application. But this time Miss C highlighted benefits income 
and expenditure which she explained was for her and benefits income and expenditure 
relevant to her partner. This is not something Miss C did when she made her original 
application. Rather, Miss C told CarCashPoint that she and her partner both relied on the 
benefits received and didnt specify that part of the benefits ought not to be treated as 
available income. It was on that basis that CarCashPoint assessed if the loan was affordable 
alongside the income and assessment details shed provided. 
Given that CarCashPoint relied on the bank statement information and what Miss C set out 
in the income and expenditure breakdown she provided, I dont think it was unreasonable for 
it to conclude that Miss C had enough disposable income. I say this especially given that 
there appears to be at least £800 of disposable income available to the household and Miss 
C was being required to meet monthly payments of £97.12.
It follows that I dont currently think it was unfair of CarCashPoint to decide it was likely 
Miss C would be able to afford the monthly repayment amount that would be due under the 
loan. 
I therefore currently dont intend to uphold this complaint. In the absence of any additional 
information or clarification by Miss C at the time of her application, I dont think 
CarCashPoint was wrong in making the decision to provide the loan to Miss C.
Miss C told our adjudicator she wasnt happy with the provisional decision. Our 
adjudicator explained how she could provide further evidence. Unfortunately Miss C 
then became unwell which led to her being hospitalised and signed off work. I 
understand Miss C returned home at the beginning of August 2023. I have therefore 
agreed three extensions of time. The third extension expired 7 on September 2023 but 
Miss C has not sent in anything further. 
During this time, whilst CarCashPoint did not have anything to add to my provisional 
decision, it agreed to hold off taking any further recovery action until the final decision 
has been issued. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
CarCashPoint will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we 
consider when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. So, 
I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about our 
approach to these complaints is set out on our website. 
Given that neither Miss C nor CarCashPoint have responded to my provisional decision with 
any new evidence or information within the initial and extended time-scales weve agreed, I 
see no reason to depart from my finding that CarCashPoint didnt act unfairly in approving 
this fixed sum loan agreement for Miss C
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
CarCashPoint Limited therefore doesnt have to do anything more. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 October 2023.
