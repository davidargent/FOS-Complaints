The complaint
Mrs K complains that NewDay Ltd MasterCard (NewDay) declined a credit card application.
What happened
In November 2021, Mrs K applied for a branded credit card from NewDay  with a limit of
£10,000. NewDay declined the application.
Mrs K complained. She accepts that NewDay can make its own credit decisions but wants 
to know why the card was declined. This was because her husband had been the victim of 
identity theft in the past. A fraudster had also tried to make transactions on another credit 
card. She was concerned that her details had been compromised, and she and her 
husband would be affected again in the same way. She said they were an elderly couple 
and this had been hanging over them for several months. She is also concerned about the 
search on her credit file undertaken by NewDay.
NewDays final response in January 2022 said that it hadnt made an error in declining the 
application. And it didnt have to tell Mrs K why it made that decision.
Mrs K brought her complaint to us. During our investigation, NewDay looked at what 
happened again. It discovered that it had made an error when processing the application. 
When it conducted a credit search  it contacted Mrs K to ask for some digits from the 
password she had added to her credit file. But NewDay had keyed in the digits wrongly, and 
this caused the application to be declined. Therefore, NewDay offered compensation of 
£75. Our investigator considered this and because of the worry and stress caused during 
the time which elapsed, he said the compensation should be increased to £150.
Mrs K rejected both offers and asked for £500. She asked that an ombudsman look at her
complaint.
I then reached a provisional decision which said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that when NewDay assessed Mrs Ks application, two things happened. Firstly, it 
made a silent call to her number  which she became concerned about and so blocked the 
number. Mrs K then called NewDay back and to complete a credit search, it needed Mrs K 
to give some digits from a password she had set up on her credit file. I imagine she did this 
to stop unauthorised persons accessing her credit file details  because of the identity theft 
which affected her and her husband previously.
I dont know why a silent call was made by NewDay  but it does seem odd, and I can see 
that  in Mrs Ks circumstances  why it was worrying. And then  after Mrs K called 
NewDay, the underwriting team input the password digits wrongly, so access to Mrs Ks 
credit file was declined  and this caused her application for a card to be turned down. I 
can see that the silent call, followed by the failure of her password, must have been 
concerning for Mrs K. This was especially so because of the reason for her setting up the 
special password on her credit file in the first place.
And  NewDay then told Mrs K in its final response that it didnt uphold her complaint  
when it couldve resolved it at that time. But it didnt, and so Mrs K was clearly worried and 
concerned for a period - between November 2021 and our investigators view in April 2022. 
And given what happened before  I can appreciate that.
Our service has set out criteria to help with deciding on awards of compensation. This 
says an award between £100 and £300 might be fair where there have been repeated 
small errors, or a larger single mistake, requiring a reasonable effort to sort out. These 
typically result in an impact that lasts a few days, or even weeks, and cause either some 
distress, inconvenience, disappointment or loss of expectation. Here, there was a single 
mistake which had a significant impact for several months.
And so on balance, Im persuaded that the compensation should be at the upper end of 
the scale  and so my provisional decision is that NewDay should pay £300 to Mrs K. The 
existence of a credit search on Mrs Ks credit file should not be a concern to her in the 
normal course of events  but to put her mind at ease, it would be sensible to remove this.
Responses to the provisional decision:
Mrs K accepted the provisional decision. She asked how she would know if NewDay had 
removed the search. NewDay commented that on the silent call. They said this probably 
happened because of the way their outbound calling system works  it uses an auto-dialler 
system to contact new customers about their application. It seems likely that when they got 
through to Mrs K, no one at NewDay was available to speak to her, and the line hung up 
automatically.
I now need to make a final decision.

What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im grateful to NewDay for the explanation about the silent call, but it still meant she was 
caused stress and concern. And that, added to the error they made in keying her password 
for her credit file incorrectly, doesnt change my view of her complaint. And so  my final 
decision is line with the provisional decision.Mrs K wants to know how she will know that NewDay have removed the search. I would say 
that this decision is binding on NewDay to do that  so they must. She can also check her 
credit file in three months time to ensure it has been done. We will give her some guidance 
as to how to do that. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. NewDay trading as Amazon Platinum MasterCard must:
Pay compensation of £300 for distress and inconvenience.
Remove the search in November 2021 from Mrs Ks credit file.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 November 2022.
