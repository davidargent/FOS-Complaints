DRN-1584550
The complaint
Ms W complains that Studio Retail Limited wont reimburse her for the cost of repairing a 
vase that was damaged when a package was delivered to her.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Ms W has provided photos showing the damage to the vase and an invoice for the 
repair cost of £312 - I sympathise with her for the damage thats been caused to the 
vase and I can understand the frustration and upset that she feels;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that Studio Retail sent a package to Ms W 
which contained the goods that shed ordered or that the package was delivered to 
her  and, when she complained to Studio Retail, it upheld her complaint, apologised 
and credited £30 to her account which it said was: to compensate you for the upset 
this has caused;
Ive watched the videos that Mrs W has provided to show that the package couldnt 
have been posted through her letterbox and of her putting a package through her 
window  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
damage to the vase was caused by the delivery of the package;
I dont consider that Studio Retails final response letter to Ms W was an admission 
that the vase had been damaged by the package being dropped through her window 
and I dont consider that it has accepted liability for the cost of repairing the vase;
I consider that it was fair and reasonable for it to apologise to Ms W for the upset that 
shed been caused and to credit her account with £30 as compensation for that  But 
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to pay for the 
vase to be repaired; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Studio Retail to pay for the vase to be repaired, to pay any more compensation to 
Ms W than its already credited to her account or to take any other action in response 
to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2020.
