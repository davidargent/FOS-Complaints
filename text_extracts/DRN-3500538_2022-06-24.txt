The complaint
Mr O complains that Lloyds Bank plc closed his accounts and refused to pay the balances in 
the accounts to him.
What happened
Mr O had several accounts with Lloyds. He says that Lloyds closed two of these accounts 
and refused to pay him the moneys that were in the accounts at the date of closure. He 
complained to Lloyds.
Lloyds investigated his complaint. It said it had closed the accounts because Mr O had been 
the beneficiary of fraudulent funds. He hadnt been able to satisfy it that he was entitled to 
the funds in the accounts. It said that, in these circumstances, it could not pay the balances 
in the accounts to him and had closed the accounts.
Mr O did not accept this. He complained to our service. Our investigator looked into his 
complaint. She said that Lloyds had asked Mr O to provide information to it about a payment 
thatd been made into his account. Lloyds said he hadnt provided this to it. Our investigator 
asked Mr O to furnish the evidence to our service, but hed not done that. He had queried 
why should I do that. In these circumstances, she didnt think Lloyds had done anything 
wrong when it had closed the accounts and refused to release the funds in question to Mr O. 
Mr O didnt agree. He said he had provided proof that he was a sole trader, including further 
information and evidence about his business to Lloyds. Our investigator asked Lloyds to 
comment on this. It said it had not received any information from Mr O to prove he was 
entitled to the funds in question.
Our investigator considered what both Mr O and Lloyds had said. But, she didnt change her 
view. So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr O had several accounts with Lloyds. In this decision Im looking only at his complaint 
about the closure of the two accounts hes complained about. Hes complained about the 
closure of account **2968 (closed on 12 November 2018) and the closure of account **8468 
(closed on 18 March 2019).
On 3 September 2018 there was a credit to account ***8468 for £8,962.00. Most of these 
funds were subsequently withdrawn by Mr O including an amount of £680 which Mr O 
transferred to account ** 2968.
Ive looked at Lloyds internal notes. These record that on 7 September 2018, Lloyds had 
concerns about whether Mr O was beneficially entitled to the payment of £8,962.00. As a 
result, it blocked account **8468 and account **2968. It contacted Mr O and asked him to 
provide proof of his entitlement to these funds. 
Mr O subsequently attended a branch of Lloyds on 1 October. On that occasion, the notes 
record that he was told he needed to contact his employer or the person whod sent the 
funds and ask that person to confirm that he was entitled to the funds. The records show that 
Mr O attended several other Lloyds branches over the subsequent months and on each 
occasion he was given the same information.
Mr O says he has provided sufficient evidence to Lloyds to show that he was entitled to 
these funds. Hes mentioned providing information about his business, including VAT 
clearance/ returns and bills of lading. He says hes gone the extra mile to prove that the 
funds were beneficially his. 
Lloyds says it hasnt received evidence from Mr O to satisfy it that hes beneficially entitled to 
the payment. Our investigator asked Mr O to provide copies of the evidence to our service. 
But, hes declined to do that. Hes asked why he should have to do that when hes already 
shown that he is a sole trader and provided other information about his business.
Having considered the information on the file provided by Lloyds and the responses from Mr 
O, Im not persuaded that he provided sufficient evidence to Lloyds to show that he was 
beneficially entitled to the payment credited to his account on 3 September 2018. I say this 
because I dont think providing the type of information Mr O has told us about, wouldve been 
sufficient in circumstances where Lloyds was asking for proof of entitlement to the specific 
payment credited to his account.
Lloyds told Mr O on 1 October 2018, when he visited one of its branches, it required the 
party which had sent the funds to contact its bank to provide further information about the 
payment. That was the specific information it requested  and theres no evidence to show 
that Mr O provided that information to it. So, I think, in the absence of that information, it was 
fair and reasonable for Lloyds to close account **8468.
At the date of closure the balance still standing to the credit of account **8468 was £445.33.  
As mentioned above, Lloyds had also blocked account **2968 on 7 September. The balance 
in that account on that date was £5,796.17. 
Taking into account both balances at the respective dates of closure, the total was 
considerably less than the amount of the payment that was being queried. In these 
circumstances, I think it was fair and reasonable for Lloyds not to pay this amount over to 
Mr O until such times as he provided it with evidence to satisfy it that he was beneficially 
entitled to the funds. Im not persuaded, on balance, that he has done that.
Having considered everything here, I dont require Lloyds to do anything further to resolve 
this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold this complaint about Lloyds Bank plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2022.
