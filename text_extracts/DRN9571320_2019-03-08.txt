K820x#14complaint
Mrs A says HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC)  mis-sold  an Advance  packaged bank account to 
her in 2012. Shes used a Claims Management  Company (CMC) to make  her complaint. 
background
Our adjudicators have  looked into Mrs As complaint already and didnt think HSBC had mis-
sold the packaged account.  The CMC  asked for an ombudsmans  review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mrs As complaint.  Having done  so, I dont think HSBC  mis-sold the Advance  
account to Mrs A. Id like to explain why I think thats the case.  
Fee free accounts  are widely  available in the United  Kingdom. And I think that Mrs A 
wouldve known she couldve had a free account  with HSBC if thats what  she wanted after 
all she had one previously. So I think that Mrs A chose to take the Advance  account.  
It looks like Mrs A benefitted from some of the main benefits  such as the preferential  
overdraft rates and fee free overseas cash withdrawals and she couldve  used  others such  
as the travel insurance.  
Im open  to the possibility Mrs A wasnt told absolutely everything  she needed to know  about 
all the benefits.  But Ive not seen  anything to suggest she wouldve been  affected by the 
main limitations or exclusions. So I dont think clearer information wouldve made a 
difference and I think Mrs A was given enough  to understand what she was agreeing to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mrs As complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs A to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 April 2019.
