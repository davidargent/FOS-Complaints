The complaint
Ms P complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) should have refunded her the 
monthly packaged bank account fees from when her First Additions account was changed to 
a Current Account with Tech Pack in December 2015.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. The 
facts are not in dispute so I will focus on giving the reasons for my decisions.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions of our investigator for these reasons:
I think its more likely than not that Ms P received at least one of the notification letters about 
the account change in December 2015 from Barclays, as they are correctly addressed, and 
she received their other correspondence over the years.
I think the letters are clear enough to explain that Ms P did not have to continue paying for 
the benefits of her account if she didnt want to. 
And I think its more likely than not that by 2015, after many years in the UK, Ms Ps English 
language skills would have been enough for her to understand the choice in front of her at 
that time.
For these reasons, although I understand Ms Ps frustration, I do not think its fair to uphold 
her complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Ms Ps complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 February 2021.
