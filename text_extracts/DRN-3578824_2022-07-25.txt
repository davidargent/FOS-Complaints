The complaint
Miss F complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA refused her request for a refund, 
after she raised a claim under its Buyer Protection policy.
A representative has been helping Miss F with her complaint. For ease, Ill refer to anything 
theyve said as being said by Miss F.
What happened
Miss F used her PayPal account to purchase some gym equipment from a seller online. She 
says that the equipment was badly damaged and rusty when it arrived.
Miss F raised a dispute with PayPal under its Buyer Protection policy, using the category 
significantly not as described. PayPal agreed to refund her if she returned the items to the 
seller and provided the tracking details within ten days. Miss F didnt return the items within 
the specified timeframe, so PayPal denied her claim. 
Miss F complained to PayPal. She said the equipment was very heavy and would have cost 
hundreds of pounds to ship. She says she explained this to PayPal many times, but it had 
nevertheless closed her case. 
PayPal said it had acted in line with its user agreement. It said that although the purchase 
was eligible for Buyer Protection, her claim was not successful as she didnt return the items 
within the requested timeframe.
Miss F remained unhappy and asked our service to consider her concerns. Our investigator 
looked into the matter and thought Miss Fs complaint should be upheld. He didnt think 
PayPal had acted fairly and recommended it refund Miss F the cost of the gym equipment, 
with 8% per annum statutory interest from the date it had denied her claim.
PayPal disagreed with our investigators view. It didnt think hed considered how the seller 
would be severely disadvantaged if PayPal had agreed to Miss Fs claim without requiring 
the items to be returned. 
PayPal said it hadnt been presented with evidence to show that the postage costs were for 
the most affordable courier Miss F could have used. It also commented that PayPal 
shouldnt be held liable for costs associated with the return of the item and its process 
doesnt hinder a complainants right to reclaim postage costs from the seller. It suggested 
Miss F address the issue directly with the seller through the small claims court. So, the 
complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold Miss Fs complaint. Ill explain why.
PayPals user agreement says that buyers may be eligible for a refund under its Buyer 
Protection policy in certain circumstances, including where the item is Significantly Not as 
Described. 
PayPals user agreement says that a claim may be denied if certain steps arent followed 
including to: Comply with PayPals shipping requests in a timely manner, if youre filing a 
Significantly Not as Described claim. PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the 
item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to 
provide proof of delivery. 
Miss F has provided several photographs to show that the items she received were rusty 
and damaged. PayPal says it didnt have the opportunity to inspect or review the items or to 
list its attributes or qualities. However, it did initially agree that Miss F was eligible for a 
refund under its Buyer Protection policy. So, PayPal appears to have accepted that the items 
met its criteria for significantly not as described. 
Miss F says it would have cost her around £460 to return the items and has provided 
screenshots of quotes to support this. She says she would have needed to pay an additional 
£125 on top of this for insurance. This means that the cost of returning the items would likely 
have been around half of what shed paid for them. PayPal has commented that Miss F 
might have been able to use a cheaper courier, but it hasnt provided any evidence to 
support this. In any event, Im persuaded that it would have been expensive for Miss F to 
return the items.
PayPals user agreement says that it may require a buyer to ship the item back to the 
seller, which implies that there are circumstances where returning the item isnt required. 
The user agreement also says PayPal will make a final decision (including automatically 
closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion. But that doesnt mean PayPal can do 
whatever it likes. It has to use its discretion fairly.
In this case I dont think PayPal has used its discretion fairly because if Miss F had returned 
the items to the seller and shed been refunded what shed paid, she still would have been 
left significantly out of pocket. PayPal has made several comments about needing to be fair 
to the seller of the equipment. However, it hasnt provided any information to show whether 
or not the seller disputed that the items were poor condition. And PayPal appears to have 
agreed that the items the seller sold were significantly not as described because it initially 
accepted Miss Fs claim. So, based on what Ive seen, I think it would be fair for Miss F to be 
refunded what shed paid for the items without having to incur the cost of returning them.
Putting things right
PayPal should refund Miss F the payment shed claimed for (£1,207.49) plus 8% per annum 
simple interest* on this amount from the date it denied her claim (15 March 2020) to the date 
of settlement.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal to deduct tax from this interest. PayPal should give Miss F 
a certificate showing how much tax its deducted if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Miss Fs complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA to put things right by doing what Ive said above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss F to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 August 2022.
