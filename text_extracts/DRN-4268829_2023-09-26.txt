The complaint
Mr R is unhappy with the service hes received from Nationwide Building Society. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons: 
I dont think Nationwide has treated Mr R unfairly in all the circumstances of this 
complaint. Due to the amount of money Mr R wanted to withdraw the staff 
member asked Mr R questions about his withdrawal. 
I dont think it was unreasonable for Nationwide to ask Mr R questions about the 
reason for withdrawing cash from his account. Theyve explained that this is part 
of their strategy to prevent fraud and to ensure that customers arent pressurised 
into withdrawing cash. 
Nationwide later issued Mr R with a warning about his behaviour towards staff. 
Im satisfied that this warning was issued in line with the account terms and 
conditions. I dont think it was an unreasonable course of action in the 
circumstances.
My final decision
Im not upholding Mr Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 October 2023.
