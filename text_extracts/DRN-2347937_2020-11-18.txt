The complaint
Mr L complains that Loans 2 Go Limited lent to him in an irresponsible manner.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision relating to this complaint in October 2020. In that decision
I explained why I thought most of Mr L's complaint should be upheld. Both parties have
received a copy of that provisional decision, but in summary I said;
Mr L was given ten loans by Loans 2 Go between July 2017 and April 2019. Most of the 
loans were secured against Mr Ls car. The loans were due to be repaid over periods 
between 18 and 36 months, but Mr L repaid each loan far earlier than planned. All his loans 
have been fully repaid. A summary of Mr Ls borrowing from Loans 2 Go is as follows;

I explained the relevant regulations that Loans 2 Go needed to follow when lending to Mr L, 
and that at different stages of their relationship different levels of checks might be 
appropriate.
I didnt think that the checks Loans 2 Go had done before agreeing any of the loans had 
been proportionate. I thought it needed to do more to independently check the true state of 
Mr Ls finances. But I didnt think that alone meant the complaint should be upheld. So 
I looked at copies of Mr Ls bank statements from the time to give me a good idea of what 
better checks might have shown.
I didnt think Mr Ls bank statements, around the time of the first three loans, suggested that 
he was facing any significant financial stress. His account was maintained in credit, and 
there werent any instances of payments being returned due to insufficient funds. His 
statements didnt show that he was borrowing from other lenders in an unsustainable 
manner. So I didnt think Loans 2 Go had been wrong to give the first three loans to Mr L.
But by the time of the fourth loan, Mr Ls bank statements clearly showed the real problems 
that he was facing with his finances. He was borrowing from a number of other short term 
lenders. And his bank statements clearly showed that he was using those loans to support a 
significant level of spending on gambling transactions. In the two weeks before he took loans 
4 and 5 Mr L spent more than four times his normal income on transactions of this nature. 
So I thought it would have been clear from better checks that Mr L would be unlikely to be 
able to repay any new borrowing sustainably.
Mr L continued with a pattern of frequent borrowing and repaying early for the remainder of 
his relationship with Loans 2 Go. And his bank statements showed his financial situation 
remained just as difficult. He continued to borrow from a range of other lenders, using the 
money to support his gambling expenditure. So I didnt think Loans 2 Go should have agreed 
to lend to Mr L from loan 4 onwards. I thought Loans 2 Go needed to pay Mr L some 
compensation.
Mr L has told us that his financial situation was just as difficult at the time of the first three 
loans as I have found it was at the time of the later loans. But he agrees those problems 
might not have been apparent from his bank statements at the start of his relationship with 
Loans 2 Go. So he accepts my provisional findings.
Loans 2 Go hasnt provided us with any further evidence or comments following my 
provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that Mr L has accepted my provisional findings and Loans 2 Go hasnt provided me 
with any further evidence or comments I see no reason to alter the conclusions I reached in 
my provisional decision.
It follows that I don't think Loans 2 Go should have agreed to lend to Mr L from loan 4 
onwards and that it needs to pay him some compensation.
Putting things right
I dont think Loans 2 Go should have agreed to lend to Mr L after, and including, the loan 
that he took on 14 September 2017 (loan 4). So Loans 2 Go should;
refund all the interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 4 to 10.
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ls credit file in relation to the loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Loans 2 Go to take off tax from this interest. Loans 2 Go 
must give Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision, for the reasons given above and in my provisional decision, is that I uphold 
most of Mr Ls complaint and direct Loans 2 Go Limited to put things right as detailed above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 December 2020.
