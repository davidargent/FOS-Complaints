K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc hasnt  refunded  him for a transaction  
which he didnt authorise.
background
Mr B hired a car and paid a holding charge on his NatWest card which he understood would 
be re-credited when the car was returned.
Mr B subsequently noticed a charge of £157.50 pending on his account.  He contacted 
NatWest and asked  it to block the payment  because  he felt it was fraudulent. NatWest 
advised Mr B that it was unable to do this as the charge was pending.
The pending  charge of £157.50 was ultimately  taken by the car hire company. Mr B is 
unhappy that NatWest didnt  block the payment. He wants the funds returned.
In its final response NatWest said it was unable to raise a chargeback  dispute  against the 
car hire company until Mr B provided details of the dispute in writing together  with evidence 
of his attempts  to resolve things with the car hire company.
Mr B was unhappy with the response  and complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. She said Mr B hadnt provided NatWest with the 
necessary information  to enable it to raise a dispute  with the car hire company. The 
investigator said that NatWest had dealt with all other aspects of Mr Bs complaint (including 
his complaint about being kept waiting on the phone) reasonably.
Mr B didnt agree so Ive been asked  to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive listened to the telephone calls between Mr B and NatWest.  During the first call, Mr B told 
NatWest he paid £88.39 to hire a car on 30 August 2018 but that he had later noticed a 
further pending charge of £157.50.  NatWest explained the procedure for raising a dispute  to 
Mr B and asked him to provide  information.
I can see that a letter  was sent to Mr B on 26 September  2018  setting out the information 
which NatWest needed in order to raise a chargeback dispute. I cant  see that Mr B replied 
to this letter or provided any of the information.
I understand that Mr B didnt feel that contacting  the car hire company would  be worthwhile. 
However, Im satisfied that NatWest acted reasonably in requesting the information from 
Mr B. Mr B didnt provide the information  so I dont think  NatWest  could have  done  anything 
more in the circumstances.
Taking all of the evidence into account Im unable to say that NatWest has acted 
unreasonably or unfairly.

My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 October  2019.
