K821x#15complaint
Mr Ms unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA reversed a return  claim on his account 
after it had been  found in his favour.
background
Mr M sold an item on Ebay for £170  and the transaction  was made  through PayPal. The 
buyer said theyd changed their mind and requested a return  which  Mr M denied. The buyer 
then left negative  information about the transaction and raised a return  request with PayPal 
claiming the item was significantly not as described.  
PayPal says its entitled to decide what constitutes significantly not as described. And in 
such claims it can require a seller  to accept items back  and refund  the buyer the price plus 
postage costs. 
PayPal investigated  matters and found in the buyers favour. But it later reversed  this 
decision and restored  the £170 to Mr Ms account. Mr M says PayPal then reversed its 
decision again without  telling him and took the money from his account.
Mr Ms unhappy because  he doesnt  think PayPal has done  any kind of investigation of his 
case and he says its treated him unfairly  by letting a buyer misuse the system. He says 
although he has the returned item hes lost out on postage costs, Ebay fees and PayPal 
transaction fees. Hes also been inconvenienced and received negative feedback from the 
buyer. He wants PayPal to admit  it made  an error and to compensate  him.
Our investigator felt this complaint  should  be upheld. In summary she said:
Under the terms of PayPals user agreement, it has the right to tell the buyer to return 
the item to the seller  as a way to resolve a dispute. The agreement  also says if Mr M 
refused to accept the return  of the item and refund the buyer the full purchase price,  
PayPal can award  the claim in the buyers  favour. 
In this case,  Mr M has received the item back and the buyer has been reimbursed 
the £170. So PayPal has settled the dispute in line with the terms of their agreement. 
But if itd conducted  an effective review of the information Mr M gave it at the initial 
return request, PayPal wouldve found in his favour as the evidence  he gave them 
was persuasive.
Mr M wants  PayPal to reimburse him the £170 and the cost of posting the item back 
to the buyer. But I dont  think that is feasible  as the buyer  has made  it clear  they dont  
want the item. And Mr M now has the item and is able to sell it again. So it isnt fair to 
ask PayPal to refund Mr M the £170 as this would  put him in a better position than he 
wouldve been in if it had found in his favour.  And I dont  think PayPal is responsible  
for the negative  feedback left by the buyer or the costs of postage on his Ebay 
account. 
But PayPal should pay Mr M £50 compensation for its poor handling of the claim 
which meant there were  delays in its resolution, and the frustration and confusion  its 
lack of communication caused him. 
Ref: DRN39518792Mr M accepts the investigators  view.
PayPal doesnt  agree and has asked for an ombudsman  review. It says the claim in question  
has been investigated and closed correctly  in line with its user agreement.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The buyer originally  said he didnt want Mr Ms item. That is confirmed in a screenshot  where 
the buyer says he changed his mind. But the buyer  later said to PayPal that the item was 
significantly different to how it was described.  Mr M challenged this and supplied  evidence in 
support of his arguments. 
PayPal has changed  its mind a number of times  about whether or not to find in favour of the 
buyer or Mr M. Although I accept that it has ultimately resolved the matter in a manner 
consistent with its user agreement, I agree with the investigator that the eventual  outcome 
suggests it didnt  properly investigate matters. Im not convinced  its investigation was carried 
out thoroughly,  fairly or reasonably. Had it been I think the evidence  Mr M provided in 
response to what the buyer had originally said wouldve likely resulted in it finding  in his 
favour from the start.
Overall Im not persuaded  on balance that Mr M has been  treated fairly by PayPal. And I 
think he has been caused some distress  and inconvenience by this, the resulting elongated  
process and by the decision PayPal ultimately  made. 
Even so, as the investigator has said, Mr M now has the item back  and can resell it. Taking 
everything into account I cannot therefore  fairly or reasonably  require PayPal to reimburse  
Mr M for the £170 cost of the item. But in view of the inconvenience  and distress hes been  
caused I agree with the investigator  that its a fair and reasonable resolution of this complaint 
for PayPal  to pay him £50 compensation for all this to include a contribution to any additional 
costs he mayve incurred. 
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  To put things  right PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should  pay Mr M 
£50 compensation.
PayPal must  pay the compensation  within 28 days of the date on which we tell it Mr M 
accepts my final decision. If it pays later than this it must also pay interest  on the 
compensation from the date of my final decision to the date of payment at 8% a year simple.
If PayPal considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to withhold income tax from 
that interest,  it should tell Mr M how much its taken  off. It should also give him a tax 
deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 October  2019.
