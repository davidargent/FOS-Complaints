K822xcomplaint
Miss G complains  about the mistakes that have been made by A. Share & Sons Limited, 
trading as SCS,  in dealing with her loan agreement.
background
SCS supplied some  furniture to Miss G in March 2016. The cost of the furniture (including 
delivery and fabric protection) was £2,287. She paid a £50 deposit and the balance of 
£2,237 was to be paid by a fixed sum loan agreement  with a third party.  But the loan 
agreement was set up for £2,287 instead  of £2,237. The loan agreement  was ended in 
March 2018 when Miss G returned the furniture  and £998.30 was refunded to her. But she 
shouldve received £1,048.30. She complained to the third party which  refunded £50 to her 
and paid her £25 compensation. She also complained to SCS and said that it should pay her 
£150 for its mistakes in setting up the loan agreement. She wasnt satisfied with its response 
so complained to this service.
The investigator recommended  that this complaint should be upheld  in part. He said that the 
loan agreement was set up for the wrong amount  and that it had taken a bit longer than 
necessary to deal with the refund. So he thought that SCS should  pay £25 to Miss G for the 
trouble and upset  caused. 
Miss G has asked  for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman.  Shes  provided  her 
account of whats  happened and says,  in summary,  that:
SCS set-up the loan agreement incorrectly;
it ended  the loan agreement incorrectly;
it refused to address the issues  and take responsibility for it
if the loan agreement hadnt  been  ended early shed have ended  up paying £50 more  
than she shouldve paid;  and
she should receive more than £25 compensation for those mistakes.
SCS says that it doesnt feel that its done anything wrong but it agrees to pay £25 to Miss G 
to bring this matter  to a swift conclusion.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The March  2016  invoice for the furniture shows that it cost £2,287 and that Miss G paid a 
deposit of £50 (which  was paid by credit card).  So the outstanding  amount due from Miss G 
was £2,237. But the loan agreement with a third party was set up for £2,287.
Miss G had various issues with the furniture and SCS then agreed that she could  return it. 
The loan agreement  was ended in March 2018  and £998.30 was refunded  to Miss G. But 
she said that she shouldve received  £1,048.30. She complained  to the third party  and it 
refunded the £50 difference  to her and paid her £25 compensation.  
But Miss G also complained to SCS and said that it should pay her £150  compensation for 
setting the agreement up incorrectly and for its delay in dealing  with the issues. It has now 
agreed to pay her the further £25 compensation that the investigator recommended that she 
should receive. And I consider that to be fair and reasonable  in the circumstances.
Ref: DRN51726872Im satisfied that the loan agreement was set up in the wrong amount. But Miss G signed the 
loan agreement and didnt notice that it was wrong. When  she complained  to the third party,  
it refunded the £50 difference  to her and paid her £25 compensation. So Miss G has now 
received a full refund  of the money  that she paid for the furniture. Shes  also received £25 
compensation from the third party and SCS has agreed to pay her a further £25 
compensation. 
Im not persuaded that the £150  compensation claimed by Miss G is justified in these 
circumstances. And I dont consider that it would  be fair or reasonable for me to require SCS 
to pay a higher  amount of compensation  to Miss G than the £25 that it has agreed to pay her 
to her. So I find that it would be fair and reasonable for SCS to pay £25 compensation to 
Miss G. 
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Miss Gs complaint in part. And I order 
A. Share  & Sons Limited, trading  as SCS, to pay £25 compensation to Miss G.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 April 2019.
