The complaint
Mr B complains that Scottish Widows Limited (SW) didnt process his change of bank 
account request properly.
What happened
Mr B said he received two monthly pension payments of around £1,100 and £163 from SW. 
He sent instructions to change his receiving bank account in April 2022. He said SW wrote 
back later in April saying the signature on the letter didnt match that on its file. Mr B made 
further contact in early July 2022 chasing the change in bank account. The change was then 
made for the monthly payment that was made on 14 July 2022. He complained in early 
August 2022 as he said the delay in the change had meant he incurred charges on his bank 
account and he wanted to be reimbursed. He said he found his old account was overdrawn 
to the tune of £1,184.07 with bank charges of £183.98 and £17.43 imposed on his overdraft 
limit. He cleared the debt on 12 August 2022. He complained to SW on 15 August and they 
replied accepting his complaint on 19 August 2022. 
SW apologised for the delay in making the change and offered £100 compensation and 
asked for details of the charges. 
The investigator didnt uphold the complaint and said the evidence showed that SW had 
written to Mr B the week after it received his request. SW accepted that it should have 
followed up sooner. The delay meant that the monthly payments for April, May and June 
went to his old bank account. The switch over was made in July 2022. But the account that 
suffered charges was the old account and not the new account. As the old account received 
the monthly payments for longer than expected and the payments would have increased the 
balance on the account they could not have been responsible for charges being incurred on 
the account. So SW was not responsible for the charges. The payment of £100 was fair and 
reasonable for the delay.
Mr B didnt agree. He said he had reviewed his account detail. At no time did the new 
account come close to being overdrawn.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I am not upholding this complaint for the reasons explained below. In order to be clear why 
that is the case I have set out details of the evidence I have considered in reaching my 
conclusion in the hope that it will assist Mr B in understanding why I have reached the 
conclusion that I have.
Firstly I note that at the time of this complaint Mr B had two bank accounts. An old account 
ending 1117 and a new account ending 1188. As this decision will be published I am not 
able to name the banks that were receiving the payments. I have therefore referred to them 
by reference to the final four numbers of each account.
Mr B received one pension payment from SW each month for around £160. 
He also received another pension payment of over £1,000 but SW was not involved in or 
responsible for that payment. I note that Mr B said he received both payments from SW but I 
have checked this with them and I dont agree this is the case. I say that because:-
1. I have checked with SW which confirmed it makes one payment of around £160. 
2. I can see from his bank statement for March 2022 for the old account ending 1117 
that the payment from SW is clearly marked as a Giro received from SW and lists his 
policy number ending 876 as the reference. By contrast the payment of around 
£1,600 shown on the same statement and made on 30 March is listed as a Giro 
received from a pooled account and the letters of the pension scheme that is making 
the payment. There is no reference to SW as there is on the other payment.
3. Mr B also said that the final response letter from SW dated 19 August 2022, 
confirmed it was responsible for the failure to change the direct debit payment for his 
payment from the other pension scheme (of around £1,000) in April, May and June 
2022. But I have read that letter and do not agree. It does not mention the second 
payment of around £1,000 at all.  
4. I have also seen a copy letter from the administrators of the other pension scheme 
regarding the payment of around £1,000 confirming it has acted on his request to 
change his bank account and that it will take around two weeks before the payment 
date is changed. So it seems that they are responsible for this and not SW.
5. I can see a payment of around £1600 from a pension scheme pooled account into his 
new account ending 1188 on 28 April 2022, and again on 30 May 2022. These 
statements all refer to a payment from a pooled account and the letters of the 
pension scheme. There is no reference to SW on those payments.
6.  It seems that the larger payment of around £1600 was moved to the new bank 
account with effect from April whereas the SW payment was not moved to the new 
account until July.
So for all those reasons it is clear to me that SW was not involved in making the monthly 
payment of around £1,000.
I have also seen the following:-
Copy letter from Mr B to SW dated 13 April 2022 and marked received on 19 April 
2022 for policy ending 876 asking SW to make future pension payments to nis new 
account ending 1188.
A Letter from SW dated 21 April noting that the signature on Mr Bs letter and on its 
records did not match. It asked him to contact them. It seems Mr B then phoned on 
11 July 2022 and his bank details were amended and as can be seen from the list of 
payments mentioned below his payment for July was sent to the new account.
A further letter from Mr B to SW dated 15 August referring to a letter of April asking it 
to change his bank account. It notes that the request was acknowledged by a 
telephone call from SW on 11 July 2022. But the request wasnt acted on so that the 
April, May and June payments were paid to his old account ending 1117.
A list from SW of transactions showing payments of around £163 made to Mr B for March to June 2022. It confirmed that the account was changed on 14 July and the 
payment made on 18 July went to the new account ending 1188.
Based on the above it is clear that Mr B asked SW to change the payment to his new bank 
account in April. Due to issues with verifying his signature this was not acted on and the 
change didnt take place until July. I think it was reasonable for SW to verify Mr B signature 
to make sure his request was genuine. I note SW has apologised for not chasing Mr B 
sooner and paid £100 for this. I think this is fair and reasonable in the circumstances and 
more than I would have awarded as I dont have evidence that there was a delay by SW.
With respect to Mr Bs suggestion that the delay in making the change caused him to pay 
bank charges because his old account became overdrawn. I have seen the following
a note of charges for the period 1 July to 1 August 2022 showing overdraft interest of 
£17.43 for the old account ending (1117). I have also seen a bank statement for his 
old account for the period from 2 July 2022 to 2 August 2022. This shows the 
account was overdrawn by around £183 at the start of the month and further regular 
payments left the account reducing the overdraft balance to around £1,183.93. 
I have also seen copy bank statements for the new account for the period from 14 
July 2022 to 14 August 2022. This shows a pension payment of £163.11 received on 
22 July 2022 and around £1600 on 28 July 2022. There is also a payment from the 
new to the old account on 12 August to clear the overdraft on it.
Based on the evidence presented I cannot see that continuing to make a payment into the 
old account ending 1117 could have caused it to move into overdraft. I say that because the 
continued payments to the old account were increasing the balance on that account and not 
reducing it, so would not have caused it to move into an overdraft position.
However if Mr B didnt update his regular bank outgoings after the much larger pension of 
over £1,000 was moved to his new bank account, (which seems to have happened in April), 
I can see that this could have resulted in him becoming overdrawn. I say that as the amount 
coming into the old account ending 1117 would have been lower due to the absence of the 
much larger pension payment made by the other pension scheme. 
I have already found that SW was not responsible for that larger pension payment of around 
£1,000. Further it is up to Mr B to manage his bank account and any outgoings made from it.
So for all those reasons I dont have evidence to show that SW is responsible for the 
overdraft charges on Mr Bs old account.  
For all those reasons I am not upholding this complaint.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. I think that Scottish Widows Limited has behaved in a fair and 
reasonable manner. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 June 2023.
