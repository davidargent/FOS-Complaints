The complaint
Mrs M complains about the amount that shes been charged by Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, for damage to a car that she 
returned at the end of her hire purchase agreement.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mrs M under a hire purchase agreement with Mercedes-Benz 
Finance that she signed in December 2017. The car was collected from her when the 
agreement ended in December 2020 by a third party on behalf of Mercedes-Benz Finance. 
The car was inspected and the inspection report says that a second inspection was required.
The car was inspected again 17 days later and damage was identified and a total charge of 
£1,048.88 was recommended. Mercedes-Benz Finance charged that amount to Mrs M but 
she complained to it about the charges. It said that the damage was evident and outside of 
its vehicle return standards which had been provided to Mrs M at the start of the agreement 
and six months prior to her lease end date. It said that its prices are benchmarked against 
industry standard guidelines and would stand up to independent scrutiny. 
Mrs M wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. She says that she 
returned the car in excellent condition and it was inspected by a qualified person who signed 
it off as not having any damage. She says that the car was then taken away to an unsecure 
location for a few days before a the second inspection and she doesnt take responsibility for 
damage that occurred after the car left her.
Our investigator recommended that Mrs Ms complaint should be upheld in part. She said 
that Mercedes-Benz Finance had charged Mrs M for two replacement tyres due to their 
speed rating but hadnt provided the information about the tyres that shed requested so she 
thought that it should remove those charges. She was satisfied that the other charges had 
been applied as per the relevant guidelines so Mercedes-Benz Finance can fairly charge for 
it.
Neither Mrs M nor Mercedes-Benz Finance has responded to those recommendations so 
Ive been asked to issue a decision on this complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in the hire purchase agreement that Mrs M had signed shed agreed that she would 
pay the reasonable expenses incurred by Mercedes-Benz Finance if she breached 
the requirements relating to the condition of the car on return and the agreement 
included the vehicle return standards;
the vehicle return standards say: When it is time to return your vehicle  you must 
return the vehicle in line with the Vehicle Return Standards  When the vehicle is 
returned to us a Vehicle Return Standard Inspection will be carried out by trained 
technicians at the nominated Defleet Centre. The vehicle must be: free from any 
broken or damaged items ; free from any defects or condition that would be in 
breach of statutory requirements; free from accident damage; and in good, clean and 
marketable condition  the standards then explain what would be acceptable and 
unacceptable;
the car was collected from Mrs M in December 2020 by a third party on behalf of 
Mercedes-Benz Finance, it inspected the car and a vehicle condition report was 
completed  the cars mileage was recorded as 23,140 miles and the report said that 
it was dark and wet and that a second inspection was required;
a second inspection took place 17 days later at the third partys inspection compound 
and a second vehicle condition report was completed  it recorded the cars mileage 
as 23,283 (so 143 miles more than when the car was collected from Mrs M) and the 
following issues were identified: three damaged wheels (with a refurbishment cost of 
£110 each), two tyres with an incorrect speed rating (with a replacement cost of 
£149.22 each) and two scratched bumpers (with a refinishing cost of £210 each);
the report includes photos and a video of the car which show the damage and I 
consider that the damage to the wheels and bumpers was unacceptable damage 
under the vehicle return standards and was more than would reasonably be 
considered to be fair wear and tear;
Mrs M says that the car was in excellent condition when it was collected from her, it 
was inspected by a qualified person who signed it off as not having any damage and 
that she doesnt take responsibility for damage that occurred after that;
the first inspection took place when it was dark and wet and the inspection report 
said that a second inspection was required  having looked at the photos of the 
damage I dont consider it to be unreasonable that the damage wasnt identified at 
that time and I consider that it was fair and reasonable for the car to be inspected 
again;
Mercedes-Benz Finance has provided an explanation of what happened to the car in 
the 17 days between the two inspections  and it was driven for 143 miles in that 
time;
I dont consider it to be likely that the damage was caused between the two 
inspections and I consider it to be more likely than not that the damage was caused 
during the time that Mrs M had the car and drove 23,140 miles in it;
the vehicle return standards say that the tyres:  must conform to the original 
specification of the vehicle. It must have matching tyres (of a size and premium 
brand, approved by the manufacturer) on each axle;
the second inspection report said that two of the tyres had an incorrect speed rating 
and Mercedes-Benz Finance has been asked to provide further information about the 
need to replace those two tyres but hasnt provided that information;
Im not persuaded that its fair or reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Finance to charge 
Mrs M for two replacement tyres in these circumstances so I find that it should 
reduce the amount that its charged her by £298.44; and
other than the charge for replacing the two tyres, Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that that Mercedes-Benz Finance has acted incorrectly and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it make any other reductions to the charges, to pay her any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to her complaint. 
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Finance to reduce the amount 
that its charged Mrs M for damage to the car by £298.44 to remove the charge for the two 
replacement tyres.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Ms complaint in part and I order Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, to reduce the amount that its 
charged Mrs M for damage to the car by £298.44.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 March 2022.
