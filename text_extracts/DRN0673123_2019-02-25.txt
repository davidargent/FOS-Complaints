K820x#14complaint
Mrs A says Lloyds Bank PLC (trading at the time as Lloyds  TSB) mis-sold her a payment 
protection insurance (PPI)  policy. Ill refer to the business as Lloyds in my decision.  
background and summary to complaint
Mrs A bought the policy in 2000  at the same time as taking out a credit  card.  She applied for 
the credit  card and PPI policy  in branch. 
Based on the credit  card application, Mrs A was employed as a packer. She has told us she 
was not entitled to any sick pay and didnt have any other means  of repaying her credit  card 
should she be unable  to work.  Mrs A has said she was in good  health at the time of the sale. 
Based on the nearest relevant policy document which Lloyds has shown us, the policy 
provided cover for accident, sickness, and unemployment  subject  to its exclusions and 
limitations. The policy also provided  life cover.  It offered to repay 5% of Mrs As credit card 
balance in the event of a successful claim accident,  sickness or unemployment claim and 
wouldve cleared  the remaining claim balance at 12 months. 
For a successful claim on the life cover, the outstanding balance  would have  been  paid off    
- up to a maximum of £10,000. 
Lloyds cant confirm the exact  cost,  but it cost no more  than 79p per £100 of the monthly 
outstanding balance. The premium would continue to have to be paid during a successful 
claim and it did attract  interest.  
Lloyds has sent us statements to show that the credit card account closed in November 
2006.
Mrs As representative has made  lengthy and substantial representations  on her behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have  read and considered  them all carefully. In 
summary, Mrs As representative says:
Lloyds failed to meet the sales standards which applied at the time.  In those 
circumstances, applying  the regulators rules and guidance for businesses  on 
handling PPI complaints  under  DISP  App 3, it should be presumed Mrs A wouldnt 
have taken out the policy and the complaint should be upheld.  Mrs As 
representatives believe there to be no evidence to rebut that presumption;
The policy excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress,  which  are some  of the 
most common reasons people  are off work. This significantly reduced  the value of 
cover;
The true costs including interest  and the fact it was unlikely you could make  a 
successful claim  meant the policy was of inherently poor value as shown by the low 
claims ratio. The common law duty of utmost good  faith means Lloyds should have 
told Mrs A about the poor value;  
Ref: DRN06731232The common law duty of utmost good faith also means Lloyds should have explained 
the significance  of the exclusions  and limitations of cover  to Mrs A and the impact  
they would  have had on her chances  of making  a claim; and
The information Mrs A received was misleading.  These policies were promoted  as 
providing peace of mind, but the number of exclusions and limitations on the scope of 
the cover  meant this was untrue. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint  both parties have seen and provided their 
responses to the adjudicators opinion. Mrs A disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  for 
several reasons.  
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
relevant considerations 
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, I am required to take into account: relevant 
law and regulations;  relevant  regulators  rules,  guidance and standards; relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published  some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mrs As. I dont intend to set that out in 
much detail here but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs As complaint.
This sale took place  in 2000 before the sale of general insurance products like this became 
regulated by the FSA in January 2005.  So the FSAs and the FCAs overarching principles 
for businesses and insurance  conduct rules (ICOB and ICOBS) are not applicable to this 
complaint; nor is the FCAs Perimeter Guidance (PERG). 
The credit agreement itself concluded  in 2006. That means the unfair relationship  provisions 
set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme Court judgement in Plevin about 
s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance made by the FCA about the handling  of 
complaints about  the non-disclosure of commission  in light of the Plevin  judgement, arent 
applicable. 
There were a number of industry codes in existence  at that time, which I am satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. In particular,  The General Insurance Standards Councils General Insurance 
Code for private  customers   the GISC Code. 
This sale was made during a period  of industry  self-regulation by the General Insurance 
Standards Council (GISC).  It published the GISC Code, which  set out minimum standards  of 
good practice for its members to follow when selling  insurance, including  PPI. 
Ref: DRN06731233The Association of British Insurers (ABI) also published a number of codes, which  I consider 
to be indicative of the standards of good industry practice expected from intermediaries, like 
Lloyds, selling insurance at this time:
The Association of British Insurers General Insurance Business Code of Practice for 
all intermediaries (Including  Employees of Insurance  Companies) other  than 
Registered Insurance Brokers  The ABI Code. 
The ABI Code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement  of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries  
While not all intermediaries  who sold PPI at the time were a member of the ABI or GISC,      
I consider these publications to be indicative of the standards of good practice expected  of 
intermediaries like Lloyds  at the time. So Im satisfied I should take these codes into account 
when deciding, what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in the circumstances of Mrs As 
case.
I have also taken account of relevant law in reaching  my decision, including: the law relating 
to negligence, contract (including the express and implied duty on professional  advisers to 
give advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence; the law relating to the utmost duty of 
good faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness).  
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001,  I am also required to take into account what  
determination the relevant former  scheme   in this case the Office of the Banking  
Ombudsman  might have been expected  to reach  in relation to an equivalent complaint.      
I note that under the Banking  Ombudsmans terms of reference  the Ombudsman  was 
required to decide  complaints by reference  to what was, in his opinion,  fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances   and that the Ombudsman was required to observe any applicable 
rule of law or relevant judicial authority. 
I am also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out in DISP App 3, first 
issued by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating to the 
sale of PPI. This sale took place before insurance mediation became a regulated  activity,  so 
Lloyds was required to take into account the provisions in DISP  App 3 as if they were 
guidance when  considering Mrs As complaint. 
key questions  
Taking the relevant considerations into account,  it seems to me that the key questions I need  
to consider in deciding  what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all circumstances of this 
complaint, are:
-If Lloyds gave advice,  whether  it advised Mrs A with reasonable care and skill  in 
particular, whether the policy  was appropriate  or suitable for her, given her needs 
and circumstances.  
Ref: DRN06731234-Whether Lloyds gave Mrs A sufficient,  appropriate and timely information to enable 
her to make an informed choice about  whether to take out the policy,  including  
drawing to her attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading  way  
the main provisions of the policy and significant  limitations and exclusions.  
-If, having considered  these questions,  I determine the complaint in favour of Mrs A,   
I must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Mrs A suffered loss or 
damage and what  I consider would amount to fair compensation for that loss or 
damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Mrs A and 
Lloyds, Ive decided  not to uphold  Mrs As complaint. Ive set out my reasoning below. 
did Mrs A know she had a choice?
Lloyds had to make it clear that the PPI policy was optional. Taking everything into account,    
I think its more likely than not that Mrs A knew the policy was optional  and she agreed to 
take it out without  undue pressure. 
Ive seen a copy  of Mrs As credit  card application, it had a section with the heading Optional 
Features. In this section there were options for a number of different products and services. 
The first of these options was for PPI. PPI was described as Asset Payment Protection on 
the form.
Below this there was a Yes option if PPI was required and a No option  if PPI wasnt  
required. A tick has been placed next to the Yes  option and Mrs A has signed the overall 
form.
did Lloyds provide  advice?
Both Lloyds  and Mrs A agree that advice was provided during this sale.  
This means  Lloyds had to advise Mrs A with reasonable care and skill, in particular whether 
the policy was appropriate or suitable given her needs and circumstances.
the advice
I dont know what steps Lloyds took to establish whether the policy  was a suitable 
recommendation for Mrs A. It seems Mrs A cant remember clearly what  happened and there 
is no record of what the adviser discussed  in relation to the policy. This is unsurprising  in 
respect of a sale during a meeting. The adviser  had some limited information  about Mrs As 
financial circumstances, but there  is no specific evidence to show  the adviser took steps to 
establish whether  Mrs A would have been caught  by the significant exclusions and 
limitations which might have meant the policy did not fully meet her needs. For example, 
there is nothing to suggest  Lloyds considered whether Mrs A had any pre-existing medical  
conditions.
Overall, on the balance of probabilities, Im not persuaded that Lloyds did all it should have 
done to determine whether the policy was suitable for Mrs A given her circumstances. So Im 
not persuaded Lloyds advised with reasonable  care and skill.
Ref: DRN06731235While Im not persuaded Lloyds did all it should  have done  to make sure the policy was 
suitable for Mrs A, I do think  its more likely  than not that the policy  was ultimately  suitable  for 
her. In reaching  that conclusion  Ive taken into consideration:
-Mrs A met the eligibility criteria for the policy.
-Mrs A had a need for the policy   it seems likely that Mrs As ability to continue to 
meet her credit card repayments would  have been put under strain if she wasnt 
working for an extended period  of time  particularly as Mrs A has said that she didnt  
have any other  means for making  her repayments if she was unwell and unable to 
work or if she became unemployed.
 
-The monthly cost of the policy appears  to have  been affordable for Mrs A.
-The exclusions and limitations didnt make the policy unsuitable  for Mrs A. There  was 
nothing about  Mrs As employment or occupation  which  would have made it difficult  
for her to claim . And she hasnt told us about any pre-existing medical  conditions  that 
could affect her ability to claim. There were  also no additional restrictions on cover for 
mental health or back problems.
-While  the policy would  only pay benefits  for a maximum of 12 months for each claim 
for disability, unemployment or hospitalisation, it still provided useful cover  given   
Mrs As circumstances and the fact the policy could have cleared her outstanding 
card balance.
Ive also considered whether, when providing  advice,  Lloyds  gave Mrs A sufficient 
information about the cover provided by the policy to enable her to understand what  Lloyds 
was recommending to her and make an informed decision  about  whether to follow that 
advice and take out the policy.
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not Mrs A was given a very broad  description of what the 
policy was intended  to cover (that is, that the policy would protect her card payments in the 
event she was unable  to work through disability or unemployment). Ive reached this 
conclusion because I think  Mrs A would have been told this  at the very least   during the 
discussion with the adviser. 
I think its unlikely Mrs A would have taken out the policy without any sense of what the 
policy was. The application  form she signed also described the policy  as Asset Payment 
Protection, and stated For the additional  peace of mind  of knowing you can continue to 
meet your minimum  credit  card payments even if you cant work  due to accident, sickness or 
unemployment you can take out Asset Payment  Protection which would  have given her 
some idea of what the policy was for.
Im also satisfied Mrs A would have realised  the policy wasnt free and its likely she would  
have had some understanding of how much the policy cost before  agreeing  to take it out.
But the evidence  from the time of the sale doesnt  tell us whether Lloyds gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit, the actual cost (the fact that the premiums  
would be added to the account balance, attracting interest if unpaid  at the end of the month, 
and were payable  during  a claim) or about  the exclusions  and limitations, before Mrs A 
Ref: DRN06731236agreed to take out the policy. Even if that information were in a leaflet or policy summary that 
Mrs A might have been given, I think its more likely than not that she based her decision on 
the things she was told, rather than on anything she was given.
Overall, having considered the parties  representations about what  happened,  while Im 
satisfied the policy was a suitable recommendation for Mrs A Im not persuaded Lloyds did 
enough to present information about the policy it was recommending in a way that was fair 
and reasonable to Mrs A. Im not persuaded that Lloyds gave Mrs A all of the information 
she needed about the policy to make an informed decision about whether to follow  the 
recommendation and take out the policy.
Ive considered how my findings interact  with the FCAs  list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling  PPI complaints  set out in DISP  App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, Im persuaded that there were significant failings in this case.
In addition to the failings  Ive highlighted above,  Mrs As representative has raised a number  
of general points in regards  to the requirements on a business when providing information  in 
PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like Mrs As. Ive considered 
these carefully and summarised them  as:
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Mrs As representative considers  to be poor 
value  and the fact that much of the premium went  to the business  rather than the 
insurer. 
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  shouldnt have just 
told Mrs A about the limitations and exclusions, it should have gone  further  and 
explained the significance of them to her. 
Im not persuaded by Mrs As representatives  views on this. The duty of utmost good faith in 
insurance law imposed a duty on both parties  to the contract  to disclose material facts  and 
not to make  material misrepresentations. While I cant be certain what  a court  would say     
I think its unlikely a court would find that this extended to the insurer  having  to disclose the 
claims ratio information or explaining  the significance of the limitations and exclusions in the 
way Mrs A has suggested. And taking into account the law, industry codes and standards of 
good industry practice applicable to this complaint,  I dont think its fair and reasonable to 
conclude that Lloyds ought  to have done either. 
what effect did Lloyds  shortcomings have  on Mrs A? To what extent did Mrs A suffer  
loss or damage as a result?
Ive found that Lloyds  didnt do all it should have done when it sold this policy to Mrs A. So I 
have gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to conclude Mrs A 
suffered loss and damage as a result. To answer  this, I must decide  whether or not Mrs A 
would have still taken  out the policy, had Lloyds done things properly. 
While Im not persuaded that Lloyds took the steps  it should  have done to establish  whether 
the policy it recommended was suitable  for Mrs A, I have found  that the policy was ultimately 
suitable for her.
In those circumstances it seems to me that, whether  or not Mrs A has suffered loss or 
damage in this case primarily depends  on whether, if Lloyds had explained  things properly, 
Ref: DRN06731237Mrs A would have acted differently, or whether  she would have taken out the policy in any 
event.
Mrs A says she would  not have  taken it out and believes that I should  presume this to be the 
case given the significant failings identified  above. I have considered  the representations of 
both sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
Deciding whether  to follow advice to take out insurance requires the consumer to weigh up a 
number of factors before  deciding  whether to proceed. Effectively the consumer has to 
weigh up the advice to take out the policy, the cost of doing so given the benefits offered in 
return and the potential consequences they will suffer if they do not have insurance, should 
the risks come  to fruition.
The evidence in this case suggests that Mrs A had some interest in taking out payment 
protection insurance. By this I mean  when Lloyds  advised her that there was a suitable  
product she could buy that would protect  her credit card payments in the event she was 
unable to work because of accident, sickness and unemployment, she concluded  she 
wanted that product. But she made  that decision based on incomplete  information, meaning 
what she thought  she was getting is not exactly what  she got. 
As I explained earlier, Im satisfied from the evidence about  Mrs As circumstances at the 
time of the sale that the policy was not fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her. 
In relation to the costs, Im satisfied Mrs A ought  reasonably to have known  she would have 
to pay something for the PPI and that it would cover  a portion of her outstanding balance   
this was set out on the credit card application . But, I accept that Lloyds didnt  make  clear the 
on-going cost information. So while Mrs A didnt know  some things, the ultimate position in 
the event of a successful  claim was not dissimilar to what she would reasonably  have 
thought from the information she based  her decision  to take out the policy on and found  
acceptable. 
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mrs A thought she had bought and 
what she actually bought were the following:
During the 12 months after the start date, the policy excluded  claims relating to 
medical conditions  and/or  symptoms that Mrs A knew about or ought to have known  
about before  the start date of the policy or that shed  seen  or arranged to see a 
doctor about, during the 12 months immediately before the start date; 
The policy limited, and in some situations,  excluded unemployment  cover  if Mrs A 
wasnt a permanent employee.
When Mrs A turned  65 she wouldnt be covered for accident, sickness  or 
unemployment. 
I do accept that there is a possibility that the limitations and exclusions above might  well 
have caused Mrs A pause for thought  and may well have caused her to conclude  that the 
policy wasnt as good as she thought and she might have decided not to proceed.  The 
limitations on the cover, when coupled with the other shortcomings in this sale, might  have 
dissuaded some  consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mrs A from taking out 
the policy. 
But, the evidence  about Mrs As circumstances  at the time of sale shows that the policy  
wasnt fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her. She was eligible for its benefits and it 
Ref: DRN06731238provided cover that, despite its limitations  and exclusions, couldve proved  valuable to her 
should the insured risks have become a reality. I also havent seen any evidence to suggest 
she wouldve been caught by any of the significant  exclusions   Mrs A didnt  have any pre-
existing medical conditions and was in permanent employment. So, I still think she had some 
good reasons  to take the policy  out.
Ive also considered what Mrs A has said about her age at the time of sale,  but the policy  
would have covered her for accident,  sickness and unemployment until the age of 65  over 
11 years  after she took the policy out. I think its likely she would have thought  shed get 
some value out of having the PPI as it would cover her for a reasonable period of time. So I 
dont think that better  information about  this would have  changed  Mrs As decision about 
taking out the policy.  
The policy also didnt exclude back or mental health  conditions, or place any additional 
restrictions or more onerous  evidential  requirements in the event of a claim on those 
grounds than would have applied to any other  disability claim. And I think its unlikely Mrs A 
would have expected to make a disability claim on the policy  without first providing some 
evidence to support  that claim.  
To make a disability claim, Mrs A needed  to be totally unable to do her normal job and not 
be doing any other work. I dont think this is likely to be too different to what  she would have 
expected to make a claim. After  all, the credit  card application form says the policy  provides  
cover if you cant  work due to accident, sickness or unemployment. So it seems unlikely 
she would  have thought shed been able to make  a successful claim if she was still working, 
whether that be in her normal job or any other job.
 
Having considered all of the evidence  and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not that Mrs A would  still have taken out the PPI. The policy was sufficiently close  to 
what she thought  she was getting and she didnt have any means of meeting her credit card 
repayments if she was unable to work due to accident or sickness and, she thought,  
redundancy. And in those circumstances I consider it more likely than not that she would 
have taken out the policy in any event.  
Mrs As representatives say the rules about how to handle PPI complaints (DISP App 3) 
make it clear  that, where  a significant  failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have  taken out PPI, unless  there  is evidence  to outweigh  the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms,  but it is a relevant  consideration  so I take it into account along 
with many other things  when I decide  what is in my opinion  fair and reasonable. Considering  
the purpose of the guidance, I dont  think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken.  
I have thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, I have found  it would be reasonable to conclude  there  
were substantial flaws  in the sales  process.  In those  circumstances, DISP App 3 says it 
should be presumed Mrs A would not have bought the PPI she bought  unless, in the 
particular circumstances  of the complaint, there is evidence to rebut the presumption. 
I am satisfied, applying DISP App 3, it is reasonable to conclude  the presumption  is rebutted 
in the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account Mrs As 
circumstances as detailed  above, I consider it reasonable to conclude  the position  Mrs A 
Ref: DRN06731239found herself in as result of the sale was the same  position she would have been in had the 
breach or significant failings not occurred. 
Mrs A believes the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws  in the sales process 
were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were  highly material and we have failed to give 
proper weight to the evidence  including her own comments  that she would not have taken 
out the policy. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance  for firms  set out in DISP App 3 (which  I 
dont consider I am), I am only doing so because  I do not consider, in this case,  that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Mrs A in the position she would have been in if she had 
not bought the policy.  
That is because,  while I accept its possible she wouldnt have taken out the policy, Im 
satisfied that of the two possibilities, its more likely than not that she would  still have taken 
out the PPI had she been given clear,  fair and not misleading information about the policy 
she was buying.  So Im not persuaded it would be fair and reasonable in those 
circumstances, to conclude Lloyds should pay Mrs A compensation, as that would put her in 
a better  position than she would have been in if everything had happened  as it should have 
done. 
Im also aware that Mrs A thinks Lloyds misrepresented  the terms of the policy in how it 
described the PPI. While I accept there is a possibility a court  might  conclude some of 
Lloyds statements misrepresented the contract,  in my opinion  the reason why Lloyds failed 
to act fairly  and reasonably was not because of what it did or didnt say in the information it 
provided  but because  the overall information  Lloyds gave Mrs A, in the way it did, was 
insufficient to meet  the standards I consider it fair and reasonable to expect it to have met in 
2000 when providing information  about an insurance  policy.  
Ive also thought about the approach Mrs As representative says a court might take if it were 
to find Lloyds negligently misrepresented the contract to Mrs A and about the remedy  a court  
might award if it were  to find that Lloyds had been in breach of its duty of utmost good  faith.  
But this doesnt  persuade  me to alter my conclusions about what  is fair and reasonable in all 
the circumstances of the complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the 
circumstances of this case.  
For the reasons  Ive already set out I dont  think  it would  be fair and reasonable to put Mrs A 
in a better position  than if everything had happened as it should  have done. 
my decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 March  2019.
