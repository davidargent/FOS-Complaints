The complaint
Mr M complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) wont refund the money he lost to a scam. 
What happened
The background to this complaint is well-known to both parties, so I wont repeat it in detail 
here. But in summary, Mr M fell victim to an investment scam by a company Ill refer to as C. 
He found them promoted online in late 2017. He spoke to a broker who offered him a bonus 
for his initial deposit and persuaded him to open a managed account with them. His 
understanding was that C would be trading for him, primarily in cryptocurrency. He says C 
also told him they were regulated, and that hed be able to withdraw funds from the account.  
With the account appearing to be making good returns, and with C offering him bonuses and 
encouraging him to invest more, Mr M was persuaded to keep depositing funds. He made 
the following payments to C from his HSBC credit card:
Date Amount
9 October 2017 £383.87(Transaction fee £11.48)
13 October 2017 £1,887.18(Transaction fee £56.43)

In early 2018, he wanted to withdraw some funds  and was told that, subject to a 
commission fee, this wouldnt be an issue. But then his withdrawal request (for $1,000, much 
less than the amount showing in his account) was declined. C said this was due to the 
bonuses paid into his account. And that he couldnt withdraw any funds until reaching a 
trading volume 40 times the bonuses applied. When he tried to query this with his account 
manager, they evaded him, claiming there was an issue with the phones, then that they were 
unwell. Mr M looked into C further and found out that, despite their claim, they werent 
regulated by the FCA. He then reported the scam to HSBC. It attempted to raise chargeback 
claims on some payments, but says it couldnt pursue these successfully as C defended the 
claim and Mr M couldnt provide the specific information required. 
Our investigator upheld the complaint. She concluded that HSBC should refund the credit 
card payments as it was liable for these under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
And while she didnt think HSBC would have been able to raise a successful chargeback 
claim for the remaining payments, she thought it should have prevented some of these  so 
recommended that it should refund Mr M from his third debit card payment.  
Mr M has accepted the investigators view, but HSBC disagrees. In summary, it says:
Its unfair to expect it to have contacted Mr M about the payments. And even if it had, 
it disputes that this wouldve prevented the scam.
There are some contradictions and/or a lack of clarity about some aspects of the 
scam. Such as whether Mr M was told he could withdraw funds initially, or after a 
few months.
Mr M was negligent in researching C and so should bear some of the loss.
Theres not a specific enough misrepresentation to show that its liable under a 
Section 75 claim.
The 8% interest rate applied for when Mr M was out of pocket is unfair. 
It also disputes that it could have raised successful chargeback claims. However, the 
investigator didnt uphold the complaint on this basis. 
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been escalated to me to determine. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold it for these reasons:The debit card payments
Its accepted that Mr M fell victim to a scam. Its also accepted that he authorised 
these payments. In line with the Payment Services Regulations, HSBC has a duty to 
execute authorised payment instructions without undue delay. So even though Mr M 
was duped into making the payments, the starting position is that he's liable.
But there are some situations where we believe that banks ought to have identified a 
potential fraud risk, so should have looked at the wider circumstances surrounding 
the transaction before making the payment. If they failed to do so, and that failure led 
to a fraudulent loss for their consumer, it may be fair to hold them liable. 
Although HSBC considers that too high a standard has been applied in this respect, 
we have a duty to resolve complaints based on what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in all the circumstances, taking into account not just the law, but also 
regulators' rules and guidance, relevant codes of practice and what we consider to 
have been good industry practice at the time. In line with this, I consider it reasonably 
to expect that HSBC should have measures in place to identify, and respond to, 
signs of possible fraud. Such as uncharacteristic account activity. 
In line with Mr Ms account use, I dont consider the first two payments to have been 
so unusual that HSBC should have identified a fraud risk. But by the time of his third 
payment on 10 October 2017, a suspicious and uncharacteristic pattern of account 
activity had emerged. Hed made three international payments to a new payee in 
quick succession, totalling over £7,000. This was out of keeping with how he 
generally used his current account and debit card. So Ive considered what would 
have happened if HSBC had responded proportionately to the fraud risk, such as by 
questioning him about the payment. 
Given the prevalence of investment scams, especially involving companies claiming 
to be dealing with these types of high-risk investments, HSBC could have warned 
Mr M about the features of these scams, and guided him on what to check to satisfy 
himself on whether C were legitimate. Despite their claims, they werent regulated. 
Nor were they registered with the Gambling Commission, despite branding 
themselves a CFD company. 
Ive no reason to doubt that Mr M, who wasnt an experienced investigator, would 
have heeded such a warning from his bank about the risks of these scams and/or 
wouldve followed further guidance on what he should check. I think this wouldve 
uncovered the scam as it would have alerted him to indications that C werent 
legitimate. Such as their deception about being regulated. And so, but for HSBCs 
failure to intervene appropriately, I consider it likely that all but the first two debit card 
payments could have been prevented. Its therefore fair to hold it liable for this loss.
Despite HSBCs queries and allegations about Mr Ms lack of research, Im conscious 
he didnt reasonably have the same level of knowledge about these types of scams 
as the bank. He was persuaded by the sophisticated nature of the scam, such as the 
contact with the alleged broker plus the professional-looking website and trading 
platform. I therefore dont consider him partly to blame by way of contributory 
negligence. Rather, I think he simply didnt foresee the risk this was a scam until he 
was reasonably alerted to this by Cs response to his withdrawal request. 
Ive also considered if the first two payments could have been recovered through the 
voluntary chargeback scheme. Under the relevant rules in force at the time, in order 
to claim successfully, Mr M would have needed written evidence of C guaranteeing 
an amount of profit or return he was due to receive. As he didnt have this, I dont 
think HSBC could reasonably have been expected to pursue a chargeback claim 
further. Its unlikely this would have recovered his loss.The credit card payments
Looking solely at the credit card account activity, I dont consider the payments to C 
so unusual that HSBC should have intervened. Regardless, I consider it liable for 
these payments under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
I cant see this is in dispute, but in broad summary, Im satisfied Section 75 is a 
relevant consideration here as:
oTheres a debtor-creditor-supplier agreement falling under Section 75. Mr M is 
the debtor, HSBC the creditor, and C the supplier (as shown on the 
statements);
oThe transactions were financed by Mr Ms credit card agreement with HSBC 
(the deposit-transactions); and
oHis claim doesnt relate to a single item to which the seller has attached a 
cash price of less than £100 or more than £30,000
In line with this, Mr M has a valid claim of misrepresentation against HSBC if it can 
be shown that C made a false statement of fact which induced him into entering into 
an agreement. On balance, Im satisfied this is the case for the deposits he made. 
The FCA went on to publish a warning that C were operating without being properly 
regulated. Thats a sign it was operating with dishonest intentions. This is also 
backed up by what Mr M has told us about how they operated (such as evading his 
requests for contact after rejecting his withdrawal request) and other information 
online. In my view, this adds credibility to what Mr M has told us that C 
misrepresented itself to him, such as by claiming to be regulated. 
Likewise, I accept that Mr M was likely told by C that hed be able to withdraw his 
funds. I appreciate HSBCs point about whether hed be able to do so immediately, or 
after a few months. But he wasnt able to do either. Overall, it seems credible and 
likely Mr M was led to believe he could access and withdraw funds from the account 
he held with C with relative ease, and wasnt told hed need to reach any particular 
trading volume if any bonuses were paid (as they were from the first transaction). 
Given the bonuses applied, in line with the term C applied, Mr M would have needed 
to reach a trading volume of over $1,600,000 before he could make any withdrawals.  
Overall, Im persuaded C misrepresented themselves as running a genuine, 
regulated trading platform through which Mr M had the opportunity to make money  
which hed then be able to access. Whereas they were likely running a scam 
intended to relieve him of his funds. And Im persuaded that, if Mr M had known this, 
he wouldnt have deposited any money with them. As such, he was induced into the 
contract on the basis of these misrepresentations.
If the deposit-transactions hadnt been made, the transaction fees wouldnt have 
been incurred. So these were a direct consequence of the deposit-transactions. And 
it was also foreseeable that such fees would be charged for converting the payments. 
So Im satisfied these are a consequential loss of the misrepresentation. That means 
HSBC is therefore liable for these, and for the deposits he made to C. Mr M wouldnt 
be entitled to any more than this through a breach of contract claim. 
Interest rate
On most occasions when Mr M paid C using his debit card, he transferred funds from 
other accounts shortly beforehand. Hes confirmed these funds were effectively 
savings. So I accept that the account interest rate from the originating accounts, 
rather than 8% simple interest, is the fair rate to apply to these.This applies to all the debit card payments, aside from those on 13 November 2017. 
Mr M transferred in £1,600 from other accounts shortly beforehand. But the 
payments to C that day significantly exceeded this. The remainder came from his 
current account. Im mindful hed received a £15,000 loan payment just over a week 
before, most of which remained in his account. Mr M has explained he took out the 
lending for another purpose, but he didnt need all the money immediately, so he 
simply used his used the funds in his current account. In the circumstances, aside 
from the initial £1,600, I consider 8% simple interest to be fair  as it reflects money 
he was out of pocket for due to the scam. 
For the credit card payments, in line with our general approach for when consumers 
are deprived of funds, Im satisfied 8% simple interest for any sums repaid. 
Putting things right
HSBC UK Bank Plc should refund Mr M all the credit card payments made to C, as 
listed above. And it should rework the account so that any interest or charges caused 
by those payments are refunded. It should also pay 8% simple interest on an any 
sums repaid towards the credit card balance arising from those payments, from the 
date they were repaid to the date of settlement (less any tax properly deductible);
It should also refund Mr M the debit card payments Ive listed  and their associated 
transaction fees  from his third payment to C (on 10 October 2017) onwards. It 
should also pay interest from the dates of payment to the date of settlement at the 
following rates. For the payments on 10 October 2017, 16 October 2017, 19 October 
2017 and 1 February 2018, and for the first £1,600 paid on 13 November 2017, 
interest should be applied from the date of payment to the date of settlement at the 
account interest rate from the originating accounts. For the remaining amount paid on 
13 November 2017, 8% simple interest should be applied from the date of payment to 
the date of settlement. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I direct HSBC 
UK Bank Plc to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2022.
