K821x#15complaint
Mrs F is unhappy  National Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest) wont  allow her daughter,  Miss F, 
to be added as a third party on her account and wont  give her a clear explanation as to why. 
background
Mrs F added Miss F as a third party to her account in 2012  as she needed  assistance  with 
some banking activities due to her age and mobility. 
This arrangement continued until NatWest wrote to Mrs F on 12 November  2018  explaining 
they would  be removing Miss F as a third party  on her account.  
Miss F has explained Mrs F is now having difficulty managing her banking. Mrs F would like 
NatWest to explain why they removed Miss F as a third party and for them to add her back  
onto her account. 
When our investigator initially looked at the complaint NatWest agreed  to add Miss F back 
onto the account if she could obtain  a Power of Attorney (POA) to show  Mrs F has 
consented to Miss F managing her finances. Mrs F did this and paid for a POA to be drawn 
up by a solicitor.  
NatWest then explained it had made a mistake requesting this and maintained that they 
wouldnt be able to add Miss F as third party on Mrs Fs account. Because  of the incorrect  
information they gave to Mrs F, they offered to refund the cost of the POA. 
Our investigator subsequently  concluded  that NatWest hadnt  made  an error in not adding  
Miss F to Mrs Fs account as a third party.  He concluded they were  entitled to make this 
decision in line with the terms and conditions of the account. However,  he agreed that 
NatWest should  cover the cost of the POA and pay Mrs F £100  for the inconvenience she 
suffered in having to obtain  this unnecessarily.  
NatWest agreed with this recommendation,  but Mrs F didnt. So, she asked for the answer to 
be reviewed by an ombudsman. The complaint  has therefore been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, my review of the evidence  has led me to the same overall conclusions as 
the investigator previously  set out and for much the same reasons. 
NatWest has taken  the decision not to allow Miss F as a third party  on Mrs Fs account.  To a 
certain extent Mrs F is free to decide who she wishes  to add as a third party to her account.  
However, there are situations where  NatWest is entitled to refuse  an instruction by its 
customer under the terms and conditions of the account. NatWest has explained it has 
exercised this right on this occasion with Mrs Fs vulnerabilities in mind and to ensure her 
best interests are protected. Im satisfied with this explanation and that NatWest  has acted in 
line with the terms  and conditions and its legal  and regulatory obligations. I therefore dont 
believe it would be fair to ask NatWest  to add Miss F as a third party  to Mrs Fs account in 
these circumstances.  
Ref: DRN77286112It is unfortunate that NatWest initially agreed to add Miss F back  onto Mrs Fs account  if she 
obtained a POA. NatWest  shouldnt have  offered to do this without more  careful  
consideration of whether it was possible. It raised Mrs Fs hopes and caused  her 
unnecessary inconvenience in obtaining a POA for no reason.  NatWest has offered  to refund 
the cost of the POA and also agreed with the investigators recommendation to pay £100.  I 
think this is a fair resolution.    
Im sorry  to hear NatWests decision  not to allow Miss F as a third party  on Mrs Fs account 
is causing her difficulties. I understand this must be frustrating for Mrs F. Although Ive 
concluded NatWest  is entitled to decide who they allow to operate  an account, they must 
ensure Mrs F is not unduly prejudiced by its decision  especially as theyve recognised she 
is vulnerable. Im therefore  pleased to see NatWest has offered Mrs F several alternatives to 
help her manage her finances and banking and having  reviewed  these I find them  to be 
reasonable. Although this isnt what Mrs F wants, I think  NatWest  has ensured  she can still 
operate her account. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I uphold Mrs Fs complaint in part. I direct National 
Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mrs F the cost of obtaining the POA. Mrs F will need to provide 
an invoice detailing the cost in order for NatWest to carry  out the refund. In addition, they 
should pay Mrs F £100 for the inconvenience  she suffered in obtaining  the POA  
unnecessarily. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 April 2020.
