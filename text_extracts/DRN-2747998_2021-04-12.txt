The complaint
Mr C complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) found in favour of the buyer 
following a claim for non-receipt of goods. He wants the £1,300 he was paid to be returned. 
  
What happened
Mr C sold some goods through an online platform for £1,300 but used PayPal as the method 
for receiving payment. Mr C says the buyer arranged a courier to collect the goods. The 
buyer then opened a dispute through PayPal claiming the goods werent received. PayPal 
found the claim in the buyers favour.  
Mr C complained and PayPal said Mr C hadnt acted in line with their User Agreement by not 
sending the goods to the buyers shipping address shown on the transaction details page. 
They said Mr C didnt therefore meet the basic requirements for their PayPal Seller 
Protection and didnt uphold his complaint.  
Our investigator looked into things for Mr C. He thought PayPal hadnt acted fairly in 
deciding the claim against Mr C and felt they should refund the £1,300. Mr C agreed with the 
investigators view, but PayPal disagreed so the matter has come to me for a decision.  
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold the complaint. I think PayPal do need to refund 
£1,300 to Mr C and pay compensation. Ill explain why below. 
I understand disputes will often arise in online platforms designed for buying and selling 
goods. Its therefore important for PayPal, being a payment platform, to have policies in 
place to help resolve those disputes. PayPal does have such policies, but what Ive 
considered here is whether PayPal have applied their policy fairly when dealing with the 
claim. 
The information shows Mr C sold the goods on 8 February 2020 for £1,300. The buyer 
provides shipping information showing an address. On 19 February, the buyer files a dispute 
claiming he hasnt received the goods. PayPal find in the buyers favour and say, although 
Mr C is eligible for PayPal Seller Protection, he didnt meet the basic requirements. So, Ive 
looked into this in more detail and the sections of the policy which cover this. 
The PayPal Seller Protection section of the policy says, under the heading Basic 
requirements: 
You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in 
your PayPal account for the transaction. If you originally ship the item to the 
recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later 
redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection. 
We therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, 
so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.
Taking into account the Paypal Seller Protection policy, I agree Mr C hasnt acted in line with 
this as the information hes provided from the courier company shows he sent the goods to a 
different address than the one on PayPals transaction details page. While this is the case, 
Ive gone further to consider whether PayPal have acted fairly and reasonably in the 
circumstances of this case.
 
Theres a dispute here between Mr C and the buyer, with Mr C saying the goods have been 
delivered and the buyer saying they havent been received. Theres also a dispute about 
who arranged the collection of the goods. Once a dispute is open, PayPal say they let the 
parties communicate with each other to try and reach an agreement. I can see thats 
happened here and PayPal have provided notes dated 19 and 20 February which show Mr 
C informing the buyer that the goods have been sent. Mr C provides evidence showing the 
goods, the receipt from the courier company and a tracking update. The buyer maintains at 
this point they havent received the goods. I believe that was the case as the evidence 
shows the goods arent delivered until 24 February. The buyer then claims on 26 February 
that he hasnt received the goods. 
Ive already mentioned that Mr C didnt send the goods to the address on PayPals 
transaction details page  so I agree he hasnt complied with the terms of the PayPal Seller 
Protection policy. However, theres a range of evidence here which persuades me the buyer 
has received the goods. Firstly, Mr C has provided a receipt from the courier company which 
shows the goods were collected from him on 13 February. And, there were four items  
which is what I would expect given what the goods are. Theres a delivery address as well as 
a name for the intended recipient. Looking at these details, I can see the intended recipients 
name is the same as the buyer on PayPals records. Theres a delivery confirmation record 
from the courier company which shows the goods were delivered on 24 February and signed 
for by the buyer. So, the evidence here shows the goods which the buyer has paid for, have 
been delivered. 
  
Secondly, I can see PayPal have written to Mr C to confirm the buyer has received the 
goods. PayPal say, We have confirmation that the buyer has received the item or service. 
No further action is required on your part. Its not clear what PayPal have seen which leads 
to this communication being sent to Mr C, but I believe its reasonable to expect they must 
have received some confirmation. And, this confirmation must have come from the buyer. 
The final point which persuades me the buyer has received the goods relates to changes he 
makes to the nature of his claim. The timeline is important here. When the buyer first opens 
the dispute, the evidence shows he wont have received the goods  so he has 
understandably and correctly registered a dispute claiming the items havent been received. 
The buyer changes the reason to Significantly Not as Described on 20 February. Then, two 
days after the goods are delivered, the buyer changes the reason and claims the goods 
havent been received. Its not clear why the buyer changed the reason twice and I cant see 
PayPal have queried this with him. The significance here though is that a Significantly Not 
as Described claim relates to a dispute where a buyer claims theyve received the goods but 
its significantly different to what they ordered. The buyer wont have received the goods at 
the point he changes the reason on 20 February, but I feel its relevant that he changes the 
reason again two days after the goods are delivered. 
I feel PayPal shouldve queried why, for two days after the goods are delivered, the buyer 
believes they are different to what he ordered. This observation can only be made by a 
buyer if they have in fact received the goods. So, taking this all into account, I believe on the 
balance of probabilities, its more likely than not, the goods have been delivered to the buyer.   I can see another area of dispute between Mr C and the buyer relates to who arranged the 
collection by courier. The communication between the two parties through their PayPal 
accounts shows they claim the other was responsible for arranging the collection. The sale 
took place using an online sales platform and Mr C has provided exchanges in 
communication between him and the buyer which took place on that platform. And, this 
shows the buyer arranged the collection by courier. In one message to Mr C, the buyer says, 
Would you take £1300 if we were to arrange our own shipping?, to which Mr C replies Yes 
that will be fine, when would you like to have the [goods] collected? The buyer later sends a 
message saying he will get it sorted. From the information Ive seen, I think the buyer 
arranged the collection and I believe Mr C acted in good faith in sending the goods to the 
address given by the buyer rather than the address on the transaction details page. 
I can see PayPal disagree with our investigators view and point out Mr C hasnt complied 
with his obligations in the User Agreement. They say he hasnt sent the goods to the 
address on the transaction details page and hasnt provided proof of delivery to this address. 
As mentioned above, I dont dispute Mr C hasnt used the address on the transaction details 
page and I dont disagree he hasnt therefore acted in line with the relevant policy. But, in the 
circumstances of this case, I dont think its fair and reasonable to apply the narrow lens of 
the User Agreement alone. I say this because Ive seen clear evidence which I believe 
shows, on the balance of probabilities, that the buyer has received the goods. So, I think 
PayPal have acted unfairly in finding the claim in favour of the buyer and returning the 
£1,300 payment to him.   
I think its reasonable for PayPal to pay compensation to Mr C for the trouble and 
inconvenience caused to him. Hes been left upset and distressed at being without the funds 
and also his goods for over a year. And, I think £100 is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances.     
Putting things right
Ive taken the view that PayPal have acted unfairly in deciding the claim in the buyers favour 
and have been unreasonable in returning the £1,300 payment to him. So, PayPal should 
refund the £1,300 payment to Mr C for this transaction together with 8% interest per year 
simple from the date these funds were returned to the buyer, until theyre reimbursed. I think 
its reasonable for simple interest to be added to the refund amount as Mr C has been 
without these funds for this time. PayPal should also pay Mr C £100 compensation.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must: 
Refund £1,300 to Mr C together with simple interest on this amount at the rate of 8% 
a year* from the date the funds were returned to the buyer until the date of 
settlement; and 
Pay Mr C compensation of £100 for the trouble and inconvenience caused.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to take off tax from this 
interest. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax 
its taken off if he asks for one.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 May 2021.
