K822xComplaint
Mrs L says Elevate Credit  International  Limited  (trading as Sunny) offered her multiple loans 
without checking  if they were  affordable.   She also says that Sunny failed to identify that she 
had become stuck  in a cycle of borrowing.
background 
Mrs L took out a running credit facility and 17 instalment loans between  May 2014 and
August 2017.  A summary of Mrs Ls borrowing, based on the information provided to us by
Sunny, can be found in the appendix  at the end of this decision.
In our adjudicators findings, he thought the checks Sunny carried  out before granting  
Mrs Ls facility were  proportionate. But he thought the way Mrs L used her facility, should  
have caused Sunny concern. As a result, Sunny should have stopped  allowing Mrs L to 
drawdown from 15 October 2014  which was her 16th drawdown.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  was wrong  to approve Mrs Ls first five instalment loans 
(loans 2-6). But by loan 7, he thought Mrs Ls pattern  of lending suggested she couldnt 
sustainably repay  this loan or any subsequent loans. 
Sunny made an offer for loans 7-18 which was in-line with our adjudicators opinion. The 
offer was to refund the interest on these  loans along  with 8% simple interest and to amend 
Mrs Ls credit file.  But Sunny didnt  agree  with the adjudicators findings about  Mrs Ls 
running credit facility (loan 1) and it provided the following comments:
Sunny  checked  whether the loan amount requested was affordable;
The drawdowns granted were sustainable  as the credit  limit had not been  exceeded;
Mrs L was making regular repayments  and there  were no indicators in that respect to 
prove she was in financial difficulties.
Mrs L rejected Sunnys  offer.  As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been 
passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to reasonably 
conclude Mrs L could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN35009422the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ls complaint.
To begin with, Sunny  has already accepted that something may have gone wrong when 
loans 6-18 were given  to Mrs L. And Mrs L has accepted our adjudicators opinion about  the 
checks completed at the start of her RCF (loan 1) and loans 2-6 and that Sunny wasnt 
wrong to approve  them. So I have no reason to reach any findings  about these loans in this 
final decision. However, I have included these  loans in the section where  I direct  Sunny as to 
what it needs to do to put things right for Mrs L.
I think the dispute is about how Mrs L used  her running credit facility (loan 1) after it was 
approved. So decision will focus  on whether  Sunny did anything wrong after the facility  was 
granted.
The relevant  regulations  in place at the time Mrs L was given her RCF (loan 1)
When Mrs L took out her facility, Sunny  was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA). The consumer  credit sourcebook (section  6.7.2) says: a firm must monitor the 
customers repayment record  and take action where  there  are signs of actual or possible 
repayment difficulties. So Ive thought about whether Sunny did enough to monitor the 
Mrs Ls use of the facility.
Our adjudicator thought Sunny shouldve seen this by the time Mrs L applied  for her 16th 
drawdown on 15 October 2014. By this point,  our adjudicator thought  that Sunny would have 
seen that Mrs Ls borrowing history showed  she was potentially  reliant  on its facility.
I dont think Sunny shouldve had any concerns about the way Mrs L used her facility at the 
start of the relationship. Mrs L was generally  using her account in the way that Sunny 
intended it to be used. Whilst Mrs L was approved a facility with a £1,000 limit, the majority 
of the time she was only used a small amounts relative to what  she could have taken.
However, Mrs Ls borrowing started  to become more frequent  in August 2014. She made 
five drawdowns, borrowing a total of £225.  She made her contractual  repayments at the end 
of August  2014  and again on 10 September 2014  repaying £124.78 in total. But within five 
days, she had borrowed £125 which was around  the same  amount she had recently repaid.
Ref: DRN35009423A few days  later, Mrs L repaid £174.60  in total.  But within nine days,  she had requested  
further loans totalling £200. This suggests  she was struggling to meet the repayments  
without the need to keep  borrowing  the same amount  she repaid. Although Mrs L wasnt 
utilising the full credit limit she seemed  to be needing to borrow  around  the same  amount 
each month. 
Mrs L went on to repeat the same behaviour as before by repaying what she owed at the 
end of September 2014 and then requesting  around  the same  amount within  a few weeks.  
She repaid £206.99 at the end of September 2014  but by 15 October 2014, she had 
requested another £250.
By 15 October 2014, Mrs L had held her facility for five months.  Whilst she was not 
requesting her full credit  limit, this doesnt mean  that Mrs L wasnt struggling to repay  what 
she borrowed from Sunny.  What appears to have happened is that Mrs L was borrowing 
further from Sunny in order  to fill a hole in her finances that was made by making 
repayments to Sunny.  .
From 15 October 2014, I think Sunny should have stopped allowing Mrs L to drawdown on 
her credit facility but it didnt do this. So Im upholding Mrs Ls complaint about her running 
credit facility (loan 1) from 15 October 2014 until the facility closed.
And Ive already explained above why Im not considering the remaining  loans  in this 
decision. 
Putting things  right  what  Sunny needs to do
In addition to what Sunny has already  agreed  to do:
refund  all interest and charges Mrs L paid on drawdowns from 15 October 2014 until 
the facility closed as well as refund all interest and charges on loans 7-18;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  from Mrs Ls credit file about  her running credit  
facility from 15 October  2014 until the facility closed.
remove loans 7-18 from Mrs Ls credit file entirely. This is because the period of time
Mrs L owed Sunny money means  that any information still recorded about these 
loans is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mrs L a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN35009424My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mrs Ls complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  pay Mrs L compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or
reject my decision  before 7 June 2020.
