K820x#14complaint
Mrs K is unhappy because PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA  closed her account and placed 
a hold on her incoming funds in January  2018.
Mrs K is being represented by her husband,  Mr K. For ease, Ill just refer to Mrs K 
throughout.
background
Mrs K sells bespoke  products through a third party website  which uses  PayPal to process  
the payments.  In January  2018 PayPal wrote  to Mrs K informing her it was closing the 
account because  of security issues and that money will be held in her account for up to 180 
days to cover any future claims or chargebacks raised.
Mrs K complained to PayPal. She said that all items sold had been  despatched to customers  
within the stated  turn-around  times  and that the block on her account puts her business at 
risk of bankruptcy. 
PayPal didnt uphold  the complaint. It said it deemed  the risk associated  with her open  
account to be too great  first due to the proportion of claims made by customers for non-
receipt of items and secondly as PayPal  suspected  Mrs K was using the account to 
complete transactions on behalf  of her husbands business, whose account PayPal had 
previously closed. It said Mrs K could appeal any claims made for non-receipt of items  by 
providing evidence  that items were received by customers.
An investigator here looked into things  and didnt uphold the complaint. He didnt  think  that 
PayPal had acted  unfairly in applying its user terms in the way that it had. Mrs K remained 
unhappy and asked for an ombudsman to consider the matter. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and reasonable 
in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having  done so, Im not upholding this complaint. I 
appreciate Mrs K feels very strongly about this situation and will be disappointed by this 
outcome, but I hope my explanation helps her to understand why Ive reached  this decision. 
Ive read and considered the whole  file, but Ill concentrate my comments  on what I think  is
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on
board and think about it but because I dont think  I need  to comment on it in order  to reach
what I think is the right outcome.
The crux of this complaint is whether PayPal has applied its user terms fairly. So Ive thought 
about whether  it has.
Ref: DRN05228122Ive reviewed PayPals  User Agreement. Section 9 of the agreement  provides a list of 
restricted activities for how an account  should be used. The restricted  activities  include the 
following:
- cause PayPal to receive a disproportionate number of Claims that have been closed in 
favour of the claimant
- allow their account to have a balance reflecting an amount owing to PayPal;
- control an Account that is linked  to another Account that has engaged in any of these 
Restricted Activities
Section 10.4 of the agreement also says that PayPal can place a reserve  on funds in an 
account if it considers  there to be a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your 
Account. It says that if an account  is closed for any reason it can place a hold on this 
reserve for up to 180 days. 
PayPal has provided  evidence to show that Mrs Ks husband is corresponding directly  with 
customers on Mrs Ks account. Its also said that both their accounts on the third party  selling 
website are linked.  Mrs K has shown that her husband was advised by the third party 
website to use another PayPal account  in order  to fulfil orders.  I can therefore understand 
why Mrs K would be frustrated that PayPal has closed her account, in part, for this reason. 
However as this website  is a separate business  entity to PayPal,  I cant hold PayPal 
responsible for any advice  this other  company provided to Mrs K. If Mrs K is unhappy  with 
the advice she received  from that company, shell need to take this up with them.
PayPal has provided  evidence to show 34 disputes  from customers  have been raised with it 
either directly, through a third party website, or via an external chargeback  between  
October 2017 and April 2018.  All disputes  that were raised  directly  through PayPal related to 
the item not having been received. 
Mrs K says has said that the number of disputes suggested by PayPal is dishonest. Shes 
also said PayPals money back guarantee doesnt  cover bespoke items unless theyre not 
received  and that she can evidence that all items were received by customers. Shes said 
the items  she sells take 12 weeks from order to produce and that PayPal is refunding 
customers before this time has passed.
PayPal says its told Mrs K she can appeal any of the claims raised  and that no further 
evidence has been provided. Its also provided us with information that shows  
Mrs Ks customers were  raising complaints with them  after the agreed timeframe having  not 
received the product. 
Ive considered PayPals user agreement which says buyers  arent eligible for 
reimbursement for purchases of custom made items  unless they are claimed to be not 
received. All disputes raised  with PayPal directly were for non-receipt  of items. PayPal 
offered Mrs K the opportunity to provide evidence items were  received back  in May 2018, 
but nothing has been provided. 
Ref: DRN05228123Mrs K has also told our service on more than one occasion that she can provide evidence 
that items  were received  and that less disputes  have been  raised  against  her than 
suggested  but she hasnt provided  anything further to support this. Mrs K recently said 
again that she could provide evidence - but that she cant do this without more information  
about which customers the disputes  relate to. However, I think Mrs H has had ample  
opportunity to provide such evidence. 
And in the absence  of such evidence, I cant see that PayPal has incorrectly  taken account 
of customer disputes,  when taking the actions that it has.
Mrs K has also said the negative balance on her account is a direct  result of the hold placed 
on her account. From  what Ive seen,  the refunds issued by PayPal alone total more than the 
outstanding account balance  so I dont think the hold on Mrs Ks account is the sole reason 
for the outstanding balance. In any event,  I think PayPal  has acted within the terms of its 
agreement to off-set any risk by placing a hold on the account until future claims have first 
been covered.
So, from the evidence  Ive seen, Mrs Ks account did breach PayPals user agreement in 
relation to restricted activities. And I dont think its unfair or unreasonable for PayPal to have 
taken the action that it has, in line with its user agreement. 
Mrs K has questioned whether its fair for PayPal to apply the same rules to small 
businesses as it does  to large  corporate businesses. Its not my role to comment  in an 
abstract sense about whether PayPals user terms are fair for different size enterprises.  My 
role is to consider  whether the terms have been fairly and reasonably  applied  in a particular 
case. For the reasons Ive already given I dont think the terms have been unfairly or 
unreasonably applied here.  So Im not asking  it to do anything  further.
Finally, Mrs K has provided information that she says is law relevant to his case.  Ive 
reviewed this and can see it isnt law. Its a European Parliament petition. In any event, it 
doesnt change  my conclusions on this case.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 May 2019.
