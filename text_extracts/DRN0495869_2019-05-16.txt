Mr M complains that Stagemount Limited  (trading as Quidmarket)  did insufficient credit  and 
affordability checks before lending  to him.

16 20 Mar 2017 £200 25 Apr 2017 £257.60 Not yet repaid
Mr M says the loans trapped him into a debt spiral  and his living expenses were  such that he 
could not afford the repayments.  He says that after hed made the repayments he had to 
borrow again to get through the next month and his borrowing pattern should have indicated 
his debt problems  were getting worse.  Mr M says the lending was irresponsible.
Quidmarket says it asked  Mr M for information about  his income  and expenditure and 
checked his credit file before approving the loans.  It says that, although the loan amounts 
varied they did not tend to go up and there were breaks between loans. It says the credit 
reports showed no evidence of a debt problem  and it looked at Mr Ms bank statements to 
verify the information  hed provided  about  income  and expenditure.
Quidmarket confirms that, on 20 September 2017,  Mr M requested a chargeback on loans 
11 and 13, but that he explained that was a mistake  as he didnt  recognise  the transactions. 
That said,  it said Mr M hasnt made any payments towards those two outstanding amounts, 
or loan 16. It acknowledged that Mr M told it he was on a debt management plan and froze 
any additional interest and charges, but that £793.60 remains outstanding.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld in part. She was satisfied that 
Quidmarket did enough checks  for the first two loans, but considered the checks should  
have gone further for loans 3 to 6. However, as Mr M hadnt provided any bank  statements  
from the period,  she could  not say what such checks would have shown and, therefore  
couldnt recommend  Quidmarket  should  have done  anything differently.
Ref: DRN04958692As there was a significant  break before Mr M applied  for loan 7, our adjudicator said it was 
reasonable for Quidmarket to assume Mr Ms circumstances  had improved. So she 
considered the checks it did on loans 7 and 8 were  sufficient.  But, for loans 9 and 10, she 
wasnt satisfied the checks  went far enough. She thought  it should  have asked  Mr M about 
other short-term loans for these applications and carried out a full financial review for the 
subsequent loans. She said that, even though Mr M hadnt provided enough information with 
which to carry out such  a review, she found  that Quidmarket should  not have approved loans 
12 onwards.
Our adjudicator explained that ongoing lending was likely to be unsustainable as the 
purpose of such loans is to act as a short-term solution and Mr M had been  borrowing 
regularly for 9 months at the point of loan 12s application. She said the pattern of borrowing 
should have indicated that Mr M was using the loans to cover normal  living  expenses, rather  
than managing a temporary cash flow issue. She recommended it should  refund interest  and 
charges on loans 12 to 16 (plus  8% statutory interest) and remove  any associated negative  
entries from his credit  file.
Quidmarket responded  to say that Mr M had regular breaks in his lending and the assertion 
that he must  have been using the loans for household  expenses  was purely an opinion.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr M 
and to Quidmarket  on 12 April 2019.  I summarise my findings:
I was satisfied that it was reasonable for Quidmarket to consider the loans  as two 
separate chains:  loans 1 to 6 and loans 7 to 16;
For loans 1 to 4, I didnt think it wouldve been  proportionate to ask Mr M for the 
amount of information it needed  to show the lending was unsustainable, given the 
loan amounts and Mr Ms circumstances and history with Quidmarket;
For loans 5 and 6 I didnt seen anything  in the information provided which suggested 
Quidmarket wouldve known that Mr M wouldnt have been able to sustainably  make 
the repayments he needed  to for these  loans. And I was satisfied it was reasonable 
for Quidmarket to consider Mr Ms financial circumstances were improving given 
these loans were the smallest in the loan chain;
As loans  7 to 9 were the first in a new chain,  and the information Quidmarket had 
showed the repayments were affordable, I was satisfied there was nothing to indicate  
Quidmarket should have carried out further checks;
I thought Quidmarket should have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further 
loans by loan 10 because:
oFrom  loan 10 onwards  Mr M was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of 
settling a previous  one. So Quidmarket  ought to have realised it was more  
likely than not Mr M was having to borrow  further  to cover the hole repaying 
his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ms indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably;
oMr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Quidmarket. 
Loan 16 was taken out almost  two years after loan 7. And the amounts were 
not decreasing.  Mr M paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a 
debt to Quidmarket  over an extended period.
Ref: DRN04958693I considered that Mr M lost out because Quidmarket  continued to provide borrowing from 
loan 10 onwards because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time;
the sheer  number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ms ability  
to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost loans.
Subject to any further representations by Mr M or Quidmarket, my provisional decision was 
that Quidmarket should  refund all interest and charges (plus 8% statutory interest) on loans 
10 to 16 and remove al entries about them from Mr Ms credit file.
Mr M had no further information to add.
Quidmarket did not respond to the provisional  decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party provided any additional  information,  I see no reason to depart from the 
conclusions reached  in my provisional decision.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. Stagemount Limited (trading as 
Quidmarket) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr M paid on loans 10-16 (taking into account  the 
chargebacks on loans 11 and 13);
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*;
Write off any unpaid interest and charges on loans  11, 13 and 16, apply the refund to 
reduce any capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr M; 
the number of loans  taken from loan 10 onwards means any information recorded about  
them is adverse.  So all entries  about loans  10-16  should be removed from Mr Ms credit  
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Quidmarket  to take off tax from this interest. Quidmarket  
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one. If 
Quidmarket intends  to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance,  it must do 
so after deducting  the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 June  2019.
