The complaint
Mr and Mrs W complain that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) made mistakes 
related to payment for a landlord insurance policy.
What happened
The background of this complaint is well known to all parties. So, Ive summarised events.
Mr and Mrs W sought to pay for their landlord policy over the phone with their broker 
(Company A). NatWest declined the payment. And following some back and forth, 
the payment was subsequently made via BACS and the cover was kept in place.
Mr and Mrs W complained to NatWest, making a number of calls to try to find out 
what had gone wrong. 
NatWest said Company A was at fault in the way it had tried to process the payment 
related to recent changes in the Payment Service Directive (PSD). Specifically, it said 
credit card payments over a certain amount taken by companies require extra 
security to verify the payment. And in this instance the additional security wasnt met.
However, NatWest did apologise for not providing clear information around this and 
offered £150 in compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. In 
response to a separate complaint, Company A blamed NatWest. 
The complaint was brought to this Service and our Investigator didnt uphold it. She 
said NatWest had followed a correct process when declining the transaction, evident 
through its system data, and its offer to account for communication issues was fair.
Mr and Mrs W asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an Ombudsman, saying the 
transaction had led to considerable inconvenience over three days while trying to 
make a simple payment.
So, the complaint has been passed to me for an Ombudsmans final decision. I 
understand Mr and Mrs W have made a separate complaint to Company A. To be 
clear, within this decision my findings are limited only to the actions and 
responsibilities of NatWest.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
Mr and Mrs W have been clear they want to know which company was at fault for this 
transaction failing. So, Ive considered the available evidence.
NatWest has shared system information that suggests the initial transaction failed 
due to actions outside of NatWests control. This has been explained in detail by our 
Investigator previously, but in summary, this data suggests the authorisation 
message sent to NatWest was missing information leading to it not going ahead.
Ive been given no other evidence which suggests to me that NatWest was at fault for 
this mistake. So, Im satisfied NatWest acted fairly when dealing with the transaction.
NatWest has since acknowledged it couldve been clearer in its explanations about 
this issue. It apologised and offered £150 for any inconvenience caused. I agree its 
explanation may have helped Mr and Mrs W understand the problem earlier on and 
avoided unnecessary enquiries.
Taking into account the circumstances of this complaint, including the frustration 
described and the time periods involved; Im satisfied £150 is fair compensation. So, 
Im not directing NatWest to do anything further.
My final decision
For the above reasons, Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W and Mrs W 
to accept or reject my decision before 6 June 2022.
