The complaint
Miss K complains about the customer service she received from National Westminster Bank 
Plc (NatWest).
What happened
Miss K took out a contract with a mobile phone retailer in August 2020 and paid an upfront 
cost of around £160. Shortly afterwards she changed her mind and asked for a refund of the 
money, which was agreed.
Miss K says she contacted NatWest a few days later to check if the money had been 
refunded into her account. She says the adviser she spoke with told her that the retailer had 
refunded the money, but had then re-debited the amount again. 
Miss K says she went back to the retailer to query the issue, only to be told that the money 
had been refunded in full and not re-debited. So, it appeared that NatWest had given her 
wrong information, which she says made her feel embarrassed. She complained to NatWest. 
Miss K says she experienced some customer service issues during this process, including 
the length of time taken to deal with her complaint, not receiving a call-back from a manager 
that was promised and having to repeat herself on calls.
NatWest investigated matters and apologised for the incorrect information Miss K was given 
and any poor service it provided her with. It paid her £100 compensation for the matter, but 
Miss K didnt think this fairly recognised the stress and embarrassment she was caused. So, 
she brought her complaint to our service.
One of our investigators reviewed the complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. He 
thought that the £100 compensation NatWest had paid was enough to put things right. He 
also thought NatWest dealt with Miss Ks complaint within its timescales. NatWest didnt 
challenge our investigators opinion, but Miss K did and repeated her earlier points.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the case has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Miss Ks complaint. Ill explain my reasons why.
In her testimony, Miss K says she was initially told by NatWest that the retailer had 
re-debited the amount that had been refunded. NatWest hasnt been able to provide any call 
recordings to demonstrate what was discussed. But, on balance, I dont think Miss K 
wouldve queried the matter with the retailer had she been given correct information. So, I 
think its most likely that NatWest gave Miss K incorrect information about her account.
Miss K says that when she contacted the retailer to query the refund, it needed to escalate 
matters to its technical team before explaining that the money hadnt been re-debited. 
Following this, Miss K says she had to contact NatWest for confirmation that the information 
the retailer had given her was correct. She says it took a few days before NatWest confirmed 
that the refund hadnt re-debited her account and Miss K says this delay caused her 
additional distress and inconvenience as she didnt know where her money was. Taking 
everything into account, I think NatWest let Miss K down. But I think £100 compensation 
fairly reflects the impact this matter had on Miss K. 
Miss K, unhappy with the service shed received, complained to NatWest. This led to further 
interactions with NatWest which Miss K remains unhappy about. However, complaint 
handling isnt a regulated activity, or one of the other non-regulated activities that this service 
can consider. So, although I understand Miss Ks strength of feeling on this point, I cant 
comment on it. 
My final decision
I dont think National Westminster Bank Plc needs to do anything more to resolve this 
complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 February 2021.
