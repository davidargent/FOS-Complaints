The complaint
Mr N and Ms C complain that Vacation Finance Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid for some holiday club membership credits. Theyve being represented in their 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr N and Ms C bought 4,000 holiday club membership credits from a holiday company in 
March 2018. The membership price was £12,400 and they paid a deposit of £3,720 using a 
debit card. They entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Vacation Finance for a loan to 
pay the remaining amount and agreed to make monthly loan payments of £112.79. 
Mr N and Ms Cs representative made claims to Vacation Finance in July 2021 under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the holiday company 
was in liquidation and couldnt provide the service sold so was in breach of contract. It also 
said that the membership was mis-sold to Mr N and Ms C and, but for the 
misrepresentations made to them, they wouldnt have purchased it nor entered into the loan 
agreement. It also said that the terms of the agreement are so egregious as to be unfair, the 
payment of commission was hidden from view and the membership was marketed as an 
investment. It said that the membership was sold to them under extreme sales pressure, a 
proper affordability check wasnt undertaken and Mr N and Ms Cs relationship with Vacation 
Finance was unfair. 
Vacation Finance responded to those claims in detail and said that it hadnt seen or been 
presented with any evidence which would lead it to conclude that Mr N and Ms C's product 
was mis-sold or misrepresented to them at the time of purchase. It also said that it lent to 
them in a responsible manner but they only made one payment in April 2018 before the loan 
was cancelled. 
Mr N and Ms C werent satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. 
Their complaint form says that their claim should be considered under section 75 because 
the holiday company is in liquidation so is in breach of contract as it cant provide the goods 
or service sold to them and the holiday company misrepresented the product to them. It also 
said that Vacation Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared 
to them; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford 
the loan; and the holiday company unduly pressured them into entering into the purchase 
agreement and the loan agreement and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure 
them; all rendering the loan agreement unfair under section 140A. Mr N and Ms C have also 
made a complaint to this service about their claims management company but that complaint 
has been dealt with separately.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr N and Ms Cs complaint about Vacation Finance 
should be upheld as she didnt think that Vacation Finances decision to turn down their 
claims was unfair or unreasonable. She wasnt persuaded that there was a 
misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think that the holiday company had 
breached the contract. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship 
between Mr N and Ms C and Vacation Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a 
court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She said that no 
commission was paid to the holiday company by Vacation Finance in relation to the 
purchase and that she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was 
unaffordable for Mr N and Ms C.
Mr N and Ms Cs representative, on behalf of Mr N and Ms C, has asked for this complaint to 
be considered by an ombudsman. It has provided a detailed submission of Mr N and Ms C in 
response to our investigators recommendation which says, in summary and amongst other 
things, that: the holiday company misrepresented the credits as something that could be 
resold easily in the future; and our investigator has failed to properly assess Mr N and Ms C 
claims under sections 75 and 140A and, had she done so, they would have been upheld.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr N and Ms Cs complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
Mr N and Ms C have provided a document from the holiday company which 
summarises the purchase that they made in March 2018 and shows that they bought 
4,000 credits for a membership price of £12,400, they paid a deposit of £3,720 and 
agreed to make monthly payments of £112.79 but they havent provided a copy of 
the membership application agreement or any of the other documents that it's likely 
that they also signed at that time;
Vacation Finance says that Mr N and Ms C claims relate to a purchase that they 
made in March 2018 and the subsequent loan taken by them from it to finance the 
purchase but that they only made one payment in April 2018 before the loan was 
cancelled - none of Vacation Finance, Mr N and Ms C and their representative has 
provided a copy of the loan agreement or the other loan documents that its likely that 
would have been provided to Mr N and Ms C about the loan;
Mr N and Ms Cs representative made claims to Vacation Finance in July 2021 under 
sections 75 and 140A: section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in 
that section are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr N and Ms Cs claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Vacation Finances response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Mr N and Ms Cs representatives July 2021 claim letter describes the alleged 
misrepresentations that were made to Mr N and Ms C by the holiday company about 
the credits and the submission in response to our investigators recommendation 
says that the product was consistently marketed and sold to Mr N and Ms C as an 
investment and that the holiday company misrepresented the product as something 
that could be resold easily in the future;
that submission also says that Mr N and Ms C were told they would be able to use 
the 4,000 credits within five years but its come to light that theyre only permitted to 
use 160 points each year;other than the brief descriptions in Mr N and Ms Cs representatives July 2021 claim 
letter and in the submission in response to our investigators recommendations, none 
of Mr N, Ms C and their representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to Mr N and Ms C 
before their March 2018 purchase or any documentary or other evidence in support 
the claims that have been made;
I understand that the credits can be used for accommodation and experiences and 
Im not persuaded that its likely that the credits would properly be considered to be 
an investment and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they 
were marketed or sold to Mr N and Ms C as an investment so I dont consider that 
theres been any breach of regulation as claimed by their representative;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
misrepresented to Mr N and Ms C that the product was something that could be 
resold easily in the future or that the credits continue in perpetuity;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the credits were 
misrepresented or mis-sold to Mr N and Ms C by the holiday company or that they 
were induced into buying them by any such misrepresentations;
I understand that the holiday company went into liquidation in May 2020 and I 
consider that the liquidation of the holiday company could be a breach of contract for 
which Vacation Finance might be liable under section 75 but I also understand that a 
new management company has been appointed to provide the services in 
connection with the credits that Mr N and Ms C had bought from the holiday company 
in March 2018 and that the credits are available for them to use;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr N and Ms Cs use of the credits has been 
adversely impacted by the liquidation of the holiday company and I consider the 
appointment of the new management company to have been a suitable remedy for 
any breach of contract and Im not persuaded that Mr N and Ms C would be entitled 
to terminate their agreement in these circumstances;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any other 
breach of contract or regulation by the holiday company for which Vacation Finance 
would be liable under section 75;
Mr N and Ms Cs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between 
Mr N and Ms C and Vacation Finance because it paid a commission to the holiday 
company which wasnt declared to them; the holiday company failed to conduct a 
proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan; and the holiday company unduly 
pressured them into entering into the purchase agreement and the loan agreement 
and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure them;
Vacation Finance says that it paid no commission to the holiday company and our 
investigator said that, from the information provided by Vacation Finance, shed seen 
that no commission was paid to the holiday company by Vacation Finance in relation 
to Mr N and Ms Cs purchase;
the submission in response to our investigators recommendation says at no point did 
the holiday company make Mr N and Ms C aware of any commission which was 
attached to the loan agreement  but it provided no evidence in support of the claim 
that Vacation Finance paid a commission to the holiday company and Ive seen no 
evidence to show that Vacation Finance paid any commission to the holiday 
company relating to the loan that it made to Mr N and Ms C;Vacation Finance said in its December 2021 final response letter to Mr N and Ms Cs 
representative that it followed its usual process and conducted an appropriate 
affordability assessment before the loan was made to Mr N and Ms C and that they 
only made one payment in April 2018 before the loan was cancelled;
Mr N says that he made it clear to the holiday company that he and Ms C would pay 
the amount due in a lump sum as they didnt want to pay interest to Vacation Finance 
but he was told that one payment needed to be paid so he sent it through his bank in 
April 2018 but in his haste he paid £129.79 instead of the £112.79 that was payable  
and hes provided evidence showing the payment of £129.79 that was made;
Vacation Finance hasnt provided any other information about the affordability 
assessment that it conducted but none of Mr N, Ms C and their representative has 
provided any evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr N and Ms C - 
and as the loan was cancelled soon after it was made to them because they wanted 
to pay the amount due in a lump sum, I consider it to be likely that the loan was 
affordable for them;
if Mr N and Ms C felt that the loan was unaffordable for them, I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect them to have contacted Vacation Finance about that soon 
after the loan was made to them and then cancelled, but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that they complained about the affordability of the loan or the affordability 
assessment that it had conducted before their representatives July 2021 claim letter;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for Mr N and Ms C, that the loan was mis-sold to them or that Vacation 
Finance has acted incorrectly in connection with the loan;
Mr N and Ms C had the right to withdraw from the purchase agreement within 
fourteen days without giving any reason but Ive seen no evidence to show that they 
contacted either the holiday company or Vacation Finance to withdraw from the 
purchase agreement within the withdrawal period;
if Mr N and Ms C had been unduly pressured into entering into the purchase 
agreement and didnt want to buy the membership credits, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have contacted the holiday company or Vacation 
Finance about that undue pressure but Ive seen no evidence to show that they 
complained about any undue pressure before their representatives July 2021 claim 
letter  and Ive seen no evidence to show that they complained about any undue 
pressure when they chose to pay the amount due in a lump sum and cancel the loan;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr N and Ms C were 
unduly pressured into buying the credits in March 2018 or entering into the loan 
agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptably aggressive commercial 
practices against them;
Mr N and Ms Cs representative says that the terms of the agreement are so 
egregious as to be unfair  but it hasnt provided a copy of the agreement or said 
which of the terms it considers to be unfair;
it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the terms in the 
agreements that Mr N and Ms C entered into in March 2018 were unfair but I dont 
consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is likely to 
mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship between a 
debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated in practice 
and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr N and Ms C and I consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr N and Ms C and 
Vacation Finance;
having considered all thats been said and provided by Mr N and Ms C and their 
representative, lm not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr N 
and Ms Cs relationship with Vacation Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be 
likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr N 
and Ms C and Vacation Finance in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr N and Ms C for the issues that theyve had with their credits but 
I consider that Vacation Finances response to the claims that had been made to it 
was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Vacation Finance to refund to Mr N and Ms C any of the money that they paid for the 
membership credits, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr N and Ms Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N and Ms C to 
accept or reject my decision before 25 December 2023.
