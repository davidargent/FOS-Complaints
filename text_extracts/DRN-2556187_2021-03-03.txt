The complaint
 Mr R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) acted unfairly in registering 
a default on his credit card account.
What happened
Mr R missed payments on his NatWest credit card each month between August and 
December 2016. As a result, NatWest sent him notices about this, and when he didnt put 
this right, it registered a default against his account in January 2017. NatWest appointed a 
debt collection agency to contact Mr R, and in February 2017, Mr R called and settled his 
balance, and his default was marked as settled. 
 
Mr R said he didnt receive any statements or letters but acknowledges that he hadnt told 
NatWest about his new address. He didnt remember making transactions during this period, 
, but he didnt dispute that he made the transactions. He said that when he spoke to 
NatWest in 2017, it told him that nothing would show on his credit record. He complained to 
NatWest about the entry on his credit record.
  
NatWest said that Mr R had switched to online statements in August 2012, so he wouldnt 
have had statements in the post, but online. It said that it had sent letters to the address on 
its records and that it was Mr Rs responsibility to keep his details up to date. It said that it 
had no record of any discussion about Mr Rs credit record when he called in February 2017. 
It said it was required to give an accurate record of Mr Rs payment history and would not 
change his record.
Mr R was unhappy with this and brought his case to our service. Our investigator said that 
Mr R should have been aware of the balance on his account as hed made the transactions 
and would have been able to look at his statements online. He agreed that it was up to Mr R 
to keep his contact details up to date. He didnt uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Mr R was not happy with this and asked for his case to be referred to an Ombudsman, so 
the case has come to me to decide. 
          
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I will start by saying that its clear that this was a case of oversight by Mr R. He settled his 
credit card account as soon as he realised that he had an outstanding balance. Mr R says 
he hadnt used his card for a while when he moved house in 2013, and he overlooked this 
account when updating his address, which I understand can easily happen. Unfortunately, 
this doesnt mean that NatWest acted incorrectly or unfairly in recording the position 
accurately in the first place. I explain my reasons below. 
Looking at his statements between January 2015  January 2016 Mr R had a balance of 
around Â£1,000 and was making the minimum monthly payment via Direct Debit. In January 
2016 he cleared the balance, but the account was left with a small credit balance and 
remained in credit until 22 July 2016, when he made an on-line transaction with a hotel. He 
then made further transactions with the hotel in August, September, October and December. 
As there was an outstanding balance, he was getting statements requesting payment.
Mr R says he didnt receive these statements as hed moved address, but NatWest has 
provided evidence to show that hed switched to electronic statements in August 2012, so 
this is how NatWest provided his statements, in line with his choice. Mr R acknowledges that 
he received e-mail alerts directing him to view his statements. Mr R says the emails didnt 
alert him that there was a problem on his account. But I dont think it was unreasonable or 
unfair of NatWest not to include more detail in the emails as the statements themselves 
contained information about the arrears on the account and a warning about the 
consequences of missing payments. 
Mr R mentions that he was probably exhausted at the time that he missed payments due to 
his personal circumstances at the time. I can understand that this may have led to his 
oversight and do sympathise with him, but unfortunately this does not mean that NatWest 
shouldnt have reported his account accurately to credit reference agencies.
NatWest has provided evidence of the letters it sent to Mr R between September 2016 - 
January 2017. I appreciate that Mr R wouldnt have received these as they were sent to his 
old address, but this was the last address he had given NatWest, and it was Mr Rs 
responsibility to ensure that NatWest had his current address details. NatWest wasnt aware 
Mr R had moved and hadnt received any returned mail to suggest that Mr R didnt live at the 
address they held. Its also worth noting that particular notices that NatWest was legally 
required to send to Mr R are not permitted to be sent electronically, so it had to send them 
by post. Taking account of all of this, I cant say that it was unreasonable or unfair of 
NatWest to write to Mr R at this address. 
Mr R notes that the debt collection agency to whom his account was passed did manage to 
contact him. I can see that NatWest attempted to contact Mr R by phone many times 
between mid-October 2016 and mid-January 2017 without success, so in the light of this, 
and what Ive already said, I am satisfied that it made reasonable efforts to contact Mr R.
Mr R says that when he cleared his balance in Feb 2017, he was informed that his credit 
history wouldnt be impacted. NatWest has been unable to provide a call recording, but I can 
see from NatWests letter in early March 2020 to Mr R, that the complaint handler had 
listened to the calls and explained that there was no mention of Mr Rs credit file. As such, I 
cant fairly conclude that NatWest said Mr Rs record wouldnt be affected.
NatWest was obliged to pass accurate details of Mr Rs account to credit reference 
agencies, so it had to report the default. This was fair and reasonable as it reflected an 
accurate picture of the account. Mr Rs credit files also show that the default was settled in 
full in February 2017. I understand that Mr R feels that his oversight in relation to a small 
balance has a disproportionate impact on his credit file, but I cant say that NatWest acted 
incorrectly in recording the default, and I note that NatWest was happy to give Mr R a 
mortgage. 
 
In summary, while I understand that Mr R feels that NatWest should remove the default on 
his account, I cant say it has acted unfairly or unreasonably in recording the default on his 
credit card account or declining to remove it.
I know Mr R will be disappointed with this, but I hope he can understand my reasons.My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 March 2021.
