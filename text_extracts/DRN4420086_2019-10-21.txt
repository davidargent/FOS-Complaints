Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Os complaint in part and thought the loans from June 2015 (loan 
7) onwards shouldnt  have been given.  Sunny  disagreed  and the complaint was passed  to 
me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr O could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN44200862But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr O could  sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. 
Loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. 
The relevant  regulations  define sustainable  as being without undue difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to make  their 
repayments without  borrowing  further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Os complaint.
Our adjudicator explained that he thought Sunny had done  enough  before  agreeing  to lend 
loans 1 to 4 but it should have done more before it lent loans 5 and 6. But as Mr O didnt 
provide information  about his circumstances at the time of those  loans, he couldnt say the 
loans were unaffordable. So our adjudicator didnt recommend that loans 1 to 6 should be 
upheld. I agree with the adjudicator and as Mr O hasnt provided any further  information  
disagreeing with the adjudicator, Ive focused  my decision on loans 7 onwards as they are 
the loans that remain  in dispute.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 7 to 14 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. I think the pattern of lending  here is important and 
so Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history  with Mr O, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN44200863Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Os case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
at this point Sunny  ought to have  realised Mr O was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr O had been indebted to Sunny for around  14 months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  Mr O was having  to borrow  further to cover 
the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances  and that his 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Os first loan was for £300 and loan 7 was for £350. Although I can see that 
Mr Os loan amounts fluctuated, the overall  amount  he owed Sunny was increasing 
as several his loans  from loans 1 to 7 overlapped. At this point Sunny ought to have 
known that Mr O was unlikely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in his income 
but to meet  an ongoing need. 
from loan 7 onwards  Mr O was provided  with a new loan within  days  of settling a 
previous one. And in many cases, he was repaying more  than one loan at a time.
Mr O wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  14 was 
taken out 24 months after Mr Os first, he had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr O lost out because Sunny continued to provide credit from loan 7 onwards:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Os indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the length of time over which Mr O borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  Mr O complaint in part as I think Sunny shouldnt have given him loans 7 
to 14. Sunny  should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr O paid on loans 7 to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the loans taken from June 2015  onwards  means  any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  7 to 14 should be removed from Mr Os 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN44200864my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Os complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr O compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 November  2019
