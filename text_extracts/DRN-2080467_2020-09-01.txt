* Including overlapping loans
Ms R says Lending Stream didnt carry out enough affordability checks and subsequent 
borrowing caused her to get into a debt spiral. She adds that, due to her condition, she isnt 
good with money and her worsening financial situation has caused her to be stressed.
Lending Stream says it asked Ms R about her income and expenditure and sanity-checked 
the information with independent data sources. It says it also checked Ms Rs credit 
expenditure by looking at her credit file. Lending Stream says it adjusted Ms Rs declared 
expenditure upwards where necessary before assessing the loan applications. It says it was 
satisfied loans 1 to 4 and 6 to 9 were affordable based upon the available information. But it 
offered to uphold Ms Rs complaint about loan 5.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld in part. He said that, in 
addition to loan 5, Lending Stream should not have approved loans 4 or 6 because her 
borrowing pattern indicated she may be having problems managing her money. He 
recommended that interest and charges should be refunded on loans 4 to 6 (plus 8% 
statutory interest) and that any associated negative information should be removed from her 
credit file.
Lending Stream accepted the adjudicators recommendation, but Ms R did not accept its 
offer. She responded to say, in summary, that she has evidence of her diagnosis of a 
developmental disorder which should be considered when looking into her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. Lending Stream was 
required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks to make sure Ms R could afford to 
repay the loans before it lent to her. Those checks needed to be proportionate to things such 
as the amount Ms R was borrowing, and her lending history. But there was no set list of 
checks Lending Stream had to do.
Loans 1 to 3
Im satisfied Lending Stream did proportionate checks for these loans and there was nothing 
in the available information to indicate the loans were unaffordable.
Loans 4 to 6
By the time Ms R applied for loan 4, I consider Lending Stream should have carried out 
better checks. I say that because:
Ms Rs total maximum monthly repayment on the four loans was almost £250 which 
was a large proportion of her £1,200 income;
This was Ms Rs fourth loan in quick succession and would have meant her being in 
debt to Lending Stream for almost 11 months;
By then, Ms R had been late with two of her monthly repayments on loan 1.
Therefore I find Lending Stream should have carried out a full financial review before it 
approved further loans. Although it didnt do such checks, I still find it was irresponsible for 
Lending Stream to have approved further loans:
Ms R already had three outstanding loans with Lending Stream, so I consider this 
was an indication she was already struggling to manage her money;
Lending Streams existing checks showed Ms R had a disposable income of around 
£300. As she needed to spend almost £250 of this on loan repayments, Im satisfied 
she couldnt afford to sustainably make such repayments over several months given 
the likelihood of unforeseen expenditure.
So I find loans 4 to 6 were unaffordable and Lending Stream shouldnt have approved them.
Loans 7 to 9
It was almost seven months later that Ms R applied for her next loan. I find it reasonable for 
Lending Stream to consider she was not reliant on short-term lending and Im satisfied its 
checks went far enough. As both loans 7 and 8 were repaid within a day, I cant conclude 
Lending Stream was wrong to have approved loans 7, 8 and 9.
I have seen evidence of Ms Rs medical diagnosis, and I acknowledge such a condition can 
affect her management of financial matters. But Ive not seen any evidence to suggest 
Lending Stream was made aware of Ms Rs condition prior to it making its lending decisions, 
so I cant conclude it should have affected the outcome of her loan applications. 
Nevertheless, I would encourage Ms R to speak to Lending Stream regarding the 
outstanding balance on loan 9 so that an acceptable repayment plan can be agreed.
My final decision
My decision is that Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) should:Refund all interest and charges that Ms R paid on loans 4 to 6;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative information about loans 4 to 6 from Ms Rs credit file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Ms R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
If Lending Stream intends to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it 
must do so after deducting the tax.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms R to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 September 2020.
