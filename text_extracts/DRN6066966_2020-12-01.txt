K821x#15complaint
Mr S says Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money)  treated him unfairly  when it 
lent him money in April 2018.
background
In April 2018, 118 118 Money  lent Mr S £1,000. Mr S agreed to repay  this amount, with 
interest, over 24 months. The scheduled  repayment was £78.32 a month, and if Mr S made  
each payment when  due hed pay £1,879.68  in total.
Mr S thinks  it was irresponsible for 118 118 Money to lend him the money.
An adjudicator looked at the complaint and thought it should be upheld. 118 118 Money 
didnt agree. The complaint has now been referred  to me.
I issued my provisional findings on this complaint on 14 August 2020.  I said:
Id considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of the complaint. 
Id taken into account relevant law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and 
standards; codes of practice;  and what I consider to have been good  industry  
practice at the relevant time.
I said the relevant rules were  set out in the Consumer Credit  sourcebook  (CONC) 
which could be found online  in the Financial  Conduct Authoritys handbook.  These  
said that 118 118 Money needed  to undertake an assessment of Mr Ss 
creditworthiness.
This meant considering whether  the commitments under the agreement would 
adversely affect Mr Ss financial situation, taking into account  the information  of 
which 118 118 Money was aware at the time the agreement  was to be made.  It 
needed to consider the ability of Mr S to make the repayments as they fell due over 
the life of the agreement.
The rules didnt specify checks that had to be completed in all cases. Instead, the 
extent and scope of the checks would  depend on, and had to be proportionate to, the 
individual circumstances  of the lending decision. This might  include the amount  and 
type of credit,  the cost of credit and Mr Ss circumstances at the time.
The checks had to look at more than just whether Mr S could repay the credit. 
118 118 Money needed to take reasonable steps to assess whether Mr S could meet  
the repayments in a sustainable  manner without incurring financial difficulties or 
experiencing significant adverse consequences.
118 118 Money needed to check that Mr S could make the payments without undue 
difficulties. In particular, he should be able to make the repayments on time, while  
meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow  to meet  the 
repayments. He should also be able to make the payments  over the life of the 
agreement out of income and savings, without having to realise  security  or assets.
Finally, the rules said 118 118 Money  shouldnt accept an application for credit  if it 
ought reasonably to have  suspected  that Mr S hadnt been truthful  in completing the 
application in relation to information supplied by him relevant to the creditworthiness 
Ref: DRN60669662assessment  for example, where  the information  was clearly inconsistent  with other 
information.
Keeping the above in mind, I said the main questions I needed to consider was:
oDid 118 118 Money  complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr S would  be able to repay  his loan in a sustainable  way?
If so, did it make  a fair lending decision?
If not, would reasonable and proportionate checks  have shown that Mr 
S could sustainably  repay the borrowing?
oDid 118 118 Money  act unfairly in some  other  way?
I looked at the checks 118 118 Money  carried out. Mr S was applying to borrow  
£1,000 over 24 months. He said he was working  full time and received an income  of 
£1,300. His outgoings  were around £220 in rent, £50 in utilities,  £50 in food, and £98 
in card repayments. He said he had zero outgoings  towards  other loans, 
maintenance, childcare or insurance.
118 118 Money also provided a report from a credit reference agency.  This showed 
Mr S had existing  debt with balances of around £1,300.  Hed exceeded the credit liit 
of his credit card. He had 6 open  accounts, with a further  55 settled accounts 
appearing on his file. I also noted a number of delinquent accounts and accounts in 
arrears or where Mr S had agreed arrangements  to repay.
Finally, 118 118 Money says it checked  a bank statement from Mr S. This showed an 
income of £1,783.14 entering  Mr Ss account.
On this basis, 118 118 Money concluded  that the loan was affordable. It said that 
even accounting  for its lowest estimated income for Mr S - £1080  it felt Mr S had 
sufficient income to pay for the loan.
I was concerned  that the information suggested  that Mr S was having difficulties 
meeting his existing credit commitments. The credit report  showed that in the year 
prior to lending  a number of accounts had been passed to debt collection  agencies. 
Five accounts  had balances of between £42 and £107, which  each had been in 
arrears for over 6 months before being  passed  to the agency. One of the open 
accounts had a status of overdue, with three overdue payments. From the rest of the 
information, it appears Mr S had entered an arrangement to repay this account, 
paying around £63 a month compared  to agreed  repayments of £156. Hed exceeded 
the credit limit of his credit card, and recently taken a cash advance.
I also noted that the bank statements showed  spending £2,450  a lot more  than 
what Mr S said he spent towards regular expenses in his application. Despite earning 
a higher salary that month than the amount shown on his application,  his existing 
commitments took him overdrawn within three days of being  paid. He remained 
overdrawn for the rest of that month, and appeared to have been receiving payments 
from family to help him meet  his existing commitments.
I recognised that Mr S appeared to have underestimated his monthly outgoings as 
part of his application. Just a few weeks after Mr S got the money,  Mr S contacted 
118 118 Money to say he wouldnt be able to afford the new repayments   and at 
that time told 118 118 Money his rent was higher  and included  details of other loan 
repayments. But I thought that 118 118 Money  knew that what  Mr S had told them  in 
his application  wasnt consistent with the other  information it had: in particular, the 
Ref: DRN60669663credit report  showed his payments towards  his other  loans, his telephone provider 
and his arrears.
For these reasons,  I wasnt  satisfied that the payments towards the loan were  
sustainable based on what 118 118 Money  had seen at the time.  Mr S was already 
having difficulties meeting repayments  towards his existing  credit  commitments and 
his recent credit  history showed problems repaying debts of a similar size to the 
monthly repayments to the new debt.
For these reasons  I didnt think that 118 118 Money should have lent.
I said that subject  to anything else 118 118 Money or Mr S told me, I proposed  to tell 
118 118 Money to remove all interest and charges from the loan and treat all the 
payments Mr S had made as repayments of the amounts borrowed.  If that meant Mr 
S has paid more  than he borrowed,  he should  get this back  with interest. If theres 
still a balance outstanding, 118 118 Money  should agree an affordable repayment 
plan with him. 118 118 Money should remove any adverse information  from Mr Ss 
credit file once  the loan was settled.
Mr S has replied  to say hes happy  with my findings. 118 118 Money has confirmed it has 
nothing further  to add. Ive looked at the complaint again.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr S says he agrees  with my findings. 118 118 Money says it has nothing further to add. I 
therefore reach the same findings  for the same reasons.
putting things right
118 118 Money shouldnt have lent the money  to Mr S. So to put things  right it should:
A)Remove all interest and charges from the loan,  and treat all payments Mr S has 
made as repayments  of the amount borrowed.
B)If this means Mr S has now repaid the amount  he originally borrowed, 118 118 
Money should refund the extra Mr S has paid, and add interest (the rate is 8% per 
year) to each  overpayment from the date Mr S made it until the date he gets it back.
C)If there  is still a balance outstanding, 118 118 Money should agree an affordable 
repayment plan with him.
D)118 118 Money should remove any adverse information about the loan from Mr Ss 
credit record  once  the loan is settled.
my final decision
For the reasons  above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Mr Ss complaint. 
Madison CF UK Limited should put things  right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 January 2021.
