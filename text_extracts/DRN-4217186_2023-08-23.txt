The complaint
Mr F complains NewDay Ltd (NewDay) refused to provide the credit limit he had previously 
enjoyed on his retailer partnership credit card account with the previous card provider, 
following its transfer to NewDay.
What happened
Mr F says he held a retailer partnership credit card account, and the retailer changed the 
card provider to NewDay. Mr F says NewDay only approved a credit limit of £3,000 which 
was lower than he had previously enjoyed with the old credit card provider. Mr F says 
NewDay didnt take into account his credit file still showed the old credit card provider, when 
it came to assessing his application and that is the reason why his limit isnt the same as he 
previously enjoyed and why his request for an increase in the limit was declined. 
Mr F also says NewDay provided poor customer service when he tried to discuss the 
increase on his credit card account. Mr F wants NewDay to improve its service and 
apologise for this and offer him compensation for the issues he has experienced. 
NewDay says this was a new application and not a transfer of his existing retailer 
partnership credit card and had to be treated as such and felt it had provided Mr F with an 
appropriate level of credit. NewDay says its specialist risk team reviewed the credit limit 
increase request, however this was declined as it didnt meet its internal credit assessment 
criteria and it takes into account many factors when setting credit limits like this. 
NewDay subsequently reviewed the issues Mr F raised about the service he received and 
agreed that at certain times of the day, it receives high volumes of calls which can cause 
delays and given that it offered Mr F £50 by way of apology.
Mr F wasnt happy with NewDays response and referred the matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator felt NewDay had fairly carried out its own internal checks when initially 
approving the credit limit and the subsequent request to increase the limit Mr F had been 
provided with. 
The investigator reiterated that this wasnt a transfer of his existing facility from the previous 
provider, and it needed to be assessed by NewDay using its own internal criteria, which it 
was entitled to do, and this was in line with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
that Mr F had signed. The investigator says the offer of £50 by NewDay for the service 
issues Mr F experienced was fair and reasonable. 
Mr F didnt agree with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I wont be upholding this complaint and I will explain how I have come to my 
decision. 
I can understand it would have been frustrating for Mr F to have his request to increase his 
credit card limit with NewDay declined, given he had a good credit score and had previously 
enjoyed a higher limit with the previous provider of the retailer partnership credit card. 
When looking at this complaint I will consider if NewDay acted fairly when it refused to 
increase Mr Fs credit card account limit. 
Mr Fs complaint centres around the fact despite him having a good credit score and having 
previously held a higher credit limit with the previous retailer partnership card provider, 
NewDay still refused to increase his credit card limit. Mr F feels this is due to the fact his 
credit file showed the previous credit card providers credit facility, even though this had 
effectively been replaced by NewDay  which meant it suggested he had more lines of credit 
available to him than he really did. 
Mr F makes the point he also found it difficult to speak to anyone at NewDay when he was 
looking to increase his credit facility with them. 
I understand the points Mr F makes here, but Im not fully persuaded by his arguments. I say 
this because NewDay would need to assess any request for an increase in the credit limit it 
made available using its own credit criteria. Its also worth mentioning that all lenders will 
apply different criteria when assessing credit applications and these assessments take into 
account various factors, so the fact Mr F may have a good credit score for example, wouldnt 
mean he would be automatically accepted for any credit limit he might request. I am satisfied 
from the information I  have seen that NewDays specialist risk team did carry out a review of 
Mr Fs request but unfortunately it didnt meet its risk appetite for a higher limit and its not for 
me to tell NewDay it must change its process or criteria here. 
Its also worth saying theres no evidence to suggest NewDays decision not to increase Mr 
Fs credit limit was based on the fact his previous credit facility was still showing on his credit 
file and as explained earlier many factors are considered before credit limits are provided or 
increased. This is also made clear in Mr Fs credit agreement as detailed by the investigator. 
NewDay have told this service it may consider in future raising Mr Fs credit limit and would 
let him know, alternatively he can apply for this himself directly, subject of course to 
NewDays lending criteria at that time. 
I understand that following a review of Mr Fs complaint NewDay felt he had experienced 
long wait times when trying to call them and offered Mr F £50 by way of apology, which I am 
satisfied is fair and reasonable here. I understand Mr F has declined this offer and I will 
leave it with him if he now wishes to accept this offer and to contact NewDay directly. 
While Mr F will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking anymore of NewDay.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 September 2023.
