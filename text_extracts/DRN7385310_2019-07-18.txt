All the loans  were to be repaid over three months; interest only for the first two months and 
capital and interest in the third month.
QuickQuid didnt agree that it lent irresponsibly to Mr H. It said that the checks it carried  out, 
amongst other things,  included asking him about  his income and expenditure and carrying 
out identity and credit checks. Its review of the information it gathered didnt show there was 
any reason that Mr H couldnt afford  the repayments, particularly as the repayments were  
spread over three months.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Hs complaint. She thought QuickQuid shouldnt  have  agreed  any 
of the loans except loan number nine. QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint was passed 
to me.
Ref: DRN73853102my provisional findings
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr H 
and to QuickQuid  on 30 May 2019.  I summarise my findings:
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this meant that it should have  carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mr 
H could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account 
a number of different  things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts 
and his income and expenditure. 
In the early stages  of a lending relationship, I thought less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
Certain factors, such as lower income, higher  repayments and/or greater  number and 
frequency of loans,  could mean  that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr H. 
There may even come  a point  where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
QuickQuid was required  to establish whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  
not just whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence 
calculation. 
QuickQuid should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower 
wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  unlikely to be able to make  
their repayments without borrowing further.  
For Mr Hs first two loans I thought  think QuickQuids checks were  proportionate and its 
decision to lend to Mr H was reasonable.
When Mr H asked to borrow for a third time, I thought QuickQuid  should  have been 
concerned about whether Mr H was reliant  on short  term lending to get by each  month. 
Mr H had declared his other  monthly  credit commitments were  £75 per month.  Although 
QuickQuid says it carried out credit checks it didnt provide a copy  or any detail about 
those checks. I found that Mr Hs credit file showed that he had a number of credit cards  
and other short  term loans, prior to QuickQuid providing loan three.
Given that Mr H was also borrowing from a number of other short term lenders I think  
QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more likely than not he was having to borrow  
further to fill the hole that repaying  previous  loans  was leaving in his finances and that Mr 
Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. I considered it was unlikely that he 
would be able to save over the life of the loan in order to make the final repayment.
I didnt think the checks  QuickQuid did for loans three to eight were proportionate.  
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid. He was late in 
making repayments to loans five, six and eight, which was also an indicator that Mr H 
was having difficulties in sustainably repaying  the loans.
Ref: DRN73853103There was a break of some nine months before  Mr H took the ninth loan so I thought  it 
reasonable to regard  loan nine as the start of a separate  chain of lending.
The information Mr H provided  suggested  he had enough disposable  income to meet  the 
loan repayments.
Within two days of receiving loan 9 Mr H asked to borrow  a further  £250  and then nine 
days later another  £200, taking the total loan to £750. The maximum repayment was 
£954, which was considerably in excess of Mr Hs declared  disposable income.  Given  
that he had returned  twice in quick succession to top up loan 9, I didnt think  it was 
reasonable for QuickQuid to assume that he would  be able to save  from his monthly 
income to repay the maximum repayment.
QuickQuid provided loan 10 just two days after Mr H repaid the previous loan. I 
considered QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr H was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
By continuing to provide these loans  (9a to 17a) QuickQuid was unfairly prolonging Mr 
Hs indebtedness by allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended for short-term use 
over an extended period  of time.
Subject to any further representations from Mr H or QuickQuid,  my provisional  decision was 
that I thought it was wrong for QuickQuid to conclude that loans 3 to 8 and 9a to 17a were 
affordable and to lend to Mr H.
Mr H accepted my provisional  decision.
QuickQuid responded  to say, in summary, that it believed the checks  it carried out were 
adequate and proportionate and it took account of Mr Hs other debt. It didnt agree that the 
loans were unsustainable. Mr H had established a good lending  and repayment history and 
often repaid the loan before he was contractually due to do so.
my findings 
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
In reaching my decision, Ive taken into account  the relevant law and regulations;  relevant 
regulators rules,  guidance and standards; relevant codes of practice; and, where 
appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the time. Weve set out 
our general  approach  to complaints about short-term lending  - including all of the relevant 
rules, guidance  and good industry practice  - on our website. 
Im not persuaded by QuickQuids argument that its checks were  proportionate. I cant see 
how doing the same thing  over and over again,  irrespective of the circumstances,  can 
always be proportionate. The amount  and extent of the checks required and the degree of 
information a lender  will need to gather in order to make an informed decision will depend on 
the circumstances of each individual loan.  An assessment of affordability is a borrower 
rather than lender focused  test.
Ref: DRN73853104QuickQuid seems to place considerable reliance on the fact that Mr H repaid a number of his 
loans early. QuickQuid seems to believe that a repeat borrower is more likely to find a later 
loan affordable simply because they have paid off previous ones. Even  though the borrower  
mightve paid off previous loans, QuickQuid wont necessarily know  how they managed to do 
this.
I agree  that a consumer repaying  a loan early could sometimes  indicate  that the short-term 
emergency (the consumer  borrowed  for) had been resolved and that the consumer was in a 
reasonable financial position.  Without making further  enquiries  about this, I cant see how 
QuickQuid can regard  simply  paying  off previous loans, or loan chains, as a reliable  indicator  
that a borrower  will be able to sustainably repay a future loan  especially bearing in mind  
the effect of paying high levels of interest  over a more sustained period. So I dont think  it is 
reasonable and proportionate for QuickQuid to have reached  this conclusion, given the 
particular facts of Mr Hs case.
Mr H often approached QuickQuid for another loan within days  after hed repaid the previous 
one. He was also borrowing  from a number of other short term lenders. I consider that 
QuickQuid ought  fairly  and reasonably  to have been  alert to the possibility Mr H mightve 
been seeking further funds to cover the hole left in his finances by the early repayment  of a 
previous loan. 
As well as assessing the affordability of each  individual loan provided to Mr H, I also thought 
that it was fair and reasonable for QuickQuid  to look at the overall pattern of lending.  It 
seemed to me that there may come a point at which a responsible lender would reasonably  
question whether continuing  to offer further short-term loans to a customer who appeared to 
be persistently reliant upon them was unsustainable or otherwise harmful. I consider that this 
point was reached at loan 6 (to 8) and 14 (to 17a).
I think that QuickQuid unfairly and unreasonably provided Mr H with loans 3 to 8 and loans 
9a to 17a (as set out in the table above). I also think that Mr H lost out  through  having  had 
to pay interest and charges  as a result of being  given  these advances  when he shouldnt  
have been. So I think that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably put things  right. 
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Mr H for loans 3 to 8 and loans 9a to 
17a, so it should:
refund  all interest and charges applied to loans 3 to 8 and 9a to 17a 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*
remove any negative information  about loans 3 to 5 and loans 9a to 13a from Mr Hs 
credit file
the number  of loans taken from 6 to 8 and 14 to 17a means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  these should be removed from Mr Hs credit 
file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN73853105my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Hs complaint. I require CashEuroNet  UK LLC to put 
things right as detailed above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 August 2019.
