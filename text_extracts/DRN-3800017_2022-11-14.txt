Complaint
Mr K is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his accounts 
without explaining why.
Background
In September 2022, NatWest wrote to Mr K and told him that it was no longer prepared to 
offer him an account. Mr K complained. NatWest didnt uphold Mr Ks complaint. As Mr K 
remained dissatisfied, he referred the matter to our service.
One of our adjudicators looked into Mr Ks concerns. He didnt think that NatWest had done 
anything wrong or treated Mr K unfairly and so didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. 
Mr K disagreed and so the complaint was passed to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered everything, I dont think that NatWest acted unfairly towards    
Mr K and so Im not upholding his complaint. Ill explain why in a little more detail.
As our adjudicator explained to Mr K, a bank is under no obligation to continue offering an 
account to a consumer if it doesnt wish to do so. I know that Mr K is unhappy that NatWest 
didnt disclose the exact reason for closing his account. However, closing a customers 
account is a commercial decision that a bank is entitled to take. Furthermore, having 
reviewed everything, including NatWests actions and the information provided, Im satisfied 
that NatWest acted in line with the terms and conditions of his account when taking the 
action it did. 
I realise that NatWests decision will have been very disappointing to Mr K and I can 
appreciate why the closure of his accounts will have caused him inconvenience. I also 
suspect that theres an element of disappointment that hes no longer able to have accounts 
with NatWest when he was previously able to. But despite all of this, Im simply not in a 
position to be able to tell NatWest that it has to offer Mr K an account in circumstances 
where it has legitimately decided it doesnt wish to do so. 
Furthermore, if Mr K still hasnt received the remaining funds from his account after 
completing the forms, this is a matter hell need to take up with NatWest in the first instance, 
although the process of releasing funds can take up to 90 days. 
So overall and having considered everything, I dont think that NatWest acted unfairly 
towards Mr K and Im not upholding this complaint. I appreciate this will be very 
disappointing for Mr K. But I hope hell understand the reasons for my decision and that hell 
appreciate why I think NatWest hasnt acted unfairly or unreasonably towards him.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Mr Ks complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 December 2022.
