The complaint
Mr and Mrs M say Santander UK Plc has not properly compensated them for a mis-sold 
payment protection insurance (PPI) policy.
What happened
In January 2007 Mr and Mrs M took out a loan with Santander.
Mr and Mrs M borrowed £19,000, repayable over a 60-month term. At the same time they 
were sold a PPI policy. The policy was financed with a single premium of £3,909.50 which 
was added to the loan. The PPI premium would attract interest totalling £601.90 meaning the 
PPI would cost them £4,511.40 over the 60-month term, or an additional £75.19 per month.
Mr and Mrs M later complained about the sale of the policy.
On 30 July 2009 Santander wrote to Mr and Mrs M. In its letter Santander agreed the PPI 
had been mis-sold.
The letter went on to set out how Santander was intending to put things right.
Santander said it would refund the total cost of the PPI so far. This included the amount of 
the PPI premium and interest paid to July 2009. This amounted to £1,137.16.
Santander also added 8% compensatory interest amounting to £146.88. The PPI premiums, 
contractual Interest and 8% compensatory interest totalled £1,284.04. 
Santander noted the loan was in arrears totalling £6,133.98, it said that without PPI the 
arrears would be £1043.35 lower.
So Santander used the refund of £1,284.04 and the figure of £1,043.35 to reduce the arrears 
by £2,327.39 from £6,133.98 to £3,786.59.
Santander also said that to remove the PPI going forward it would need to close the loan, 
cancel the PPI policy, and issue a new loan agreement without PPI.
The overall effect of all this would be to reduce Mr and Mrs Ms arrears from £6,113.98 to 
£3,786.59 and issue a new loan without PPI. The new loan would have a monthly repayment 
of £365.42 over the remainder of the 60-month term, which was what Mr and Mrs M would 
have paid from the outset if PPI had not been added.
On 6 August 2009 Mr and Mrs M were sent a new agreement to sign. The covering letter 
began, following the cancellation of your loan repayment insurance we have pleasure 
enclosing a new agreement for you to sign.
Looking at the figures and Mr and Mrs Ms new loan agreement and monthly repayment it is 
clear that this proposal would have put Mr and Mrs M back in the position they would have 
been in if the new agreement had been put in place. And that would have resolved the 
complaint.
It isnt clear why, but Santander says the new agreement was not taken up by Mr and        
Mrs M. So it seems the new loan was never put in place and the original loan continued with 
the PPI attached until May 2010 when Mr and Mrs M defaulted on the loan. At the time the 
outstanding amount owed was £16,752.84.
In 2019 Mr and Mrs M complained to Santander that they had never been compensated for 
the mis-sale of the PPI
Initially Santander said the complaint had been dealt with in 2009 and said Mr and Mrs Ms 
complaint was out of time. 
Following this services involvement Santander agreed to look again at the account and what 
had happened in 2009. And in August 2020 Santander agreed Mr and Mrs M had not been 
fully compensated in 2009 . Santander agreed to carry out a recalculation but said that any 
further compensation due would be used to reduce Mr and Mrs Ms outstanding arrears. 
Santander calculated that it owed Mr and Mrs M a further £1,828.64 which it would use to 
reduce Mr and Mrs Ms arrears.. An adjudicator from this service said that this was fair. 
Mr and Mrs M disagreed with the adjudicators findings so the complaint has been passed to 
me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When a PPI policy was mis-sold Id expect the business (as far as is possible)  to put the 
consumer back in the financial position they would be in if the PPI had not been sold.
The total cost of the PPI including contractual interest on the initial agreement was 
£4,511.40. So in order to return Mr and Mrs M to the position theyd be in, this amount would 
need to be removed from the outstanding loan balance.
Santander has added to the £4,511.40 some addition cost for arrears letters and interest on 
those arrears letters. It has also added a small amount of 8% compensatory interest for extra 
Mr and Mrs M paid between July 2009 and when the loan defaulted in 2010.
Santander then deducted one amount of £40 which was an annual no claims bonus the 
policy paid annually if no claim was made. As Mr and Mrs M would not have received this if 
the PPI had not been sold I think it is fair for Santander to deduct this from the amount it 
owes Mr and Mrs M.
Ive seen a screenshot from Santanders records which shows that when the loan defaulted 
and the PPI was cancelled the insurer rebated £586.43 which was used to reduce the debt. 
That is usual when a single premium policy is cancelled early. Once the rebate was 
deducted the outstanding amount, representing the cost of the PPI was £4,009.15.
I can see that in 2009 Santander paid £2,327.39 compensation which was used to reduce 
the arrears. This included £146.88 compensatory interest.
£2,327.39 compensation minus £146.88 compensatory interest leaves £2,180.51So Santander has deducted £2,180.51 from the outstanding amount of £4,009.15 leaving 
the amount of £1,828.64 which is the amount now offered by Santander.
Looking at these calculations I can see that between the 2010 PPI rebate, the compensation 
deducted from the arrears in 2009 and the further £1,828.64 now being offered, the cost of 
the PPI has been removed from the outstanding balance of the loan. I also note Mr and     
Mrs M have been paid compensatory interest at 8% simple for the time they were out of 
pocket while repaying the loan.
So, taking everything into account I think the new offer from Santander effectively puts        
Mr and Mrs M in the financial position theyd be in if the PPI had not been sold.
If it hasnt already done so Santander should use the additional £1,828.64 to reduce the 
outstanding balance on the account. 
 My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I am satisfied the new offer from 
Santander UK Plc is fair and now places Mr and Mrs M in the position they would be in if the 
PPI had not been sold.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M and Mr M to 
accept or reject my decision before 23 June 2021.
