The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as P, complains that National Westminster Bank Plc
(NatWest) told it to apply for a Bounce Back Loan (BBL) having been informed by P that it
was no longer trading.
Ps complaint is brought to this service by one of its directors, whom Ill refer to as Mr R.
What happened
P held a business bank account and business credit account with NatWest. P had ceased
trading, having seen its business severely affected by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic,
and Mr R was planning on dissolving the company.
Mr R contacted NatWests business credit account team, who advised Mr R that once P was
officially showing as struck off, they would write off Ps credit account balance. However,
when Mr R then contacted NatWests business bank account team, he was told that
because of the overdrawn balance outstanding on Ps account, he should apply for a BBL on
Ps behalf and use the loan funds to clear Ps overdrawn balance.
Mr R had misgivings about NatWests instructions, but he applied to NatWest for the BBL as
requested and was approved for a BBL of £2,000. P used the funds to clear the overdraft
balance with NatWest and repay other creditors. However, when Mr R then attempted to
strike off P, NatWest wouldnt allow him to do so because of the outstanding BBL balance
owed by P. Mr R wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint on Ps behalf.
NatWest looked at Ps complaint. They didnt acknowledge that theyd told P to apply for a
BBL, and they noted that P had self-declared in the BBL application that it met the criteria
necessary for a BBL to be approved. As such, NatWest didnt feel that it had acted unfairly
towards P and didnt uphold the complaint. Mr R wasnt satisfied with NatWests response,
so he referred Ps complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at Ps complaint. But they didnt feel that it could reasonably
be confirmed that Mr R had acted under NatWests instructions when applying for the BBL
as he maintained. And our investigator also noted that P had benefitted from the BBL funds,
and so didnt feel that NatWest had acted unfairly in how theyd managed the situation. Mr R
remained dissatisfied, so Ps complaint was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 9 December 2022 as follows:
I note that the versions of events put forwards by Mr R and by NatWest as
to what happened here are in contradiction with one another, and also that NatWest 
havent been able to provide any recordings of what appears to be the crucial 
telephone call  when Mr R claims he was told by NatWest to apply for a BBL  or 
any notes of that call written by the NatWest agent who completed it.
In circumstances such as this, I have to decide  if I feel its reasonably possible for 
me to do so  what I think is most likely to have happened, on balance, and in 
consideration of all the information and evidence available to me. In this instance, 
this evidence consists of testimonies from Mr R and NatWest, as well as emails 
between Mr R and NatWest and between Mr R and Ps accountant. Finally, several 
recorded telephone calls have been provided to this service by NatWest, including Mr 
Rs call with NatWests business credit account team.
Assessing all this information, I arrive at the following timeline:
Mr R calls NatWest and speaks with their business credit account department. Mr R 
explains that P has ceased trading and is going to be dissolved. NatWests agent 
advises that once P shows as being officially dissolved, NatWest will write off the 
balance owed by P on the credit account. NatWests agent also explains to Mr R 
what specific forms Ps accountant would need to complete to achieve this. Notably, 
there is no mention from either Mr R or NatWests agent that P might or should apply 
for a BBL or any other form of borrowing.
On that same day, Mr R emails Ps accountant and details the conversation hed just 
had with NatWests business credit account team, including the specific forms that 
NatWests agent had said would need to be completed. Ps account responds that 
same day and confirms the form type advised by NatWest is correct. Again, notably, 
there is no mention of a BBL or any form of borrowing by Mr R or his accountant.
Five days later, NatWests business bank account team attempt to contact Mr R by
telephone, but without success. The team then send Mr R an email which reads as 
follows: 
I have tried to contact you today by telephone to discuss your business 
account. It's important I speak with you at the earliest convenience. Please 
could you reply back with the best time and number for us to call.
If you have been affected by Covid-19, I have attached a few hyperlinks in 
this email for you to view. They will direct you to the Bank's and the 
Government's websites where you will be able to see what support you might 
be eligible for.
The next day, Mr R called NatWest and speaks with an agent, who then transfers Mr 
R to another agent. This second agent wasnt the business banking team member 
that had sent the email asking Mr R to contact NatWest the previous day, and while 
NatWest have been unable to provide a recording of this telephone call, they have 
provided a copy of the email sent by the second agent following the call to the team 
member whod sent the email asking Mr R to contact them.
This email confirms that Mr R told the agent that P had been badly affected by the 
Covid-19 pandemic such that it has no income, and that Mr R was in the process of 
completing the forms needed to dissolve the company. The email also states that Mr 
R rejected the offer of potential assistance from one of NatWests specialist teams 
because there was no prospect of P recovering as a going concern. Finally, the email 
asks the other team member to call Mr R back and confirms Mr Rs telephone 
number for that other team member to do so. And once again, notably, there is no 
mention of a BBL or any other form of borrowing.The business bank account team member did call Mr R back as requested. But 
NatWest have confirmed that theres also no recording of this telephone call, as well 
as nothing on their systems, such as typed call notes by their agent, which confirms 
what was or wasnt said during this call.
This is unfortunate, because its during this telephone call  where Mr R was called 
back by NatWests agent  that Mr R has said that the agent wouldnt follow the 
example set by their colleague in the business credit account team, and write off the 
balance outstanding on the business bank account overdraft when Ps dissolvement 
was made official, and instead insisted that Mr R should take out a BBL on Ps behalf 
 even though Mr R made NatWests agent aware that P had no business income 
nor any predicted business income in the future.
NatWest have asked the agent in question here for their recollections of the call with 
Mr R. And while the agent hasnt been able to recall exactly what was said, theyve 
stated that if Mr R had informed them that P was no longer trading and had no 
income that they would have referred Mr R to one of their specialist support teams 
and that they most definitely wouldnt have told Mr R that he needed to apply for a 
BBL.
But its notable that the support team that NatWests agent says they would have 
referred Mr R to, is the same support team that the previous agent with whom Mr R 
spoke also referred Mr R to, but whose support Mr R rejected on the basis that there 
was no reasonable possibility that P would be able to continue as a going concern. 
Also, the fact that Mr R had declined the referral to that support team was explained 
by the other agent in the email sent to the business bank account team member who 
then called Mr R back.
Additionally, its evident from the email chain between Mr R and his accountant that 
following being called back by NatWest, Mr R then messaged his accountant and 
explained that the filing of the forms to dissolve P would have to be put on hold 
because NatWests business banking team werent taking the same approach as 
NatWests business credit account team and instead were insisting that Mr R apply 
for BBL on Ps behalf. And Mr R also states in his email to his account that he has 
concerns about applying for a BBL because he knows that P wont have any income 
to pay the BBL back.
All of which means that one of two things appear to have happened here. Either, 
after NatWests agent called Mr R back, Mr R then decided to apply for a BBL having 
seemingly not considered it before, with Mr R then sending an email to his 
accountant fabricating a story about how NatWest had told him he must apply for the 
BBL. Or, when NatWests agent called Mr R, that agent did either directly tell or 
strongly imply that Mr R must apply for a BBL on Ps behalf.
I find the second of these possibilities to be more plausible. There are several 
reasons for this, including that Mr R made no mention of taking a BBL prior to being 
called back by NatWests agent, and that he seemingly had no reason to apply for a 
BBL, given that Im satisfied hed already committed to dissolving P for the reasons 
outlined above.
Additionally, while Mr R can point to several things in support of his position, such as 
the emails and recorded telephone calls referred to above, there is correspondingly 
little firm evidence to support NatWests position. This is because theres no recording of the vital telephone call where Mr R was called back, or any note typed 
by NatWests agent at that time detailing that call.
And while NatWests agent has explained what he hypothetically would have said if 
Mr R had told him the information that he did, the agent hasnt been able to recall 
what he did actually say, having been told by Mr R that P had effectively ended as a 
going concern and was going to be dissolved.
As such, my position here is that I feel its more likely than not, in consideration of all 
the above, that NatWests agent did tell or strongly imply to Mr R that he should apply 
for a BBL on Ps behalf. And so, Ive thought about how this complaint should fairly 
be resolved having taken this position.
Matters are complicated by the fact that Mr R did then apply for a BBL on Ps behalf, 
despite his misgivings, and I acknowledge that ideally, Mr R should have simply 
refused to take this course of action. But as explained above, I feel its likely that Mr 
R did this following a conversation with NatWest in order to enable the outstanding 
business bank account overdraft balance to be cleared, on that understanding that 
after clearing that balance, NatWest wouldnt then block the planned dissolvement of 
P.
NatWest have highlighted several declarations on the BBL application form which 
they contend Mr R adhered to and confirmed by submitting the application, some of 
which refer to the applicant business not being in financial difficulty. For instance:
I/We confirm at the time of submitting this application, I am/we are not 
subject to a debt relief order or an individual voluntary arrangement, an 
undischarged bankrupt nor, if we are applying for the loan as a partnership, in 
a voluntary arrangement with my/our creditors nor in liquidation, or (in 
Scotland) subject to a debt management plan, debt payment plan, trust deed 
- whether protected or not - or an undischarged bankrupt.
I can appreciate NatWests concerns here, but at the time that Mr R made the BBL
application in Ps behalf, P wasnt subject to a debt relief order, an IVA, or in any form 
of voluntary arrangement with creditors. And its also notable that other declarations 
within the BBL application refer to the applicant company not being in financial 
difficulty on 31 December 2019  which P wasnt  while another declaration asks the 
applicant to confirm that the BBL funds will be used for business purposes, which 
was the case.
Notably, Mr R did declare Ps business turnover for 2019 to have been £10,000, 
which enable P to apply for the minimum BBL loan amount of £2,000  which Mr R 
then did. Its unclear whether Ps turnover for 2019 was indeed £10,000, or whether it 
might in fact have been higher. But I feel the fact that Mr R only applied for the lowest 
possible BBL amount aligns with my calculated opinion that Mr R applied for the BBL 
solely to satisfy NatWests requirements as told to him by NatWests agent  that the 
outstanding overdraft balance on the business current account must be repaid before 
NatWest would allow P to be dissolved.
All of which means that I do feel that NatWest have acted unfairly towards P here, 
and it follows that my provisional decision will be that Im upholding this complaint in 
Ps favour.
Ive thought about what would constitute a fair resolution here and having done so 
my provisional instruction to NatWest is that they must write off the BBL balance and allow P to be dissolved. In arriving at this position Ive considered what I feel should 
reasonably have happened  which is that when Mr R contacted NatWests business 
banking team they should have taken the same approach as was taken by NatWests 
business credit account team.
This would have resulted in Ps overdraft balance  which was approximately £300  
being written off, and in P being dissolved. And while I acknowledge that P has had 
the benefit of the BBL money, this money should never have been lent to P by 
NatWest, given that Mr R had explained to NatWest on multiple occasions before 
applying for a BBL that P had no income or any projected future income.
So, while my provisional instruction will result in NatWest now having to write off a 
larger balance than the business bank account overdrawn balance that I feel should 
have been written off, I feel that its the unfair actions of NatWest that are ultimately 
responsible for this, and I dont feel that P should incur any ongoing detriment or 
inconvenience as a result of those actions.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr R on Ps behalf and NatWest the opportunity 
to provide any comments or further information they might wish me to consider before I 
moved to issue a final decision. Mr R responded and confirmed that P was happy to accept 
my provisional decision. However, NatWest did provide some comments on my provisional 
decision which they asked me to consider.
NatWest began by stating that they felt the reason I had provisionally upheld this complaint 
was because they had been unable to provide a copy of the call recording in which Mr R 
claims he was advised to apply for the BBL by one of NatWests staff.
NatWests belief here is incorrect, and I can only refer them back to my provisional decision 
letter above, within which I explain that in the absence of a recording of the telephone call 
which would confirm exactly what was or wasnt said, Ive made a decision as to which 
version of what happened here  Mr Rs or Nationwides  I feel is most likely to have 
happened, given all the information thats available to me. In short, Im not saying what did 
happen, but what I feel is most likely to have happened. 
As also explained above, I feel that one of two things likely happened here. Either Mr R was 
told by a member of NatWests staff that he had to take a BBL, or Mr R decided himself to 
take a BBL. And, upon consideration, I find the first of these scenarios  that Mr R was told 
by a member of NatWest staff that he had to take a BBL  to be more likely.
One reason for this is that Mr R made no reference of a BBL in any correspondence with 
either NatWest or his accountant until after he spoke with NatWest about Ps business bank 
account, after which he sent his accountant an email stating that their previously discussed 
plans to dissolve P had to put on hold because NatWest were telling him he needed to take 
a BBL to clear Ps overdraft balance before P could be dissolved. 
If Nationwides version of what happened here is correct  that Mr R wasnt told he needed 
to take a BBL and arrived at that decision suddenly himself  then it seems to me that this 
would mean Mr R must have sent the email to his accountant that he did as a planned and 
deliberate fabrication, presumably with an eye to any potential future dispute and with the 
intention of protecting P  a company that was due to be dissolved  from having to repay a 
relatively small £2,000 BBL amount. This seems unlikely to me.
Instead, of the two plausible scenarios, I simply feel its more likely that one of Nationwides 
staff did tell Mr R that he needed to apply for a BBL, but that this isnt recorded, for whatever 
reason, in Nationwides files. And I also feel that Nationwide shouldnt have provided P with a BBL, even in light of the relaxed assessment criteria of a BBL at that time, given that Mr R 
had told them on several occasions prior to Ps application that P wasnt trading, had no 
income, and had no realistic chance of any future income. 
All of which means that my position here remains as described in my provisional decision 
letter above, and it follows therefore that I will be upholding this complaint in Ps favour on 
that basis.
Putting things right
NatWest must write off any BBL balance owed by P and allow P to be dissolved.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc on 
the basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask P to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 February 2023.
