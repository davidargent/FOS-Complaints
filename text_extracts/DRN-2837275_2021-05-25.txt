The complaint
Miss L is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wouldnt reimburse her under their 
Buyer Protection scheme for a purchase that she made.
What happened
On 29 August 2020, Miss L purchased car parts online from an overseas based trader. She 
made a payment of €2,135 using her PayPal account. The sellers website said that the 
parts would be delivered within 10 days. 
Miss L contacted the seller on 21 September 2020 as the parts hadnt been received. After 
some chasing, the seller replied on 24 September 2020 and told Miss L that the parts were 
ready to be shipped.
Miss L raised a case with PayPal on 30 September 2020 as the parts still hadnt been 
received. PayPal escalated the case to a claim on 1 October 2020. 
The parts were despatched by the trader on 6 October 2020 and tracking information was 
provided. They were finally delivered to Miss L on 14 October 2020. Miss L checked the 
parts but found that they wouldnt fit her vehicle as described. So, Miss L contacted PayPal 
again and changed the reason for her PayPal claim.
On 20 October 2020, Miss L emailed the seller who agreed to refund Miss Ls payment 
subject to returning the parts, with tracking and at her own cost. Miss L agreed. She 
contacted both the seller and PayPal again on 27 October 2020 to confirm that return 
shipping of the parts had been booked. Miss L confirmed their despatch to the seller on 29 
October 2020. The seller didnt respond to either of these emails.
Tracking information shows that the shipment was delivered on 9 November 2020, so Miss L 
emailed the seller to ask for her refund, but she didnt receive a reply. So, Miss L escalated 
her claim with PayPal. 
Despite numerous email exchanges and calls, PayPal refused her claim. So, she decided to 
complain to PayPal. They said that she had provided them with an invalid tracking number. 
They also said that her claim was declined because she had returned the items to the seller 
without involving them.
Miss L was unhappy with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators has considered Miss Ls complaint. He thought that PayPal hadnt 
acted fairly. He said that a fair resolution was for PayPal to refund €2,135 to Miss L in 
respect of the parts she had purchased and returned.
Having reviewed Miss Ls complaint, I reached a different outcome to that of our investigator. 
Because of that, I issued a provisional decision on 21 April 2021 giving both Miss L and 
PayPal the opportunity to respond to my findings below, before I reached a final decision.
In that decision, I said:
Miss L made her payment for the purchase in dispute here through PayPal and so 
shes seeking a refund under PayPals Buyer Protection scheme. Ive looked at the 
terms and conditions of this scheme to see whether Miss Ls claim met the relevant 
criteria here. These are available to view on their website. 
In Miss Ls case, she ordered car parts. Upon receipt they didnt fit the vehicle as 
specified. So, she has valid grounds to raise a claim for PayPal to consider here and 
she did so in line with the relevant terms, including the timeframe within which to 
raise a claim. 
Miss L contacted the seller by email on 20 October 2020 to explain the situation and 
agreement was reached for the parts to be returned, at Miss Ls expense and the 
seller would provide a full refund. So even at this stage, Miss L was willing to work 
with the seller to try and resolve the dispute directly.
Miss L returned the parts to the seller and paid for the return shipping costs herself. 
They didnt form part of her claim. She also confirmed to the seller when the parts 
had been shipped and she updated PayPal by telephone.
PayPal emailed Miss L on 12 November 2020 asking her to upload copies of emails 
from the seller. PayPals customer notes show that the requested items were 
provided on that date. So, it appears that Miss L met PayPals requirements here.
PayPals notes show they were seeking confirmation from the seller that theyd 
received the returned parts. They stated that the claim would be denied if there was 
no response. On 28 November 2021 their notes then state that Miss Ls claim had 
been denied as she had provided invalid return tracking details. But Miss L had 
provided everything that PayPal had requested. Shed asked what else they needed 
as shed provided them with all email exchanges with the seller, which included the 
tracking reference.
PayPal denied Miss Ls claim on the basis that she sent the item back to the seller 
without PayPals say. The tracking details provided are invalid. But from the 
information that Ive seen, it appears that Miss L kept PayPal fully informed in a 
timely manner. Our investigator was also able to download the proof of delivery from 
the shippers website using the consignment tracking number provided to PayPal. 
Miss L later received an email from the shipping company confirming that the parts 
had been delivered to the seller on 9 November 2020  this included the same proof 
of delivery that was available from the tracking number. Miss L may have provided 
this email to PayPal later than its terms allow, but that email confirmation itself shows 
that while PayPal may classify most items as lost after 60 days  they were shown 
that this one wasnt.
Based upon this, I cant see that PayPal took reasonable steps to confirm that the 
return delivery had been completed. They appear to have relied upon their own email 
approaches to the seller, who didnt respond. I also cant see any evidence to 
suggest that PayPal had previously requested further specific tracking details from 
Miss L. Neither had they requested any other information from her. 
PayPals Buyer Protection terms and conditions confirm that they can require a 
customer to provide information within a timeframe to be set by PayPal in order to 
qualify for protection under the scheme. However, there can be instances where 
rigidly following terms and conditions can lead to an unfair outcome.
My findings show that Miss L met all of PayPals requirements here. Shed asked 
them on a number of occasions if they required any more information. PayPal didnt 
ask for anything more from her. So, by denying Miss Ls claim under their Buyer 
Protection Scheme, its difficult to conclude that PayPal have treated Miss L fairly or 
reasonably here. I agree with our investigator, so to put things right, I believe that 
PayPal should refund €2,135. 
But I can also see that Miss L has invested considerable time and effort into resolving 
the matter. I can fully appreciate the inconvenience and distress that this might cause. So, I shall be asking PayPal to pay compensation to Miss L of £100 to reflect 
this.
Miss L responded to my provisional decision. She said that she didnt have any further 
evidence or comments to add.
PayPal didnt respond to my provisional decision with any new information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having given both Miss L and PayPal the opportunity to consider my provisional decision, 
neither party have provided me with anything that leads me to change my mind. So, my 
decision here will remain as detailed in my provisional decision of 21 April 2021.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold Miss Ls complaint.
I require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to.
Refund to Miss L €2,135 in relation to the parts purchased,
Pay compensation to Miss L of £100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 June 2021.
