The complaint
Mrs M complains that Covea Insurance plc mishandled her claim on her motor insurance 
policy. 
What happened
The subject matter of the claim and the complaint is a car first registered in January 2018. It 
had a diesel engine, automatic transmission and 5 doors. 
Mrs M bought it in March 2019 (according to a later policy schedule). Mrs M changed the 
registration for a cherished number plate.
Mrs M insured the car on a comprehensive policy with Covea for the year from May 2022. 
Mrs M was the policyholder. Her husband Mr M was a named driver.
Coveas policy wording said that the maximum it would pay was the market value, defined 
as follows:
The cost of replacing the car with one of the same make, model, age, mileage and 
condition as the car immediately before the loss or damage happened.
By mid-November 2022, the car had a recorded mileage of about 28,700. Unfortunately, in 
mid-November 2022, an accident seriously damaged the front of the car. Covea said the car 
was a total loss.
Mrs M complained to Covea about poor communication and about under-valuing the car.
By a final response dated early December 2022, Covea upheld the complaint about 
communication. But it turned down the complaint about valuation. Covea said it had obtained 
trade guide valuations as follows:
CAP £12,820.00
Auto Trader £13,080.00
Glasss £13,580.00
Cazoo £14,914.00 
Covea said that the market value of the car had been £13,771.33.
Mrs M brought her complaint to us in mid-December 2022.
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld in part. He thought that 
Covea had valued Mrs Ms car correctly. But he thought it unfair that she hadnt been given 
an interim payment whilst her complaint was investigated. He recommended that Covea 
should pay Mrs M 8% simple interest from the date of her settlement in addition to a 
valuation figure of £13,771.33.
Mrs M disagreed with the investigators opinion. She asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. She and her husband say, in summary, that:
The car had alloy wheels.
Market value should be established by what is actually for sale on the market, rather 
than by trade guides.
Their car was worth in excess of £15,000.
In late November and early December 2022, the lowest replacement prices they 
could find were £15,600.00.
In late January 2023, the figure was £15,190.00. 
Their solicitors have completed a statutory declaration. This document effectively 
proves (to any reasonable body) their position on market valuation is valid.
On Sunday 29 January 2023, they agreed to buy a car of the same model, with 
26,000 miles but registered in 2017 and with 3 doors and a petrol engine for a price 
of £13,950.00. This fell through as they did not have the funds until the Monday. Had 
they had the interim payment from Covea, they could have completed the purchase.
In early February 2023, they bought a car of the same model and with automatic 
transmission but registered in 2016 and with 3 doors and a petrol engine for a price 
of £13,495.00.
Covea also disagreed with the investigators opinion. It asked for an ombudsman to review 
the complaint. It says, in summary, that:
If it were to raise the payment for the vehicle, it would also need to release the 
vehicle to salvage. If this were done without the private plates being retained there 
would be a high possibility that the plates would be disposed of with the vehicle and 
then Mrs M would not be able to get the number back.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We expect an insurance company to value a used vehicle by reference to retail prices in 
certain trade guides. We usually find the guides persuasive as they are based on extensive 
nationwide research of likely selling prices. 
Compared to trade guides, we usually find advertisements less reliable as they include the 
sellers asking price, that may be negotiated downwards.
The statement of insurance in May 2022 said that Mrs M and her husband each had access 
to another vehicle. I find it likely that he had a car of his own and she was a named driver on 
his policy.
Ive noted the make, model, specification, year, mileage and condition of Mrs Ms car before 
the accident. 
Mrs M has said her car had special alloy wheels. But she hasnt provided enough evidence 
to show that. In any event, I find it unlikely  in the context of a 2018 car -  that they would 
add much if anything to the value of the car.Ive looked at all the advertisements Mr M has sent. I accept his statement that in November 
and December 2022, the lowest- priced comparable car he found was at £15,600.00.
I also accept his statutory declaration that in late January 2023, the lowest- priced 
comparable cars he found were at £15,190.00 and £15,400.00. But I note that each of them 
had a recorded mileage of under 28,000.
I wouldve expected Covea to make an interim payment to Mrs M when it became clear that 
the valuation was in dispute. Ive seen an email in which she said she wanted to keep the 
cherished registration number. 
Coveas final response acknowledged that it had failed to answer Mrs Ms email. So  
whatever it now says about disposing of the damaged car  Covea didnt make the position 
clear at the relevant time. Therefore I dont accept that it had a fair reason not to make an 
interim payment. 
From what Mr M has said, Covea still hadnt made an interim payment by late January 2023. 
But Im not persuaded that this was the reason why he and Mrs M didnt proceed with the 
purchase on Sunday 29 January. After all, Mr M has said that he had raised the money by 
the next day. And his bank statements show that he transferred £14,000.00 from one of his 
accounts to another on 30 January 2023.
On 1 February 2023, Mr M paid £13,495.00 for an alternative car. That car had a petrol 
engine and 3 doors. Also it was first registered in late September 2016. But (according to the 
sales invoice) it had a recorded mileage of less than 18,000, which is exceptionally low for a 
car of its age. In any event, I dont regard it as a close comparable for Mrs Ms old car. 
For a car like Mrs Ms as at November 2022, the investigator found retail valuations in the 
trade guides as follows:
CAP £12,795.00
Glasss £13,580.00
Cazoo £14,914.00
I dont regard the highest figure as so out of line with the lower two that I should disregard it 
as an outlier. However, I conclude that Coveas valuation of £13,771.33 fell within the range 
of the trade guide figures. So I dont find it unfair or unreasonable. And I dont find it fair and 
reasonable to direct Covea to increase that figure. 
Ive found that Covea had no fair reason not to make an interim payment. I accept that the 
lack of an interim payment delayed the purchase of a new car for Mrs M from November 
2022 to early February 2023, with adverse effects on her independence. However, Mrs M 
and her husband havent said that she no longer had access to his car.
I find it likely that the lack of an interim payment caused Mrs M upset and inconvenience. But 
much of that was to do with being kept out of her money. I consider that interest is 
compensation for loss of use of money. 
From a DVLA vehicle check, Ive seen that by late March 2023, it had transferred the 
cherished registration number to the replacement car. I find it likely that Mr M wouldve told 
us if Covea still hadnt paid the sum of £13,771.33. So I find it likely that Covea made such 
payment in February or March 2023. Putting things right
Overall, I find it fair and reasonable to direct Covea to pay interest at our usual rate on the 
sum of £13,771.33 from the date of Mrs Ms claim to the date of Coveas payment.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Covea Insurance plc to pay Mrs M simple interest at a yearly rate of 8% on the sum of 
£13,771.33 from the date of the claim to the date of Coveas payment. If Covea considers 
that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to take off income tax from that interest, it 
should tell Mrs M how much its taken off. It should also give her a certificate showing this if 
she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 June 2023.
