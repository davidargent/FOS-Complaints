K821x#15complaint
Mr M has complained about short-term  loans granted to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid. Mr M says he couldnt  afford these loans and that QuickQuid didnt  
take appropriate steps to check whether he could afford them when he took them out. 
background
QuickQuid agreed 16 short-term loans for Mr M between December 2014 and August 2016. 
The loans were  repayable over between one and three months.  
Several of Mr Ms loans were topped up, sometimes on more  than one occasion.  This is 
where he took out further borrowing under the same  agreement,  before paying  back the 
initial amount  borrowed.
He also re-financed two of his loans, this is where  he took out further borrowing, extending 
the term of the agreement, and rescheduling the remaining payments. Ive set out a 
summary of the lending  below.

One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Ms complaint already and recommended the 
complaint be upheld in part. He felt the checks QuickQuid carried  out on loans  1  3 were 
proportionate. But he thought that the checks carried  out from loan 4 onwards werent. 
However, due to limited  evidence being provided, he was unable  to say what  proportionate 
checks wouldve shown for loans 4 onwards. So he felt he had insufficient evidence to say 
that loans 4  6 should not have been agreed. 
However he thought  that it shouldve been  clear  to QuickQuid that by the time Mr M applied  
for loan 7, he was no longer using these  loans as a temporary fix to a short-term cash  flow 
problem, and they were  more likely  being  used to plug a hole in his finances. A hole that 
grew each month with the additional interest  he continued to repay. He therefore  thought  
QuickQuid shouldve realised that loans 7 onwards  were not sustainably  affordable  for Mr M 
at the time they were  approved, and that QuickQuid shouldve therefore not agreed to them.
QuickQuid disagreed with the findings. And Mr M raised no new arguments in response  to 
the adjudicators  assessment. So as no agreements been  reached at this stage, the case  
has come  to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision.
As it seems loans 1 - 6 are no longer in dispute,  my decision will focus on QuickQuids 
decision to approve  the remaining loans, loans  7 - 16.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and   
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time.  
QuickQuid initially said that it did conduct  appropriate and proportionate affordability
Assessments. It said these checks included analysing Mr Ms current financial 
commitments, insolvency records, delinquency records,  County  Court  judgments, credit  
enquiries and other  credit  accounts currently open. In addition, QuickQuid verified 
information obtained from Mr M, we also consider an applicants credit-scoring information  
from Credit Reference Agencies, plus various other  3rd party reports.
In response to the adjudicators assessment, which recommended loans 7  16 were upheld, 
QuickQuid said We started implementing changes to affordability assessment in June 2014 
and all the changes  were completed by Feb 28th 2015. Starting 1st March 2015  before Mr M 
borrowed his first loan, QuickQuid had implemented an affordability review that is consistent 
with the FCA Handbook  and that was in place  at the time we received authorisation by the 
FCA. We confirm  that this assessment was conducted properly and individually for each of 
these last loans.
Ref: DRN35561483QuickQuid has raised  this above generic  argument, both in response  to the adjudicators  
assessment, and in its initial file submissions.  But this service  has addressed this specific  
point by QuickQuid  in several previous  decisions,  so Im not going to expand  on it any further  
here. As by now, QuickQuid should be aware that my role is to look not only into the rules  
and regulations set by the regulator at the time of borrowing, but also the law, good  industry  
practice and all the available evidence and arguments, to help decide whether I think what 
the business has done is right or not. And in this case I dont think QuickQuid was right to 
provide Mr M with loans  7 onwards. Ill explain  why.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ms income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Ms complaint.  These questions are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr M would be able to repay  in a sustainable way?  If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr M would  have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Ms indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
1. Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks to satisfy  
itself that Mr M would be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would those  checks have 
shown that Mr M would have been able to do so?
Ref: DRN35561484As loans  1 - 6 are no longer in dispute, I havent  reconsidered the proportionality of the 
checks QuickQuid carried out on these loans as part of my assessment. And I havent 
recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 7 onwards either, because 
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why.
2. Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ms indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending.  Ive  looked to see if there  was a point at which 
QuickQuid should  reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think  that this point 
was reached around the time Mr M applied for loan 7. I say this because:
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid at this point. 
And was in effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an 
extended period
the amount  Mr M was borrowing had steadily been increasing, and QuickQuid ought 
to have realised it was likely his indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably 
I think that Mr M lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ms 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im upholding  Mr Ms complaint about loans 7 onwards,  because  the overall  pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr M in some 
other way.  
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
Ref: DRN35561485I think QuickQuid was wrong to have  approved  loans 7  16 including all top-ups on, and 
re-finances of these loans. So it needs to refund all of the interest and charges  Mr M paid 
towards these loans.
Specifically, it should:
-refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  7 to 16 including all top-ups  and 
re-finances; 
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple  from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*;
-remove any negative information  about loans 7 to 16 from Mr Ms credit file;
-the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 16 should be removed from 
Mr Ms credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Mr Ms complaint in part. 
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 July 2019.
