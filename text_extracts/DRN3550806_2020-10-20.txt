K821x#15complaint
Mrs W complains on behalf of the estate of Mr W. She says that New Day Ltd (trading as 
Debenhams Mastercard)  irresponsibly  provided  a credit card facility  to her late father. Mrs W 
also says NewDay provided  poor customer service  during the complaint process.
background
In June 2015, NewDay approved a credit card with a limit of £7,500  for the late Mr W. Mr W 
sadly passed away in March 2018  and at the time of his death there was an outstanding 
balance of around £2,604.
Mrs W on behalf of her fathers estate complained to NewDay,  she said her father was 81 
years old and vulnerable  at the time the credit  card was approved. Mrs W says that her 
father had a poor credit history as he was repaying historic debts and had previously 
defaulted on a credit facility with Debenhams.
Mrs W says during her communication with NewDay,  it didnt acknowledge her 
correspondence and the complaint points she raised hadnt been  properly investigated.  
NewDay accepts that it could have provided better  service and offered Mrs W £100  for the 
trouble & upset  it caused her. However,  NewDay didnt think  it was wrong to have approved 
the late Mr W for the credit  card.
The complaint was referred  to this service, where  one of our adjudicators looked at the 
complaint. She thought that NewDay had irresponsibly lent to the late Mr W as there were 
signs from its checks that suggested he was likely to struggle to repay. So, she 
recommended that the complaint should  be upheld, and the interest and charges paid 
towards the credit card be refunded to Mr Ws estate  plus statutory interest.
Mrs W on behalf of Mr Ws estate disagreed and said the NewDay was so reckless in its 
decision to lend to her late father and it needed to write off the outstanding  balance on the 
account.
As the complaint wasnt resolved, its been passed to me an ombudsman  to make a 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay needed to carry out proportionate  checks to satisfy  itself that the later Mr W could 
repay the credit it was approving for him. Having looked at the information  provided, I agree 
with the adjudicator that NewDay shouldnt have approved the credit it did for the late Mr W.
NewDays checks show that it thought the late Mr W was a high risk, with an income  of 
£1,600 and an outstanding balance of unsecure loan of around  £12,700.  It also appears 
from NewDays internal  notes that it was concerned about the risk in the lending  and took 
into account the late Mr Ws partners  income  something it shouldnt  have been doing as it 
wasnt a joint application. So even  without taking its checks further I think NewDay was 
reasonably aware  that the late Mr W likely couldnt afford the credit  it approved  for him. As a 
responsible lender, I dont think it should  have  lent to him. And it needs to put things right.
Ref: DRN35508062Should the outstanding balance be written off?
Mrs W has argued that the late Mr W was in in payment  arrangements with at least  three 
creditors, at the time NewDay  lent to him, which had been ongoing for several years.  She 
has also said that back in the 90s the late Mr W had defaulted on credit provided  by 
Debenhams and so NewDay  was reckless  to lend to him and the balance on the account 
should be written off.
Firstly, I think the default from the 90s is so long ago that I wouldnt expect NewDay to 
necessarily place a lot of weight  on this when it considered Mr Ws credit  application in 2015. 
Also, NewDay wasnt required to keep records from such a long time ago and so I wouldnt 
necessarily have expected it to make the connection  in those circumstances.
Also, the fact that the late Mr W was in payment arrangements with other  creditors  doesnt 
persuade me that the outstanding balance needs to be written off on that basis.  The 
repayments that the late Mr W was making  towards  these historic debts were  quite minimal 
and had been ongoing for a while. 
I think NewDay was irresponsible to lend to the late Mr W given what it found  from its 
checks, but I think the outstanding balance should  be repaid.
The late Mr W had access to the funds  to spend  as he pleased,  I appreciate  Mrs Ws point 
that her father spent  credit he obtained  on non-essentials which  he didnt need or use. But I 
havent seen evidence to suggest that NewDay should have been reasonably  aware of this 
and this use of credit doesnt  necessarily mean  that the late Mr W didnt  benefit  from the use 
of the credit  facility. 
I think in the circumstances, its fair that the principal outstanding be repaid. And so, I wont  
be asking NewDay to write off the debt.
The complaint handling process
I appreciate that Mrs W has likely had a difficult time trying  to sort out her late fathers  
financial affairs. NewDay  has acknowledged that it could  have  done  better  with the service it 
provided to her during the complaint  process  and has offered £100 for the trouble and upset 
caused. If Mrs W wishes to accept  the offer, shell need to contact NewDay  directly to do so. 
Putting things  right  what  NewDay needs to do
Refund all interest,  fees and charges  applied  to the account  from when  it was 
opened;
NewDay may apply the refund to the outstanding balance on the account;
if theres surplus after applying the refund to the outstanding  balance,  NewDay 
should add 8% simple  interest  to the surplus  and pay it to the estate of Mr W;
if after applying the refund to the outstanding balance, theres still a balance 
outstanding, NewDay  should work with the estate of Mr W to agree an arrangement  
for payment.
Ref: DRN35508063my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding the complaint on behalf of the estate of 
Mr W and require NewDay Ltd to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs W on behalf of 
the estate of Mr W to accept or reject my decision before 20 November 2020.
