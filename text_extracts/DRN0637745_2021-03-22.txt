K821x#15complaint
Miss T complains that the amount of credit  she had from J D Williams & Company Limited 
was unaffordable to her.
background
Miss T opened two accounts with JDW in June 2012, with a credit  limit of £200 on each.  She 
continued to make purchases  on Account  S*610  until July 2016.  Her credit limits were 
increased periodically by JDW as follows:

Miss Ts representative says further  lending should not have been facilitated as the 
repayments were unaffordable based on her income and expenditure and her debt with 
other lenders. It says Miss T had a history of late or missed payments and that JDW did not 
carry out appropriate checks of her financial  history.
JDW says it assessed Miss Ts credit  limit increases using information from credit  reference 
agencies. It says she initially had a very small account limit which increased over time based 
on how Miss T managed  her account. It says her payment record indicated  she was able to 
maintain her payments. JDW adds that when Miss T contacted it to advise of her financial 
difficulties, it agreed a payment plan with a debt management charity and froze the interest 
charges. It says the account was passed to a third-party  debt collector in January  2018.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She wasnt satisfied that 
JDWs checks  were good enough but didnt  have enough evidence to show  what better  
checks would have  shown  for the credit increases on account S*610  in 2012 and 2013. 
However, by December 2014  she considered JDW should reasonably have realised that 
further lending  was likely to have been unsustainable  and that account S*610  was now 
unsuitable for her. 
Ref: DRN06377452Our adjudicator said JDW should:
Remove any interest and charges (including delivery costs and insurance premiums)  
added to the account since  22 December  2014;
Calculate how much  Miss T owed after the above adjustments  and any repayments 
shes made since this date should  reduce the adjusted balance;
oIf this clears the adjusted balance  any funds  remaining should be refunded to 
Miss T with 8% simple  interest  - calculated from the date of overpayment to 
settlement date;
oIf an outstanding  balance remains, JDW should  look to set up a suitable 
payment plan with her for the outstanding amount.
Remove any negative  information about the account from Miss Ts credit file from 22 
December 2014 onwards  once the amount owed has been  settled;
As the account  was passed to a third party, JDW may need to liaise  with them  to 
ensure the above  is carried out.
Miss T responded to say, in summary, that she was experiencing  financial  difficulties  from 
2012 and forwarded bank  statements from this time as evidence  of such.
JDW said its strategy  ensured it was acting in Miss Ts best interests by giving her a very 
small credit limit initially  which  was only increased  by a modest amount each time based on 
her management of her account. It said that after the small initial  increases, Miss Ts credit 
limit on account S*610 was not increased again  for 27 months. JDW  said Miss Ts payment 
record showed she was spending in line with her circumstances and affordability and her 
balance did not go much above £1,000 at any time. It adds that it used internal data as well 
as external credit reference agencies to assess each credit  limit increase and her credit file 
showed no negative  information.
JDW also says that Miss Ts payments were on time for the first 45 months (with one 
exception) and were often  above  the minimum required. It maintains that the checks it 
carried out were proportionate to the level of credit being provided  and that Miss T only used 
up to 54% of the credit limit.
The complaint has now come to me to review and resolve. To be clear, I am only 
considering whether or not JDW ought  to have increased the credit limits on Miss Ts 
accounts, not whether the accounts should  have  been opened in the first place and an initial 
credit limit agreed. 
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Miss T and to JDW on 3 March  2021. I wasnt satisfied that 
JDW completed  appropriate and proportionate  checks because:
I saw no evidence that JDW asked Miss T about  her income  or expenditure;
Miss Ts credit limit increased by a factor  of five  from £400  in June 2012 to £2,000  
in June 2013 and then more than doubled  from December 2014  to July 2016;
JDWs credit check showed a 2009  default  and evidence of some  late payments;
Miss Ts payment history showed  she was often paying the minimum repayments 
and was sometimes late in paying;
JDW says it used credit checks and account management information to make  credit 
limit decisions  but didnt mention Miss Ts income or expenditure was considered.
Ref: DRN06377453I then considered what JDW was likely to have found had it carried out proportionate checks.
September 2012 to June 2013
Miss T provided  a bank statement from December 2012 which I considered  could be used 
as a reasonable proxy for what  better  checks may have shown in the first year.
Based on the information I had, I thought it likely, that, even with better checks, JDW  would 
have considered the credit limits to be affordable to Miss T from September 2012  to June 
2013. So I couldnt conclude JDW was wrong to approve the credit limit increases it did.
December 2012  to December 2014
Miss Ts accounts were  well-managed from December 2012 to May 2014 and her balance 
reduced to around  £80 by May 2014.  However, it then increased to £270 by the end of 2014,  
at which  point JDW increased  Miss Ts credit  limit from £1,000 to £1,600. As before, I wasnt  
satisfied JDW had carried out proportionate checks,  so I looked at bank  statements from the 
time. Miss T also provided evidence of a debt management plan from November 2014.
I thought proportionate  checks  would  have indicated Miss T was struggling  to manage her 
money and that JDW was irresponsible to have increased her credit limit at that time. 
Indeed, I found  that the checks would have shown JDW that it should not have allowed 
further purchases on credit and that it should  have frozen Miss Ts account at that point.
January 2015  to July 2016
By December 2015 Miss Ts balance had increased  to £800 as she continued to make 
minimum repayments. She then missed  payments in December 2015,  January 2016 and 
February 2016 and incurred  late payment fees as a result.  Although she then made a 
payment, further  late fees were charged  in April and May 2016, and the balance  was almost 
£900 when JDW increased her credit  limit from £1,600 to £2,250 in July 2016.
Based on Miss Ts management of her account, I considered JDW  should have realised, or 
ought reasonably  to have realised, that Miss T was already struggling to manage her money 
and it was irresponsible to extend  her further  credit  in July 2016.
So I couldnt  conclude  JDW was wrong to increase Miss Ts credit limit to June  2013.  But I 
found it was irresponsible to have increased  her limit in December 2014 and July 2016. Also,  
I considered it likely proportionate checks in December 2014 would have found Miss T was 
struggling to manage  her money and shouldnt have been allowed further credit purchases.
Neither JDW,  nor Miss T, responded to my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I need to take into account the relevant 
rules, guidance  and good industry practice  as outlined in my provisional decision.
As neither party provided any additional  information,  I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional decision.
Ref: DRN06377454my final decision
My decision  is that J D Williams & Company Limited should:
Remove all interest and charges  including delivery fees and insurance premiums 
(should there be any)  added to the account since December 2014;
Calculate how much  Miss T would have owed  after the above  adjustments  with any 
repayments since this date being  used  to reduce the adjusted  balance;
oIf this clears the adjusted balance  any excess should be refunded to Miss T 
with 8% simple interest* - calculated  from payment date to settlement  date;
oIf a balance remains, JDW should aim to agree  an affordable repayment plan;
Remove any negative  information about the account from Miss Ts credit file from 22 
December 2014 onwards  once the amount owed has been  settled;
Liaise  with the third-party  debt collection agency to ensure the above happens.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires JDW to take off tax from this interest.  JDW must give 
Miss T a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. If JDW intends to 
apply the refund to reduce  any outstanding  capital  balance, it must do so after deducting  tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 April 2021.
