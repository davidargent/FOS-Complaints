The complaint
Mr M is unhappy Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) hasnt reimbursed him for his loss after he fell 
victim to a scam.
What happened
Towards the end of 2019 Mr M was looking to make an investment and found a company 
(L) online. Mr M believed L would be helping him invest in bitcoin, providing him advice on 
how he should invest his money.
Mr M downloaded remote access software under Ls instruction so it could see what trades 
he was making and take over where necessary. He believed this was allowing L to show him 
the investments and the profit he was making and allowed them to instruct Mr M when using 
various crypto currency trading platforms it had instructed him to open accounts with.
He started by making a payment of around £210 to one of the crypto currency platforms and 
he received a return of around £200. This persuaded Mr M to continue.
Within around six months Mr M sent around £97,000 to the scammers. Mr M made the 
following payments:
Date Amount
5 December 2019 £213.66
12 December 2019 £2,193.56
17 December 2019 £4,418.91
11 February 2020 £10,000
13 February 2020 £8,640.06
18 February 2020 £8,596.97
25 February 2020 £8,654.06
10 March 2020 £22,542.83
11 March 2020 £22,739.68
15 May 2020 £9,218.29
27 July 2020 £14,000
Total £111,218.02
Scammers informed him his account balance was between £200,000 and £300,000 but 
around July 2020 told him he was losing £20,000 - £30,000 per day. Shortly after this the 
account Mr M could access showed his account balance was almost £0. He tried to contact 
L but was unable to.
Mr M then said he researched online any other companies that might be able to help him get 
his money back. He contacted company S which he believed specialised in obtaining funds 
individuals had lost as the result of a scam. He provided the details of his situation and the 
company he thought hed been working with. He then received an email he believed to be 
from L which seemingly confirmed S had been able to obtain all his losses via a court order.
Mr M was told in order to get his money back he needed to make a payment of £14,000 to a 
crypto currency platform he opened under Ss instruction. He says someone from S then 
hacked this account and removed the money from it.
He reported the situation to Lloyds which initially told Mr M it couldnt help as it had 
misunderstood his circumstances and thought his claim related to purchasing bitcoin which 
hed legitimately received rather than hed been the victim of a scam. Overall, it didnt feel it 
was liable for the payments Mr M made to the scammers although it acknowledged it 
couldve done more to help him when he originally reported the scam. It offered him £300 in 
acknowledgement of the trouble and upset caused.
In the case of the money hed sent via bank transfer to international accounts, it contacted 
the beneficiarys banks, but in the case of all payments the money couldnt be returned. The 
first payment Mr M made  for around £210  was made by card. But Lloyds explained it 
was unable to carry out a successful chargeback as under the relevant schemes rules, the 
service hed paid for had been successful as hed been able to credit his crypto currency 
account as intended.
I issued my provisional decision earlier in July 2022. In summary I said that:
I thought the payment Mr M made on 11 February 2019 was significantly unusual 
enough that Lloyds ought to have intervened to check he wasnt at risk of fraud or a 
scam. I thought it was significantly higher in value than payments he was generally 
making at the time as well as being a foreign transaction which wasnt something 
Mr M usually carried out.
Had Lloyds intervened and sufficiently questioned Mr M about the payments I 
thought it likely wouldve recognised hed fallen victim to a scam. I said this because I 
think it wouldve been clear to Lloyds Mr M didnt have a clear idea of what he was 
investing in, how the investment worked and hadnt carried out any due diligence into 
the company he was paying. And although he was making payments to his own 
cryptocurrency account, given the prevalence of scammers using this type of account around the time, I think Lloyds ought to have recognised that this didnt automatically 
mean the payments were legitimate.
Although I felt Lloyds had missed an opportunity to prevent the payments Mr M made 
from 11 February 2019, I also thought he shared liability for his loss. It didnt appear 
Mr M had carried out any research into the type of investment he was making or the 
company he was dealing with. Had he searched online I think it wouldve been clear 
the situation was likely a scam. He also described the company as pushy and 
pressuring him to invest more and more, downloaded software that gave them 
access to his devices and had to open third party trading accounts under their 
instruction. Overall I didnt think a reasonable person would expect a legitimate 
broker to operate like this and Mr M ought reasonably to have recognised something 
was amiss.
Mr M had also searched the company online part way through the payments he 
made and despite the poor reviews he said he saw, accepted that these were just 
disgruntled investors and continued to make payment to them. I also didnt think it 
was reasonable overall that when he recognised hed been the victim of a scam, he 
then paid significant amounts to a second scammer to try and retrieve the funds 
before he contacted more trusted sources like his bank or the financial regulator.
I thought about whether I thought Lloyds had done enough to try and recover the 
funds when it was made aware of the scam. And although it didnt act as promptly as 
it ought to have done, in the case of each payment the beneficiarys bank was unco-
operative. I didnt think it was likely this wouldve been any different had they been 
contacted earlier so I didnt think Lloyds delay caused Mr M a loss.
Mr M responded to my provisional decision. He explained hed already provided all the 
evidence he was able to in this case and had nothing further to add. Lloyds didnt respond by 
the deadline provided.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has provided any new information for me to consider in this case, I havent 
departed from the conclusions in my provisional decision  which Ive summarised above.
I think Lloyds missed an opportunity to prevent Mr M from making payments to scammers 
from 11 February 2019, but, I also think Mr M has contributed to his loss as I think he 
reasonably ought to have done more to check the payment he was making were genuine.
Putting things right
For the reasons given, I think Lloyds is partially liable for Mr Ms loss from the third payment 
he made to scammers. It should reimburse 50% of his loss from this point (£52,195.95). Mr M has explained that £43,555.89 of this money came from his savings account. Lloyds 
should apply simple interest of 0.2% (the account rate) to this amount from the date of each 
payment to the date of settlement.
Hes said that the payment of £8,640.06 (made on 13 February 2020) was money borrowed 
from a family member. So I dont think its appropriate in the circumstances for Lloyds to pay 
interest on the 50% reimbursement of this payment.
It should also pay him the £300 previously offered for the way it dealt with his initial query.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require Lloyds Bank PLC to pay Mr M the redress Ive outlined 
above. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to 
accept or reject my decision before 16 September 2022.
