The complaint
Mrs A complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) didnt refund her for an item she 
returned to the seller.
What happened
Mrs A purchased an item in US Dollars, through PayPal, from an overseas company. When 
the item arrived it wasnt what Mrs A was expecting. Mrs A contacted PayPal and it started a 
buyer protection claim.
Mrs A was advised to return the item, at her expense, which she did. Mrs A sent PayPal the 
tracking details for the return. When PayPal checked this, the item hadnt been delivered, it 
was still waiting in the UK.
PayPal asked Mrs A to send the receipt for the postage, but Mrs A didnt respond to this 
request. PayPal had already refunded the postage costs to Mrs A but it closed the buyer 
protection claim and didnt refund Mrs A for the item.
PayPal says it did this because Mrs A didnt respond to its request for further information.
Unhappy with the lack of refund Mrs A brought her complaint to this service. An investigator 
looked into things and thought PayPal should refund Mrs A for the item.
The investigator understood PayPals decision not to refund, at the time, but the item had 
since been delivered back to the seller. The investigator felt this was new and compelling 
evidence PayPal hadnt considered before.
And since Mrs A was now left with no item and no refund the investigator felt this was unfair.
Mrs A agreed with the investigators assessment, but PayPal didnt. PayPal said Mrs A didnt 
respond to a reasonable request for information and hadnt appealed its decision. PayPal 
asked for an ombudsman to decide things.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres no dispute Mrs A returned the item. And theres now no dispute the item has been 
delivered to the seller. I have to decide if its now fair for PayPal to refund Mrs A for the item.
PayPal asked Mrs A to return the item to the seller, and she did. PayPal checked the 
tracking details and the item hadnt left the UK. PayPal asked for the receipt Mrs A got when 
she returned the item but Mrs A didnt respond to this request.
PayPals user agreement says users need to respond to PayPals request for documentation 
within the time limit. I dont think PayPal did anything wrong when it asked Mrs A for the 
receipt. And I dont think PayPal was wrong to initially decline the buyer protection claim.
Mrs A should have responded to PayPal when it asked for the receipt. PayPal wanted to see 
Mrs A had returned the item to the correct address.
But Mrs A had already contacted PayPal to query the address as it wasnt in the Latin 
alphabet. I think PayPal should have been fairly confident Mrs A had returned the item to the 
correct address.
PayPals user agreement also mentions appeals, it says users may be able to appeal if you 
have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination.
PayPal refused to refund Mrs A because it couldnt see the item had been delivered. It took 
some considerable time for the item to leave the UK, and this wasnt Mrs As fault. But the 
item did eventually leave the UK and it was delivered back to the seller.
This proof of delivery is new information. PayPal would have refunded Mrs A had she proved 
delivery when she first raised her buyer protection claim. I think it follows its fair to refund 
Mrs A now PayPal has proof the items been delivered back to the seller.
I dont think PayPals position has changed here. PayPals refunding Mrs A following the 
item being provably returned to the sender  the fact this refund is coming some time after 
the buyer protection claim was started isnt, I think, a reason not to refund.
In response to the investigators assessment PayPal said Mrs A had never raised an appeal. 
But Mrs A did complain to PayPal about her lack of refund. And Mrs A brought her complaint 
to this service.
I think both these things were a fair indication Mrs A wasnt satisfied with the fact shed not 
been refunded. I think PayPal had the opportunity to log an appeal earlier than now, if it 
chose not to I dont think thats a fair reason to not refund Mrs A now.
My final decision
My final decision is PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must:
refund Mrs A the full amount debited from her PayPal account in respect of this 
purchase
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2021.
