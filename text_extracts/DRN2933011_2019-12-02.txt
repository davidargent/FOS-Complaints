K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs R complain that Link Market Services Trustees Limited wrongly  sent him a letter  
stating that as Mrs R had died it was enclosing  information about  how to transfer  her shares.  
They dont accept  its offer of £150  for this distressing error.
background
An investigator at this service said that Link had made an honest mistake,  promptly 
apologised and sought to find out why this error had occurred. Given  this, he felt its offer was 
fair and reasonable. He thought Mr and Mrs Rs expectation of 4,000  to 5,000 Euros  was far 
outside what this service would typically award  for an error  of this nature.
Mr and Mrs R did not agree, saying they had spent a lot of time and money pursuing this 
mistake and the subsequent complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  In this case I agree with the investigator 
and for the same  reasons.
Ive no doubt Mr and Mrs R were  very upset  to receive this letter, but it was an obvious  
mistake which  Link immediately acknowledged  and apologised for. Ive seen nothing to 
suggest Mr R spent  a significant amount of money  in pursuing this issue  resolved and, in 
general, we do not compensate complainants for the time it takes to pursue a complaint.
I am satisfied that Links offer of £150  was broadly in line with what this service would have 
awarded in these circumstances.
my final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs R to 
accept or reject my decision  before  2 January  2020.
