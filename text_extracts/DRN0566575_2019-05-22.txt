One of our adjudicators assessed  Mr Rs complaint. He didnt think  that QuickQuid  was 
wrong to give Mr R loans one and two but said that it shouldnt  have given  him loans 
three to 13. The adjudicator set out what QuickQuid should do to put matters  right.  
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator. As the complaint hasnt  been  resolved 
informally, its been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide. 
In April 2019, QuickQuid  waived the remaining balance on one of Mr Rs loans and removed 
adverse entries  about that loan from Mr Rs credit  file. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice, this means that it should have  carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mr R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN05665752But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan repayments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and, in particular, the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
Before the loans, QuickQuid asked Mr R about his monthly income and expenditure, 
including other  credit commitments and it says that it validated the information Mr R gave. It 
also carried out credit checks. It seems  to me that there was nothing  to indicate  that loans 
one and two were unsustainable. Given Mr Rs apparent disposable  income and his history  
with the lender at that stage, I dont think that QuickQuid was wrong  to give Mr R loans one 
and two.  
Proportionate checks for loans three  onwards  would  most likely  have  shown that Mr R 
couldnt afford to repay further borrowing. I say this because at the time Mr R applied for 
loan three  he had shown signs that he was struggling to repay  loan two. Mr R should have 
repaid loan two in three payments ending in early  August 2015 but he took considerably 
longer to repay loan two  over four months.  In these  circumstances,  I think there was a 
significant risk Mr R wouldve been unable to sustainably meet his repayments for loan three 
and any subsequent loans. This was borne out, as Mr R incurred late fees in relation to 
loans three,  six and seven. 
Ref: DRN05665753Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
six. Thats because:
By loan six, Mr Rs overall pattern of borrowing suggested he had become 
persistently reliant on short-term loans. Mr R had taken out six loans in a 10 month 
period in the first year. From loan six onwards, the amounts Mr R was borrowing 
increased. From then, with one exception,  Mr Rs borrowing either increased or 
stayed the same  as the previous loan. The pattern of lending itself shows that the 
loans from loan six were unsustainable   so I dont think  QuickQuid  should  have 
given Mr R any of loans  from loan six onwards.  
Mr R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid. Loan  13 
was taken out over three and a half years  after Mr Rs first loan with QuickQuid. And 
it was for a much larger amount than the amounts Mr R had initially  borrowed. Mr R 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service an intermittent debt to 
QuickQuid over an extended period.
I think that Mr R lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from loan three 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The sheer number  of loans and late payments were likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Rs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans three to 13.
Ref: DRN05665754putting things right 
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Mr R from loan three  onwards.  So, for 
loans three  to 13, QuickQuid should: 
Refund all interest  and charges Mr R paid on loans three to 13.
Reduce the refund by the amount  of any capital that formed part of the balance that it 
has already waived and pay any remaining balance to Mr R.
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any remaining balance paid to Mr R, from the 
dates he made the payments to the date of settlement*. 
Remove any negative  information about loans three to five from Mr Rs credit file. 
Remove all entries about loans  six to 13 from Mr Rs credit  file, as I think  that the 
number of loans  taken from loan six onwards means  any information  recorded  about 
them is adverse.   
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Rs complaint  in part. CashEuroNet UK LLC,  
trading as QuickQuid,  should pay Mr R compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 June  2019.
