The complaint
Mr F says Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money sent him a default notice, and 
some other correspondence, by post. He says that he suffers from mental health issues and 
receiving these letters caused him distress. He would like to receive communications by 
email or in a telephone call and not by post. 
What happened
In March 2000 Mr F took a loan from 118 118 Money. He borrowed £2,000 and he was due 
to make 24 monthly repayments of £129.41. 
Mr F had difficulty repaying this loan. I wont go into all of the details about this here as Mr F 
and 118 118 Money are both aware of them. But briefly:
Mr F was not working from April 2020, and so he was unable to make repayments 
towards his loan.
In June 2020 Mr F informed 118 118 Money that he was working with a debt 
management organisation and he would be able to repay £40 a month. 118 118 
Money agreed to this, but Mr F was unable to repay this amount consistently. 
In September 2020 118 118 Money informed Mr F that his loan account was being 
handled by their specialist support team. Relevant to this complaint is that he would 
not receive routine communications. He would only receive the communications that 
118 118 Money was required to send. And Mr F and the business would contact 
each other by phone. 
Mr F and 118 118 Money have agreed repayment plans in November 2020 and 
April 2021. But Mr F has been unable to consistently repay the agreed amounts. 
Much of the contact Mr F has had with 118 118 Money has been over the phone but 118 118 
Money has sent Mr F some letters and it is these that his complaint centres on. 118 118 
Money says the following letters were sent:
Two notices of sums in arrears sent in February and August 2021. 
An annual statement sent in March 2021.
A notice of default sent in August 2021. 
118 118 Money has looked at Mr Fs complaint and it didnt uphold it. It said that it has 
accommodated Mr Fs circumstances as far as it is able. And it says that it is required under 
the consumer credit act to send, in paper form, information about the arears and the default 
notice. 
Our investigator looked into Mr Fs complaint and also didnt uphold it. He took into 
consideration Mr Fs concerns about the Equality Act 2010 and what 118 118 Money had to 
do to treat Mr F fairly overall. He didnt think that the business had acted unfairly or 
unreasonably. 
Mr F didnt agree, and he asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He 
didnt raise any new issues at this point. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about lending - including all of the relevant 
rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Mr F has said that 118 118 Money should make reasonable adjustments for him due to his 
disabilities as it is required to do under the Equality Act of 2010. 118 118 Money does need 
to abide by the terms of this act. But it also has to have regard to the other laws, rules and 
regulations that exist. For example, there is a requirement in the Consumer Credit Act for 
lenders to send some information by letter. And there is also the requirement by the industry 
regulator for 118 118 Money to, for example, treat its customers fairly. 
Given all of these laws, rules and regulations, I think the approach the investigator took to 
look at this situation was the right one. That is has 118 118 Money treated Mr F fairly and 
reasonably here. And this is what I have also thought about. 
As Ive outlined above, in addition to the mental health problems Mr F has, he was also 
unable to work shortly after the loan was advanced. But I can see that 118 118 Money acted 
positively towards him at this time and tried to work with him, and his debt management 
organisation, to help him pay what he could. It also tried to communicate with him in a way 
that was easiest for him. For example, by not sending him routine correspondence and using 
its dedicated support department to handle communications with him.  
But 118 118 Money does still have to send Mr F important information about his loan 
accounts. And as its noted, it needs to send these in letter format. This is to ensure that 
Mr F is in receipt of this information. Given the nature of the information it sent by letter, I 
dont think it was wrong to do this. 
And looking at the overall way 188 188 Money has treated Mr F, over the time he has 
complained about, I dont think that it has treated him unfairly or unreasonably. 
I can see that Mr F feels strongly about this issue, and Im sure he hasnt found the 
complaint process easy. But I hope he finds my explanation helpful and my decision doesnt 
cause him any undue distress. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im not upholding Mr Fs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 April 2022.
