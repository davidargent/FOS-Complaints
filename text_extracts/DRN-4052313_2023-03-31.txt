The complaint
Mrs Bs representative has complained, on her behalf, about a pension sum of £65,000 
which was lost during the process of transferring it from her self invested personal pension 
(SIPP) plan with IPS Pension Limited, trading as James Hay Partnership, to Cofunds 
Limited, trading as Aegon. 
The delays in locating her pension funds meant that a significant amount of her pension 
assets was left in cash until it was transferred to a new SIPP provider in May 2021.
What happened
James Hay received an instruction to transfer £65,000 from Mrs Bs James Hay SIPP to her 
Aegon General Investment Account (GIA) on 10 December 2020. This was for a further 
contribution to an existing investment, for which required James Hay was required to 
countersign. James Hay then sent this payment to Aegon on 16 December 2020. However, 
Aegon said James Hay hadnt provided the correct forms, and so the payment would be 
returned on 31 December 2020. 
Unfortunately, this didnt happen. Mrs Bs representative contacted Aegon in January 2021 
and was told the money had been returned to James Hay due to an incorrect reference 
number. The representative then raised a complaint with James Hay on 22 January 2021 
about this missing money.
James Hay contacted Aegon on 26 January 2021 and was told the money had been 
returned as Aegon had been unable to match the reference number. James Hay then 
attempted to locate the money on its own systems, as it believed the money had been 
returned to it.
On 19 February 2021, James Hay received a transfer form, requesting that Mrs Bs entire 
SIPP be transferred to Standard Life. James Hay emailed Mrs Bs representative on 26 
February 2021 requesting an instruction to trade form, in addition to any application forms 
Aegon may require. However, James Hay used an incorrect email address to contact Mrs 
Bs representative. As a result, this request for information wasnt picked up.
Mrs Bs representative then contacted James Hay on 8 March 2021 to enquire about the 
missing £65,000 and the status of the transfer. These issues were escalated, the correct 
email address was provided, and the request sent again on 9 March 2021. James Hays 
banking team also confirmed that it had investigated and could find no evidence that the 
£65,000 had been returned to it by Aegon.
The necessary information to continue with the transfer was then sent to James Hay on 12
March 2021. This was then sent to Aegon to move all the funds into the SIPP bank account 
on 17 March 2021.
James Hay had also contacted Aegon on 16 March 2021 to request evidence that the 
£65,000 had been returned to it. Aegon said its system didnt show any record of the money 
being returned, but that it would investigate further. On 17 March 2021, it emailed saying the 
money had been returned to James Hay on 31 December 2020.
On 26 March 2021, James Hay received £454,383 which was placed into the SIPP bank
account. However, as it hadnt yet received the £65,000, it couldnt complete the requested 
full cash transfer. On 4 April 2021, Aegon then confirmed it had located the £65,000 which 
was still with it. It explained it had been placed under a different plan number. It confirmed on 
12 April 2021 that the £65,000 had been placed into Mrs Bs GIA.
Although James Hay had sent the full disinvestment instruction on 17 March 2021, Aegon 
said a new instruction would be required to disinvest the £65,000. James Hay questioned 
this and asked if the recent instruction could be used, but Aegon confirmed on 23 April 2021 
that the new instruction would be required. However, James Hay didnt let Mrs Bs 
representative know about this requirement until 12 May 2021, when James Hay sent it the 
application forms.
The completed forms were received on 14 May 2021 and were sent to Aegon on 24 May 
2021.
On 25 May 2021, James Hay executed a partial transfer to Standard Life of the £545,089 
which was already available. The disinvestment of the remaining amount was completed and 
£64,998 was received on 1 June 2021. The money was then transferred on 4 June 2021.
In its final responses of 27 May 2021 and 25 August 2022, James Hay said that it didnt 
believe it was responsible for the £65,000 going missing and that it also wasnt responsible 
for the delays caused when trying to locate it. 
Mrs B wasnt satisfied with the responses to her complaint, so it was referred to our service 
for an independent review.
The first investigator to review the matter didnt think the complaint should be upheld, saying 
in summary that the confusion regarding the whereabouts of Mrs Bs pension funds hadnt 
stemmed from James Hay, and as such he didnt think the complaint should be upheld.
Mrs Bs representative rejected that assessment, saying that the investigator had only 
considered the loss of the £65,000, but the issues to consider were James Hays failure to 
adhere to its own requirements, as set out in the plans terms and conditions, namely to 
keep accurate records, process contributions and transfers and to carry out services it 
deemed necessary to effectively manage the SIPP. James Hay had failed on each count, 
the representative said. It had failed in losing control of the pension funds and then in its 
attempts to recover the situation, it added.
The further matters which therefore needed consideration were the service levels provided in 
recovering the situation, James Hays promise to accept full responsibility for any financial 
loss, and why it had needed so many contacts and chasers to push for a successful 
conclusion.
The investigator wasnt persuaded to change his view, however, saying in summary that he 
had considered the level of service as a whole, which included the issues surrounding the 
lost £65,000, and whether James Hay could reasonably be found to be responsible for the 
delays in locating it  along with the amount of chasing which Mrs Bs representative had 
said needed to happen before the matter was resolved. And although he noted that James 
Hay had said that it would compensate Mrs B for any investment losses incurred by delays it 
had caused, he reiterated his view that James Hay wasnt responsible for the delays.
Mrs Bs representative reconfirmed Mrs Bs dissatisfaction with the outcome, saying that James Hay failed to complete the full transfer out (to Standard Life) in a timely manner due 
to the delays caused in tracing the lost £65,000. This had caused a financial loss, the 
responsibility for which didnt lie with Mrs B, it said. The whole transfer process should be 
considered, it said.
As the initial investigator had left the service, a new investigator said that, as agreement 
couldnt be reached on the matter, it would be referred to an ombudsman, but that the review 
would only cover the matter which had been assessed by the previous investigator.
The case was referred to me, but I agreed that the whole transfer should be considered 
within the existing complaint. And so the investigator asked both parties for any further 
comments before issuing his further assessment.
James Hay issued a new final response letter, in which it said that its view that the 
responsibility for the lost £65,000 lay with Aegon was unchanged. But it did concede that, 
once it had received confirmation that a new application form was required by Aegon, it 
should have conveyed this to Mrs Bs representative sooner.  
It therefore offered to calculate any financial loss assuming it hadnt caused delays and the 
transfer had been completed by the point it felt it would have been able to do so - on 20 May 
2021. To do this, it asked for contract notes to be provided confirming the date, unit amounts 
and price when re-investment was made.
But Mrs Bs representative has questioned the timings of the delays. Its queried as to why 
James Hay didnt use its secure messaging service to request the additional information on 
26 February 2021. James Hay said that it was reliant on the client or representative to 
supply all necessary documentation before instructing a trade. So, although it did send the 
request to an incorrect email address, it said that if the information had been provided at the 
outset, it wouldnt have needed to request the additional information. It also apologised that it 
didnt use the secure messaging system but that it would use email where it was appropriate 
to do so.
The investigator then set out the most recent assessment of the matter, saying the following 
in summary:
He agreed with the findings of the previous investigator on the matter of the lost 
£65,000, saying that James Hay wasnt responsible for the delays caused by the 
funds being untraceable. He noted that Aegon had informed James Hay that the 
funds had been returned, when they had not. It took reasonable steps to clarify the 
situation and the correct position was only confirmed by Aegon on 4 April 2021.
Although James Hay could have completed its investigation into the whereabouts of 
the missing funds sooner than it did, it nevertheless did so within eight weeks of the 
complaint being raised  as was provided for within the dispute resolution (DISP) 
rules.
James Hay sent the information request dated 26 February 2021 to the wrong email 
address, but the correct information should have been provided at the outset. In prior 
trade instructions, the correct application had been provided and so Mrs Bs 
representative ought to have been aware of the requirement.
It was reasonable for James Hay to expect clients and their representatives to 
provide the necessary information in line with the terms and conditions. The 
investigator also didnt think that James Hay had treated Mrs B unfairly in using email, rather than the secure message service, in its communication.
He noted the timeline provided by James Hay for calculating when the transfer could 
have been processed, had it confirmed the requirement for a new application form for 
Aegon sooner. He said that its conclusion that the full transfer could have occurred 
by 20 May 2021, and James Hays offer to calculate any loss incurred as a result of it 
being processed later, was fair.
Having assessed the likely overall impact on Mrs B, he also considered the further 
£150 offered by James Hay in respect of the inconvenience its mistakes had caused 
her to be fair.
Mr and Mrs B said, in response, that the remained dissatisfied with the outcome of the 
investigation. They made the following points in summary:
Both James Hay and Aegon were at fault, but they were passing the buck to one 
another.
There were three indisputable facts: James Hay didnt complete the transfer out from 
IPS to Elevate in a timely manner; Aegon lost control of £65,000 and its inaction and 
very poor communication created a huge delay.
Mrs B had at all times acted in good faith and shouldnt be penalised for the 
incompetence of the two regulated businesses.
James Hays offer to back date the transfer timeline to 20 May 2021 made a 
difference of four working days, but this wasnt acceptable as: James Hay lost 
another eight working days by failing to supply paperwork to match the BACS 
credits, and so the reinvestment in fact occurred on 7 June 2021; and £454,383 was 
paid in cash by Aegon to James Hay on 26 March 2021, which was four weeks after 
the initial transfer request  this should have been enough time for James Hay to 
chase the missing funds and complete any outstanding paperwork  but it did 
nothing unless pushed by others.
A total of £519,383, comprised of £454,383 and the missing £65,000 was sitting in 
cash from 26 March 2021 to 7 June 2021  a total of 50 working days. This was an 
error caused by James Hay and Aegon, not Mrs B.
As agreement hasnt been reached on the matter, it was referred to me for review.
At my request, the investigator enquired further as to why James Hay was able to partially 
transfer the SIPP on 25 May 2021, with the £65,000 then being received a few days later, 
and therefore why it wouldnt have been able to do so earlier. In response, its said that its 
able to complete partial transfers providing certain requirements are met. And in this 
instance, as Mrs Bs SIPP was fully crystallised, with numerous tranches, it was able to 
complete a partial transfer for the full value of one of the tranches.
But it also said that it was unable to initiate a transfer to a new provider, and therefore it was 
incumbent upon the receiving scheme, customer or their appointed representative to initiate 
such a transfer  including a partial transfer  as set out in the plans terms and conditions. 
The full transfer request which was submitted in February 2021 couldnt be completed as the 
£65,000 was missing.
It further confirmed that there was a telephone conversation with Mrs Bs representative on 7 May 2021 in which the possibility of a partial transfer was discussed, but James Hay couldnt 
act on the basis of a phone call. It did then agree to accept the partial transfer instruction via 
email, and this was received on 12 May 2021, but this wasnt actioned until 25 May 2021.
I issued a provisional decision on the matter on 15 March 2023, in which I set out my 
reasons for upholding the complaint. The below is an extract from that decision.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My current view is that there have clearly been errors and delays incurred both by James 
Hay and Aegon in this matter. And I agree with Mrs Bs representative that she shouldnt 
bear the consequences of the combined effect of these.
I think the primary problem, and the issue from which other problems  albeit not all - 
stemmed, was the loss of the £65,000 by Aegon. Aegon has itself now confirmed that it 
didnt return these funds to James Hay on 31 December 2020, and that it didnt in fact locate 
and then invest the funds in the GIA until 12 April 2021.
But there were other delays for which I dont think Aegon was responsible, and Im setting 
out my view on this below.
The missing £65,000  from 18 December 2020 until reinvestment in the new SIPP
Before the £65,000 was lost, James Hay initially provided the wrong forms, which led to 
Aegon trying to return the funds on 31 December 2020. 
On the basis that the £65,000 was sent to Aegon on 16 December 2020, and it ought 
reasonably to have been able to invest this in the GIA, had the correct forms been provided, 
two working days later, there was a total delay in investing the £65,000 from 18 December 
2020 up to 12 April 2021, the date that it was invested in the Aegon GIA 
The £65,000 was then returned to James Hay as cash on 25 May 2021. But it should have 
been invested in the GIA from 18 December 2021 up to 12 April 2021, and been benefitting 
from whatever investment return was experienced during that time.  
Therefore, my view is that, to compensate Mrs B fairly, James Hay should firstly seek from 
Aegon confirmation of whether, had the £65,000 been invested in the GIA from 18 
December 2020 up to 12 April 2021, the notional value at that date would have been higher 
than £65,000. 
If it wouldnt have been, there is no overall loss, and so neither James Hay nor Aegon would 
need to compensate Mrs B for the loss of investment of the £65,000 in the period from 18 
December 2020 up to 12 April 2021. 
But if the amount as at 12 April 2021 would have been higher, then there was a loss, which 
then needs to be apportioned between James Hay and Aegon. 
James Hay should in that instance seek confirmation from Aegon as to whether there was 
an increase or decrease in the notional value of the GIA investment for its initial delay period 
from 18 December up to 31 December 2020. If there was a notional reduction in value, then 
James Hay doesnt need to pay Mrs B compensation in respect of the lost £65,000. The 
entirety of any loss to Mrs B up to 12 April 2021 should be borne by Aegon.If there would have been an increase in value for that period, and then there would have 
been a further increase in the value of the £65,000 investment from 31 December 2020 to 12 
April 2021, then James Hay will be responsible for whatever notional increase in value which 
would have been achieved within that initial delay period up to 31 December 2020. 
And so it should seek confirmation from Aegon as to what proportion of the notional increase 
as at 12 April 2021 it would have been responsible for as a result of notional investment for 
the period from 18 December 2020 to 31 December 2021. 
If there was a notional increase in the value of the £65,000 from 18 December 2020 to 31 
December 2020, but a subsequent decline in the value from 31 December 2020 to 12 April 
2021, then Aegon will bear no responsibility for any of the loss to Mrs B  the entirety of the 
loss would have been caused by the initial delay period. 
Additionally, any such notional decline in value from 31 December 2020 to the date of 
disinvestment and return to James Hay may be offset by James Hay against a notional 
increase in value which would have been experienced between 18 December 2020 to 31 
December 2021.
The amount of gain/loss to Mrs B on the £65,000, and if the latter, what percentage of loss 
would be attributable to each business, would then have been established as at 12 April 
2021. If the amount resulting from notional investment on 18 December 2020 would have 
been higher, then Ill call this amount value (A).
From this point onwards, Aegons liability for the delays relating to the lost £65,000 ceased, 
but the effect of its share of the loss on the current value of Mrs Bs SIPP persisted (see 
below).
As set out above, Aegon confirmed on 23 April 2021 that a new instruction would be 
required to disinvest the £65,000. However, James Hay didnt let Mrs Bs representative 
know about this requirement until 12 May 2021, when James Hay sent it the new application 
forms.
The completed forms were received on 14 May 2021 and were sent to Aegon on 24 May 
2021. James Hay received the disinvested amount on 1 June 2021 and transferred it out to 
Mrs Bs new SIPP on 4 June 2021. 
Had James Hay conveyed the need for the new disinvestment instruction to Mrs Bs 
representative on 23 April 2021, it would reasonably have taken, allowing for the intervening 
weekend, until 27 April 2021 for the forms to be received back by James Hay, and then sent 
to and received by Aegon the day after  28 April 2021. Aegon then took six working days to 
disinvest and transfer the funds across to James Hay, and so James Hay would have 
received the funds on 6 May 2021. James Hay transferred the funds three working days 
after it received them, and so they would have been transferred to the new SIPP provider on 
11 May 2021.
James Hay should therefore seek from Aegon the value of (A) as established above, with 
the addition of the actual investment returns it experienced within the GIA between 12 April 
2021 and 6 May 2021. 
The redress which would need to be paid by James Hay and Aegon is their respective share 
of the total loss to Mrs B as a percentage, which then needs to be applied to the current 
value of the amount represented by the transfer of the £65,000 into Mrs Bs current SIPP. So for example, if the £65,000 invested since 18 December 2020 would have been worth 
£68,000 at 12 April 2021, and either Aegons or James Hays share of that loss is 70%, and 
with actual investment returns applied up to when it should have been transferred out on 11 
May 2021 (using the disinvestment date of 6 May 2021) taking that amount to £70,000, then 
it would need to uplift the amount represented by the £65,000 transfer within Mrs Bs current 
SIPP by a factor of 1.054.
But Aegon wasnt responsible for the delay between 11 May 2021 and 4 June 2021, and so 
a separate calculation should be undertaken to determine the additional effect of the delay 
incurred solely by James Hay. This would be to compare the loss attributable to Aegon 
determined by a notional transfer on both 11 May 2021 and 4 June 2021. So in effect, a 
further calculation as above, but on the basis of the later transfer date of 4 June 2021. If the 
loss due to the notional earlier transfer on 11 May 2021 is higher, James Hay should pay as 
a monetary amount, instead of Aegon, whatever the difference is between those two 
calculations  with Aegon then paying the lower amount.
The effect on Mrs Bs SIPP should be neutral, but this will reflect the impact of the loss 
caused by Aegon up to a notional transfer date of 11 May 2021, whilst not holding it 
responsible for additional delays incurred by James Hay.
The retention of £454,383 in cash from 26 March 2021 until reinvestment in the new SIPP
James Hay was unable to comply with the initial full disinvestment request as it didnt have 
the lost £65,000. As James Hay has confirmed, there was a telephone call on 7 May 2021 
in which the possibility of the partial transfer was discussed, but James Hay couldnt act on 
the basis of a phone call. It did then agree to accept the instruction via email, and this was 
received on 12 May 2021, but this wasnt actioned until 25 May 2021. 
But the full transfer was in any case impacted by the loss, investment, and subsequent 
disinvestment of the £65,000. As Ive said above, Aegon had informed James Hay on 23 
April 2021 that, following the relocation and investment of the £65,000, a new disinvestment 
instruction would be required, but James Hay didnt confirm this to Mrs B s representative 
until 12 May 2021. The forms were received back from Mrs Bs representative two days later 
on 14 May 2021.
Had the £65,000 been received by James Hay sooner, the whole of the amount could have 
been transferred together at an earlier stage, with no need for a partial transfer. So for the 
period from 28 March 2021, which is two days after James Hay received the bulk of the 
amount to be held in cash, up to 11 May 2021, which is the soonest all of the funds could 
have been transferred together, I think the responsibility for any loss lies with Aegon. The 
funds couldnt have been transferred together before this point due to the loss of the 
£65,000.
But for the period between 11 May 2021 and the actual date of transfer and reinvestment, I 
think the responsibility for any loss lies with James Hay. If it hadnt caused delays in notifying 
Mrs Bs representative of the need for a new transfer application form, and had actioned that 
request promptly, and the disinvestment of the £65,000 had also taken place earlier, a full 
transfer could have proceeded on 11 May 2021, with no need for the partial transfer. 
As such, the same redress principle as that set out above should be applied to the amount 
which was held in cash from 26 March 2021 onwards, but with Aegon being responsible for 
the first delay period from 28 March 2021 to 11 May 2021 and then James Hay being 
responsible for the period from 11 May 2021 to the date of reinvestment in the new SIPP. If there is a loss attributable to James Hay from either part of the redress calculation as set 
out above, James Hay should in the first instance pay into Mrs Bs SIPP to increase its value 
by the total amount of the loss and any interest (as set out below). The amount paid should 
allow for the effect of charges and any available tax relief. Compensation should not be paid 
into the pension plan if it would conflict with any existing protection or allowance.
If James Hay is unable to pay the total amount into Mrs B's pension plan, it should pay that 
amount direct to her. But had it been possible to pay into the plan, it would have provided a 
taxable income. Therefore the total amount should be reduced to notionally allow for any 
income tax that would otherwise have been paid. This is an adjustment to ensure the 
compensation is a fair amount  it isnt a payment of tax to HMRC, so Mrs B wont be able to 
reclaim any of the reduction after compensation is paid.
The notional allowance should be calculated using Mrs B's actual or expected marginal rate 
of tax at her selected retirement age. I assume this to be basic rate. And so, assuming that 
tax free cash would be taken, the reduction should be applied to 75% of the compensation, 
resulting in an overall notional deduction of 15%.
Additional interest at the rate of 8% simple per year should be added to any loss from the 
date of any final decision along these lines to settlement if the complaint isnt settled within 
60 days of James Hay receiving notification of Mrs Bs acceptance.
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If James Hay deducts income tax from the 
interest it should tell Mrs B how much has been taken off. James Hay should give Mrs B a 
tax deduction certificate in respect of interest if Mrs B asks for one, so she can reclaim the 
tax on interest from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Mrs B has also unquestionably been significantly inconvenienced and distressed by this 
matter. And whilst I appreciate that James Hay isnt responsible for some of the delays or 
the loss of the £65,000, its nevertheless made several errors which have contributed to 
Mrs Bs predicament.
As such, my current view is that James Hay should pay to Mrs B a further £200 in 
recognition of this.
Mrs Bs representative accepted my findings. James Hay broadly did too, but wished to 
amend an aspect of my proposed timeline, saying that, once it had received the 
documentation to send to Aegon on 27 April 2021, it would have taken four working days to 
do so, and given the bank holiday, this would have been on 4 May 2021. And so, according 
to the remainder of the proposed timeline, this would mean that the transfer would have 
occurred on 17 May 2021 rather than 11 May 2021.
Mrs Bs representative has accepted that revised timeline.
Aegon also broadly accepted the proposed resolution, but pointed out that the instruction 
which accompanied the transfer of the £65,000 was to invest it in cash within the GIA, and 
so, it said, there would have been no loss for the time during which it had been lost.
I therefore asked the investigator to enquire further as to Mrs Bs understanding of what 
would happen with the £65,000 once it was invested in the GIA. Mrs Bs representative has 
said that the money would have been invested in the same way as her existing funds in the 
GIA  and that there would clearly have been no point in adding further money just for it to 
sit in cash.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My views on the matter remain broadly the same as those set out in the provisional decision, 
and for the same reasons. Ive noted Aegons point about the cash investment instruction, 
but I agree with Mrs Bs representative. There clearly would have been no point in adding 
funds to the account unless Mrs B intended to invest them. And in the absence of any 
evidence to persuade me otherwise, it seems more likely than not that the £65,000 would 
have been invested in the same way as Mrs Bs existing GIA funds. 
I think it was the fact that James Hay firstly issued the wrong forms, and then the 
subsequent loss of the £65,000 by Aegon, which prevented the funds from being invested 
as intended. And so I dont think the proposed redress methodology needs to be changed, 
other than as set out below. 
Putting things right
As with the provisional decision, my aim is to put Mrs B as closely as possible into the 
position she would have been, but for the mistakes made by both businesses. 
This hasnt been straightforward, and Im grateful to all parties for their swift communication 
on the amendments and outstanding issues which have needed to be addressed.
On the basis of the responses received, my view on the appropriate manner of putting things 
right remains as outlined in the provisional decision, but with an amended date of 17 May 
2021 for the soonest date that all of the funds could have been transferred to the new 
provider. Further, the notional investment return on the £65,000 should be calculated on the 
assumption that Mrs B would have invested in the same funds, and proportions, as already 
existed within the GIA.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint and direct IPS Pensions Limited, trading as 
James Hay Partnership, to undertake the above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2023.
