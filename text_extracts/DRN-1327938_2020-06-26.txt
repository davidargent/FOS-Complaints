The complaint
Mrs O complains that the direct debit for her monthly payment under a hire purchase 
agreement wasn't collected by Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Seat
Financial Services, and about the service that she's received from it.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mrs O under a hire purchase agreement with Seat 
Financial Services that was signed in April 2019 - and she agreed to make 48 
monthly payments of £449.93 and a final payment of £16,065 for the car;
Seat Financial Services accepts that it didn't send the direct debit instruction to Mrs 
O's bank so the direct debit wasn't set up and the payment of £449.93 that was due 
at the end of May 2019 wasn't made - it apologised for that and offered Mrs O £100 
as a gesture of goodwill but said that she needed to make that payment and her June 
payment would be collected by direct debit;
there was some confusion about the date that the payment would be collected 
and Mrs O says that Seat Financial Services should have communicated with her 
better than it did and that the May payment should be waived, halved or added to the 
end of her agreement - she also says that the credit limit on her credit card has been 
reduced as a result of this;
I sympathise with Mrs O for these events and can understand her frustration that the 
May 2019 direct debit wasn't collected as expected and that the communication from 
Seat Financial Services wasn't as good as she thought it should be - but she'd 
agreed to make monthly payments of £449.93 and the May 2019 hasn't been made;
Seat Financial Services says that it placed a hold on arrears letter being sent out for 
that payment and that it hasn't recorded any adverse information about that payment 
on her credit file;
Mrs O says that her credit card limit has been affected - but a credit limit can be 
reduced for many reasons and I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to 
show Mrs O's credit limit has been reduced as a result of the May 2019 payment not 
being made or that Seat Financial Services has recorded any adverse information 
about that payment on her credit file; 
if Seat Financial Services has recorded any such information, Mrs O should complain 
to it and then, if she's not satisfied with its response, she may be able to make 
another complaint to this service;I'm not persuaded that Seat Financial Services is acting incorrectly in requiring Mrs O 
to make the May 2019 payment - and I don't consider that it would be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to waive or reduce the amount 
of the payment or to delay it until the end of the agreement; and
Seat Financial Services has apologised to Mrs O for the issues with the direct debit 
and it has offered her £100 as a gesture of goodwill - I consider that it would be fair 
and reasonable for it to pay her £100 but I don't consider that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require it to pay her more than that or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.  
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading 
as Seat Financial Services, should pay £100 to Mrs O.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs O to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 July 2020.
