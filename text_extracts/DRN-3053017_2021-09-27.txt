The complaint
Mr M complains about the way his motor insurer, Admiral Insurance Company Limited, 
offered a service with another company when he called to report a potential claim. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator, for these reasons:
Ive listened to the call Mr M had with Admiral and agree theres no pressure put on 
him to use the other company to make his claim. He was clearly being presented with 
a choice between two options. 
The options available to Mr M were accurately explained by Admiral. That allowed 
Mr M to make an informed choice whether to use the other company, or raise a claim 
against his own insurance policy. 
The information given to Mr M  that his excess wouldnt have to be paid if he used 
the other company  was a fact of the situation. If Admiral hadnt told him that fact, he 
wouldnt have been able to make a fully informed choice. It was for Mr M to decide 
how persuasive he found the fact, when making his decision. 
When presenting the options to Mr M, I cant see that Admiral could reasonably have 
foreseen he would become unhappy with the other companys service. As such, I 
cant see that Admiral needed to make Mr M aware that might happen, when 
informing him about his options. 
For these reasons, I find Admiral treated Mr M fairly in this case. 
My final decision
Ive decided not to uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 October 2021.
