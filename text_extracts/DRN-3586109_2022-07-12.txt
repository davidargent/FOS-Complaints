The complaint
Mr C complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aquacard (NewDay) acted irresponsibly when 
they agreed to provide him with a credit card account and later increased his account limit to 
an unaffordable level.
What happened
Around October 2015, Mr C applied to NewDay for a credit card. He completed his 
application online. NewDay assessed Mr Cs application based upon information hed 
provided together with information obtained from credit bureaus. They agreed to provide a 
credit card account with an initial limit of £300.
NewDay later undertook a review of Mr Cs credit card account with them. They used 
information held about Mr Cs financial circumstances together with information obtained 
from credit bureaus. They also looked at how Mr C had used his credit card account with 
them. NewDay decided to offer an increased limit of £1,000. They wrote to Mr C to tell him 
this and gave him 40 days to contact them should he not want his limit increasing. Mr Cs 
account limit was increased to £1,000 in July 2016.
In July 2021, the CMC wrote to NewDay on Mr Cs behalf. They thought NewDay had acted 
irresponsibly when they agreed to provide Mr C with a credit card account. They also 
thought NewDay had been irresponsible when they increased his account limit in July 2016. 
The CMC made the following points:
NewDay failed to properly assess Mr Cs financial circumstances; and
Mr Cs income and expenditure at the time showed the credit provided was 
unaffordable; and
Mr C was already paying several lenders and his income would no longer cover his 
monthly repayments; and
Mr C had a poor credit rating at the time NewDay agreed to lend.
The CMC asked NewDay to refund all interest and charges theyd applied, pay 8% statutory 
interest and remove all related negative or adverse information from Mr Cs credit file.
NewDay considered Mr Cs complaint but didnt think theyd acted unfairly or unreasonably. 
They were satisfied that the account and credit limit increase were provided correctly, and 
adequate checks were completed to ensure they were affordable. The CMC didnt agree 
with NewDays findings, so referred Mr Cs complaint to this service. 
Our investigator considered Mr Cs complaint and asked NewDay to provide all relevant 
facts and information. Having provided that information, NewDay said that their original 
decision to provide a credit card account remained appropriate. But they now agreed they 
shouldnt have increased Mr Cs limit in July 2016. NewDay offered to refund interest and 
charges from when the limit increase took effect. Our investigator agreed with NewDays 
findings and supported their offer. 
Mr C didnt agree that NewDays original decision to give him a credit card was appropriate. 
He also said that the income figure theyd used in his application was wrong. So, he wasnt 
willing to accept NewDays offer.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Mr Cs complaint has been passed to me to consider.
I reached a different outcome to that of our investigator. Because of that, I issued a 
provisional decision on 9 June 2022  giving both Mr C and NewDay the opportunity to 
respond to my findings below before I reached a final decision.
In my provisional decision, I said:
NewDay have provided details of the information Mr C input in his online application 
in 2015. This showed Mr C stated an income of £30,422. Mr C says this figure isnt 
correct and should be £10,000 less. But as the information feeds directly from what 
Mr C originally input, I cant reasonably say that NewDay were at fault if this figure 
was incorrect.
The application and credit bureau information also show that Mr C had existing 
unsecured debts of £5,700, had no outstanding payday loans or any adverse 
markers or missed payments in the preceding 12 months. There was evidence of 
previous defaults, but the last of these was more than three years before Mr Cs 
application. There was also evidence of other public records. But again, these 
predated the application by at least 18 months.
NewDay have said Mr Cs application falls within their policy as a second chance 
lender that offers lending to people who may have been rejected by other high 
street lenders. NewDay is entitled to decide who they lend to and, if they want to 
accept the risk of lending to people that other business may not lend to, they are free 
to decide that. But that doesnt mean that they dont have the same obligations as 
other lenders to perform borrower focused assessments that any lending they 
provide is affordable and sustainable.
The relatively small level of borrowing NewDay made available to Mr C leads me to 
think that the checks they did  including taking the information Mr C provided in 
good faith and double-checking credit reference information  were proportionate 
here. So, I dont believe that NewDay were acting irresponsibly when they originally 
agreed to lend to Mr C with a limit of £300.
NewDay have now agreed that when they increased Mr Cs limit, the information 
available to them at the time should have resulted in a different decision. Theyve 
agreed that the increased limit was not appropriate. Having considered all the 
information, I agree with NewDay on this point. So, I believe any redress should be 
reflective of this.
Mr C has received benefit from the money he borrowed, so its fair that he remains 
liable for any remaining amount outstanding. I also agree that NewDay should refund 
interest and charges to Mr Cs account. But as I think the original decision was 
appropriate, this should only relate to any element over and above the original £300 
limit. In the event that the refunded interest and charges result in a surplus balance 
falling due to Mr C, then NewDay should also add interest of 8% simple to this figure.
Im mindful that the CMC have asked that Mr Cs credit file be amended. To ensure a 
fair outcome, I think NewDay need to ensure that any balance changes on Mr Cs 
account, resulting from the interest and charges refunded, are reflected in the 
monthly balances reported on his credit file. In addition, once any remaining balance 
has been repaid by Mr C, NewDay should then remove any related adverse 
information from Mr Cs credit file.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision, I asked both parties to respond with any new information or 
comments they wanted me to consider. 
NewDay confirmed they had no final points theyd like to make, and they agreed with the 
findings in my provisional decision.
The CMC confirmed theyd received my provisional decision and while they did confirm 
theyd reached out to Mr C for his comments, I havent received any further comments or 
information.
On the basis that Ive not seen anything more that persuades me to change my mind, my 
final decision will remain unchanged.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold Mr Cs complaint.
I require NewDay Ltd (trading as Aquacard) to settle as follows:
Refund all charges and interest relating to any balance owed above the original £300 
limit agreed.
If an outstanding balance remains owed once the refunds have been made, NewDay 
should contact Mr C to discuss a suitable repayment plan.
If the effect of refunding all interest, fees and charges leaves a credit balance, the 
balance should be treated as overpayments and returned to Mr C along with 8% 
interest from the date they were made until the date of settlement.
Amend Mr Cs credit file to reflect the new monthly balances after refund of interest 
and charges.
Remove any related adverse information from Mr Cs credit file once the outstanding 
balance had been repaid.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay Ltd to take off tax from this interest. NewDay 
must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 August 2022.
