K821x#15complaint
Through a claims management  company (CMC), Mr and Mrs R have complained about fees 
and charges added to their mortgage  account  by Pepper (UK) Limited.
background
Mr and Mrs R have a mortgage  taken out in 2007. On 14 September  2015 the loan was 
transferred to an unregulated mortgage  book  holder,  which appointed a regulated business, 
Pepper, to administer the account. I will refer to Pepper throughout, including where  this 
relates to events which took place before Pepper  took over administration of the loan.
On 26 April 2018 the CMC wrote  to Pepper to complain about fees and charges added to the 
account. In its final response  letter, Pepper offered to refund fees totalling  £200, being five 
£40 fees it had applied in months where  the full monthly repayment had been made. 
Because it was dissatisfied with this, the CMC, on behalf of Mr and Mrs R, brought the 
complaint to us.
Pepper didnt  consent to us considering  fees and charges  applied  before 26 April 2012, six 
years before the complaint  was brought. An adjudicator looked at this and was satisfied that 
any claim for fees before that date was out of time  and there were no exceptional  
circumstances to explain the delay in complaining about them. The CMC accepted this.
The adjudicator looked at fees and charges applied to the account since  26 April 2012.  She 
agreed with the refund  offered of £200 for the five arrears fees applied  where the full monthly  
repayment had been made. But the adjudicator also thought additional fees of £224 should  
be refunded, as follows:
3 x £48 fees applied on 9 December  2015,  22 January 2016 and 1 February  2016  for 
what was described as second  mortgage consent fee  a total of £144;
2 x £40 monthly arrears fees applied on 2 June  2012 and 3 July 2012, where these 
were duplicated  with legal fees  a total of £80.
So in total (including the £200 offered by Pepper  in its final response  letter) the adjudicator  
recommended fees of £424 should be refunded. 
Pepper didnt  think it should refund the 2 x £40 arrears fees applied at the same time as 
legal fees in June and July 2012.  It says that these are not duplicated fees, because even 
though solicitors had been instructed, Pepper  still needed to carry out arrears  administration 
on the account.
Because Pepper didnt accept the adjudicators  findings, the complaint has been  passed to 
me for a final decision. The CMC has made no further submissions.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
The only issue to be determined is whether the two arrears administration  fees of £40 
applied on 2 June  and 3 July 2012 should  be reimbursed. Pepper hasnt disputed  the other 
fees weve asked  it to refund.
Ref: DRN91624002I see that in June and July 2012 Mr and Mrs R were charged £40 per month for arrears 
administration, at the same time as their account was with solicitors. Although Pepper 
argues it was entitled to charge the fee because it was continuing to administer  the account, 
I note that it didnt charge the £40 arrears administration fee in August 2012, even though 
the same  type of solicitors charges were also applied to the account.
In the circumstances, I dont think its fair or reasonable for Mr and Mrs R to be charged 
arrears administration  fees in months  where  the lender was taking legal action against them 
and also charging  them for that. Consequently  Im satisfied that the fees of £80 for the 
arrears administration  fees for June and July 2012 should also be refunded.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement Pepper (UK) Limited  
must reimburse the following  fees totalling  £424 to Mr and Mrs Rs mortgage  account, and 
remove any interest applied on those fees:
5 x £40 monthly arrears fees, as outlined by Pepper (UK) Limited in its final response 
letter  a total of £200
3 x £48 fees applied on 9 December  2015,  22 January 2016 and 1 February  2016  for 
what was described as second  mortgage consent fee  a total of £144;
2 x £40 monthly arrears fees applied on 2 June  2012 and 3 July 2012, where these 
were duplicated  with legal fees  a total of £80.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs R to 
accept or reject my decision  before  23 February  2019.
