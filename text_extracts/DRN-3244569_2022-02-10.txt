The complaint
Ms L says Short Term Finance Limited (STFL) lent to her irresponsibly. She says that she 
already had debt problems when she took the loans and so she couldnt afford to make the 
repayments. So, Ms L thinks that STFL shouldnt have lent to her.
 
What happened
This complaint is about 16 loans STFL provided to Ms L between June 2015 and December 
2019. Some of the information I have been provided about the lending is in the table below.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She didnt have enough to say that STFL 
shouldnt have approved loans 1 to 5. But she thought that the lending pattern itself had 
become harmful by loan 6 and so STFL was irresponsible to continue to lend after this time. 
STFL disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It said that it hadnt done anything wrong 
here. It adhered to the guidelines, regulations and good industry practice before lending. 
Ms L, or her representative, didnt disagree with what the adjudicator said. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
STFL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms L could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that STFL should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Ms Ls complaint in part and Ive explained why below.
Ms L didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 5. Because of this, I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I wont comment in detail 
about this lending. Save to say, I agree these loans werent lent irresponsibly for the same 
reasons the adjudicator outlined. But they are something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 6 to 16 because I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of STFLs lending 
history with Ms L, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which STFL should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so STFL should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Ms Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:Ms L had taken out six shorter term loans within 14 months. I think, in this case, this 
is a significant number of loans over a relatively long time.  
Right from the start Ms L was provided with a new loan within a very short time of 
settling a previous one. 
And there are some indicators in the information Ive been provided as to why Ms L 
was using this type of loan so frequently. Her income was modest, and the 
application form data shows she took a number of these loans for subsistence. I 
think its pretty clear Ms L was struggling to cover her ordinary living costs before 
making any loan repayments. 
STFL also ought to have known that Ms L was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
So STFL ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms L was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan repayments were leaving 
in her finances and that Ms Ls indebtedness was unsustainable. She did struggle to 
repay the lending at times from early on in the relationship. 
And Ms L didnt make any real inroads to the amount she owed STFL. Loan 16 was 
taken out over four years after Ms Ls first. And it was for a larger amount. Ms L had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to STFL over an extended 
period.
I think that Ms L lost out because STFL provided loans 6 to 16 because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ls indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
The number of loans and the length of time over which Ms L borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 to 16 and STFL should put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STFL should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms L from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Ms L may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between her and this particular lender which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt 
a viable option, she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that, 
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how she would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Ms L in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Ms L would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFLs liability in this case for what Im satisfied 
it has done wrong and should put right.
STFL shouldnt have given Ms L loans 6 to 16.
A) STFL should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms L towards interest, 
fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B) STFL should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms L 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms L originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) STFL should pay Ms L the total of A plus B.
D) The overall pattern of Ms Ls borrowing for loans 6 to 16 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Ms Ls credit file. If 
STFL has sold any of the loans STFL should ask the debt purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STFL to deduct tax from this interest. STFL should give 
Ms L a certificate showing how much tax STFL has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Ms Ls complaint.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 March 2022.
