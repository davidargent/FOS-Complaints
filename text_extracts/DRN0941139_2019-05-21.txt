K822xcomplaint
Ms K complains  that Mercedes-Benz Financial Services UK Limited  (MBFS)  gave  her 
misleading information when she asked about her options at the end of her hire purchase 
agreement, and is now asking her to pay an unreasonable amount.
background 
In July 2015, Ms K entered into a hire purchase agreement for a car with MBFS. Under the 
agreement she paid a deposit of £11,846.19, and agreed to pay 24 monthly instalments of 
£250 each. After that, in July 2017, she had the option of:
paying an optional  purchase payment of £24,750, plus a purchase activation fee of 
£10, when the car would become hers; or
returning the car to MBFS when she wouldnt have to pay anything more,  provided it 
was in satisfactory condition and was within the agreed mileage.
In April 2017, Ms K rang MBFS and asked  what her options were.  She says she was told 
she could extend  the hire by paying  the same rental as before - £250  a month. But nearer 
the end of the agreement  she was told it would cost her more than £500  a month to extend 
the rental.
She complained to MBFS that this wasnt what she had been told, and MBFS should honour  
the original agreement. She asked for copies of her previous phone calls with MBFS. In the 
meantime she kept the car. MBFS asked her to sign and return  the quote  for the higher  
rental extension figure, but she didnt. She said she was still waiting for the copy  phone  calls.
Eventually MBFS recovered the car and sent her a bill for use of the car since  July 2017.   
Ms K complained to MBFS that it knew she wasnt prepared  to pay more than the original 
monthly rental. So it should have recovered  the car sooner.  She wasnt  willing  to pay 
MBFSs bill of more than £4,000.
our adjudicators view
Our adjudicator recommended  that this complaint should be upheld  in part. She had listened  
to the phone calls between MBFS and Ms K about what would happen  at the end of her 
agreement in July 2017.
In a phone  call MBFS had with Ms K on 7 June 2017, MBFS made  it clear  that the hire 
purchase agreement  would be ending on 23 July 2017. Ms K asked what  would  happen on 
that date. The advisor  explained that before 23 July 2017, she would need to tell them 
whether she was buying the car, part exchanging  it or extending the hire. But it didnt appear  
she had contacted MBFS until 8 August 2017, when she requested  an extension.
Ms K then argued with MBFS that the terms offered werent what  she had been told earlier. 
She asked  for copies  of the call recordings, which were provided in early September  2017.
The adjudicator said there was nothing  to suggest Ms K had been provided with incorrect 
information about what she would be charged for an extension. And she hadnt seen 
anything to suggest Ms K wasnt sent the call recordings she had asked  for, or that these  
had been edited in any way. So she thought  MBFS was entitled to charge the amount it was 
asking for Ms Ks extended use of the car.
Ref: DRN09411392However she agreed that MBFS had been  slow to provide the call recordings, and its 
customer service  on this aspect could have been  better.  MBFS had now offered a goodwill 
payment for this of £75, and the adjudicator thought this was fair in the circumstances.
Ms K responded to say, in summary, that:
MBFS should have  collected the car in July as she hadnt agreed to its proposed  
pricing structure after July;
she didnt think she should  have been charged an excess mileage charge as well as 
a monthly charge;  and
it had taken MBFS four or five months  to collect the car during which she had 
constantly to chase MBFS.
my provisional findings
I issued my provisional view to Ms K and to MBFS on 15 February  2019.  In it I said that, like 
the adjudicator,  Id seen nothing to suggest  Ms K was provided with incorrect information 
about what she would be charged for an extension. Ms K was sent the call recordings she 
asked for. Id seen  nothing to suggest  these  were edited in any way. 
There was some delay in the call recordings being  provided. I thought MBFSs offer of £75 
for this poor service was fair in the circumstances.
Ms K said the onus  was on MBFS to collect the car, either at the end of her agreement  on  
23 July 2017 or after that when it was clear  she wouldnt agree to the revised rental  MBFS 
was suggesting.  However I thought she also had an obligation to return  the car to MBFS at 
the end of the agreed term. When she didnt, MBFS was entitled to charge her for her 
continued use of the car on a reasonable basis.
The bill MBFS sent her had three  elements:
Damages for repairs needed to the car - £728.65
This included a replacement key and tyre, and refurbishment to alloy wheels, and was, I 
thought, reasonable.
Extra days rental - £1,069.57
MBFS had charged her on a daily basis for the continued use of the car for 106 days  at the 
same monthly rate she was paying before  (£250 per month). I thought this was reasonable 
for her continuing to use the car, although I thought the figure should be £1,059.57 rather  
than £1,069.57 as MBFS had suggested.
Excess mileage charges - £3,173.18
Under the agreement  Ms K agreed to pay an excess mileage charge of 16p + VAT for each 
mile in excess  of 12,000  miles a year, and proportionately for part of a year. So she was 
allowed to drive 12,000 miles a year before the charge applied. She had covered well over 
this by 23 July 2017,  so I said an excess mileage  charge would always have applied.
Ref: DRN09411393By the time she handed  the car back on 6 November  2017, she had covered 40,527 miles. 
So MBFS calculated the excess mileage charge at (40,527-24,000) =16,527 x (16p + vat) = 
£3,173.18.
I had suggested  to MBFS that this didnt take account of the fact that it was charging her for 
the 106 days she continued to use the car, for which she should  have a mileage allowance. 
So she should  only be charged for 13,042 miles x (16p + vat) = £2,504.06.
I said that, while not conceding  it was necessarily obliged to calculate  it in this way, MBFS 
had agreed to reduce the amount payable to this amount. 
This meant the total amount MBFS now required Ms K to pay was £4,292.28 (£728.65 + 
£1,059.57 + £2,504.06). I thought this was a fair amount  and was in accordance with the 
terms of the hire purchase agreement she had signed, and her continued use of the car after 
the end of its contractual term.
MBFS responded to say that it was in agreement with my provisional view. Ms K hasnt 
responded at all.
my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  what's  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
As neither Ms K nor MBFS has provided  any fresh information or evidence in response to 
my provisional decision, I find no basis to depart  from my earlier conclusions.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part, and order Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited to:
1.pay Ms K compensation  of £75 for the distress  and inconvenience its delays in 
providing the call recordings caused  her; and
2.accept  £4,292.28 in settlement of what Ms K owes under her hire purchase 
agreement and for her continued  use of the car after July 2017.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 June  2019.
