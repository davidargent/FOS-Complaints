K822xcomplaint
Mr M says Elevate Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny, irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 26 loans Sunny provided to Mr M between January  2017 and May 
2018. Ive included a table  at the end of this decision which sets out some information about  
Mr Ms borrowing history  with Sunny.  
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ms complaint about loans 4 onwards and thought these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed with this view but responded with an offer to 
uphold Mr Ms complaint from loan 13 onwards. Mr M didnt accept this offer, so the 
complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
Ref: DRN06391372the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint. Our adjudicator didnt feel loans 1  3 
should be upheld,  and Mr M seems to have agreed  with this opinion. So as these loans are 
no longer in dispute, I havent considered these further in my decision. But I have thought  
about all of Mr M loans when considering his overall  lending history with Sunny.  
Sunny told us it has a robust process for confirming the customers affordability at the point 
of application  which included checking  the income and expenditure information provided by 
the consumer.  It also says that it carried out credit checks on Mr M which wouldve revealed 
more information  about his financial situation  at the time. But I think  Sunny shouldve 
realised from the way Mr M was borrowing that he was having  problems managing  his 
money.
Loan 4 was Mr Ms fourth loan within two months  and Mr M was indebted to Sunny  for the 
entire time  so it looks  like Mr M wasnt managing  his finances and kept topping  up the 
amount he was in debt without repaying  any previous loans. So, Mr Ms indebtedness was 
increasing still. This information,  along with the information about  a default on Mr Ms credit  
file within  the last four months,  which  it obtained  from its credit check for loan 4, ought to 
have led Sunny to realise Mr M was not managing his money well and was unlikly to be able 
to pay back this loan - or any subsequent  loan.        
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Our adjudicator felt that this stage had been  reached by loan 8. But, given the fact that these 
loans were all taken  out within the space  of five months, I dont  think  it had yet reached the 
point  considering how long these  loans were meant to run for - to suggest that a pattern  of 
lending had developed. However, given the particular circumstances of Mr Ms case, I think  
that this point was reached by loan 10. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr M was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr M had taken  out ten loans within six months  and Mr M had been  
indebted to Sunny  for nine out of the ten months.  So Sunny ought to have realised it 
was more likely than not Mr M was having  to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ms indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ms first loan was for £200 and loan 10 was for £250. And, even though  the 
amount borrowed  between loans 1 and 10 varied, the amounts was not significantly 
reducing  and Mr M requested loan 10 for the largest amount. So at this point Sunny 
ought to have known that Mr M was not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall 
in their income but to meet an ongoing  need.  
Ref: DRN06391373From  Mr Ms first loan he was taking  out another loan within  weeks of taking out the 
previous, and often  while still having  a number of loans  outstanding  often taking  out 
a number of loans totaling up to £600 in a month.  And even though Mr M did repay  
most of his loans  early, he was taking out a new loan shortly  after.  So, it seemed he 
was becoming reliant on this type of credit.
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Mr Ms 26th loan 
was taken out around 16 months  after Mr Ms first. And Mr M was indebted  to Sunny 
for almost all of this time, with only a months  break on few occasions. Mr M had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 10 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 onwards, for the reasons outlined  above 
and I think Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  4 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 -9 from Mr Ms credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 10 onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  10  26 should be removed from 
Mr Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as outlined above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 March  2020.
