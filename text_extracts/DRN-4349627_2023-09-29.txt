The complaint
Mr W has complained about a secured loan he holds with Shawbrook Bank Limited. Hes 
unhappy about how the interest rate has varied over the life of the loan.
What happened
This loan was taken out in April 2007 with GE Money Home Finance Limited (trading as First 
National) and was for £15,000 (plus fees). It was set up with a term of 15 years and had an 
initial interest rate of 9.71% variable. This gave an initial payment of around £170 a month. 
The loan was transferred to Shawbrook in July 2016.
On 25 September 2020, Mr W complained about the loan. He said he understood the 
interest rate to be variable, but the rate went up but didnt come down.
Shawbrook didnt uphold the complaint and, unhappy with the response, Mr W referred his 
complaint to our service.
The complaint was looked at by one of our investigators. He said that Mr W had complained 
too late about the interest he had been charged before 25 September 2014, although he 
said he would take account of earlier interest rate changes as part of the overall 
circumstances of the complaint. He then considered the complaint about the interest rate 
since that date and didnt uphold it.
Mr W didnt agree with our investigators findings on either point and so the case was passed 
to me to decide.
I issued a decision about our jurisdiction earlier this month. In that I said the only part of this 
complaint we have the power to consider is in respect of the interest rate charged since 
25 September 2014 because everything else hadnt been complained about in time. 
However, as I explained in that decision, in considering the part of Mr Ws complaint about 
the fairness of the interest rate, it will be necessary to consider the whole history of the 
interest rate, including before 25 September 2014. Thats because changes to the interest 
rate before that date may have influenced the interest rate charged from then on, and so 
form part of all the circumstances of the case that I am required to consider.
Ive now considered that part of the complaint and am issuing this decision to set out my 
findings on it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Was the interest rate term fair?
Mr Ws loan agreement says in section L:
The rate of interest will increase or decrease if and to the extent that there is any change 
in GE Money base lending rate (see Condition 1(3) and 3(2) on page 2).
Those two conditions say (with GEMHF meaning GE Money Home Finance Limited):
References to GE Money base lending rate means the base lending rate of GEMHF 
from time to time or, if no such rate exists, such other rate or rates as GEMHF may from 
time to time decide in which case GEMHF shall give the Customer not less than 30 days 
written notice of any such other rate taking effect.
In the event of GE Money base lending rate increasing or decreasing after this 
agreement takes effect, the rate of interest at letter J on the front of this agreement (or 
the rate of interest at that time) will be increased or decreased by the same percentage 
point(s), or fraction of a percentage point, as GE Money base lending rate.
Having considered the agreement very carefully, Im satisfied it is clear the interest rate is 
variable, and it should vary in-line with any changes to GE Moneys published base lending 
rate (GEBLR). The GEBLR would have varied depending on GE Moneys cost of funding 
and risk analysis. Im also satisfied that the term is clear and fairly set out. I think it should 
have therefore been clear to Mr W when he agreed to take out the loan that the initial 
interest rate wasnt fixed, it might vary and, if it does vary, what would impact that.
Was the term applied fairly?
GE Money up until July 2016
We know that the terms of Mr Ws agreement set out that his interest rate would vary in-line 
with any changes to the GEBLR. 
The GEBLR rate was publicly available, and weve obtained the historic rate information for 
the period in question.  
Mr W may be unhappy GE Money increased its interest rates to cover increased costs and 
risk to the business during the financial crisis and that this was at the expense of its 
customers. But that doesnt mean it was unfair. The cost of running a business will change 
and can increase. It is broadly accepted that businesses might therefore need to increase 
interest rates to meet those costs. 
After January 2009, even though its cost of funding was constantly increasing, GE Money 
didnt pass any more of these costs on to its customers, instead maintaining the GEBLR at 
the January 2009 level. So, although the GEBLR diverged from the cost of funding, this was 
only for the consumers benefit.
I cant say GE Money has breached the terms of the agreement and I wouldnt expect the 
rate to follow another rate, such as the Bank of England base rate (BoEBR), where this isnt 
stated in the agreement.
Between 25 September 2014 and July 2016 (which is when Shawbrook took over the loan) 
the interest rate should have varied in-line with the GEBLR. We know that during this period, 
there were no changes to the GEBLR and no changes to Mr Ws variable rate. So, I cant 
say that the lender acted unfairly during this period as the terms have been applied 
consistently.Having considered everything, Im satisfied the interest rate term was applied fairly during 
the period the loan was with GE Money.
Shawbrook July 2016 onwards
I agree that when Mr W took out the mortgage, it was on the expectation that the rate would 
be variable, with the GEBLR being used as the reference rate. But the GEBLR ceased to 
exist when Shawbrook took over the loan and Shawbrook left the rate unchanged until 
November 2021 when it reduced Mr Ws rate from 11.76% to 5.67% (backdated to January 
2021).
I understand Mr W feels his rate should have varied in that period between 2016 and 2021, 
and it was unfair that it didnt.
Ive considered this point very carefully, including what the contract says and what happened 
with Mr Ws individual interest rate. Having done so Im satisfied Mr W hasnt been treated 
unfairly due to Shawbrook not varying the rate in that period. Ill explain why.
Whilst this isnt a BoEBR tracker product, that is a useful external benchmark of market rates 
to use here to explain why I dont think Mr W has been disadvantaged by Shawbrook not 
varying his rate between 2016 and 2021.
The starting point here is that Im satisfied the rate of 11.76% was correct when Shawbrook 
took over the loan in July 2016. So, if the loan rate was to vary, it would have been from that 
starting point.
There have only been two periods over the seven-years from July 2016 to June 2023 where 
Mr Ws loan would have been charged at a lower rate had it tracked BoEBR. Those were;
from August 2016 to November 2017  a period of fifteen months  where Mr Ws 
interest rate would have been 0.25 percentage points lower if it had tracked BoEBR, and
from March 2020 to January 2021  a period of ten months  where Mr Ws interest rate 
would have been 0.40 percentage points lower if it had tracked BoEBR.
That is set against;
a nineteen-month period (from August 2018 until March 2020) where Mr Ws interest 
rate would have been 0.25 percentage points higher if it had tracked BoEBR, and
the fact Shawbrook decreased the interest rate to 5.67% in January 2021 (backdated 
from November 2021) when the interest rate would have been 11.36% at that point if 
it had tracked BoEBR.
Up until the latest point we know  which was June 2023  Shawbrook maintained Mr Ws 
interest rate at 5.67%, despite BoEBR increasing substantially in that period. Had Mr Ws 
interest rate tracked BoEBR then in June 2023 his interest rate would have been 16.26%, 
against the 5.67% he was charged.
Full details of this can be seen in the table below.
Date BoEBR Mr Ws rate Mr Ws rate if it had tracked BoEBR
July 2016 0.50% 11.76% 11.76%
August 2016 0.25% 11.76% 11.51%November 2017 0.50% 11.76% 11.76%
August 2018 0.75% 11.76% 12.01%
March 2020 0.10% 11.76% 11.36%
January 2021 0.10% 5.67% 11.36%
December 2021 0.25% 5.67% 11.51%
February 2022 0.50% 5.67% 11.76%
March 2022 0.75% 5.67% 12.01%
May 2022 1.00% 5.67% 12.26%
June 2022 1.25% 5.67% 12.51%
August 2022 1.75% 5.67% 13.01%
September 2022 2.25% 5.67% 13.51%
November 2022 3.00% 5.67% 14.26%
December 2022 3.50% 5.67% 14.76%
February 2023 4.00% 5.67% 15.26%
March 2023 4.25% 5.67% 15.51%
May 2023 4.50% 5.67% 15.76%
June 2023 5.00% 5.67% 16.26%
Im satisfied that if Mr Ws interest rate had instead followed an external benchmark like the 
BoEBR since July 2016 then Mr W would have incurred more interest over that period than 
he actually did. For that reason Im satisfied he hasnt lost out financially due to the interest 
rate not varying from July 2016 (other than the 2021 reduction to 5.67%) and so I cant say 
Shawbrook acted unfairly.
My final decision
For the reasons given I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 October 2023.
