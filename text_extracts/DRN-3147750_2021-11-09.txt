Complaint
Mrs T has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly continued to 
applying charges to her overdraft when she was in financial difficulty.
  
Background and my provisional decision of 18 October 2021
One of our investigators looked at this complaint and didnt think NatWest had done anything 
wrong or had treated Mrs T unfairly. Mrs T disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to 
review her complaint.   
On 25 October 2021, I issued a provisional decision setting out my initial findings on Mrs Ts 
complaint. I wont copy that decision in full, but I will instead provide a summary of my 
findings. 
I started by saying that NatWest will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good 
industry practice we consider when looking at whether a bank treated a customer fairly and 
reasonably when applying overdraft charges. So I didnt consider it necessary to set all of it 
out in my provisional decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, I thought that NatWest acted unfairly when 
it continued adding interest and associated fees and charges to Mrs Ts overdraft from 
December 2017. I was satisfied that by this point, it was evident Mrs T had been hardcore 
borrowing for a year. A cursory look at her statements leading up to this period showed that 
she hadnt seen a credit balance during this period. 
Given Mrs T had thus far proved unable to do so, over an extended period, it was unclear to 
me how NatWest expected her to repay what she owed within a reasonable period of time. 
So at this point, I thought that NatWest should have stopped providing the overdraft on the 
same terms and treated Mrs T with forbearance, even if this meant taking corrective action in 
relation to the facility, rather than adding even more interest, fees and charges to the 
balance.
All of this meant that NatWest should have realised that Mrs T was experiencing financial 
difficulty, wasnt using her overdraft as intended and shouldnt have continued offering it on 
the same terms. As NatWest didnt react to Mrs Ts overdraft usage and instead continued 
charging in the same way, I thought that it failed to act fairly and reasonably towards her. 
Mrs T ended up paying additional interest, fees and charges on her overdraft at a time when 
she was already experiencing difficulty. So I stated my intention to issue a final decision 
which found that Mrs T lost out because of what NatWest did wrong and that it should put 
things right.
NatWests response to my provisional decision   
NatWest said that it didnt agree with my provisional decision as the charges were applied in 
line with the terms and conditions of the account. But it agreed to settle the complaint, in line 
with my provisional decision, as a gesture of goodwill.
Mrs Ts response to my provisional decision
Mrs T didnt provide anything further for me to think about.
  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I thank the parties for their further comments. I can confirm that Ive read and considered 
everything theyve said and provided. 
Although I am pleased to see that NatWest has agreed to pay compensation in line with my 
recommendations, I am deeply concerned at NatWests reasons for failing to agree with the 
substance of my provisional decision. So I want to absolutely clear in saying that just 
because any overdraft charges were applied in line with the terms and conditions of the 
account it doesnt automatically follow that NatWest will have acted fairly and reasonably. It 
is extremely important that NatWest understands this. 
Overall and having considered the further points made in response to my provisional 
decision, Im still upholding Mrs Ts complaint. 
  
Fair compensation  what NatWest needs to do to put things right for Mrs T
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Mrs Ts complaint for NatWest to put things right by:
Reworking Mrs Ts current overdraft balance so that all interest, fees and charges 
applied to it from December 2017 onwards are removed.
AND
If an outstanding balance remains on the overdraft once these adjustments have 
been made NatWest should contact Mrs T to arrange a suitable repayment plan 
for this. If NatWest considers it appropriate to record negative information on     
Mrs Ts credit file, it should reflect what would have been recorded had it started 
the process of taking corrective action on the account from December 2017.
OR
If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer 
being an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments 
and returned to Mrs T along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from 
the date they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement. If no 
outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, then 
NatWest should remove any adverse information from Mrs Ts credit file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NatWest to take off tax from this interest. NatWest must 
give Mrs T a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
  
My final decisionFor the reasons explained above and in my provisional decision of 25 October 2021, Im 
upholding Mrs Ts complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc should put things right in the 
way Ive set out above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 December 2021.
