The complaint
Miss P says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly 
lent to her. Miss P says Sunny should have known she couldnt afford to make the loan 
repayments and she had to borrow further in order to do so. This led her into a spiral of debt. 
What happened
This complaint is about 14 short-term loans Sunny provided to Miss P between March 2018 
and July 2019. Miss Ps borrowing history is as follows:

 Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ps complaint and thought the loans from loan three 
onwards shouldnt have been given as Sunny was aware of Miss Ps income and 
expenditure and should have seen the loan repayments would have left her with a limited 
disposable income and which would have made the borrowing unsustainable. 
Sunny disagreed. It said the lending was affordable, but it did offer to uphold the complaint 
for loans 11 to 14. We put the offer to Miss P, but she didnt wish to accept it.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss P could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss P could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Miss P didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one and two shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Miss P had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ps complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why.
When writing to Sunny, our adjudicator detailed Miss Ps income and expenditure it had 
recorded and explained that the combined repayments for loans two and three  loan two 
still had four months to run if it ran to the agreed term  would leave Miss P with insufficient 
income and the lending was likely to be unsustainable. 
For loan three Sunny had recorded that Miss P was earning £1,081.92 and had total 
expenses of £901. As loan two was being repaid at the same time as loan three, the 
combined monthly repayments would have been £105.58 which only left Miss P with around 
£75 in disposable income for the next three to four months. Our adjudicator thought this was 
unlikely to have been sustainable for Miss P. 
In response, Sunny explained that the expenditure recorded when loan three was applied for 
included the monthly repayment amount for loan two. It said this left Miss P with enough 
disposable income each month. So, the borrowing was affordable and sustainable. 
But I dont agree. While Sunny has told us the monthly repayment for loan two was included, 
it hasnt given me any evidence or breakdown of how its calculated Miss Ps expenditure so I 
cant be sure. And I cant tally the loan repayments with what Sunny has recorded. It has told 
us Miss Ps monthly credit expenditure at loan two was £325, and it had reduced to £276 
when she took loan three. It may have been the case that Miss P had paid off a debt 
elsewhere, but I cant know this for certain or rely on it without further evidence. 
So, on the face of it, when Miss P took loan three, her monthly income was £1081.92 and 
expenditure was £901, leaving a disposable income of £181. The combined monthly 
repayments for loans two and three would leave her with a limited amount of disposable 
income month for the next four months. I dont think this was enough bearing in mind it was 
unlikely that Miss P would not incur some unexpected expenditure during that time. So, I 
think the borrowing was unaffordable and unlikely to be sustainable for loan three and any 
subsequent loans. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss P, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ps case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss P was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss P had taken out six loans within 11. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Miss P was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Ps 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
From loan six onwards Miss P was provided with a new loan within days or weeks of 
settling a previous one. 
 
Miss P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 14 was 
taken out 16 months after Miss Ps first. And it was for the same amount as the first. 
Miss P had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period.
 
I think that Miss P lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ps indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Miss P borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Miss Ps ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans three to 14 and Sunny 
should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do 
If the outstanding balance due on Miss Ps loan 14 has been transferred to a third party 
Sunny should buy the loan back if it can. If Sunny cant buy the loan back, then it needs to 
work with the third party to make sure the following is achieved: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Miss P towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss P which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss P originally made the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding loans, 
and treat any repayments made by Miss P as though they had been repayments of the 
principal on all outstanding loans. 
If this results in Miss P having made overpayments then Sunny should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the 
overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 
Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus, then the surplus should be paid to Miss P. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss P. 
E) Remove any adverse information recorded on Miss Ps credit file in relation to loans three 
to five.
The number of loans taken from six onwards means any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So, all entries about loans six to 14 should be removed from Miss Ps credit file. 
Sunny does not have to remove loan 14 from Miss Ps credit file until these have been 
repaid, but any adverse information recorded about these loans should still be removed.        
                                                                                                                    
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
If after doing the above Miss P still has an outstanding balance due, then Sunny should try 
and work together to come to a mutually agreeable repayment plan with Miss P in order to 
repay what is owed. But Id remind Sunny of its obligation to treat Miss P fairly. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Ps complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 July 2020.
