The complaint
Mr B says that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) acted irresponsibly by providing 
him with an overdraft facility and allowing him to increase his overdraft limit to £3,500. 
What happened
Mr B applied online and was agreed for an overdraft with a limit of £2,000 in September 
2019. This was increased to £3,500 in February 2020. 
Mr B complained that the overdraft was unaffordable and shouldnt have been approved as 
he had no previous credit history and an income which was less than declared. 
One of our adjudicators looked into Mr Bs concerns and didnt think NatWest had made an 
error on its overdraft lending and was satisfied that NatWest had carried out appropriate 
credit checks and that the lending was affordable based on the information NatWest had. 
Mr B disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, to be clear my decision only relates to Mr Bs overdraft lending with NatWest. Any 
other lending is being dealt with in separate complaints.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including the 
key rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. And Ive referred to this 
when deciding Mr Bs complaint. Having considered everything provided, Ive decided not to 
uphold Mr Bs complaint. Ill explain why in a little more detail. 
NatWest needed to make sure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means is 
NatWest needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand whether Mr B 
would be able to repay what he was being lent before providing any credit to him. Our 
website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. 
Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less thorough  in terms of 
how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship. But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income 
was low or the amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the 
greater the risk of it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial 
difficulty. 
Ive kept all of this in mind when thinking about whether NatWest did what it needed to 
before agreeing to Mr Bs overdraft. Mr B was given what was an open-ended credit facility. 
So overall this means the checks NatWest carried out had to provide enough for it to be able 
to understand whether Mr B would be able to repay his overdraft within a reasonable period 
of time. 
NatWest says Mr B had an initial overdraft with a limit of £2,000 in September 2019 which 
increased to its highest limit of £3,500 by February 2020. NatWest says all overdraft and 
limit increase applications were fully credit scored taking into account information Mr B 
provided about his income and how Mr B had managed his accounts held with it, as well as 
information held by other lenders provided through credit reference checks. 
NatWest has provided me with a copy of Mr Bs overdraft data from both his application 
forms. I can see that both applications were clean accepts indicating that no adverse data 
had shown up on his credit report which is hardly surprising as prior to the initial overdraft 
lending Mr B has told us that hed never taken out any form of credit.
I can see from Mr Bs bank statements that prior to the lending he was receiving healthy 
regular credits into his account which exceeded the total income figures NatWest used when 
assessing his overdraft applications (£1,486 on his initial application and £1,462 on the 
overdraft limit increase application). On these figures and after calculating and deducting Mr 
Bs living costs and other credit commitments Mr B was left with funds exceeding £800 and 
that the overdraft limits he requested were within the affordable limit NatWest had calculated 
for him. 
Mr B says he was only working part time and some of the credits received into his account 
were from his parents. I accept this may well have been the case, but NatWest would not 
have known these credits were not a source of income and when assessing Mr Bs 
application it would have looked at the amount being credited to the account as a whole. And 
based on this information NatWest was satisfied his score was high enough to provide him 
with the overdraft facility and limits he requested.
I think it is also worth mentioning prior to the overdraft limit increase in February 2020 
although Mr B was utilising his overdraft, he never exceeded his limit and what he held in his 
other account with NatWest was enough to pay off his overdraft should he have needed to. 
I accept that Mr Bs financial position may well have been worse than the credit checks 
carried out showed or in any information he disclosed to NatWest at the time of his 
applications. And it is possible that further checks might have told NatWest this. But NatWest 
was reasonably entitled to rely on the credit check it carried out and the information Mr B 
provided it. And given there wasnt any adverse information shown on the credit check, or 
significant outstanding debts elsewhere and his other accounts showed a credit balance, I 
think NatWests checks went far enough. 
So I dont agree that NatWest acted irresponsibly by allowing Mr B an overdraft and 
agreeing to increase his overdraft limit. And considering the credits going into the account I 
dont think that it was unreasonable for NatWest to conclude Mr B would be able to repay the 
additional funds within a reasonable period of time. 
This means that I dont agree NatWest provided Mr B with an overdraft unfairly or 
irresponsibly. That said, even though I dont think Mr Bs overdraft was approved 
irresponsibly, NatWest still wont have acted fairly and reasonably towards Mr B if it applied 
any interest, fees and charges to Mr Bs account in circumstances where it was aware, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to have been aware Mr B was experiencing financial difficulty. 
So Ive considered whether there were instances where NatWest didnt treat Mr B fairly and 
reasonably. Mr B was made redundant in October 2020 and in November although he still 
had around £1,600 in his other account, he was at the top of his overdraft limit and not long after this he entered NatWests collections department regarding lending not related to Mr 
Bs overdraft. 
At this point Mr B got in touch with NatWest following a letter he had received from it asking 
if he needed help. NatWest took action quickly and froze interest on the account in order to 
assist Mr B sent him a letter requesting his income and expenditure so it could work out 
repayment proposals which is in line with what Id expect. 
So I dont think that NatWest treated Mr B unfairly or unreasonably which means that Im not 
upholding this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 February 2023.
