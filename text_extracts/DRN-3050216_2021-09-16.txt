The complaint
H, a limited company, complains that WorldPay (UK) Limited recorded a default against it,
although it had paid a debt to it in line with its agreement with WorldPay. Hs complaint is
brought by Mr T, a director of the limited company.
What happened
Mr T said that hed processed a refund from H to a customer, through WorldPay. Mr T had
understood that this money would come out of Hs bank account, but then WorldPay got in
touch to say that H owed it this money. So Mr T said he made an arrangement to pay off the
money in instalments, but WorldPay issued a notice of arrears before he could make the
second payment, and put a default on Hs credit file.
Mr T said that the business relies on lines of credit, and Hs available credit with another
lender was reduced just after this. So Mr T thought this was because of what WorldPay had
done. Mr T said hed complained, and WorldPay had apologised, but it now said hed missed
two months of payments, which wasnt true. And it wouldnt remove the default.
WorldPay said that H made a payment through his WorldPay account, as a refund, on 27
April 2020 for £537.30. WorldPay tried to take this money from Hs account the next day, but
the payment was rejected. So WorldPay had paid this refund to Hs customer, and it couldnt
get the money back from Hs account.
WorldPay told us it had agreed a repayment plan with Mr T, on behalf of H. He was
supposed to pay £337.70 on 13 May 2020 then a second payment of £200 on 5 June 2020.
WorldPay recorded this as a promise to pay. But WorldPay said this promise was broken, as
the first payment was late.
Mr T has shown us that he sent this payment on 14 May. Worldpay says it was not received
until 15 May 2020. WorldPay said theres no grace period for a first payment, so a Status
One marker was added to Hs company credit file on CAIS (Credit Account Information
Sharing). This would appear to be the equivalent of a missed or late payment marker on a
persons credit file.
Worldpay said that it could see that when Mr T complained on behalf of H, it had made
mistakes in its reply. It had told H that there was a default recorded against it, when all that
was recorded was one Status One marker. And it had said that the second payment was
late, which was also wrong. But it didnt think it had made a mistake about recording the
status one marker.
Worldpay said that the second payment was made on time, and the first payment had been
made, albeit late, so H didnt owe it any money now. It would be updating CAIS to show this.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that WorldPay
had been unreasonable. Our investigator said WorldPay usually offsets any refunds given
against payments received by a business that day, but H had only made one transaction that
day, which was a large refund. And then this payment didnt come out of Hs bank account.
Our investigator noted the mistakes that WorldPay had made in its communications with H,
and passed on its apology for this.
Our investigator said Mr T had set up a payment arrangement for H, but the first payment
was late. Worldpay hadnt registered a default, just a Status One marker. Our investigator
thought that was reasonable. He said that our service couldnt know if this marker was the
reason why Hs other lender had reduced its available credit. And he stressed that WorldPay
hadnt done anything wrong by recording this marker. Our investigator didnt think that it
would be appropriate to ask WorldPay to make a payment of compensation in this case.
Mr T replied on behalf of H. He said that hed only contacted WorldPay on 14 May, and
made a payment on the same day. It wrote to him on 11 May, and he only got the letter late
on 13 May. He said that there was no arrangement to pay set up until 14 May, when he
made the first payment and agreed to make the second.
Our investigator didnt change his mind. He said that he felt that the screenshot showing that
a payment was due on 13 May 2020 was evidence that a payment plan was set up, with that
as the first payment date. But as Mr T on behalf of H hadnt agreed with our investigator, the
case came to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
When this case came to me, I asked Worldpay for some more evidence. I thought 
that if it had indeed been in touch with Mr T, on behalf of H, to ask him to make a 
payment, that it was likely to have put this in writing. But we hadnt seen any letter 
telling H that it owed WorldPay some money. So I asked to see this letter.
Worldpay said it couldnt show us a letter. It said that it must have written to Mr T, to 
prompt him to get in touch on 13 May. It sent us notes showing Mr T had been in 
touch on 13 May.
Worldpays previous argument appears to have been that it had agreed a payment 
plan with Mr T before 13 May, and his first payment was due then, but not made until 
later. It now appears to be saying that Mr T first rang it on 13 May, in response to a 
letter it sent asking him to make a payment, to cover the £537.50 refund it had made. 
And WorldPay agreed this plan with Mr T on 13 May, during this call.
Although Mr T thought hed spoken to WorldPay on 14 May, not 13 May, what 
WorldPay has now said, about Mr T making a payment straight away when he first 
contacted it about this debt, is in line with what Mr T has always said.
Worldpay also said that it had sent in the CAIS report between the refund being 
made, and Mr T contacting it on behalf of H to make a payment. But it now says that 
the report was made well before the payments were made by Mr T to clear Hs debt 
to WorldPay. And those payments didnt affect the CAIS report.
So it does seem as if Hs account with WorldPay went into debt, which Mr T wasnt
expecting, and this debt was reported to CAIS, before Mr T was notified of this debt 
and given an opportunity to pay. It also appears, from what WorldPay has said now, 
that Mr T did keep to the repayment arrangement that he had made with WorldPay.I dont think its fair and reasonable for WorldPay to have reported a payment as 
overdue, when H wasnt expecting to owe any money, and hadnt been made aware 
of the problem. So I think that WorldPay should remove any negative markers it has 
placed on Hs CAIS file, which resulted from this refund.
Mr T also says that this affected Hs lending elsewhere. I cant be sure that this had 
the effect that Mr T fears, because this is a decision made by a different lender. But I 
do understand that sorting out this problem has taken up a considerable amount of 
Mr Ts time, which I would otherwise expect would have been spent advancing Hs 
business. So I think that Worldpay should pay H £200 in compensation, to make up 
for that.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Worldpay said it had nothing to add, and it would accept my decision. Mr T said on behalf of 
H that he was grateful. He said that this had always been about the principle, not about 
money, so he was more than happy to accept £200 in compensation.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the decision I originally proposed, which includes 
both compensation and amendments to Hs CAIS file.
My final decision
My final decision is that WorldPay (UK) Limited must remove any negative markers it has 
placed on Hs CAIS file, which resulted from this refund, and to pay H £200 in compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask H to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2021.
