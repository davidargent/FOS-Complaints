The complaint
Miss Ns complaint is that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has used the 
compensation from three mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) policies to reduce the 
debt it says Miss N still owes it following completion of an Individual Voluntary Arrangement 
(IVA).
What happened
In 2009 Miss N entered into an IVA. My understanding is the IVA was completed in 2013.
NatWest was party to the IVA.
In 2019 Miss N complained to NatWest about  PPI policies she had been sold with three 
loans taken out in 1995,1998 and 2001.
NatWest agreed to uphold the complaints and offered compensation which Miss N accepted. 
But NatWest used the compensation to reduce the debt it said was still owed by Miss N.
Miss N says that as the IVA has been completed, NatWest should pay the compensation 
directly to her.
Our adjudicator thought NatWest had acted fairly. Miss N disagreed with the adjudicators 
findings so the complaints been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold Miss Ns complaint and Ill explain why.
Ive looked at the letters NatWest sent to Miss N in May 2019. I can see that on page one 
they mention the offers of compensation. On page two the letters mention that if Miss N had 
been party to an IVA any payment would be made to the relevant account and any 
disbursements would be managed by NatWests insolvency team.
And on the forms which Miss N signed to accept the offers it was again stated that if Miss N 
had been in an IVA then any payment will be made to the relevant account. So I think 
NatWests offer made it clear that it intended to use the compensation to offset any 
outstanding debt.
Miss N has told us there is no outstanding debt as all the debt with NatWest was written off 
and does not exist following the completion of the IVA.
Ive thought about this but when Miss N entered into the IVA, the debts she owed werent 
cancelled. And they werent cancelled when she completed the IVA in 2013. Miss N couldnt 
be chased for the debts. However, the debt she had with NatWest still existed.
NatWest has shown us evidence that on completion of the IVA there remained a debt of
£6,154.08 which originated from a current account overdraft. I think NatWest can fairly use 
the compensation to reduce this balance. In effect Miss N owes NatWest the outstanding 
debt from her current account, and NatWest owes Miss N a smaller amount of compensation 
for mis-sold PPI policies. I dont think it would be fair for me to direct NatWest to pay Miss N 
the compensation when Miss N still owes NatWest a larger amount. So I think its fair for 
NatWest to set one against the other.
I see that in June 2019 NatWest used the compensation of £4,699.85 to reduce the 
outstanding debt to £1,454.23.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc has acted fairly when using the 
compensation from  mis-sold PPI to reduce Miss Ns outstanding debt. So I make no further 
award against National Westminster Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss N to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 May 2021.
