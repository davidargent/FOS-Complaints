The complaint
Mr M complains that American Express Services Europe (Amex) marked his credit file with a 
missed payment in September 2020.
What happened
Mr M had credit card from Amex. On the statement dated 5 June 2020, the limit was 
£8,100 and balance £8,242. The minimum payment required was £300, due by 30 June 
2020. On 22 June 2020, Mr M paid in £300. On 25 June 2020, he called Amex and asked 
for a three- month payment holiday under the Covid-19 support scheme. This was agreed 
by Amex. The statement dated 5 September 2020 asked for a payment of £301 by 30 
September 2020.
That wasnt paid by Mr M and Amex notified the credit reference agencies (CRAs) of a 
missed payment.
Mr M complained. He said hed enrolled for a three-month payment holiday on 25 June 
2020, after having paid the June 2020 bill. So, he said the payment holiday should run for 
July 2020, August 2020, and September 2020  with the next payment then due in 
October 2020. He didnt agree that the payment holiday shouldve started in June 2020  
as he had paid that month. He said that his credit file was now affected.
Amex said their process was to date the payment holiday from the current cycle, plus the 
next two cycles. So, the months covered by the payment holiday were June 2020, July 
2020, and August 2020. The next payment was therefore due by 30 September 2020  
and that wasnt paid by Mr M. Amex said that Mr M had called Amex on 15 July 2020  
and he was then told that the payment holiday started in June 2020.
Mr M brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Amex hadnt acted reasonably. He 
thought it was reasonable for Mr M to assume the payment holiday would start after the 
payment he made in June 2020  three days before he called to arrange the payment 
holiday. He could see that later, in 2021, Amex had defaulted Mr Ms account and so the 
default should be backdated to the earliest possible date, and compensation £100 should 
be paid.
Amex didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at Mr Ms complaint.
I came to a provisional decision:
Mr Ms complaint is specifically about what happened in connection with the payment 
holiday that he requested in June 2020. His complaint to Amex, and to this service, didnt 
mention the later problems he had with his account  I can see that it was defaulted in 
2021 and Mr M told us it was passed to a debt collection agency. But Im not going to 
address what happened after September 2020. If Mr M wishes to complain about events 
after that, he must firstly complain to Amex; and, if he is not happy with their response, he 
has the option to bring that complaint to us.
Looking at what happened in June 2020. In April 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) announced guidance to lenders in response to the effects on customers of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. All lenders, including Amex, had to put in place payment holidays 
on many credit agreements, including credit cards  to help customers who were affected.
Customers could ask for a total of two payment holidays each of three months  whereby 
payments could be suspended. Missed payments would not be reported to credit reference 
agencies, although interest would still be debited to the accounts. This support was 
provided by firms up to the end of October 2020.
The intention was to provide short term support  usually in cases where customers would 
be returning to work within a short period of time. And so  where a customers situation 
was that they were in longer term difficulty, then payment holidays under this scheme 
werent normally agreed.
So  Ive considered Mr Ms complaint in the light of this. The 5 June 2020 statement 
showed he needed to make the minimum payment of £300 by 30 June 2020  it was paid 
on 22 June 2020. Mr M then called Amex on 25 June 2020 to ask for a three-month 
payment holiday. Amex agreed to this. But Mr M thought the holiday was for the three 
months of July 2020, August 2020, and September 2020. Amex say that the holiday 
started in June 2020. And so  when Mr M didnt make the payment due by 30 September 
2020, Amex marked Mr Ms credit file with a missed payment.
]
Amex have shown us that their process was to mark the payment holiday from the current 
cycle  i.e. the month in which it was requested. They said their process was that Mr M 
would have been told that when he called. We asked Amex for the call on 25 June 2020 
so we could hear what Mr M was told  but this wasnt available. We also asked Amex for 
any letters or emails sent to Mr M about the payment holiday  but they told us their 
process was not to send anything. So  there isnt a lot of information we can see here.
Amex say that on a call on 15 July 2020, Mr M was told the cycle started in June 2020  
but this call isnt available either. There are notes of the call, which say Enrolled for last
month and the following two billing cycles- which may indicate Mr M was told as Amex 
say he was. But equally, the call notes reflect that Mr M was asking if a payment needed 
to be made in July as app saying need to make payment.any 
reminders/alerts/statements we cannot suppress, can ignore (while on payment holiday). 
And I can see that the statement dated 5 July 2020 showed that a minimum payment of 
£293 was needed by 30 July 2020. So  I dont think its reasonable to say that Mr M 
couldve been clearly told that the payment holiday ran from June 2020  as the point of 
the call was about July 2020s payment.
I also considered whether the statements that Mr M received told him about the payment 
holiday  and they dont. The statements for July 2020, August 2020 say that minimum 
payments were still needed  as Amex didnt adjust them to reflect the payment holiday. So, 
when Mr M received the statement for September 2020  it showed a payment of £301 was 
needed by 30 September 2020. And given what Mr M had been told on the call on 15 July 
2020  that he could ignore the amounts due  I think he could reasonably assume that the 
payment wasnt needed.
Amex showed us that they sent a Notice of Default to Mr M dated 5 October 2020  but this 
was after the event and I dont think it supports Amexs argument that the payment holiday 
only ran up to August 2020.
While Amex has followed their processes here, strictly following a procedure or process can 
lead to an unfair outcome for a customer in the individual circumstances of their situation. I 
think thats whats happened here. And so, on the balance of evidence, I am proposing to uphold Mr Ms complaint. And ask Amex to remove the late payment markers from Mr Ms 
credit file for the missed payment in September 2020. Mr M has told us how distressed and 
anxious he has been that a compensation payment of £100 is justified here.
Responses to the provisional decision:
Amex accepted the findings, but Mr M didnt. He said:
Compensation should be higher and 
Amex had ruined his life - as he now couldnt get any affordable credit, such as a 
mortgage. Any loans he was able to get would be at higher rates of interest 
because of what happened.
I now need to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
While I hear what Mr M has said in response to the provisional decision, I think its unlikely 
that he would be declined for lending at normal interest rates because of the missed 
payment in September 2020  which this decision puts right in any case. 
As I said in the provisional decision, it does appear that he ran into difficulties with Amex 
later, in 2021  when his account was defaulted and passed to a debt collection agency. I 
suspect it is that which is impacting him in the way he says. His complaint to us was 
specifically about the missed payment in September 2020, not about the later default.
If he wants to complain about the later default, he should complain to Amex in the first 
instance about that.
Similarly, the compensation of £100 is appropriate for the complaint that Mr M brought to us.
And so  my final decision is unchanged from the provisional decision.
(continued)
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. American Express Services Europe Limited (AESEL) must:
Remove the late payment marker from Mr Ms credit file for the missed payment in 
September 2020.
Pay compensation of £100 for distress and inconvenience. In responding to this 
final decision, Mr M should advise how he would like this to be paid.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 August 2022.
