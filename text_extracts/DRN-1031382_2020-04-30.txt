Complaint
Mr H has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
MYJAR Limited. Mr H says he was lent to irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial 
problems.
Im aware Mr H has made another, quite similar, complaint. But this involves a different 
company. Hell get a separate letter about that, but for this complaint Ill refer mainly to 
MYJAR to keep things simple.
Background
We now know that Mr H took out some 19 short-term loans from MYJAR between April 2014 
and July 2015. Ive enclosed a summary of his borrowing with MYJAR, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
MYJAR said it was prepared to settle the complaint in relation to loans 5  14 and loan 19. 
Mr H didnt agree so one of our adjudicators looked into the complaint and said they thought 
it should be upheld from the point of loan number 5 onwards. MYJAR didnt agree and so the 
complaint has come to me for an ombudsmans final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking about Mr Hs 
complaint.
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr H could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. However, certain factors might point to the fact that 
MYJAR should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr H could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
MYJAR told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr H. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked at the overall pattern of lending history with 
a view to seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, MYJAR should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Ive looked carefully at Mr Hs declared income and what he said about his monthly 
expenditure. With this information, and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length 
of the lending relationship, I think the checks which MYJAR most likely carried out appear to 
have been proportionate for loans 1  4. Although they would have been quite basic, I think 
these levels of checks would have made these particular loans appear affordable. So Im not 
upholding this part of Mr Hs complaint.
For loans 5 and 6, we know MYJAR already accepts it shouldnt have lent to Mr H (because 
it previously agreed to repay him for loans 5  14). So Im not going to go into any great 
detail about these. I agree that MYJARs financial checks in relation to these loans should 
have been more comprehensive. However, Id like to add some specific comments about all 
the lending after loan numbers 5 and 6, because there are important reasons why no more 
lending should have taken place.  
I think this because the emerging pattern of repeated lending from the point of loan 7 
onwards in this case would have looked different and therefore required a more thorough 
and responsible approach. The overall pattern of MYJARs lending to Mr H should have 
caused it to see, in my view, that it shouldnt have provided any further loans from the point 
of loan 7 onwards. 
This was Mr Hs seventh short-term loan with MYJAR in 3 months. And in common with his 
borrowing pattern thus far, he was again asking to borrow from MYJAR immediately after 
paying off the previous loan. His borrowing pattern was therefore rapid and indeed back-to-
back; and there was no sign of his borrowing decreasing in value. 
So MYJAR ought to have realised that between loan numbers 7  19 Mr H wasnt merely 
borrowing to deal with short-term cash-flow problems; he was borrowing very regularly, to address shortfalls in his income and to meet an ongoing need. Mr H was having to 
consistently take out high interest, short-term lending over a sustained period and the 
indebtedness caused by this type of borrowing was harmful, in my view. MYJAR should 
have realised Mr H was at risk of not managing to repay the loans sustainably or getting into 
financial difficulties. 
So in addition to loans 5 and 6, which MYJAR says it shouldnt have lent, Im also upholding 
this complaint in respect of loans 7 - 19. MYJAR repeatedly lent to Mr H in an unsustainable 
manner because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost loans
 
Putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 5 - 19;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loan 19* and treat any 
payments Mr H made towards this loan as payments towards the capital;
if reworking Mr Hs loan 19 account as Ive directed results in him effectively having 
made payments above the original capital borrowed, then MYJAR should refund 
these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from 
the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of settlement. 
if reworking Mr Hs loan 19 account leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, then 
MYJAR can use the total refund for other loans to offset this. And if there is still an 
outstanding capital balance then I would remind it that it should take a sympathetic 
view when seeking to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr H for the 
remaining capital
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Hs credit file in relation to loans 5 
and 6;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 7 - 19 should be completely 
removed from Mr Hs credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
*I understand loan 19 was never fully repaid.
My final decision
For the reasons given, I partly uphold Mr Hs complaint. MYJAR Limited should put things 
right for Mr H as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 May 2020.
