K820x#14complaint
Mr N complains that a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement with 
Santander Consumer  (UK) plc, trading as Santander Consumer Finance, wasnt  of 
satisfactory quality. 
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
Santander Consumer  Finance, as the supplier  of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality  when  it was supplied to Mr N. Whether or not it was of satisfactory 
quality at that time will depend on a number of factors,  including the age and mileage of the 
car and the price  that was paid for it. The car that was supplied  to him was about  five years 
old, had been  driven for 45,208 miles and had a price of £64,495. Satisfactory quality also 
covers durability which means that the components within the car must be durable and last a 
reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long that time is will depend on a number of 
factors. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
the car was supplied  to Mr N in June 2016 and he says that he complained to the 
dealer about some  issues with it within the first month but it didnt repair  the car;
hes provided an estimate from July 2016  of £9,750 for repairs  to an oil leak,  the 
shock absorbers and clutch;
he complained  to Santander  Consumer  Finance  in February  2017  about an issue 
with the cars brakes  but he didnt provide it with evidence about  that issue so his 
complaint wasnt upheld  and he didnt  complain to it at that time about the issues 
with the oil leak, shock absorbers  or clutch;
he complained  to Santander  Consumer  Finance  about  the oil leak,  clutch  and brake 
calipers in March 2019 but since then hes sold the car and says that it should refund 
his deposit and monthly payments;  
Santander Consumer  Finance says that the cars mileage in October 2017 was 
65,074  so in sixteen  months  hed been  able to drive nearly 20,000  miles in the car;
Mr N complained to Santander  Consumer Finance  about  the cars  brakes  in February  
2017  about eight  months after the car was supplied to him  but he didnt complain 
about the other issues that he had with the car and continued  to use it;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained  about  all of 
the issues that he had with the car at that time but he didnt do so until March  2019  
nearly three years after hed had the car and more than two years  after hed initially  
complained to it;
Ref: DRN42760602Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr N in June 2016 and I dont consider 
that it would  be fair or reasonable for Mr N to receive a refund of the deposit and 
monthly payments  that hes paid for the car; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Santander Consumer  Finance to refund to Mr N any of the money  that he paid for the 
car or to take any other  action  in response to his complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ns complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 June 2020.
