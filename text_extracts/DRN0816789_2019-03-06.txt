K820x#14complaint
Mrs W says Barclays  Bank UK PLC (Barclays) mis-sold her a Tech pack  from its feature 
store in 2012. Shes used a Claims Management  Company (CMC) to make  her complaint.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mrs Ws complaint and didnt think the feature store pack  
had been mis-sold. The CMC disagreed  and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mrs Ws complaint. 
Ive looked at everything thats been provided  on this complaint. And having done  so, I 
havent seen anything to suggest Mrs W was mis-sold her Tech pack. 
I think that Mrs W freely chose to take the Tech pack, and she couldve used the benefits 
too. So while  Im open  to the possibility Mrs W wasnt provided with everything she shouldve 
been, I havent seen anything to suggest  clearer information wouldve changed her decision.  
And, in these circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mrs Ws complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs W to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 April 2019.
