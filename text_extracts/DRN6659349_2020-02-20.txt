K821x#15complaint
Mr D says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 10 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr D between  October  2016  
and March 2018. Mr Ds borrowing  history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Amount Monthly 
Repayment
1 05/10/2016 22/03/2017 £200 £57.89
2 03/02/2017 21/07/2017 £600 £183.33
3 13/06/2017 22/08/2017 £150 £43.11
4 02/09/2017 22/11/2017 £700 £217.29
5 09/10/2017 22/12/2017 £150 £44.29
6 24/11/2017 22/02/218 £500 £163.98
7 30/12/2017 Outstanding £450 £142.10
8 05/02/2018 Outstanding £250 £75.21
9 22/02/2018 Outstanding £350 £114.74
10 31/03/2018 Outstanding £250 £77.83
Sunny has offered to refund all interest and charges for loans 4-10. Our adjudicator  reviewed 
the complaint  and thought  that Sunny should  do more. The adjudicator  found  that Sunny  
shouldnt have given  loan 3 onwards and that from loan 6 onwards  Mr D had become reliant 
on short  term loans so Sunny should  do more than just refund interest and charges.  Sunny 
didnt respond  to the adjudicators view.   
As an agreement couldnt  be reached, the case was passed to me  an ombudsman  for a 
final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr D could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN66593492the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint.  
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to more when it approved  loans 1 and 2. Mr D 
didnt disagree  with this so I wont  be making further  findings on these loans, but I have 
considered them when looking at Mr Ds borrowing history and his financial situation overall.
The adjudicator explained that had Sunny carried out proportionate checks  for loan 3 it 
would have shown  Mr D was not able to sustainably repay further borrowing. I agree with 
this and Ill explain why.
Sunny says it carried out checks when Mr D applied for loan 3 and these checks  didnt 
reveal anything  of concern. It says based on Mr Ds income and expenditure, he had 
sufficient disposable  income to afford the repayment. However, I think if Sunny had reacted 
effectively to the information  it had gathered it wouldve seen that loan 3 was not affordable  
for Mr D. When Mr D took out loan 3, he still had loan 2. This meant  his highest monthly 
repayment to Sunny  for his loans was £226. Mr D was earning £1,250 a month and had a 
monthly expenditure of £949.  This left him with £301  and the loan repayment for loan 3 took 
out a significant proportion of this, leaving Mr D with £75 to last the remainder of the month. 
So as the repayment represented  a significant  proportion of Mr Ds income,  I think  Sunny 
ought to have realised this and the potential for Mr D to struggle to make  the repayment.
Given Mr Ds income  and borrowing, it seems  there  was a significant chance of Mr D
having to borrow  again to meet his commitment under this loan. Sunny was under a
duty to ensure the lending  could  be sustainably repaid and in Mr Ds case I dont think it
was. And I think this wouldve been  clear to Sunny at the outset when it gathered
Ref: DRN66593493information from Mr D.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr D with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ds case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr D was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr D had taken out 6 loans within 14 months. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mr D was having to borrow further  to cover the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ds 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ds first loan was for £200 and loan 6 was for £500. At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that Mr D was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
Mr D wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  6 was 
taken out around 14 months after Mr Ds first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr D 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr D lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr D borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ds ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 3 to 7 and Sunny should put things right.
Ref: DRN66593494putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr D loans 3 to 10. So it should (or direct any third party to do, if 
it has sold on outstanding  loans):
refund  all interest and charges that Mr D paid on the loan 3;
honour the offer of £231.10 for loans  4 - 10
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date
of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 - 5 from Mr Ds credit file;
write off unpaid interest  on loans 7 - 10 and apply  the refund towards the outstanding 
balance and pay the remaining to Mr D.
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 means  any information  recorded about them
is adverse. So all entries about  loans 6 -10 should  be removed from Mr Ds credit file
*HMRC requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. If Mr D asks Sunny for a certificate showing 
how much  tax its taken off, you should provide this. If Sunny intend to use the refund to reduce  an 
amount Mr D owes, you must do this after tax.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Ds complaint.  Elevate  Credit  International 
Limited should pay put things right for Mr D as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman ask Mr D to accept or reject  my decision 
before 20 March 2020.
