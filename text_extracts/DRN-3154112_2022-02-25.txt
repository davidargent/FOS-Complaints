The complaint
Mr and Mrs I complain that their premiums for their AXA Insurance UK Plc (AXA) motor 
insurance policies were too high.
What happened
In July 2017, Mrs I was involved in a car accident with a third party. At the time she was 
insured with another insurance company. The other driver disputed liability for the accident. 
The matter was eventually settled in court in September 2019. The court found that the other 
driver was at fault.
Mr and Mrs I took out four motor insurance policies with AXA between August 2018 and 
December 2019. Mr I believes AXA calculated his premiums for these policies based on the 
open claim against his wife. He thinks these premiums should be recalculated because the 
court decided his wife wasnt at fault for the accident. Hed like AXA to refund the amount it 
overcharged him. He says he first contacted AXA about this in July 2020.
AXA accepts that it didnt respond adequately to Mr Is original emails and letters and didnt 
recalculate his premiums when he first told it about the courts decision. In fact, AXA didnt 
respond to his complaint until July 2021, after hed come to us. It apologised for this and for 
failing to acknowledge his requests to recalculate his premiums between August 2020 and 
July 2021. It refunded Mr and Mrs I £475.90 for their 2018 and 2019 premiums. It also paid 
them £200 to apologise for its poor service.
Mr and Mrs I remain unhappy with this. They dont think AXA has refunded them for all their 
affected policies.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She reviewed AXAs 
evidence and was satisfied that it had refunded the correct amount.
Mr I disagreed with our investigator, so the case was passed to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First, Mr I has asked us a lot of questions about his AXA policies and wants us to reply to 
each of these. Ive considered everything hes said but I dont think I need to comment on 
each point to reach the right outcome. Ive focused instead on what I think is the key issue.
Mr I thinks AXA overcharged premiums for four policies in 2018 and 2019. I need to decide if 
thats right and if AXAs refund is appropriate. 
When underwriters price insurance policies, the premium can sometimes be higher if theres 
an open claim against the customer. This is because the underwriter considers the risk of 
insuring the customer to be greater. However, if that claim is settled in the customers favour 
 in other words, a no fault claim  the insurer should review the premium to make sure it 
priced it correctly and treated the customer fairly. So when Mr I told AXA the result of the 
court case about his wifes accident, AXA should have reviewed the premiums for their 
motor insurance policies.
AXA told us it only recorded an open claim on only two of Mr and Mrs Is four policies. It says 
the other two policies recorded the claim as no fault from inception in November and 
December 2019. It says this means the premium was calculated correctly for two policies 
and it had to recalculate Mr and Mrs Is premiums for the other two policies. Ive shown this 
in the table below: 
Policy Start EndRefund 
Y/NReason
1 16-Aug-18 16-Aug-20 Y Refund period covers Aug 2018 and Aug 2019 premiums
2 11-Dec-18 10-Dec-19 Y Refund period covers Dec 2018 premium only
3 24-Nov-19 23-Nov-20 N Premium originally calculated on 'no fault' basis
4 11-Dec-19 10-Dec-20 N Premium originally calculated on 'no fault' basis
Im satisfied that this is correct. Policies 3 and 4 were taken out after the court decision on 
Mrs Is accident. And while AXA told us that the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE) 
database was still showing the claim as unresolved when these policies were taken out, AXA 
says it took no further action. This means the premiums for policies 3 and 4 were calculated 
correctly, as no fault claims against Mrs I. It follows that theres no reason for AXA to amend 
the premiums for these two policies. 
AXAs underwriter provided us with detailed pricing information for policies 1 and 2. This 
shows two calculations for each policy:
1. The policy priced as an open claim. In other words, what Mr and Mrs I actually paid.
2. The policy priced as a no fault claim. In other words, what they should have paid.
The refunds were the difference between these two calculations for each policy. As our 
investigator explained, the pricing calculations are commercially sensitive and Im unable to 
share them with Mr I. However, Ive reviewed them and Im satisfied that AXA calculated the 
refunds for these two policies correctly. 
The refunds were:
Policy 1 £173.13 (2018) + £251.48 (2019) = £424.61
Policy 2 £51.29 (2018).
Total £475.90
AXA provided screenshots that show it paid Mrs I the £475.90 refund and £200 
compensation on 26 July 2021. Mr I says AXA hasnt paid them the full amount. 
I think it has. Mr Is letter to us on 19 September 2021 said his wife had received £51.29 for 
policy 2, plus the £200 compensation. He said this meant they hadnt received the 
outstanding £424.61 for policy 2. But he also said a refund for two years has been made in 
relation to policy 1. Im satisfied that this was the outstanding £424.61, and Mr and Mrs I 
have received their full refund.
This was complicated and I understand why Mr I was confused about it. It wasnt entirely 
clear to us what had happened until we reviewed AXAs pricing information. I also 
understand why Mr I was upset by AXAs poor service and its failure to resolve this sooner.However, for the reasons above, Im satisfied that AXA calculated the refund correctly. I also 
think its offer of £200 to apologise for its poor service is fair. As Im satisfied by what AXA 
has done, Im not upholding Mr and Mrs Is complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs I and Mr I to 
accept or reject my decision before 24 March 2022.
