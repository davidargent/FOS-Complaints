K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains that Transunion International UK Limited refuses to delete some of the 
information it has recorded on his credit file
background
Mr H complains that some of the information TransUnion has recorded  on his credit file is 
inaccurate, but that TransUnion wont delete it. Specifically, he complains about:
Two addresses which he says he has never been to,
Other addresses continuing to appear on his credit file more than six years after he 
left them,
The same  notice  of correction appears  several times,
Multiple searches  with his name  spelled incorrectly, and
Searches remaining  on his file for more  than a year.
TransUnion said that it reports searches for two years, and addresses permanently.  But as a 
gesture of good  will it removed one address which was no longer linked to a credit  account. 
It said it was unable to remove an address  which was still linked to an account,  and this 
applies to all of the remaining  addresses. It said that the notice of correction had only been 
recorded once,  but it appears under each address, so that it will be seen  by someone who 
searches for one address.  So although  it might look as if the notice has been duplicated, it 
has not been. The searches with the incorrect  name are not visible  to lenders,  only to Mr H, 
so this had caused him no detriment. Finally, TransUnion said it was unable to amend an 
address, and so Mr H would have to take this up with the relevant lender.
Our investigator upheld  part of this complaint. He accepted most of what TransUnion had 
said, but he thought that TransUnion ought  to raise  the matter of the incorrect  address with 
the lender on Mr Hs behalf. He accepted that TransUnion could not unilaterally remove the 
address if it was wrong, but if the lender accepted  that it was wrong then the lender would 
instruct TransUnion to remove it. He also said that if any other addresses were no longer 
linked to an account, then TransUnion should remove  them.
TransUnion did not accept that decision, and asked for an ombudsman to review  this case.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I agree  with out investigators opinion about the parts  of this complaint which he did not 
uphold, and for the same reasons. However,  only one address was no longer linked to a 
credit account, and that is the one which TransUnion agreed  to remove as a gesture of good 
will. TransUnion says, and I have  no reason  to doubt it, that the other addresses are still 
linked to accounts. So they cannot be removed. Therefore I do not uphold that part of this 
complaint.
As for the two addresses which  Mr H says do not relate to him (the ones recorded by Lloyds 
and by Cabot), if these  addresses have indeed been  recorded incorrectly  then this could 
either be the lenders  fault, or TransUnions.  I dont  think it is unreasonable to ask 
TransUnion to check with each lender  that each address it is reporting is indeed  the address 
the lender meant to report.  If either  lender answers that TransUnion is definitely reporting the 
Ref: DRN83611152right address, then there will be nothing  else TransUnion can do, and Mr H will have to 
pursue the matter directly with the relevant lender.  (I recommend that he starts now, without  
further delay.) But since TransUnion has not provided evidence of the data each lender sent 
it, I logically  cannot absolutely rule out the possibility that TransUnion might have 
erroneously reported  a wrong address. So I will uphold  this complaint to the limited extent 
that TransUnion should check this with the relevant lenders and ensure that the data it is 
reporting is correct.  But beyond that, I think there is nothing more that TransUnion needs to 
do.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. I order Transunion International UK 
Limited to contact Lloyds  and Cabot to verify the two disputed  addresses which  they are 
reporting, and to make any corrections which  either lender asks TransUnion to make. But 
I do not require  TransUnion to do anything else.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 September  2020.
