The adjudicator recommended that Mrs K complaint be partially upheld. The adjudicator  
thought that Sunny shouldnt have  agreed to lend loans 4 onwards.  
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicators view so the complaint has been  passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs K could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks should take into account  a number 
of different  things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and Mrs Ks 
income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I 
think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN92554252the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mrs K could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. The 
loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to do so without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mrs K complaint.
The adjudicator didnt recommend that loans 1 to 3 should be upheld. Mrs K hasnt provided 
any further information disputing this. Ive looked at the circumstances around those loans 
and I agree with the adjudicator. So Im not upholding the complaint  about loans 1 to 3.
Before Sunny lent Mrs K any of the loans it checked her income and normal  living costs 
including regular credit  commitments. The information Sunny provided suggests  that Mrs K 
had an income of £1,500 and her monthly expenses varied from £475 to £1,000  throughout 
the lending relationship.
By the time Mrs K applied  for loan 4, I think  Sunny  should have  been  looking to build a clear  
picture of her circumstances before lending. I say this because  Mrs K was now taking  a 
fourth loan when she hadnt  fully repaid any of her previous loans and loan 4 was for a 
higher amount than her previous two loans.
And had Sunny carried out proportionate checks, its likely to have found that Mrs K was 
borrowing from at least two other short term lenders. So Mrs K had around five other short 
term loans outstanding, including loans 1 to 3 with Sunny. Also,  I think proportionate checks  
would likely  have made Sunny  aware  that Mrs K was in payment arrangements for two other 
short term loans.
Taking what Sunny was likely to have found  and what  it knew  about  Mrs K at the time it lent 
loan 4, it shouldve  been concerned that she had wider financial issues and that it was likely 
she couldnt afford to repay the loans  sustainably. And it shouldnt  have lent loan 4 and any 
subsequent loans.
Ref: DRN92554253Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Mrs Ks lending  history with Sunny, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so, Mrs K should  have  realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mrs Ks case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
at this point Sunny  ought to have  realised Mrs K was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Mrs K had taken out 6 loans in less than 5 months and all the 
loans were overlapping. So Sunny ought to have realised  it was more likely than not 
that Mrs Ks indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably;
Mrs Ks sixth loan was for £250 and was taken within a day of borrowing loans 5. 
While the loan amounts for loan 7 decreased, Mrs Ks overall  level of indebtedness  
hadnt substantially  reduced. At the time of loan 7 Mrs K had loans  5 and 6 still 
outstanding, At this point Sunny ought to have  known that Mrs K was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need; 
Mrs K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Mrs Ks last 
loan was taken  in December 2017,  whilst  four other loans were taken out in the same 
month. I can see that loan 1 was taken in April 2017,  so Mrs K had effectively been 
continually borrowing from Sunny for more than eight months.  Mrs  K had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
Ive also considered that Mrs Ks loan amounts reduced when she borrowed loans 10 and 
11. That said, I can see that she hadnt  fully repaid  loan 10 when she borrowed loan 11 and 
on the same  day as she borrowed loan 11, she also borrowed  loan 12 which was double the 
amount of her previous  loans. I think Mrs K continued to be dependent on these loans and 
the repeat  lending  was unsustainable.
I think that Mrs K lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ks indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mrs K borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mrs Ks ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans six to fourteen as well as loans 4 and 5 and 
Sunny needs  to put things  right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs K paid on loans 4 to 14.
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement.
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Mrs Ks credit  file;
Ref: DRN92554254the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6 to 14 should be removed from 
Mrs Ks credit  file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs K a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Ks complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should pay Mrs K compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 December  2019.
