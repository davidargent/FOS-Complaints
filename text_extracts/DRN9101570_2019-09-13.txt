K820x#14Complaint
Miss M complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) shouldnt have charged her for 
her overdraft when it removed access to her current account. She also complains NatWest 
didnt offer support to her when she was in financial difficulty in 2012.  She thinks  it shouldnt 
have charged her for her overdraft during this time.
Background
Account access
Miss M has a current account  with NatWest with an overdraft facility. In April 2018 NatWest 
removed access to her online facility and then blocked her account in May 2018.
NatWests fraud team called Miss M, but she failed to pass telephone security. She was 
asked to go to her nearest branch with photographic ID to discuss  recent account 
usage/activity. Miss M said this wasnt possible due to her hours of work.  She wanted to 
know how much  she needed  to pay to remain within her limit, but NatWest refused as they 
needed her to go into branch first to talk about  her account. 
Miss M made numerous calls after this time.  NatWest continued to refuse to tell her how 
much she needed  to pay as it still required her to go to branch.  On one occasion it did tell 
Miss M an amount she needed to pay, which turned out to be incorrect.  And on another call 
NatWest also said a home visit could be arranged.
Miss M complained to NatWest. It admitted it told her an incorrect figure to pay and refunded 
some charges and waived  further charges due later that month. It apologised for saying a 
home visit mightve been possible  when it wasnt. But it refused to discuss  a payment 
arrangement or closing  the account  until Miss M went  into branch as requested.
Historic charges
When Miss M complained  to us, she raised  another complaint about how NatWest had 
treated her when she was in financial difficulty in 2012. NatWest responded saying it had 
helped Miss M. It says Miss M agreed to a repayment plan in regard to her overdraft after 
shed asked for help.
Investigators findings
An investigator at our service looked at Miss Ms complaint and didnt uphold it. She found:
-NatWest had put Miss M on a repayment plan regarding her overdraft after shed 
contacted it in 2012. Based on the information  available  from this time this appeared to 
be a reasonable solution which Miss M went ahead  with.
-Miss M had failed  security over the phone.  So requiring  her to go to branch with ID 
wasnt unreasonable.
-Miss M didnt meet NatWests criteria for a home visit. NatWest  had apologised for 
saying a visit mightve been  possible  and it didnt need  to do anything  more.
Ref: DRN91015702-Miss M says she is unable to visit a branch due to work  commitments, but what  shes  
said isnt persuasive.  Its likely  something could be arranged with her employer to allow 
her to attend.
Miss M disagreed. She said she passed security over the phone after May 2018, the home  
visit had been  suggested by NatWest  and she couldnt afford to pay fees. She wanted  the 
account to be closed. She also asked why she has access to her credit card if NatWest  is 
concerned about  her identity.
Since this time NatWest has provided  information  to show Miss Ms account is now in credit  
which has stopped  further overdraft charges.
The complaint has now been passed to me for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, my review of the 
evidence has led me to the same overall conclusions as the investigator  previously  set out 
and for much the same reasons.
charging Miss M when  she couldnt  access account
Ive considered carefully what Miss M has said about why NatWest  shouldnt have continued 
to charge her for her overdraft once her access was removed, particularly as she says the 
charges are causing  her financial difficulty. Ive considered too her comment about  it being 
better for her account to be closed.  
NatWest should  consider  ways they can help customers who are experiencing financial 
difficulty. But they are also obliged to verify  account holders before taking instructions from 
them in regard to their accounts. This would include actions such as closing the account  and 
arranging a way forward regarding repayment  of debt
NatWest say they need to verify  Miss M face to face in branch and need her to speak to their 
fraud team once  shes there. I understand Miss M thinks  she shouldnt have to do this. But 
she did fail security when  speaking to NatWests fraud  team on the phone  and they want to 
speak to her when shes present in branch.  I appreciate Miss M says she passes  through 
telephone security when she calls NatWest, but I dont think  this makes NatWests  request 
unreasonable. 
Its not unusual  for banks  to require additional  security measures  to be taken when one 
method of verification fails. Neither  is it unusual for this to take the form of a customer  
presenting in branch with identification. 
Miss M says she is unable to go to a branch due to her working hours. Ive taken on board 
her hours of work may not align to branch opening  times and that she says she is a part-time  
student so her free time may be further limited. But I havent seen sufficient evidence to 
show she cant make  an arrangement with her employer  to go to her nearest NatWest  
branch on one of the six days a week its open.
Ref: DRN91015703I understand Miss M was told a home visit was possible and NatWest has apologised for this 
error. But she was also told a home visit would only take place during branch hours. So even 
if a visit had been possible, I cant see what benefit  this wouldve been if Miss M was 
working. So I think NatWests apology is enough  to make up for their error.
Historic charges
Ive considered what Miss M has said about  NatWest not agreeing to waive interest and 
charges on her account like her other  creditors did when she asked for assistance in 2012. 
But I think NatWest did come to an arrangement with her.
NatWests records indicate a payment plan was put into effect after a discussion took place  
regarding Miss Ms situation.  There was a freeze  on interest  accruing  on her account  
between November 2012 and June 2013,  during which time she made a monthly payment of 
Â£5 to reduce her balance.  It appears this was to give her time to find full-time work.
NatWests records also indicate  they informed her about getting free independent  debt 
advice. So on balance I think NatWest  did offer appropriate support at that time.
My final decision
Ive decided not to uphold  Miss Ms complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 October  2019.
