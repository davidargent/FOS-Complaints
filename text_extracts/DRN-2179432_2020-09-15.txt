The complaint
Ms N is unhappy that the balance showing on her online banking for her Santander UK Plc 
mortgage didnt tally with what she thought she owed.
She said she wanted the ombudsman to request that Santander reimburse her the £10,500 
she says is missing from the closing balance on her online mortgage account statement.
She also wants £21,000 for the distress and financial detriment she has suffered, as well as 
punitive measures against Santander.
What happened
I issued my provisional decision in August 2020, the findings of which stated: 
I dont doubt that this is very important for Ms N but although Ive read and considered 
the whole file Ill keep my comments to what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on any 
specific point its not because Ive not considered it but because I dont think I need to 
comment on it in order to reach the right outcome.
Ms N indicated she might be sending some more information to us, but despite various 
chase ups for this (since May 2020) weve not received anything further. I cant keep 
complaints on hold indefinitely, and so Im issuing this provisional decision without waiting 
any longer.
I can understand why Ms N has been confused by all the transactions on her online 
mortgage account showing overpayments being credited and reversed off, and different 
outstanding balances. But having cross referenced everything Im satisfied there isnt
£10,500 missing as Ms N believes.
Ms N has supplied her own transaction list showing what she believes it should be, giving 
a balance on 11 July 2019 of £289,526.02 but having looked at that shes started with an 
incorrect opening balance on 1 April 2019, thus giving her a figure of £10,500 less than 
was actually outstanding. Ms Ns used £314,181.71 whereas the actual balance on 
1 April 2019 was £324,681.71. I can see Ms Ns online screenshot shows a balance of 
£314,181.71 on 1 April but that was incorrect.
Ive worked through Ms Ns entire transaction history from when the £375,495 mortgage 
was drawn down on 14 October 2014 and that doesnt show that Ms N has made any 
lump sum overpayments other than those detailed in the table below. Having reviewed all 
the debits and credits, as well as the running balance for the life of the mortgage, Im 
satisfied the balance on 1 April 2019 was £324,681.71, not £314,181.71.
The transactions to the mortgage from 1 April to 31 July 2019, therefore, were as follows:
Date Description Credit Debit Balance
1 April Opening balance £324,681.71
1 April Interest charged £741.36 £325,423.07
1 April Payment made £1,721.30 £323,701.77
1 May Interest charged £739.12 £324,440.89
1 May Payment made £1,721.30 £322,719.59
1 June Interest charged £736.88 £323,456.47
3 June Payment made (£1,721.30 normal 
payment, plus £10,500 overpayment)£12,221.30 £311,235.17
1 July Interest charged £712.25 £311,947.42
1 July Direct debit bounced (£12,221.30) £311,947.42
11 July Payment made (£1,721.30 normal 
payment, plus £10,500 overpayment)£12,221.30 £299,726.12
Its not possible for us to carry out a detailed or forensic audit of an account history. Its 
open to Ms N to ask a suitably qualified independent accountant to do that for her. That 
would have to be at her expense, though if an error were found to her financial detriment 
she could include the costs of finding it in any complaint that followed. That said, Ive 
looked at the transaction history and having done so I cant see any mistakes.
Santander has said the online mortgage balance isnt live and there is a known issue 
with it, so it shouldnt be relied upon for a true outstanding balance amount. Were not the 
regulator so its not my role to tell Santander to change the way its mortgages are viewed 
online. Ms N could have obtained a true figure by requesting a redemption statement at 
any point, but I do understand her confusion with the online figures.
Santander has admitted it could have done better here to explain things to Ms N and I 
agree with that. But I also agree that £250 is a little on the high side for compensation for 
that. Having considered everything that happened  as well as what we might award for 
other similar cases  Im satisfied that £150 is a fair and reasonable compensation figure 
for any trouble and upset caused to Ms N.
I invited both parties to let me have any further submissions before I reached a final
decision. Santander didnt respond to my provisional decision. Ms N responded after the 
deadline saying (I quote verbatim):
I must say I am even more perplexed and surprised by this provisional decision.  The 
reduced compensation is at best an insulting token gesture for what was a highly stressful 
and distressing experience which left me at my wits end and in the belief that balance on 
my online mortgage account statement got inflated. So the Ombudsman acknowledges 
that the "online screen shot shows a balance of 314,181.17 on 1 April" yet concludes 
"that was incorrect"!
Is the Ombudsman therefore saying that it is acceptable for banks to fudge and then 
manipulate customer's statement balances such that we cannot and should not rely on 
this balance as being accurate?
I believe I provided a full and detailed narrative of the sequence of events that led to my 
compliant and there was no additional factual information I could have provided.I await the Ombusdman's final decision which if not fabourable fair or reasonable will 
leave me with no other option but to seek alternative recourse.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
To answer some points from Ms Ns recent email:
I havent said it is acceptable for banks to fudge and then manipulate customer's 
statement balances so Im concerned Ms N has taken that away from my provisional 
decision. My provisional decision explained that Santander has said there is a known 
issue with the online balance, but as were not the regulator thats not something I 
can tell Santander to change. 
The reason I mentioned not receiving anything further from Ms N is because the last 
two emails we received from her (in May and June 2020) said that she needed more 
time to revisit the complaint and present us with the additional points she wanted 
considered. As we didnt hear anything further our investigator sent various chase 
emails to Ms N to which we received no reply. We didnt need anything further from 
Ms N, we just wanted to ensure shed had all the time she needed to make any final 
submissions.
Im impartial and I have to look at things objectively, sometimes taking a step back and 
focussing on the broader picture. 
Whilst Ms N was put to some trouble and upset Im satisfied there havent been the errors 
with her mortgage that she believed there had been. I understand this has taken time to 
resolve, but unfortunately thats the very nature of dispute resolution, it does take up 
personal time and can be concerning. Having considered everything Im satisfied my 
provisional award of £150 compensation is fair in the circumstances.
Having reviewed everything carefully and considered the case afresh, my opinion hasnt
changed. Ive reached the same findings - and for the same reasons - as I set out in my
provisional decision.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part, and order Santander UK Plc to pay £150 compensation to 
Ms N. I make no other order or award. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, 
Im required to ask Ms N to accept or reject my decision before 14 October 2020.
