*this shows the approximate combined total repayment amount where loans overlap Mr W mainly said that he had to take out loans so that he could pay other outstanding 
payday loans as he wasnt spending his money responsibly and his wages alone werent 
enough to pay the loans. 
Our adjudicator upheld the complaint in part. She thought that whilst she hadnt seen enough 
to say that loans 1  5 had been unfair, Sunny shouldnt have given Mr W loan 6 or any 
further loans after that. She set out what she thought Sunny should do to put things right for 
Mr W. 
Sunny initially disagreed with our adjudicator and said it didnt think the complaint should be 
upheld. Sunny said that paying loans early wasnt consistent with Mr W being in financial 
difficulty and it meant hed saved interest by doing this. 
But after further consideration, Sunny looked again at Mr Ws lending pattern, particularly the 
number of loans being taken out within close proximity to one another. Sunny agreed it 
would be fair and reasonable to uphold the complaint from loan 9 and Sunny made an offer 
to settle the complaint.
We passed on details of this offer to Mr W but it hasnt led to the complaint being settled. So 
it comes to me to make a final decision.
What I've decided - and why 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. And Ive kept this in mind when thinking about this 
complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.Sunny was required to establish whether Mr W could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication that a borrower could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
Sunny has told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr W. It asked him for details of 
his income and normal expenditure. And Sunny carried out checks on Mr Ws credit file.
Our adjudicator didnt think she had enough evidence to say that loans 1 - 5 shouldnt have 
been provided. Ive looked at the information gathered, including what Mr W said about his 
income and expenses when he took out these loans. I agree with our adjudicator that there 
isnt enough to say Sunny shouldnt have provided these loans to Mr W. It was still early in 
the lending relationship and so I think the checks were enough for Sunny to agree to lend 
these loans. 
For these reasons, I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint about loans 1 - 5.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr W to see if there 
was a point at which Sunny reasonably shouldve seen that further lending was 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful and so it shouldnt have provided further loans. 
I think by loan 6 Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. I say this because:
Mr W wasnt managing to repay his loans sustainably. Mr W had been paying Sunny 
loans during the course of each of the last 4 months in a row and he was now taking 
out his sixth loan  due to keep him indebted to Sunny for a further 6 months 
 
hed taken out loans 1, 2 and 3 within the space of a week  all before hed had to 
start making any repayments to Sunny
 
he took out loan 4 less than two weeks after paying loans 1 and 3. He took out loan 5 
shortly after paying loan 2, whilst loan 4 was still running. And he asked for loan 6 the 
same day he repaid loan 4  when he was still making repayments on loan 5
 
Sunny didnt necessarily do anything wrong when it loaned again to Mr W before hed 
paid all his earlier loans. But Sunny shouldve seen that he wasnt making any real 
inroads into his debt and this was now the third time in a row that Mr W had borrowed 
again soon after early repayment of previous loans
 and by now, Sunny ought to have known that Mr W probably wasnt borrowing to 
meet a temporary shortfall in income but to meet an ongoing need. And that he was 
having problems managing his money and wasnt using the loans for their intended 
purpose 
 
I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards when:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time  
 
the number of loans was likely to have a negative impact on Mr Ws ability to access 
mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 - 10 and Sunny should put things right.
In coming to my decision, Ive taken into account everything Sunny has said, including 
comments made in response to what our adjudicator said. But this doesnt change my 
overall view. Paying loans early doesn't mean that Mr W was able to do so in a way that was 
sustainable for him. For the reasons I've explained, this pattern of borrowing and repaying 
this number of loans early suggests to me that Mr Ws finances were not in a stable position 
and he was struggling to manage his debt. The fact he saved on interest isnt a reason for 
me not to uphold Mr Ws complaint from loan 6 onwards.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
 
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr W towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 6 - 10, not including anything already refunded.
 
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr W which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr W originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
 
C. Pay Mr W the amounts calculated in "A" and "B".
 
D. The overall pattern of Mr Ws borrowing for loans 6 - 10 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans entirely from 
Mr Ws credit file. 
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decisionFor the reasons given above, I uphold Mr Ws complaint about loans 6 - 10. Elevate Credit 
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should take the steps Ive set out above to put 
things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 May 2020.
