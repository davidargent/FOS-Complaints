K820x#14complaint
Mr B through his representative  says Cash on Go Limited (trading as Peachy) irresponsibly 
lent to him.
background
This complaint is about five short term loans Peachy provided  to Mr B between June 2012 
and May 2014.  Mr Bs borrowing  history is as follows:

5 17/05/2014 500 229.64
Our adjudicator didnt  think Mr Bs complaint should  be upheld as he didnt think Peachy 
incorrectly lent any of the loans. Mr B disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Peachy needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Peachy should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN48245532Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
Peachy wasnt required  to carry out a credit check before lending to Mr B and from the 
information Ive seen, I dont think Peachy carried out a credit search. Mr B has provided a 
copy of his credit file and I can see that he was borrowing from other  short term lenders. But 
Peachy wouldnt  have seen the information on Mr Bs credit  file.
Peachys checks included Mr Bs monthly  income which varied  from £1,600 to £1,800, and 
also Mr Bs monthly expenses before lending loans 1 to 3. Mr Bs expenses at the time of 
these loans were £600.  Mr B also confirmed that he was employed and renting.
Given the repayment amount for loan 1, I think Peachys checks went  far enough. I can see 
that Mr B deferred the repayment of this loan three times. Mr Bs repeated deferral for the 
repayment of an amount  that was small compared  to his income might have suggested that 
Mr B may have had wider financial problems. But Im also mindful that after repaying this 
loan, Mr B didnt borrow loan 2 until more than four months later. I think  given the 
circumstances and this length of time it wasnt unreasonable for Peachy to rely on the 
information Mr B provided when  it decided to lend him loan 2. So I also think Peachy did 
enough before lending  loan 2. Even though  the loan amount and repayments  were more 
than loan 1, Mr B still appeared to have  sufficient disposable income to repay the loan.
There was a break in lending  of around  10 months  before Peachy lent Mr B loan 3. I think  
this was a significant amount of time and it split the lending chain into two - so that loan 3 
was the first loan in this new chain. The repayment amount for loan 3 was less than £100 
and in the circumstances, I think Peachys checks went far enough.
On the day Mr B repaid loan 3, he requested loan 4 for £500,  this was higher than any of his 
previous loans but it was an instalment loan with the highest repayment of £211.21   less 
than the repayment for loan 2. From  what I can see Peachy only checked  Mr Bs income but 
I think given the circumstances of this loan it shouldve checked Mr Bs expenditure as well. 
Had Peachy carried  out proportionate checks by asking Mr B about his monthly expenses 
before lending this loan,  its likely to have  found  that Mr B could afford this loan. 
I think its likely Mr B wouldve declared  a similar amount for his expenses as he did for loan 
3 - two weeks earlier.
Loan 5 was surrounded by similar circumstances to loan 4 and Peachy is likely  to have 
found that Mr B could  afford this loan had he asked him about his expenses as well.
I accept that Mr Bs actual  circumstances  suggest  that he couldnt afford the loans as he was 
indebted to other lenders but this wasnt something he told Peachy and Peachy wouldnt 
have known about this from what I consider proportionate checks.
So overall, I dont  think Peachy  lent any of the loans  wrongly.
Ref: DRN48245533my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I do not uphold Mr Bs complaint or make any award  against  
Cash On Go Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 November 2019.
