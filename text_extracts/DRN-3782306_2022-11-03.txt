The complaint
Ms W, through a representative complains that Morses Club PLC (Morses) didnt carry out
proportionate affordability checks before it granted her loans. Ms W says these loans werent
affordable for her.
What happened
Morses provided details granted to Ms W in February and September 2020. Ive included
some of the information weve received about these loans in the table below.

Following Ms Ws complaint Morses wrote to her representative to explain that it wasnt
going to uphold it. Ms Ws representative didnt accept the outcome and referred
the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
An adjudicator then reviewed Ms Ws complaint and she didnt uphold it because she
thought Morses had made a reasonable decision to provide these loans.
Ms Bs representative didnt agree with the outcome, but no reasoning was provided as to
why.
The case was then passed to an ombudsman. However, after the complaint was referred to
me, further enquiries were made with Morses, at which point further loans were identified as
being lent to Ms W. I have put together a new loan table below which includes, as far as I am
aware Ms Ws total lending history. The two 2020 loans appear in this new loan table as
loans 13 and 14.

Ms W had some problems repaying loans 11 and 12 (in addition to loan 14) which were sold
to a third party in June 2018. Loan 14 was sold to a third-party in June 2021. No further
update has been provided about what the outstanding balances may be for loans 11, 12 and
14.
The weekly repayment column is the cost per week, per loan. So, when loans overlapped
the cost will be greater. For example, when loans 8 and 9 were running at the same time
Ms W was contracted to pay £17.50 per week.
There is a gap in lending of almost two years between loans 11 and 12 being sold to a third
party and when Ms W returned for further borrowing. Ive, therefore in this provisional
decision considered that there were two chains of lending. Loans 1  12 and then loans 13
and 14.
Morses loan table which it provided the Financial Ombudsman suggests that there could be
at least one further loan which was granted some time before May 2011. However, as
neither party has been able to provide any further information about it, then Im only going to
be considering the loans outlined in the table above.
I then issued a provisional decision explaining the reasons why I was intending to uphold 
Ms Ws complaint in part. A copy of the provisional findings follows this in italics and a 
smaller font and it forms part of this final decision.
What I said in my provisional decision
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about this type of lending - including all
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Morses had to assess the lending to check if Ms W could afford to pay back the amounts
shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was
proportionate to the circumstances. Morses checks couldve taken into account a number of
different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and
Ms Ws income and expenditure.
With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have 
been proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Morses should have done more to establish that 
any lending was sustainable for Ms W. These factors include:
Ms W having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Ms W having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period 
of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing 
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms W coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms W.Morses was required to establish whether Ms W could sustainably repay the loans  not just
whether she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money
to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Ms W was able to repay her
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue
difficulties and in particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and
without having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further,
then it follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and
thought about what this means for Ms Ws complaint.
Loans 1  3
For these loans it is likely that Morses made enquires with Ms W to find out what her weekly
income and expenditure were. However, due to the passage of time, the information Morses
likely obtained is no longer available. This means I dont know what it knew about Ms Ws
income or expenditure details.
In addition, Ms W hasnt provided any details about her financial position at the time these
loans were approved.
Given, the lack of information I cant fairly come to the conclusion that Morses did something
wrong when it advanced these loans, so I cant fairly uphold Ms Ws complaint about these
loans.
Loan 4
Again, as for loans 1  3 Morses likely did collect some information about Ms Ws income
and expenditure but it cant provide the figures it obtained. I also have nothing from Ms W
about her position at the time. So, on the face of it, it would seem this loan may be one that
shouldnt be upheld.
However, that doesnt mean Im not in a position to uphold the complaint about this loan.
This is because Ms W had shown that she had problems repaying previous loans and
therefore, would likely have problems repaying her loans going forward.
For example, it took Ms W 10 additional weeks to repay loan 3, and then she returned for
lending on the same day that loan had been repaid, to borrow a larger sum to be repaid over
the same period. I dont quite understand how Morses couldve reasonably believed that
Ms W would be able to repay this loan in a sustainable manner when she had recently
demonstrated that she couldnt repay the previous loan, which was smaller in the same time
scales.
Therefore, Im intending to uphold Ms Ws complaint about this loan.
Loan 5  12
So, in addition to looking at the checks that Morses did Ive also looked at the overall pattern
of Morses lending history with Ms W, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which
Morses should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise
harmful. And so Morses should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further
loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Ms Ws case, I think that this point was reached by
loan 5. I say this because:At this point Morses ought to have realised Ms W was not managing to repay her
loans sustainably. Ms W had taken out five loans in this chain of lending in 25
months. So Morses ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms W was
having to borrow further to cover a long-term short fall in her living costs.
From the first loan in this chain onwards, Ms W was generally provided with a new
loan on the same day a previous loan was repaid and at times had a number of loans
running at the same time. To me, this is a sign that Ms W was using these loans to fill
a long-term gap in her income rather than as a short-term need.
Ms W, at times continued to have problems repaying her loans, for example it took
Ms W 60 weeks to repay loan six, which was meant to repaid in 33 weeks. This
would suggest to me that Ms W was having problems managing her money and
shouldnt have been advanced further loans.
Ms W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Morses. Loan 12 was
taken out over six years after Ms Ws first loan. Her final loan was for the same sum
as her first loan. So, Ms W had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a
debt to Morses over an extended period.
I think that Ms W lost out when Morses provided loans 5 - 12 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ws indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Ms W borrowed was likely to
have had negative implications on Ms Ws ability to access mainstream credit and so
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im intending to uphold Ms Ws complaint about loans 4  12 in the first chain of lending.
Loans 13 and 14
There was a significant gap in lending of around 20 months after Ms Ws last two loans had
been sold to a third-party collection agency and it was also nearly three years since her last
loan was advanced.
This break, in my view is sufficiently large for Morses to have in effect treated Ms W as a
new customer and the start of the new lending relationship. This means, loan 13 could be
treated as if it was loan 1 in a new chain of borrowing and this has implications for what
Morses needed to do in order to carry out a proportionate check.
For these loans, Ms W had declared a weekly income of £256 and £254. With declared
outgoings of £174 and £190.20 per week. Which gave Ms W a weekly disposable income of
£82 for loan 13 and £73.82 for loan 14.
Morses couldve reasonably believed Ms W had sufficient disposable income to afford the
weekly loan repayment for both loans of £10.
In addition, before loan 13, Morses also carried out a credit search and it has provided a
copy of the results to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
It is worth saying here that although Morses carried out a credit search there isnt a
regulatory requirement to do one, let alone one to a specific standard. But what Morses cant
do is carry out a credit search and then not react to the information it received  if necessary.
Having reviewed the results Morses was given, I do have some significant concerns about
her credit file. A summary of what Ive seen can be found below;
Two unsatisfied County Court Judgements (CCJ) and the most recent CCJ having been 
recorded three years before loan 13.
Just under £7,000 of active debt spread across 31 active credit accounts.
Ms W had opened five new credit accounts within the last 6 months  so close to one new 
credit facility per month.
Ms W already owed another home credit loan provider nearly £1,200.22 accounts in default, owing nearly £5,000 with the most recent default having been
recorded 10 months before loan 13. Of these 22 accounts, six were connected with
home credit loans.
A number of accounts in delinquency  so missed payments but not yet at the level
of a default, with the most recent account entering delinquency in the month before
this loan was approved.
Given what the credit results show, I dont think, in this case that it matters whether the loan
appeared pounds and pence affordable. I say this because the credit file information
provided to Morses showed that Ms W likely having current financial difficulties she had a
number of accounts in default, and CCJs which hadnt yet been satisfied. She was also
having difficulties as a recent credit account had just moved into delinquency and she
seemed to be opening at least one new credit account per month within the last six months 
and its reasonable to conclude these were likely high cost credit loans.
Overall, Im satisfied the information within the credit checks ought to have alerted Morses to
the fact that Ms W was likely having current and immediate financial difficulties and so it
didnt make a fair decision to provide loans 13 and 14.
Overall, Im intending to uphold Ms Ws complaint about loans 4  14.
Responses to the provisional decision
Both Morses and Ms W were asked to provide anything further for consideration as soon as 
possible, but no later than 1 November 2022. 
Ms Ws representative emailed to confirmed she had accepted the proposed outcome as 
outlined in the provisional decision. 
Morses also emailed to confirm it had accepted the findings. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both Ms W and Morses have accepted the findings I was intending to reach in this case, I 
see no reason to depart from those provisional findings. I still think, for the reasons outlined 
in the provisional decision that Morses was wrong to have advanced Ms W loans 4  14. 
Ive outlined below what Morses needs to do in order to put things right for Ms W. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Morses should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it not lent loans 4  14 to Ms W, as Im satisfied it ought to have. Clearly
there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms W may have simply left matters there,
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere. If this wasnt a viable option, she may
have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how she would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dontthink I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Ms W in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Ms W would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Morsess liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
Morses shouldnt have provided loans 4  14.
If Morses has sold the outstanding debt Morses should buy it back if Morses is able to do so
and then take the following steps. If Morses is not able to buy the debts back then Morses
should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A. Morses should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms W towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything Morses have already refunded.
B. Morses should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Ms W which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms W originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Morses should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Ms W as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Ms W 
having made overpayments then Morses should refund these overpayments with 8% 
simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments 
would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Morses should then refund 
the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D. If there is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on any outstanding loans. If this 
results in a surplus, then the surplus should be paid to Ms W. However, if there is still 
an outstanding balance then Morses should try to agree an affordable repayment 
plan with Ms W.
E. Morses should remove any adverse information recorded on Ms Ws credit file in 
relation to loan 4 and loans 13 and 14. The overall pattern of Ms Ws borrowing for 
loans 5  12 means any information recorded about them is adverse, so Morses 
should remove these loans entirely from Ms Ws credit file. Morses do not have to 
remove loans 11 and 12 from Ms Ws credit file until these have been repaid, but 
Morses should still remove any adverse information recorded about those loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to deduct tax from this interest. Morses should
give Ms W a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in the provisional decision, Im upholding Ms Ws 
complaint in part.
Morses Club PLC should put things right for Ms W as directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2022.
