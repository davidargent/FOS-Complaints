K821x#15complaint
Miss K complains  that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) gave her 
loans irresponsibly.
background
This complaint is about 15 instalment loans Sunny provided to Miss K between June 2016 
and March 2017. The loans had to be repaid  over 14 months  and several loans overlapped,  
for example loans  1 to 5 ran concurrently, as did loans  6 to 8 and loans 9 to 11 etc. I 
understand loans  9, 11, 14 and 15 were  not repaid in full Heres a table showing these loans.

Our adjudicator felt that the complaint should be upheld in part. He said:
 Sunny had already upheld Miss Ks complaint about loans1and 2 and offered to put things 
right by making a payment to her in line with what this service wouldve recommended. So 
our adjudicator said he didnt need to consider this loan as part of his assessment  
 he thought that Sunny hadnt done  anything wrong  in providing loans 3 through  to 5 
 but he did think  that Sunny had been wrong to give loans 6 to 15 to Miss K as, by that 
stage, the overall  pattern of her borrowing history suggested that shed become persistently 
reliant on short term loans. As a consequence  he felt that Sunny shouldve  recognised  that 
further lending  to Miss K was unsustainable 
 to put things right our adjudicator recommended  that Sunny  should refund all interest and 
charges Miss K had paid on the loans it had already offered to uphold  (loans 1 and 2) as well 
as doing this for loans 6-15,  plus pay interest  on the refunds, and amend Miss Ks credit file 
to remove any negative  information about  loans  1 and 2 and all information recorded on her 
complaint form about loans 6-15.
Ref: DRN10306802Sunny hasnt responded to our adjudicators settlement proposals  so the complaint comes to 
me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Before the complaint came to us, Sunny offered to provide a refund of interest paid by 
Miss K on loans 1 and 2, plus interest on the refund. It says the loans were repaid on time 
and this information was reported to credit reference agencies   so theres no adverse  data 
that needs to be removed  from her credit file. It doesnt appear that Miss K paid any charges 
on these loans for which a refund would also be required. So, Ill include these loans later in 
my decision  when I say what Sunny is required to do to put things right,  but I dont need to 
say any more about them. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss K could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss K could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN10306803Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ks complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss K, with a view to seeing  
if there was a point  at which  Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ks case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because at this point Sunny ought  to have realised:
Miss K was not managing to repay  her loans sustainably. Miss K had taken out 
6 loans in under  3 months. 
Some of those loans  were overlapping and/or taken out within  a day or so of the last 
one, or on the same  day the last loan was repaid. 
Sunny  ought  to have realised it was more  likely  than not Miss K was borrowing 
further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Miss Ks indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably. 
Loans 1 and 5 seem to have been  repaid  on the same day she took out loan 6. 
I dont know which came  first  repaying  these or taking out loan 6  but either  way it 
seems clear  that Miss K had an ongoing  need for a relatively large amount of money.
I think that Miss K lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ks indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss K borrowed were  likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ks ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
I think Sunny shouldve been  concerned that Miss Ks borrowing continued  to be 
unsustainable. And this is borne  out by what followed  for example, loan 6 was for 
£900 and loan 9 was for £800  these were substantial amounts and not much less 
than her initial borrowing from Sunny. Also she continued to take some overlapping 
loans by applying  for new borrowing before the previous borrowing had been  fully 
paid. This suggests to me that Miss Ks financial circumstances hadnt improved 
since she first started asking Sunny for loans.
Ref: DRN10306804So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6-15 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
If it hasnt  already done so, refund all interest  and charges Miss K paid on loans 1 
and 2 and pay interest  of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges 
from the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement
refund  all interest and charges Miss K paid on loans 6-15 and pay interest of 8% 
simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges  from the date they were paid (if 
they were) to the date of settlement
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  Sunny made about loans 6-15 should be 
removed from Miss Ks credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss K a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Miss K had an outstanding balance on loans 9,11,14 and 15 and it looks  like this debt 
may have been sold to a third party debt collection company  when Miss K was 
unable to make the repayments. It seems less than 20% of this was interest charges.
I havent seen  anything to make  me think Miss K shouldnt repay the principals she 
borrowed from the lender. So it seems  reasonable that if Miss K still owes  some of 
the capital she borrowed that could be repaid using part of the refund she is due. But 
to do so Sunny must first take this debt back into its own books if it has sold it on and 
reduce it to reflect just the capital that Miss K borrowed. 
In this event I would remind Sunny of its duty to treat Miss K sympathetically and 
fairly. This may mean agreeing a repayment  plan with her for the outstanding capital 
balances.
If Sunny is unable, or unwilling,  to buy the debt back it must ensure that its interest  
and charges that formed part of the sold on debt are removed from the outstanding 
balance. It can either  make a payment to the third party  or directly to Miss K in order  
to do this. This is to ensure Miss K doesnt repay  more than the capital she borrowed 
on these loans.
In addition, Sunny needs to work with the third party to remove any other interest  and 
charges added by the debt collection company, so that Miss K doesnt owe any 
further interest and charges on these loans.  Again, this may mean making a payment 
to the third party or directly to Miss K. 
If Miss K has made payments to the third party and has ended up paying more than 
the amount she originally borrowed  Sunny  will also need to refund any extra  (over  
and above the amount originally borrowed)  Miss K paid plus 8% simple  interest  from 
the date the extra amount was paid to the date of settlement.
Ref: DRN10306805my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ks complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Miss K as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 October  2019.
