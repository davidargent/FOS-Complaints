K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that a £17.89 refund  hasnt  been  credited to his account  with PayPal Europe 
Sarl & Cie, SCA.
background
In October  2018 Mr C bought an item online with his debit card using PayPal. 
Mr C said he didnt recognise the transaction, so the money was returned to him. However, 
he received the item after this, and the money was debited  again. Mr C returned  the item to 
the seller after this so that he could get his money  back. In January 2019,  Mr C received an 
email from the seller saying it had issued the refund so he should check with PayPal.
During December  2018,  Mr C phoned  PayPal  twice to ask about  the missing  refund.
On both occasions he was told that he would get the money  in seven to ten working  days. 
But this didnt happen. 
Mr C says he then raised  a complaint with PayPal in early  February  2019  using an online 
service. He has provided us with evidence to show this. But PayPal told us that they didnt 
recognise it as a complaint from Mr C. It says the evidence Mr C has provided  is a complaint 
from an unverified third party. In the circumstances, PayPals position  is that Mr C hasnt 
complained to it. So it didnt think it was right for us to look into the complaint. As Mr C hadnt 
complained to it directly,  in line with its procedures, it told him it wasnt willing to take the 
matter further. 
Our investigator appreciated PayPals position.  But she was satisfied that Mr C raised a 
complaint against  PayPal  in February  2019.  She said PayPal had had eight weeks to 
respond to this complaint. As that eight weeks has passed, our service  was able look into 
this matter. 
Our investigator didnt  think it was unreasonable for Mr C to expect PayPal to refund the 
payment after they said they would on two separate occasions. Nor did she think  it was fair 
for PayPal  to say that it wasnt going  to take the matter  further after it had done this. She 
accepted that the money shouldve been  credited to Mr Cs debit  card (as opposed to his 
PayPal account). But PayPal wouldve been  involved in that refund.
In June 2019 PayPal confirmed that it had given Mr C incorrect information on the phone  in 
December 2018.  So it would refund the £17.89 payment and offer Mr C an additional  £75 as 
a gesture of goodwill  to reflect the service it provided. But it said that Mr C would have to 
make an official  complaint to PayPal  about this as it still didnt recognise the February  2019  
communication as a complaint.
Our investigator thought it would be unnecessary and unfair to make Mr C do this given that 
hed complained more than six months  ago - in February 2019.  However, she thought  the 
amount of compensation PayPal has suggested  was fair and reasonable given the nature of 
the complaint  and the inconvenience PayPal  has caused. To resolve  the complaint our 
investigator said PayPal  should refund the £17.89  payment  and pay Mr C the £75 goodwill 
payment it has said it was willing to pay.
Mr C has indicated that he would  accept this settlement, but PayPal disagreed  with our 
investigator and asked for an ombudsman to consider this complaint.
Ref: DRN38901532my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I also think that PayPal 
should refund the £17.89  payment and pay Mr C £75 for the inconvenience it has caused  
him. Ill explain why.
The facts  of this case arent in dispute.  Mr C didnt receive the £17.89 refund the online 
seller said it had processed in January 2019.  This shouldve been  credited to his debit card 
account, via PayPal. 
Nor is it in dispute that PayPal gave Mr C incorrect information when he spoke to it in 
December 2018.  On both occasions  it told Mr C that he would get the money in seven to ten 
working days. In June  2019 PayPal told us that it shouldve said that his bank  would refund 
him if he went to his bank  and made  a chargeback claim.
PayPal has said it would  be willing to refund  the £17.89 payment, and offer Mr C an 
additional £75 if he were to make  a complaint directly, in line with its complaints procedure.  
The reasons  for this are set out above.
Im not PayPals regulator,  so it isnt for me to tell it how it should operate. In particular, it 
isnt for me to tell PayPal  what means  of communication it should  - or should not use - in 
dealings with its customers. I appreciate that PayPal  has its procedures,  and understand 
what it has told us about the reasons for that. However, in the particular circumstances  of 
this case, I dont think its fair and reasonable for PayPal  to require Mr C to make a new 
complaint to it to get the money it has offered. I say this because  PayPal knows Mr C is 
unhappy, has accepted it has made mistakes, and is willing  to pay Mr C an amount he has 
indicated hes happy with to resolve  his complaint. Making Mr C complain again  would  
inconvenience him further, and mean  that he had to wait even longer to resolve this matter. 
It follows that I think that PayPal should  pay Mr C £92.89  in total (£17.89 + £75).
my final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA should pay Mr C £92.89 to resolve 
this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 October  2019.
