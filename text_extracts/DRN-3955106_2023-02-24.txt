The complaint
Mr P is unhappy that National Westminster Bank (NatWest) refused his request for a cash 
withdrawal.
What happened
Earlier this year, Mr P visited a branch to make a cash withdrawal of Â£15,000 which hed 
arranged to do in advance. However, NatWest refused his request as he didnt answer their 
questions regarding the purpose of the cash withdrawal.
NatWest explained they are required to complete due diligence on transactions to protect 
customers from fraud and scams. They also needed to be satisfied that the purpose of the 
transaction was legitimate. They said theyd acted in line with the terms and conditions of the 
account in declining Mr Ps request. 
Mr P remained unhappy as he felt NatWest were obstructing the withdrawal of money from 
his account and they were defaulting to a guilty until proven innocent position. He believes 
he has a right to keep the information about the purpose of the cash withdrawal to himself. 
He thinks NatWest insisting on him disclosing this information is a step too far.
Our investigator said he was satisfied NatWest didnt do anything wrong. He said NatWest 
were following their procedures in asking Mr P questions about the withdrawal to protect the 
account. Mr P disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to review his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest are required to take reasonable steps to protect their customers from fraud and 
scams. They might be held liable for any foreseeable losses, if they breach their duty of 
care. 
The nature of security procedures means customers, like Mr P, may be caused distress and 
inconvenience. But this doesnt mean NatWest are at fault or that they shouldnt complete 
any additional checks.
The terms and conditions of Mr Ps account explains that NatWest may delay or refuse to act 
on his instructions in some circumstances. Such as, if NatWest reasonably suspects Mr Ps 
instruction is connected to a scam, fraud or any other crime, or they reasonably consider that 
his instruction is of a type where there is a high risk of there being such a connection.
I think there is a higher risk of a large cash withdrawal being connected to a scam, fraud or 
other crime. Given that Mr P was withdrawing a large sum of money in cash, I dont think 
NatWest have acted unreasonably in asking questions about the purpose of the cash 
withdrawal as per their process. By doing so, NatWest may have been alerted to a potential 
financial crime. 
I appreciate Mr P says he confirmed he wasnt under any duress or threat, and nor was he 
being forced or blackmailed to make this withdrawal. Mr P was also prepared to sign a 
disclaimer to absolve NatWest of any responsibility.
Im glad to hear Mr P wasnt a victim of a scam or other crime, but its not unusual for 
someone in this type of situation to be coached or coerced to say something similar to their 
bank. And ultimately, NatWest arent obliged to deviate from their process and agree to Mr 
Ps suggestion of signing a disclaimer.
I understand Mr P feels that NatWests suspicion about his withdrawal wasnt genuine as 
they didnt report the matter to the police or block his account. As I explained above, Im 
satisfied NatWest had a legitimate reason to be concerned about the risks involved with Mr 
Ps request. I think NatWest sufficiently mitigated the risk of Mr Ps instructions being 
connected to fraudulent activity, scams or other crime by declining his request to make the 
withdrawal. 
Mr P has also explained he was able to withdraw the amount he required by using his 
maximum daily limit at an Automated Teller Machine across several days. He wants to 
understand what difference it makes to NatWest when he gained access to his cash.
A large cash withdrawal has a much higher risk compared to smaller cash withdrawals made 
across several days. I say this because numerous smaller cash withdrawals over a longer 
period of time minimises the likelihood of Mr P being a victim of fraudulent activity, scams or 
other crime. 
In any event, NatWest are entitled to make commercial decisions about how they carry out 
their day-to-day business, including their risk appetite and security procedures around large 
cash withdrawals from a branch. Im satisfied NatWest were following their procedures and 
acted in line with the terms and conditions when refusing to act on Mr Ps instructions.
All things considered, I cant agree NatWest have treated Mr P unfairly or have acted 
unreasonably in following a procedure thats in place to protect their customers and 
themselves.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 March 2023.
