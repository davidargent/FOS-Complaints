Miss E says CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to her irresponsibly.
background
I sent Miss E and QuickQuid my provisional decision on 21 March 2019. A copy  is attached and 
it forms part of this final decision. The full background to the complaint is set out in my provisional  
decision, so I wont reiterate it here. I explained why I was planning to uphold the complaint and 
what I thought  QuickQuid  should do to put things  right. I asked Miss E and QuickQuid to let me 
know if they had anything to add.
QuickQuid didnt send me anything else to consider. Miss E said she was happy with my 
provisional decision.
my findings
Ive again  considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good industry 
practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
As Miss E accepted  my provisional decision and as QuickQuid didnt respond, I see no reason  to 
depart from my provisional findings. So Im upholding the complaint, for the same  reasons  as set 
out in my provisional decision.

QuickQuid must:

my final decision

complaint
Miss E says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss E had six loans with QuickQuid, several of which  were topped-up.  This means she borrowed extra 
funds during  the course of the loan agreement. Ive set out some of the information  QuickQuid provided 
about the loans in the table below.

An adjudicator  considered this complaint and recommended  it be upheld in part. He thought  QuickQuid 
was wrong to approve loans 4b, 6a and 6b. QuickQuid didnt  agree,  so the complaint was passed to me to 
decide.
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive taken into account  the law, good industry practice  and any relevant 
regulations at the time.
I hope neither party takes it as a discourtesy, but I do not intend to go into a great deal of detail about the 
affordability of each individual  lending  decision in this complaint for reasons which will become clear below.
This services  approach to complaints about short-term  lending is set out on our website. But in simple 
terms, we generally think proportionate checks in the early stages of a lending relationship would be less 
thorough than towards  the end  and less thorough when  the amounts lent are small compared  to the 
applicants income. But this can vary,  depending  on individual circumstances  and other  relevant factors 
can include  repayment difficulties  the lender is aware of.
For the first three  loans Miss E took out, I dont think it was unreasonable for QuickQuid to rely on what 
Miss E told it about  her income and outgoings and I dont think it was irresponsible to lend to her. Miss E 
did pay a number of default  interest  charges on loan 2, but there was then a large gap between loan 2 and 
loan, 3 so I dont think the number of default charges was as significant a factor in the early stages of the 
lending relationship.
For loans 4 and 5, I think its less clear whether the lending was responsible  or not, given how Miss E 
managed her accounts. But I dont intend to make  a decision  on whether loans 4 and 5 were lent 
responsibly as I think the redress Im planning to award in respect of loan 6 is fair overall  for Miss Es whole  
complaint.
Ref: DRN35122183why I plan to uphold the complaint about loan 6
Throughout her lending history with QuickQuid, Miss E had demonstrated  signs of difficulty  in repaying her 
loans. With the exception of loan 5 (the smallest loan) all of her loans were repaid late and Miss E paid a 
large number of late fees and default interest charges. For loan 3, for example, Miss E paid a late fee and 
36 lots of default interest charges. And on loan 4 Miss E paid another 36 lots of default  interest   a total of 
around £170.  As can be seen  from the table  above, loan 4 was repaid four months  late.
Miss E went on to make  a complaint about  irresponsible lending on 26 June 2018  after repaying loan 5 
but before loan 6 was approved. QuickQuid rejected her complaint  on 
23 July 2018  it approved two advances  before this date and one afterwards. I havent seen Miss Es 
original letter of complaint  to QuickQuid, but from what Miss E has told us, she considers  she was stuck in 
a cycle  of borrowing and was dependent  on the loans.
Im not suggesting QuickQuid needed to automatically take these statements  at face value. 
But looking back at how Miss E had manged  her accounts, what she says seems plausible. 
So I think QuickQuid ought  to have realised it wasnt likely to be responsible  to lend again so soon after 
receiving Miss Es complaint.
So I dont think  QuickQuid acted responsibly  when it approved  loan 6 and the top-ups. But, from what Ive 
seen, Miss E hasnt repaid much of the £600 she borrowed  only about  £41 as of September 2018. This 
means I need  to think carefully about  what fair redress would be in Miss Es case.
This services  approach to redress  for irresponsible lending would usually  involve  asking  a lender  to write 
off interest and charges.  But in some circumstances,  we might  tell a lender to write off all the debt. 
Examples of where we might  do this are available on the technical resource section  of our website.1 The 
examples include where a lender actually knew a person was struggling financially when it approved  a 
loan.
As Ive set out above, I do think QuickQuid  actually knew, from the information it had and what  she told it, 
that Miss E was in financial  difficulty.
Taking everything into account, I think fair redress in Miss Es case, in respect  of all of the loans she 
complains about, would simply  be to tell QuickQuid to write off what  Miss E owes it. 
From what Ive seen, the write off Im proposing would be greater than the interest and charges Miss E had 
paid on loans 4 and 5. So even if I were  to direct redress for those too, Miss E wouldnt get anything 
directly  it would be fair, in her circumstances, for QuickQuid to offset  this against the write  off. Theres 
therefore no need to consider  whether or not loans 4 and 5 were approved  responsibly.
In summary, I dont think QuickQuid  acted responsibly when  it approved  loan 6 and in the particular 
circumstances of Miss Es complaint,  I think its fair QuickQuid write  off what  she owes it. I consider that 
would be a fair way to put things right for the entirely of Miss Es complaint.

write off what Miss E owes  it; and

Im planning  to uphold Miss Es complaint in part and to tell CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right by 
taking the steps set out above.
