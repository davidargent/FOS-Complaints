The complaint
Mr W complains that Sainsbury's Bank Plc did not uphold his chargeback claim and did not 
consider his claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 for compensation 
about a mis-sold kitchen.
What happened
In November 2021 Mr W paid about £9,900 with his Sainsburys Bank credit card to a third 
party (the merchant) for the supply of a kitchen. He later complained that this kitchen had 
been misrepresented to him, and that he was not given the opportunity to reject it. He says 
he had therefore gone along with his purchase of different kitchen units as he had had no 
realistic alternative. In July 2022 he asked Sainsburys Bank for a refund.
Sainsburys Bank raised a chargeback dispute, and in the meantime it temporarily re-
credited the payment to Mr Ws account. The merchant defended the claim, saying that it 
had replaced some larder units with different ones and had refunded Mr W the price 
difference (the new units being somewhat cheaper than the originals). The bank accepted 
this evidence and re-debited the disputed amount. Mr W complains that the bank did not do 
this within 45 days, being the time in which he thought that a chargeback had to be resolved, 
and so he had treated the money as his own to spend; the unexpected re-debit had caused 
him some financial problems. But his main complaint is that his request for a refund should 
have been treated as a claim under section 75, rather than a chargeback, and that such a 
claim should have succeeded. He says that the larder units were misrepresented to him, due 
to a glitch in the merchants visual rendering software. He referred this complaint to our 
service.
The bank says it actually did begin to consider Mr Ws claim under section 75, but he had 
come to our service before it could finish. It said that the chargeback had failed because the 
merchant had already resolved the issue by replacing the relevant units and refunding the 
price difference, and Mr W had accepted that remedy at the time. The kitchen had been 
installed. The bank argued that a section 75 claim would have failed for the same reason. 
Our investigator agreed, and for those reasons he did not uphold this complaint. He also 
said the 45-day time limit was for the merchant to respond, not for the bank to consider the 
evidence and resolve the dispute.
Mr W did not accept the investigators opinion. He said he had never received the refund, 
and he had only accepted the amended kitchen because he felt that he had been left with no 
other choice. The kitchen had been kept in storage for over five months before being 
installed, and as he has a family he could not wait for a new kitchen to be supplied by some 
third party. He asked for an ombudsman to review his case. He suggested that a refund of 
50% of the cost of the kitchen would be a fair alternative to rejecting it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I do not uphold it, for broadly the reasons I have outlined above. I will 
elaborate a little further.
While I understand Mr Ws reasons for accepting the amended order instead of rejecting it, 
this does not mean that it would be fair to let him reject the kitchen now, or to refund the 
price or half of the price as an alternative to rejection. Although rejecting or cancelling the 
order at the time would have been inconvenient for him, it would not have been impossible, 
but instead he chose not to exercise that right. I dont think that is the same thing as being 
denied the right, or the opportunity to exercise the right. In an email dated 9 May 2022 he 
accepted the change to his order, and asked whether the price would go up or down. The 
merchant replied to say that there would be a refund of £151.87 plus VAT. The kitchen, as 
altered, was supplied and installed.
In another email dated 4 July, Mr W confirmed that he had received a refund of £677.22 and 
requested a breakdown of what this was for. It appears from other emails that a little over 
half of that amount was for an unrelated issue (some items which were damaged in storage 
and needed to be replaced). But it seems more likely than not that the rest of it included the 
difference between the prices of the original and replacement larder units. So on the balance 
of probabilities, I am satisfied that the merchant accepted that the original units had been 
misdescribed and that they would not be satisfactory, offered to replace them with suitable 
(and slightly cheaper) alternatives and to refund the difference in price, and then paid that 
refund once Mr W had accepted that offer. Mr W appears to have confirmed as much in a 
phone call with Sainsburys Bank on 1 September 2022 (according to the banks internal 
notes).
That information would certainly have been fatal to a chargeback claim. I can see in 
Sainsburys Banks internal notes that the bank also opened a section 75 case on 1 January 
2023, although its case handler was doubtful that this would succeed either. In March (by 
which time Mr W had approached our service), which is as far as my copy of the notes go up 
to, no decision about that had been made yet, but since then the bank has told us that it 
does not think that it is liable under section 75.
Section 75 applies to Mr Ws purchase, so I have taken it into account. That section makes 
the bank jointly liable for any misrepresentation made by the merchant. A misrepresentation 
is a false statement (which can be made by an image as well as by words) which induces 
someone to enter into a contract which they would not have entered into otherwise.
However, although one remedy for misrepresentation is to unwind a contract and put the 
parties back in the position they would have been in if the contract had not been made, 
I think that would be disproportionate in this case because Mr W did not ask for this at the 
time, but agreed to accept the modified order. And the kitchen has since been installed.
As an alternative to rejection, Mr W recently proposed a refund of 50% of the price, in case 
an ombudsman thought that removing the whole kitchen was asking too much. But I think 
that would still be disproportionate too, for the same reason. Instead, I think that the remedy 
which the merchant and Mr W agreed at the time  amending the order, and adjusting the 
price to reflect the change  was fair.
For that reason, I do not think that Sainsburys Bank reached the wrong decision about 
Mr Ws claim.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 November 2023.
