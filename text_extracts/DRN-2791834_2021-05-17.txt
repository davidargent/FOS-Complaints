The complaint
Mrs L is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, approved her for a credit account 
with a credit limit she feels was unaffordable for her at that time.  
What happened
Mrs L applied for a credit account with PayPal in 2019 and was approved by PayPal for a 
credit account with a credit limit of £3,000. 
In July 2020, Mrs L raised a complaint with PayPal on the basis that she didnt feel that the 
credit account that PayPal approved her for was affordable for her at the time of the 
application in 2019. Mrs L also felt that this would have been apparent to PayPal had they 
conducted checks into her financial position at that time.
PayPal looked at Mrs Ls complaint, but they felt that they had conducted reasonable and 
proportionate checks into Mrs Ls financial position at the time of the credit application and 
that there had been nothing in these checks that had demonstrated to them that Mrs L might 
not be able to afford the credit being offered. So, they didnt uphold Mrs Ls complaint.
Mrs L wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They didnt feel that PayPal had been able 
to demonstrate that they had conducted reasonable and proportionate checks into Mrs Ls 
financial circumstances. However, they felt that if PayPal had conducted such checks, then it 
was more likely than not that the information that they had gathered wouldnt have caused 
them to consider that the credit wasnt affordable for Mrs L at that time. So, our investigator 
didnt uphold this aspect of Mrs Ls complaint.
However, our investigator noted that PayPal had advised Mrs L that they had conducted a 
credit check with a specific Credit Reference Agency (CRA)  and that Mrs L had spent time 
chasing that CRA for confirmation of that credit check  but PayPal had actually conducted 
their credit check with a different CRA. Our investigator felt that Mrs L had been 
unreasonably inconvenienced by this and recommended that the complaint be upheld in Mrs 
Ls favour on that basis and that PayPal should pay £50 to Mrs L to compensate her for the 
inconvenience she had incurred.
PayPal didnt agree with the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a business to decide who it will offer credit to, and if so, how much and on what terms. 
What this service would expect would be that, at the time of the credit application, the 
business would conduct reasonable and proportionate checks to ensure that the amount of 
credit being offered is affordable for that customer at that time.
PayPal have said that they did that here. They explained that they took details of Mrs Ls 
income and expenditure to confirm that she had sufficient disposable income to be able to 
afford the credit being offered. PayPal also stated that they undertook an assessment of Mrs 
Ls credit file.
Unfortunately, PayPal havent been able to provide a copy of the assessment of Mrs Ls 
credit file that they conducted. And while they have been able to provide a copy of the 
income and expenditure information that they gathered from Mrs L at the time of the 
application, Im not convinced that this information is detailed enough to have enabled 
PayPal to have arrived at an accurate understanding of the amount of Mrs Ls disposable 
income at that time.
I say this because PayPal have advised that Mrs Ls income and expenditure assessment 
demonstrated that Mrs L had a disposable monthly income of £500. However, PayPals 
income and expenditure assessment of Mrs L wasnt based on specific income and 
expenditure figures, but instead asked Mrs L to confirm which range of income and 
expenditure she was in. 
For instance, PayPals income and expenditure assessment confirms that Mrs L stated that 
her monthly income was in the range of £501 to £1,000, while her monthly outgoings were 
confirmed as being in the range of £1 to £500. 
This feels ambiguous to me, and leaves open the possibility that Mrs Ls income was toward 
the lower end of the £501 to £1000 range, while her income may have been toward the 
higher end of the £1 to £500 range, meaning that Mrs Ls actual disposable income may 
have been very low. 
This means that its very difficult to conclude from PayPals income and expenditure 
assessment that PayPal had obtained an understanding of Mrs Ls income to the level of 
detail that would be expected here, such that it could be used to conduct a fair and accurate 
assessment of Mrs Ls ability to afford credit.
However, whilst Im satisfied that PayPal didnt conduct reasonable and proportionate 
checks into Mrs Ls financial position, as this service would have expected that they would 
have done, it doesnt follow necessarily from this that the credit offered to Mrs L was 
unsuitable or unaffordable for her, such that PayPal could be said to have offered credit to 
Mrs L irresponsibly.
I say this because if PayPal had conducted reasonable and proportionate checks, these 
checks may have demonstrated that the credit being offered to Mrs L was affordable for her. 
Because of this, Ive tried to gain an accurate understanding of Mrs Ls financial position at 
the time of credit application to try to determine whether the credit being offered to her was 
unaffordable for her at that time.
Unfortunately, a copy of Mrs Ls credit file from the time of the application isnt available, so 
Ive had to base my assessment on indirect information. These include the PayPal credit 
account statements, which demonstrate how Mrs L used the credit account, as well as Mrs 
Ls own testimony into her wider financial position at that time.
Having done so, I dont feel that I can fairly say that, had PayPal undertaken reasonable and 
proportionate checks into her financial position at that time, that its more likely that not that 
PayPal should have concluded that the credit being offered was unaffordable for Mrs L. 
I say this because the PayPal credit account statements dont highlight any usage that might indicate that Mrs L was in financial difficulty at that time, such as the repayment of other 
borrowing, but instead appear to demonstrate normal usage, including several retail 
purchases. Additionally, Mrs L has also confirmed to this service that she was manging her 
existing credit well at that time and hadnt missed any payments. And its difficult to conclude 
from this that Mrs Ls credit file at that time would have presented PayPal with any causes 
for concern or reasons to suspect that the credit being offered to Mrs L was unaffordable for 
her.
So, while I can certainly sympathise with Mrs L that her financial position deteriorated to the 
degree that she felt compelled to contact PayPal and seek help with regard the payments 
due on this credit account  help which I note that PayPal have provided - I dont feel that I 
can say that her financial position at the time of the account application was such that 
PayPal should have concluded that the credit account was unaffordable for her at that time. 
And it follows from this that Im unable to uphold this aspect of her complaint.
However, while Im satisfied that it cant be demonstrated that Mrs L has incurred any form of 
financial loss directly attributable to PayPals decision to offer her credit, Im of the opinion 
that Mrs L has been unreasonably inconvenienced by PayPal during her interactions with 
them such that an award of compensation for that inconvenience is merited.
This is because PayPal informed Mrs L that they had conducted a credit check at the time of 
the account application using a particular CRA, when in fact a different CRA had been used. 
This led to Mrs L contacting the incorrect CRA for confirmation that a credit check had been 
conducted, and to questioning the answers received from that CRA, when they correctly told 
her that no credit check against her had been conducted with them at that time.
Because of this I feel that its fair and reasonable that PayPal should make a payment of £50 
to Mrs L, to compensate her for the inconvenience that shes incurred, and I will be 
upholding this complaint on that basis only. 
Putting things right
PayPal must make a payment to Mrs L of £50 to compensate her for inconvenience she has 
incurred.  
My final decision
I uphold this complaint against that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, on the basis explained 
above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 June 2021.
