K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) unfairly applied  charges  when  
a buyer  initiated  chargebacks against him. Mr S also complains about the service he 
received when he complained. 
background
Mr S listed  three items for sale on a website  (W). He said two buyers purchased the items,  
with one buyer buying two of the items.  Mr S received the money  for the sales into his 
PayPal account.   Shortly after each transaction Mr S said he received an email from W 
which said W had to remove the listings due to unauthorised use of the buyers  accounts.  W 
also advised Mr S not to send the items. 
Mr S said he did not withdraw the money  from his PayPal  account as he believed that W 
would recover the funds as it would do with any other refund. He said he didnt communicate 
with the buyers  or post the items. Mr S said the buyers had been  victims  of fraud  and would 
be entitled to recover their payments and that he was equally the victim of the fraud as the 
fraudsters would have  expected to obtain goods from him using stolen funds. 
Mr S said he expected the owners of the accounts  (the credit card holders) to recover  the 
funds and in due course they initiated chargeback  requests.  He said he didnt contest the 
chargebacks for the transactions nor did he ask PayPal  to contest the chargebacks  because  
he said the funds  were effectively stolen property.  
After being notified about the chargebacks Mr S said he provided  PayPal  with details of the 
background to the transactions. He said PayPal then opted to dispute the chargebacks.
It then charged him the £14 chargeback fee plus the transaction  fee for each item per the 
terms and conditions. This came to a total of £49.02  in fees.  He complained  to PayPal. He 
said this was unfair and unreasonable  and a breach of the requirement to treat customers 
fairly. 
Mr S said he didnt  receive a final response  letter from PayPal so he brought his complaint to 
this service. He further complained about  PayPals failure to deal with his complaint. 
After considering all of the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to 
Mr S and PayPal on 13 February  2018.  I said:
Mr S listed  items for sale on W which is a separate legal  entity  from PayPal. Mr S 
could have chosen to receive payments for his items  from other payment services 
and Im satisfied Mr S freely  chose to use the PayPal service so was bound  by 
PayPals terms and conditions.
The terms and conditions  state that PayPal  will charge £14 for a chargeback plus the 
transaction charge. The credit card holders  chose  to recover  the money using 
chargeback which Mr S did not dispute.  So on the surface Mr S needs to pay the 
charges associated with chargeback. 
Mr S said he was also the victim of fraud.  He said he expected  the credit card 
holders to recover the funds or for W to contact him to recover the funds.  The 
process by which  W would recover the funds is not clear to me. But for the credit  
card holders an option available to them would  be through chargeback. This would 
Ref: DRN54667552be an entirely separate process to W. The chargeback process is operated  by the 
credit card scheme  itself and not the retailer, in this case W, or the payment system,  
in this case PayPal.   
The emails  sent by W after each transaction said the following:  
We also recommend you take the following actions if this buyer  won the item:
If you havent received payment, dont complete the sale or send the 
item to the buyer
Dont communicate with the buyer directly
Verify any payments youve been notified  of by logging  in to your 
PayPal account  (or other online payment service)
If the buyer requests refunds or additional  payments dont send  any 
money without contacting W first
If you have any concerns or questions,  click Help  & Contact at the top of 
most W pages.
The emails  do not say what Mr S should do in the event  the buyer has sent payment. 
But Mr S accepted the money didnt belong  to him. He said the funds were left in the 
account for return to the buyer. But this still means  the money was in Mr Ss 
possession to do with what he wanted, and as he knew the money wasnt  his I agree 
with PayPal that he had a duty to return the funds and not wait for them to be 
recovered. 
The emails  do not say Mr S shouldnt  return the funds. It says to contact  W before he 
does so. In his complaint Mr S said he believed W would recover  the funds as it does 
with any other refund.  Given this uncertainty and the fact the issue  at the core of this 
complaint involves Mr Ss relationship with W it would be reasonable to expect Mr S 
to contact W himself  to establish what to do with the money. Had Mr S received 
instructions regarding refunding the money  and had he done so through PayPal he 
would not have incurred the chargeback  costs.  In its terms and conditions  PayPal 
state there  is no charge for refunding.  It keeps  only the transaction  costs;  which  is 
less than £10 in total. 
 
Mr S said he was told not to send  the items and, as the investigator had pointed out, 
had he done so he wouldve qualified for the seller protection. I accept this is the 
case. But I still consider  it was Mr Ss responsibility to speak with W to establish  next 
steps rather than to assume the money  would be refunded back out of his account. 
The card scheme charges  PayPal for chargebacks.  PayPal, as part of its terms and 
conditions, passes the charge to its customers, unless the seller can benefit from the 
seller protection  programme.  Mr  S chose to use the PayPal service to accept  
payment and he assumed either  W would recover the money, though  its not clear to 
me how that would happen, or the credit card holders would seek  to recover the 
money. A legitimate avenue to do so for them would  be through chargeback. 
PayPal said in its response to the investigator  that as Mr S did not refund  the 
payments himself, he left himself open to chargebacks.  Had he reversed the 
payments when he was advised they were  unauthorised the credit card holders 
would not have any need to file the chargebacks. I agree  with this, subject to Mr S 
contacting W first, as it suggested. 
Ref: DRN54667553Mr S has said PayPal  has taken around  £50 from him as an innocent  consumer in 
circumstances when  he had nothing to do with the alleged unauthorised transaction.  I 
fully accept Mr S played no part in any alleged  fraud  and he accepts the money did 
not belong to him. I also appreciate that he didnt intend to keep  the money. But Mr S 
did not contact  W in order  to seek to refund the money and so the credit  card holders 
were able to initiate chargebacks, hence  triggering the associated  fees.  
Mr S said in his complaint  that any financial institution (in this case PayPal)  acting 
fairly and reasonably would have returned the funds to the buyer's financial institution  
and closed the case. 
It is my role to be fair and reasonable to both parties and I can deviate  from PayPals 
terms and conditions if I believe  it fair and reasonable  to do so. I do understand Mr S 
is frustrated with this situation. But in this case Im satisfied PayPal hasnt done 
anything wrong. And subject to any further  information I wont  be asking  it to do 
anything more to resolve  matters. 
Mr S has also complained about  the service he received  when he complained.  Im 
sorry to hear that. Im afraid  I dont  have the power  to consider those aspects of Mr 
Ss complaint that concern how PayPal dealt with his original complaint. Under the 
rules that apply to our service, we can only consider complaints about regulated  
activities, and complaint handling  isnt one of these. 
I invited both Mr S and PayPal for their responses to my provisional decision.  PayPal 
received my decision but had nothing further  to add. Mr S disagreed  and asked me to 
consider some further points relating to fairness, industry practice and PayPals relationship 
with W which I shall address below. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  First of all Id like to thank Mr S for taking 
the time to respond to my provisional decision in such detail. I want  to reassure him that Ive 
taken all his points on board but if I dont mention something this isnt because I havent 
considered it but rather I dont think I need  to mention it in order  to reach the right outcome. 
I think its important to clarify that PayPal and W are separate legal entities. Their 
relationship is such  that PayPal  is contracted to provide payment services to W. The 
companies are not integrated, though it might appear to a consumer like that on Ws 
website, but operate as one supplying a service to another.  An account with W is entirely 
separate to an account with PayPal. In general  there are other ways  to pay for items on the 
W website and there  are other ways for sellers to receive payment. 
Mr S has said it was unfair for me to suggest that he was at fault. It wasnt  my intention to 
apportion any blame to Mr S for any inappropriate behaviour. Im sorry if this is how it came 
across. In putting  items  up for sale on W Mr S was creating a contract with a potential buyer 
and in doing so he chose  to use the PayPal service  to receive money. This means he 
agreed to be bound by its terms and conditions which include charges for refunds and 
chargebacks.  These terms  and conditions are entirely separate  from Ws and relate  only to 
the agreement  between Mr S and PayPal. 
Ref: DRN54667554Mr S has said in being fair and reasonable our rules  require us to take account of good 
practice in the industry. He said in situations like this that would mean the business would 
absorb the charges and that no UK financial  institution would  levy charges.
. 
Mr S is correct  that we must take into account good practice in the industry in order  to be fair 
and reasonable.  But it does not necessarily follow that it is PayPal that should absorb the 
charges in these  individual circumstances.  That would be the case  only if PayPal had done 
something wrong. And Im not persuaded that it has. Mr S has laid out in detail  why he 
believes the credit card holders PayPal  account  would also have been compromised, in 
addition to their account with W, so PayPal was responsible for allowing the fraudulent  
deposit into his account and should  have taken action itself on seeing Ws emails to return 
the money. 
Mr S has said the credit  card holder  stated  their W account had been  hacked. Mr S said in 
order to have made a purchase and payment the credit card holders W and PayPal 
accounts had to be accessed.  Im not disputing  this. But the accounts are separate. A 
customer logs into the W account to select an item to purchase and then has to log into 
PayPal to complete  the payment for it. Its of course  possible both accounts  were accessed 
inappropriately but I cant say for certain.  And there  is no evidence  the credit  card holder has 
made a complaint to PayPal concerning their PayPal account. 
In my provisional decision I said Mr S should have contacted W in order  to identify what  to 
do regarding  a refund. Mr S has said he did contact W and was told not to refund any money 
as per their email.  The email I have seen is as quoted above, which does not say Mr S 
shouldnt return the money but should  contact W before he does. 
I can see that Mr S wasnt given clear instructions from W regarding how to get the money  
back. This is unfortunate.  But this is not the fault of PayPal. The transaction  in question 
related to the credit card holders W account.  So I still consider it reasonable for Mr S to 
have contacted W with a view to establishing exactly how he should return the money and 
which organisation would be responsible for this. Or alternatively he should simply have 
asked PayPal to return the money. 
Mr S said it was wholly unreasonable  for me to expect him to return the payment after he 
had been informed that the credit card holders account had been hacked.  I disagree. Mr S 
put goods up for sale. After he found  out there  were  unauthorised transactions Mr S should  
have refunded the payments to the accounts  they came from and kept the goods. It would 
then be up to W and if necessary PayPal,  if there  was unauthorised access  to the PayPal  
account, to investigate any wrong doing.  I understand there would be charges to refund the 
money, but these are significantly  less than the chargeback charges and are part of the 
contract Mr S has with PayPal. 
Mr S has also said he was an innocent  recipient  so hes questioned why he should incur  
charges, and PayPal  obtain a fee, when it permitted a fraudulent payment to be sent in the 
first place. He said it was PayPals failure  to secure  the credit  card holders PayPal account 
that permitted the payment in the first place.  
I do understand what Mr S means  by this but its not my role to decide if the PayPal account 
was compromised, nor can I determine  whether PayPal  has done anything  wrong  with 
regards to account security. It could simply be the case  that the account holder was using 
the same  security details  for their W account  as they were for their PayPal account.  Mr S 
was told the credit card holders W account was compromised.  This has nothing  to do with 
Ref: DRN54667555PayPal and I dont  I agree with Mr S that it was PayPals responsibility to take proactive 
action by contacting W itself to investigate or return the money. I can appreciate this 
situation has been frustrating and very annoying for Mr S and he would like to be 
compensated for the charges hes incurred. This is understandable  and he has my genuine 
sympathy. But I dont agree that PayPal has done  anything wrong, and it wouldnt be fair for 
me to ask it to refund Mr S. And I have  to be fair to both parties. So for the reasons outlined  
here and earlier in my provisional decision I wont be asking it to do anything  further. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2019.
