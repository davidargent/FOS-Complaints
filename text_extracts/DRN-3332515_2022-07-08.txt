The complaint
Ms W complains that Shawbrook Bank Limited (Shawbrook) has rejected the claim she 
made under sections 56 and 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the Act) in relation to a 
solar panel system she says was misrepresented to her by the supplier.
Ms W is represented by a claims management company (the CMC).
Background
In or around July 2016, Ms W was contacted by a representative of a company Ill call P to 
talk about purchasing a solar panel system (the system) to be installed at her home. After 
being visited by a representative of P, Ms W decided to purchase the system and finance it 
through a ten year fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook. The system was 
subsequently installed.
In February and July 2021 the CMC made a claim to Shawbrook on Ms Ws behalf under 
section 75 of the Act. The CMC said that, following a cold call, P had made a number of 
representations about the system that had turned out not to be true, and it was these 
misrepresentations that had induced Ms W to enter into the contract with P. The CMC said 
the following misrepresentations had been made:
the total cost of the system was documented as £8,976.45 to mislead Ms W, as when 
the interest was added the total cost was actually £14,117.20;
the system would generate free electricity;
the system would be self-funding; and
the feed in tariff (FIT) and savings on her electricity bills would provide enough 
income to cover the monthly loan agreement payments.
Shawbrook didnt agree the system had been misrepresented to Ms W or that there were 
any other reasons for the claim to be upheld.
One of our adjudicators looked into what had happened. Having considered all the 
information and evidence provided, our adjudicator didnt think that P had misrepresented 
the system to Ms W and found no reason to uphold the complaint.
The CMC didnt agree with the adjudicators view for the following reasons:
the salesman had never shown Ms W Ps quote (on which the adjudicator had 
relied), and she had only seen the last page when she signed it;
Ms W had never had the opportunity to read it;
a copy of the quote had never been sent to her to read in her own time;
being satisfied with what she had been told in the sales meeting, Ms W had not 
thought it necessary to ask for a copy of the quote afterwards;
other customers have reported similar sales tactics, so Ms Ws claims were credible;
where a person is unaware that a representation is false, the fact that they could 
have found out it was false by taking reasonable care is not a defence in law.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the case has been passed to me for review.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I do not uphold it. I will explain why.
Relevant considerations
When considering whats fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account relevant law 
and regulations, relevant regulatory rules, guidance and standards and codes of practice, 
and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant 
time. In this case the relevant law includes sections 56 and 75 of the Act.
Section 75 provides protection for consumers for goods or services bought using credit. As 
Ms W paid for the system with a fixed sum loan agreement, Shawbrook agrees that section 
75 applies to this transaction. This means that Ms W could claim against Shawbrook (the 
creditor) for any misrepresentation or breach of contract by P in the same way she could 
have claimed against P (the supplier). So Ive taken section 75 into account when deciding 
what is fair in the circumstances of this case.
Section 56 is also relevant. This is because it says that any negotiations between Ms W and 
P, as the supplier, are deemed to have been conducted by P as an agent of Shawbrook.
For the purpose of this decision Ive used the definition of a misrepresentation as an untrue 
statement of fact or law made by one party (or his agent) to a second party which induces 
that second party to enter the contract, thereby causing her loss.
What happened?
If there is a dispute about what happened, I must decide on the balance of probabilities  
that is, what I consider to have been most likely to have happened, given the evidence that 
is available and the wider surrounding circumstances.
Ms W says that during a sales meeting she was told that the system would be entirely self-
financing and come at no additional cost.
There are several documents that have been provided by both parties. These include the 
solar quote, titled Your Personal Solar Quotation. Ive considered these, along with Ms Ws 
testimony and recollection of the sales meeting, to decide on balance what is most likely to 
have happened.
The quote is a detailed document that sets out key information about the system, the 
expected performance, financial benefits and technical information. P, via Shawbrook, has 
told this service that this formed a central part of the sales process and the representative of 
P would have discussed this in detail with Ms W, explaining any benefits of the system, prior 
to her agreeing to enter into the contract.
Ms W denies that she was given the chance to read the quote, either in the sales meeting or 
afterwards. But on balance I dont think its likely or plausible that she simply took the 
salesmans word for it when she was told that she could buy thousands of pounds worth of 
equipment  paid for with an interest-bearing loan  without it costing her a penny, without at 
any point asking to see something to that effect in writing. Its more likely that she has simply 
forgotten seeing the quote over the five years between the sale and the bringing of her 
claim.Having thought carefully about the available evidence, Im satisfied that on balance the 
quote did form a central part of the sales process and therefore accept that the salesperson 
went through it during the meeting. So, Ive taken this into account, along with Ms Ws 
version of events, when considering if there have been any untrue statements of fact.
The credit agreement sets out clearly the amount being borrowed (i.e. the cash price of the 
system, less any deposit), the interest to be charged, the total amount payable, the term of 
the loan and the contractual monthly repayments.
Cost of the system
On balance, Im satisfied that Ms W was told that the overall cost of the system was more 
than its cash price. The credit agreement made it clear that £8,976.45 was only the cash 
price. It set out a clear breakdown of the deposit (£100), the amount of credit provided 
(£8,976.45), the total charge for credit (£5,140.75), the monthly payments, and the total 
amount repayable, £14,117.20.
Having considered all the evidence, including Ms Ws recollections, Im satisfied that she 
was told that there would be a monthly loan repayment due. The quote makes this clear, as 
set out in the table below. Overall, Im satisfied that the two documents, the quote and the 
credit agreement, made it clear that it would cost Ms W more than the cash price as she had 
decided to pay for it with an interest-bearing loan.
FIT payments and savings
Ms W has said that she was told her monthly loan repayments would be covered, or self-
funded by the FIT payments and the savings on her energy bills. Ive considered the quote 
that was provided by P as well as Ms Ws recollections of her meeting with Ps 
representative to decide what is most likely to have been said.
The system analysis page of the quote sets out the estimated income Ms W could expect to 
receive by way of FIT payments from the system. This is split out into the expected FIT 
payments in the first year and the expected average income over 20 years. The FIT scheme 
only provides payments for a 20-year period.
I think that the first of these tables is clear that Ms W could expect to receive a total FIT 
income in year one of £181.65, which results in an average monthly income of £15.14. Im 
satisfied that the same document set out that there would be a monthly loan repayment due 
of £116.81. As a result, Im not able to conclude that Ms W was told that the monthly loan 
repayments would be covered by the FIT payments alone.
The quote goes on to look at the electricity savings Ms W could expect from the system. The 
expected year one electricity savings is £316.37 and, when taking into account the optional 
extras chosen by Ms W, the combined income and savings in year one is shown as 
£1,098.96. This is shown in a table titled Putting it all together.
Theres a section headed Repayments with three tables showing repayments over 60 
months, 120 months and 180 months. Ive focused on the table for 120 months as this is the 
length of the loan that Ms W entered into with Shawbrook. This table shows the loan as 
repayable in 120 monthly payments of £116.81. For each year of the ten year loan it shows 
the expected grand total return from the system. It then averages that figure over 12 months, 
and subtracts the monthly loan repayment, to give an average difference between the 
monthly return from the system and the monthly loan repayment in each year. This gives a 
negative figure for the first five years of the loan, meaning that the system would take six 
years to begin to make enough money to cover the loan payments.
I think the quote clearly sets out the income Ms W could expect to receive from the system, 
by way of FIT payments and savings, as well as her expected contractual monthly loan 
repayments. Whilst I accept that the table doesnt simply compare the FIT income and 
savings to the monthly loan repayments, it does clearly set out that the overall income she 
could expect to receive by way of FIT income and any additional savings would not be 
immediately sufficient to cover the monthly loan repayments. (This supports my finding 
above that Ms W wasnt told that the FIT payments alone would cover the loan repayments.) 
Ive carefully thought about Ms Ws version of events. However, as Ive found that the quote 
did form a central part of the sales process which the salesperson went through at the 
meeting, I dont think I can reasonably find that she was told that the monthly loan 
repayments would be covered by the FIT income and savings.
Self-funding
Ill now consider whether P told Ms W that the system would be self-funding from the outset. 
In doing so Ill again weigh all the available evidence to decide what is most likely to have 
happened.
Bearing in mind my finding on the central role the quote played in the sales meeting, Ive 
considered the table above which sets out the estimated average monthly income from the 
system, and the effect on that income of subtracting the monthly loan repayment. Im 
satisfied that the table is clear and easy to understand. On balance Im also satisfied that the 
salesperson referred to the table at the meeting.
As a result, I consider the salesperson did not make a representation that the system would 
be self-funding from the outset. Rather, I find that the salesperson went through the quote at 
the meeting which sets out that there would be a difference between the expected income 
and the monthly loan repayments.
Im of the view that this makes it clear that the system wouldnt be self-funding from the start. 
I think the quote is clear that there would be a difference between the expected income and 
monthly loan repayments.
That said, I do accept that Ms W was told by P that the system would be self-funding over a 
certain period of time.
The Key Facts page of the quote states in large font that it would take seven years for the 
overall benefits that Ms W could expect to receive to match the cash price of the system.
I think the seven-year estimated payback time is clear and prominent, being in large print on 
page 2, and so I dont consider that it needed further explaining. This figure also appears in 
the Putting it all together section.
So Im satisfied that P told Ms W that the system would pay for its cash price in seven years, 
as supported by the figures above, which were included in the quote. If that were an untrue 
statement of fact, and Im satisfied that this was what induced her to enter into the contract, 
and she subsequently suffered a loss, then that could amount to a misrepresentation. So Ive 
gone on to consider the performance of the system and whether this is in line with the 
contract between P and Ms W.
Performance
The MCS certificate and quote set out that the system is expected to produce 2,709 kWh a 
year. I have looked at Ms Ws FIT statements and can see that her system, on average, has 
generated 2,636 kWh a year. This is slightly less than estimated by P at the point of sale 
(97%), so Im satisfied that the system is performing as expected, in terms of energy 
generation, if not financially. So the reason Ms W has not seen the expected financial 
returns is not because the system is defective, but for some other cause.
I have also looked at the assumptions used by P, including the self-consumption rate, 
expected annual increase in utility prices (EPR) and expected annual RPI inflation increase. 
I am satisfied that Ps method for calculating these is fair and reasonable.
P used Office of National Statistics (ONS) data between 2006 and 2015 to calculate the 
utility price and RPI inflation. I have looked at the actual yearly increases between 2016 and 
2020, and the increases have been lower than predicted by P at the point of sale, and I think 
this explains why Ms W hasnt been receiving the financial returns she may have been 
expecting from the solar panels. Since actual energy prices have been lower than the 
modelling predicted, the savings achieved through the energy generated by the system have 
been correspondingly lower.
As I have explained, the assumptions used by P were based on the information available 
from the ONS at the time. And based on this, I dont consider it unreasonable for P to have 
used them as the basis for calculating the potential financial income Ms W could have 
expected to receive from the system. So, whilst I can appreciate that the returns may not 
have been as high as estimated at the point of sale, Im not persuaded that this was due to 
unreasonable assumptions being used by P at the time Ms W entered into the contract.
Summary
Having carefully considered the evidence provided by all parties in this complaint, Im
satisfied that there were no untrue statements of fact made by P that induced Ms W to enter 
into the contract for the system, and I have found no other reason to uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 August 2022.
