The complaint
Ms G complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd unfairly requires her to repay lending it 
provided for goods which she says were returned.
What happened
Ms G purchased a mobile device from a retailer using finance provided by Creation. She 
then asked the retailer if she could return the device and arrangements were made for it to 
be collected.
Ms G says that she left the device in her porch along with another package to be collected 
by a different courier. It subsequently came to light that the courier sent by the retailer had 
collected the wrong package. I understand that it was delivered to the retailer, and 
subsequently returned to Ms G sometime later. 
Ms G enquired about the whereabouts of her mobile device, but it seems the retailer denied 
having received it. Ms G raised a complaint with Creation on the basis that it wasnt fair to 
ask her to repay sums for goods which had been returned.
Creation said that the retailer had told it the device had not been returned. It declined to 
cancel the finance agreement unless the retailer confirmed receipt of the goods. It also 
suggested that Ms G take the matter up with the retailer and the courier.
Ms G didnt agree with Creation, so she referred the matter to this service. She said that she 
believed the courier had picked up both packages but only one had been returned to her. 
She provided tracking information for a package which the retailers courier had collected.
Our investigator accepted that Ms G was allowed to return the device she purchased. But 
significantly, they didnt think that Ms G had followed the correct returns process based on 
information found on the retailers website as well as relevant regulations. They noted that 
under those regulations Ms G was required to return the goods or hand them to someone 
authorised to receive them. They suggested that by leaving the goods in her porch Ms G 
hadnt met those requirements. 
They also noted that Creation ought to have considered whether or not Ms G had a valid 
claim under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Whilst they didnt think Ms G had a 
valid claim, they said that Creation had provided poor service and ought to pay Ms G £150 
compensation for upset and worry caused. 
Creation agreed with our investigators recommendation. Ms G disagreed and asked for an 
ombudsmans decision on the case. She provided a screenshot of a text message from a 
retailer which she believed showed the device had been collected. 
The case has been passed to me to decide what should happen.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusion as our investigator for broadly the same 
reasons. Ill explain why. 
Ms Gs complaint relates to a running account credit facility provided by Creation. Its a 
regulated agreement and one which this service has the power to consider a complaint 
about.
Ms G might find that Ive presented the events which led to this complaint in less detail than 
she presented them. Ive done this simply because I dont find it necessary to mirror that 
level of detail in explaining what a fair and reasonable outcome is. I can assure Ms G, 
however, that Ive carefully considered everything Ive been presented.
In considering what I believe to be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances, Im required 
to take into account relevant law, rules, guidance, codes of practice as well as what I 
consider to have been good industry practice at the time. 
When the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, Ive made my decision on 
the balance of probabilities  that is, what I think is most likely to have happened given the 
available evidence and the wider circumstances. 
Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 is relevant here. It protects consumers who buy 
goods and services on credit. It says, in certain circumstances, the finance provider is legally 
answerable for any misrepresentation or breach of contract by the supplier. 
The Consumer Contract Regulations 2013 (CCR) are also relevant in this case. They say, in 
summary and with relevance to this case, that in order to cancel a contract the consumer 
would need to return the goods or hand them to the trader or someone authorised by the 
trader to receive them.
Like our investigator, I accept it seems that Ms Gs agreement with the retailer allowed her to 
return the goods. So, if it could be reasonably established that the goods were returned and 
Ms Gs account with Creation hadnt been credited with the associated value of the 
purchase, then theres grounds to say theres been a breach of contract. 
Ive carefully considered all of the evidence thats been provided in determining whether the 
goods were likely returned. I acknowledge that Ms G has provided evidence so show that 
something was collected from her porch  for which shes provided tracking details. And, I 
accept that a package made its way to the retailer. 
However, I also think its clear from Creations correspondence with the retailer, that the 
package it received didnt contain the goods Ms G intended to return. And I think Creation 
made reasonable attempts to find out what could've happened. On balance, I think its most 
likely that the tracking details weve been provided relate to the package which was 
incorrectly collected and delivered to the retailer. 
I cant say for sure what happened to the package which contained Ms Gs mobile device, 
but based on what Ive seen, Im not persuaded that package was returned to the retailer. 
Additionally, I think that by leaving the goods in her porch, Ms G hasnt met the requirements 
set out under the CCR to entitle her to cancel her contract.  So, I dont think theres been a 
breach of contract that Creation ought to be responsible for.
Given all of the above, Im not persuaded that Creation has been responsible for a breach of 
its contract with Ms G, nor that its acted unfairly by asking her to repay the lending it provided. So, I dont require anything of Creation in that respect. That being said, I accept 
that Ms G was caused some upset and worry by Creations handling of the matters, but I 
think the £150 compensation its agreed to pay is sufficient in the circumstances.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, my final decision is that I require Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd to pay Ms G £150 compensation to the extent that it has not already done so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 December 2022.
