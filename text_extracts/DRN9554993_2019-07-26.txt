K822xcomplaint
Ms W complains that National Westminster Bank Plc failed to respond to her Section  78 
request and went on to default her credit card. 
background 
Ms W had a credit card with NatWest. The last payment was made in September 2018. She 
spoke with NatWest  in November 2018 to confirm she was experiencing financial difficulties. 
NatWest put the account on hold for thirty  days and offered to discuss  her situation. NatWest 
went on to issue a default notice to Ms W. NatWest spoke with Ms W again  on 
19 December 2018 and looked at her income and outgoings. It found she wasnt able to 
afford her payments and agreed a further  thirty day hold. 
On 10 January 2019 Ms W asked NatWest to provide information  about her credit  card 
under Section 78 of the Consumer Credit Act. Businesses have 12 working days  to respond  
to a Section  78 request. 
On 23 January 2019 NatWest wrote to Ms W and asked her to confirm  the reason for the 
Section 78 request. On 24 January 2019 NatWest  sent Ms W an account termination letter. 
Ms W complained and said NatWest couldnt take action to enforce the debt before it had 
responded to the Section  78 request. NatWest responded on 4 February 2019 and said it 
had asked Ms W to provide further  guidance about  her Section 78 request. It confirmed the 
default notice  was issued in December  2019 and that the termination  letter  was sent 
because overdue  payments  hadnt been made.  NatWest didnt uphold  Ms Ws complaint and 
she asked our service to look at it. 
NatWest responded  to Ms Ws Section 78 request  on 15 February 2019. Ms W says she 
didnt receive the information it sent.  
An investigator looked at Ms Ws complaint. She was satisfied NatWests decision to default 
the account wasnt linked to Ms Ws Section  78 request. But she asked NatWest to pay £100 
because it didnt respond to Ms Ws Section 78 request within 12 business days. NatWest 
agreed but Ms W asked  to appeal her complaint. Ms W reiterated that she hadnt  received 
NatWests response to her Section 78 request and didnt know  the debt was enforceable. As 
Ms W asked  to appeal, her complaints been  passed to me to make a decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
From what  Ive seen, there  are two key issues I need to decide.  Whether  NatWests  decision 
to default the credit  card was unfair and linked to Ms Ws Section 78 request. I also need to 
look at the delay in responding to the Section 78 request. Ill start by looking at the decision 
to default. 
Ref: DRN95549932I know Ms W feels the two issues are linked. But before NatWest could take the step of 
terminating the account and applying a default it had to take certain steps. One of those 
steps is to issue a default notice and I can see that was done in December 2018, several 
weeks before Ms W made a Section 78 request. The default  notice  gave Ms W time to 
respond or make a payment. But aside from sending NatWest a Section 78 request Ms W 
didnt make any payments  or get back in touch. 
A Section 78 notice  doesnt mean a business  has to stop all collections activity. So I dont 
agree that sending  a termination letter before it responded was unreasonable. By this time, 
Ms W hadnt made payments for around four months so I think NatWest was able to take the 
step of closing her account. 
NatWest has sent evidence to show the default was registered on 12 March 2019 and it says 
it provided the information required  on 15 February 2019 when it responded to Ms Ws 
Section 78 request. Im sorry to disappoint  Ms W but I havent found anything  to show 
NatWest treated her unfairly or made  mistakes  when  it took the decision to close  her 
account. Im not persuaded the decision was linked to Ms Ws Section 78 request. 
NatWest should  have responded to Ms Ws Section 78 request sooner. I agree with Ms W 
that her initial 10 January  2019 email was clear. The investigator asked NatWest  to pay 
£100 because  it didnt provide the information  requested until 15 February 2019 and I think  
thats fair in the circumstances. I know Ms W says she didnt receive  the information 
NatWest sent. But Ive seen a copy of the letter and accompanying  information  and its 
correctly addressed in line with the details we hold.  Im satisfied NatWest complied with her 
Section 78 request and sent her the information  on 15 February  2019.  
I am sorry  to disappoint Ms W but whilst I agree there was a delay in responding to her 
Section 78 request I havent found thats related to NatWests decision to default her credit 
card. NatWest has agreed to pay Ms W £100 because  of the delay in responding to the 
Section 78 request and Im satisfied  thats a fair way to resolve this complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part and direct  National Westminster Bank Plc 
to pay Ms W £100. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 August 2019.
