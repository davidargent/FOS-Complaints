Miss D complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid was irresponsible  to lend 
her money that she couldnt afford to repay.

Miss D says that she was caught in a cycle  of having to borrow  more money to repay 
existing loans and that this caused her stress. Miss D wants QuickQuid to refund the interest 
and charges that shes paid and write off any outstanding balance.
The adjudicator recommended that Miss Ds complaint  should  be upheld  in part. In 
summary, the adjudicator thought it was reasonable for QuickQuid to agree loans one to 
three but not loans four to 11.
The adjudicator recommended that QuickQuid refund  all interest  and charges that Miss D 
had paid on loans  four to 11 with interest  on the refund. As Miss D had been borrowing for 
an extended period of time, the adjudicator  also asked QuickQuid to remove  all entries  about  
loans four to 11.
QuickQuid disagrees  with the adjudicators  view.  It says that its not possible to determine  
whether certain  loans  were unsustainable  without  analysing  Miss Ds circumstances in 
detail. QuickQuid doesnt agree that the sheer  number of loans  is enough of a basis to say 
that the lending wasnt sustainable.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Miss D could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. 
Ref: DRN17821972These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Miss D could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ds complaint.
For loans one to three,  Miss D declared a monthly net income  of just under £1,340. Given  
the amount that QuickQuid expected Miss D to repay for loans one and two, I consider it was 
reasonable to agree  both these loans based  on knowing Miss Ds income  alone.
Loan three was for a substantially higher amount than the first two loans. Although I dont 
think QuickQuids checks were adequate, I dont have enough information to decide what 
better checks are likely to have shown. So I dont uphold  Miss Ds complaint  about loan 
three either.
Ref: DRN17821973Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Miss Ds lending  with QuickQuid to see if there  was 
a point at which QuickQuid should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid shouldve realised that it shouldnt 
have agreed to give Miss D any more  loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ds case, I think  this point was reached by loan 
four. I say this because:
by loan four, Miss D had been borrowing almost  continuously from QuickQuid for 
eight months and she wasnt making any inroads  into the amount she owed.
Miss D had also deferred repayment of loans one and three   indicating that she 
couldnt afford to repay the loans  in line with the terms  of her loan agreements.
from loan four onwards, Miss D borrowed regularly from QuickQuid with limited 
breaks in between each loan. I think  that QuickQuid shouldve seen that it was more 
likely than not Miss D was borrowing further to cover  the hole repaying each previous 
loan had left in her finances.
I think that Miss D lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ds indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Ds 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
I appreciate that QuickQuid doesnt  think the mere number of loans is enough for me to say 
that the lending was unsustainable. However,  QuickQuid will know  from previous  decisions 
that there  are cases where this service  considers  the overall  lending  pattern and not just the 
affordability of each loan.  
When a consumer borrows  repeatedly over an extended  period of time, its likely that theyre 
not using the loans  for their intended  purpose  that is to help with unexpected one-off 
expenses or temporary  cash-flow problems.
It follows that I consider  it fair to uphold Miss Ds complaint about loans four to 11
puting things right   what QuickQuid needs to do
refund  all interest and charges that Miss D paid on loans four to 11;
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;  and
the number  of loans taken by the time of loan four means that any information about loan 
four onwards is negative.  So all entries  about loans four to 11 should  be removed from 
Miss Ds credit file.
Ref: DRN17821974*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss D a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Ds complaint in part and direct  CashEuroNet UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 July 2019.
