K820x#14complaint
Mrs H complains on behalf  of the estate  of her late husband (Mr H). She feels that National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest for short) has treated Mr H and the estate unfairly  (acting in 
her capacity as administrator of the estate).  
background
This complaint revolves around an overdraft debt that Mr H had for a significant  amount of 
time before he passed away. NatWest sought repayment of that debt from Mr H and then Mr 
Hs estate.
Mrs H feels that NatWest  didnt do enough  to help Mr H whilst he was alive as he was in 
financial difficulties due to serious ill health. She also points to things that went wrong,  
particularly in what NatWest told Mr H and her about the actual  amount of the debt at 
different times. 
NatWest point to the fact that it allowed Mr H to pay reduced payments to it because of his 
circumstances and didnt  charge interest  for some time. The debt amount was set in a court 
order in 2007.  The adjudicator in this case decided that due to our time limits and the debt 
being set by a court  order and what was known at the time this complaint at this service 
could only consider events within six years  of the complaint  being  made.  Mrs H understood 
and accepted this.
NatWest has accepted that some of its communication  wasnt  good enough. It took steps  to 
show it was sorry and it also offered £200.   Mrs H doesnt think  that was enough, so she 
complained to this service.
The investigator did not agree with Mrs H and said NatWests position was reasonable. As 
Mrs H remains  unhappy her complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint .
Firstly, I should state that it is clear  these are terribly sad circumstances  and I appreciate Mrs 
Hs position considering what has happened. She has my sincerest condolences. I can also 
appreciate that Mrs H must have found  the existence of this debt hugely stressful.  And I note 
her comments about not running away from the debt and that she and those around her 
believe in acting with integrity. For these sentiments I commend her.
I should also add at this point that this decision only deals with how NatWest has acted  here. 
I note Mrs Hs comments regarding a solicitors  firm. However,  NatWest  is only responsible 
for what it does and not for what other legal entities do. So, this decision only deals  with 
what NatWest has done.
However, having considered the entirety of the matter I do not think  this complaint should be 
upheld. I say this for the following reasons which I see as key to this complaint. I appreciate  
that this will disappoint  Mrs H, but I shall explain why I think  this so that she understands my 
standpoint.
Ref: DRN71355842All regulated firms, when  they know or have reason to believe that a consumer is in financial  
difficulty are obliged to treat those consumers positively and sympathetically. Clearly this 
would be the case here once  NatWest  was on notice that Mr H was seriously ill and couldnt 
work. Although NatWest  must act positively and sympathetically this doesnt mean it is 
obliged to waive interest or waive charges  or write off any of the debt. It may decide to do 
this, but it isnt obliged to do so or to continue to do so. This is a key issue whilst considering 
what happened here.
NatWest has explained  that once a debt is passed to its recoveries team it no longer issues 
statements because such statements dont show the true position of the account. This is 
because such accounts are treated differently, and the correct  position is reached through  
manual calculations rather than through automated processes. Ive considered the evidence 
and I can see that the debt was reducing in line with the repayments being made until the 
final payment that Mr H made which was in April 2017. I can also see that NatWests records  
show that it explained how it deals with such accounts to Mr H in October 2016. So, I think  
on balance it did explain how it treats such accounts  to him and hed have understood his 
debt was being treated differently to a normal account.
After Mr H sadly passed away,  I can see NatWest  considered the official  documentation 
regarding his estate.  I can see that it contacted Mrs H in her role of administrator of the 
estate as it appeared to NatWest that the estate held enough funds for Mr Hs debt with 
NatWest to be paid off. Subsequently Mrs H has described how her family have paid off the 
debt with NatWest and she has described how NatWest has told her that the outstanding  
debt is cleared. Mrs H is unhappy  with how NatWest  has dealt with her. However outside of 
the issues NatWest identified when it offered the £200, I dont think it did anything sufficiently 
wrong for me to make it take corrective action. NatWest has referred  to the duty of 
administrators to settle debts of the estate before making distributions. It is correct that in the 
dealings with any estate  that debts must be settled first so I dont  think it has done  anything 
wrong here.
Mrs H has said that NatWest were enabled to give him some help to alleviate some  of the 
suffering he was about to endure. And on this I completely  understand her sentiments. 
However, as I described earlier NatWest  isnt obliged to take any action  other than to treat 
people positively and sympathetically. And this doesnt mean  it needs  to waive interest  or 
charges or write off some  or all the debt. But in this case NatWest has described how it 
stopped applying interest from November 2010 onward. So, I do think NatWest did do more 
than it had to and did act positively and sympathetically toward Mr H for an extended time.
I understand that having this debt added to stress of Mr Hs illness and passing. However, 
Im satisfied that the debt was fairly owed and fairly treated by NatWest save  for the issues  it 
has already acknowledged and apologised for. The debt was owed, and NatWest was 
entitled to take steps to recover what it was owed. And when asked for assistance  regarding 
the debt it isnt obliged to do what it is asked  to do. And as Ive said it did stop applying 
interest to the debt.
Mrs H has said that she hopes that one of the outcomes of this complaint is that NatWest  
gives more consideration to how it deals  with situations such as this. I think the industry  
broadly is becoming  more  thoughtful  about  how it deals with financial difficulties  and serious 
ill health. But as I think it acted fairly, I dont think NatWest needs  to do more.
For me to uphold a complaint I must find on balance of probabilities that a business has 
done something wrong. I can appreciate  in these terribly sad circumstances that Mrs H feels  
Ref: DRN71355843that NatWest could have done more. But that is not the test which  the rules that govern this 
service say we must apply. As a consequence of all of this I dont think  NatWest has to do 
anything more than it has already offered to do. So it should pay the £200  if it hasnt already 
done so. I appreciate this isnt the decision that Mrs H wants  to hear. But I think  that 
NatWests position  has made good for what happened here. Consequently, I do not uphold  
this complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I do not uphold the complaint against National Westminster 
Bank Plc.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs H to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 December 2019.
