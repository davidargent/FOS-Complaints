K822xcomplaint
Mr B has complained that Barclays Bank  UK PLC advised him in February 2003 to take out 
a decreasing term assurance (DTA)  policy providing  life and critical illness  cover  of £100,000 
over 25 years to protect a mortgage hed arranged on an interest-only repayment  basis.
When he moved and increased his borrowing  to £140,000 recently,  he asked to increase the 
level of cover under the policy from £100,000 and found it had reduced to approximately 
£70,000.
  
Barclays accepted  that Mr B should have been recommended  a level term assurance (LTA) 
policy in 2003  which would have cost him £49.20 per month. The DTA policy he was 
recommended cost him £33.60 per month. 
Accordingly, Barclays made Mr B an offer that would give him cover of at least  £100,000 to 
February 2028 at a monthly cost of £49.20  he would  have paid to a LTA policy that provided  
life and critical illness cover of £100,000 in February  2003. In order  to do so, Mr B would 
need to arrange a second policy that provided a minimum sum assured of £100,000 until 16 
February 2028 and Barclays  would pay him compensation that subsidised the monthly 
premium to this policy at £15.60 per month.  
In this way, Mr B pays total premiums of £49.20 for life cover and critical illness cover of at 
least £100,000  - the monthly premium he would  have  paid to a LTA policy  since 2003. Mr B 
wasnt required to pay the increased  premium of £49.20 per month retrospectively since 
February 2003.   
 
But Mr B says that, as Barclays  mis-sold the DTA policy to him, he shouldnt be asked to 
increase his monthly premiums at all to provide life and critical illness  cover  of £100,000 on 
the correct basis.
background 
I issued a provisional decision in September 2019  in which I thought  Barclays offer to 
resolve Mr Bs complaint didnt put him in the position he would have been in now had he 
been recommended  the correct policy in February  2003. 
Besides, I didnt think it was fair for Mr B to accept  the responsibility for arranging  a second 
policy on the open market. 
And, in any event, he couldnt replicate  the amount of cover  he ought  to have been 
recommended in February  2003 because hes since developed  a medical condition which 
meant he couldnt now be offered critical illness cover.
Also, Mr B increased his borrowing from £100,000 to £119,000 a short time after February 
2003 when the purchase of his first intended  property fell through  and he ought to have 
been advised to have  taken out a LTA policy for £119,000 over 25 years.
So, my view was that the only way Barclays  could  replicate the position  Mr B ought to have 
been in now is to provide an indemnity until February 2028  to make a capital payment to him 
that increases  to £119,000 any claim payment he, or his estate, might receive before 
16 February 2028 under his existing DTA policy. 
Ref: DRN77430072In return, Barclays should  be entitled  to deduct  from any such payment the difference  in 
monthly premiums Mr B would  have  been expected to pay to a LTA policy providing life 
cover, terminal illness and critical illness cover of £119,000 from 2003 and the premiums he 
will have actually paid to the DTA policy of £33.60 per month to the date of the claim. If Mr B 
makes no such  claim on his DTA policy by 16 February 2028,  Barclays  indemnity will end.
I also noted that Mr B had recently increased his borrowing to £140,000, this loan being  
repayable on a capital and interest basis 12 years later, in 2040.  
As such,  it was essential for him to appreciate that, even if we put him in the position of 
having been sold a LTA policy in 2003 providing life and critical illness cover of £119,000 
over 25 years, this policy could only guarantee sufficient  cover for his current borrowing if the 
outstanding balance of this loan reduces  to £119,000 and he claimed on the DTA policy 
before it expired in February 2028.  This decision couldnt accommodate  his increased 
borrowing as well some  15 years later.
I invited both Barclays and Mr B to comment on my provisional findings,  a copy  of which  is 
attached and forms part of this final decision.
 
developments
In response, Barclays said that, while it accepted that my proposal  to resolve Mr Bs 
complaint was suitable, its offer was appropriate  because:
Mr B confirmed  in a telephone conversation with Barclays when raising his complaint 
that he didnt want to increase his level of cover  above £100,000 even though he 
increased his borrowing  to £119,000 because he held savings he could use to cover  
the difference. So, it said any offer should  be based  on Mr B requiring total cover  of 
£100,000. It would send me a recording of this telephone call;
its original  offer to resolve Mr Bs complaint in May 2018 wasnt clearly explained. 
Barclays intention was to offer an indemnity  that would make-up the shortfall in 
critical illness cover Mr B could  no longer obtain.  It expected  him still to arrange a 
second policy to meet the shortfall in life cover. Barclays would then subsidise the 
total cost of all this cover  at £49.20  per month  - the premium Mr B would have been 
required to pay since February 2003  for a LTA providing life cover and critical illness 
cover of £100,000  over 25 years.
Mr B agreed with my provisional view. He did say that, when he increased his borrowing 
later in 2003, he was never asked by the adviser  whether  he wanted to increase  the level of 
cover under the policy to match his new borrowing. He found it surprising that Barclays 
should raise this issue after all this time.
findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have listened  to the recording  of the telephone conversation between  Barclays and Mr B 
when he first raised his complaint. Mr B did confirm that, when he increased his borrowing to 
£119,000 later in 2003, he was content  to leave the cover  under the DTA policy at £100,000 
because he did have  savings that could meet any shortfall in the event of a claim under the 
Ref: DRN77430073policy. As he was single, with no dependents, at the time, Im satisfied that Mr B would have 
been prepared  to use his savings in this way.  
In the circumstances, I think Mr B would  have accepted it was appropriate for Barclays to 
have recommended him a LTA policy providing life cover, terminal illness  benefit and critical 
illness cover  of £100,000 over 25 years in 2003. Accordingly, as this was the amount of 
cover he agreed to, even  when he increased his borrowing  to £119,000, Im inclined to 
decide that his complaint should  be resolved  as if he had intended to set up a LTA policy  in 
2003 providing cover of £100,000.
So, as neither Mr B nor Barclays has disagreed  in principle with the my provisional decision, 
I see no reason to change  my proposal to resolve Mr Bs complaint other than to base it on 
the assumption that he ought to have  taken out life cover, terminal  illness  benefit  and critical 
illness of £100,000 on a level basis in 2003.
In return, Mr B must  accept that he should  be prepared to pay the true cost of the policy he 
ought to have been recommended.  In other  words, I dont  think he can expect Barclays to 
provide such an increased  level of cover at no further cost than the £33.60 per month he 
was paying to the policy he complains  was insufficient for his needs.      
Mr B will also need  to appreciate that, when he extended the repayment term of his current  
borrowing by approximately 12 years, he didnt make further  provision to repay  the amount 
that would  be outstanding  on this loan after 16 February 2028. So, if he doesnt claim under 
the DTA policy before it expires, the ongoing  amount he owes his current lender until 2040 
will be unprotected unless  he makes future provision to cover that debt.
decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint. 
I require Barclays Bank  UK PLC to provide Mr B an indemnity  to increase any claim payment 
he receives from the DTA policy he took out in 2003 to £100,000,  whether due to death, 
terminal illness or critical illness as decided by Mr Bs current  policy provider when assessing 
his claim.  This indemnity  is conditional  on Mr B maintaining the DTA policy to its expiry  date.
Barclays should be entitled to deduct from the amount it pays under  this indemnity an 
amount equal  to the total shortfall in monthly premiums Mr B paid to his DTA policy  of 
£33.60 per month and the monthly premiums of £49.20 he would have been expected to pay 
to a 25-year LTA policy providing life cover, terminal illness and critical illness  cover of 
£100,000 in 2003 to the date of the claim. 
If Mr B makes no such  claim on his DTA policy by 16 February 2028, Barclays  indemnity will 
end. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 December  2019.

complaint
Mr B has complained that Barclays Bank UK PLC advised him in 2003  to take out a decreasing term 
assurance (DTA)  policy providing  life and critical  illness cover  of £100,000 to protect  a mortgage  hed 
arranged as an interest-only loan.
Barclays accepted that Mr B should have been recommended a level term assurance (LTA) policy  for 
a mortgage set up on this basis. Accordingly, it made him an offer to provide the level of cover he 
required on the correct  basis at a total premium going forward equal to the monthly premium he would 
have paid to a LTA policy from 2003. 
But Mr B doesnt accept  that he must increase his monthly premiums to provide cover on the correct  
basis.
background 
In January 2003, Mr B arranged an interest-only  mortgage of £100,000  over 25 years and was 
recommended by Barclays to take out a decreasing term assurance  (DTA) with another provider 
which offered  life cover,  terminal  illness benefit and critical illness cover of £100,000.
It seems the property purchase  didnt proceed and Mr B took out a larger loan of £119,000  to buy 
another property. But the policy he applied  for in February 2003 wasnt  changed to match his new 
borrowing - it was set up to provide a sum assured of £100,000  over 25 year at a monthly premium of 
£33.60. Barclays concluded that the DTA policy  was unsuitable  for Mr Bs mortgage,  but only in so far 
as the level of cover  it provided reduced over the term, whereas the amount outstanding  on the 
mortgage would remain at £100,000.
  
Barclays confirmed that a LTA policy providing  life cover, terminal illness benefits and critical  illness 
cover of £100,000 over 25 years would  have cost Mr B £49.20  per month in February  2003. So, it 
sought to put Mr B in the position he would be in now had he taken out such a policy at that time.
But Mr B had since developed a medical condition  and the policy provider  wasnt prepared to offer a 
policy that included  critical illness cover fixed at £100,000 for the remainder  of the policy term to 
February 2028.
So, Barclays  offered to cover any shortfall in the amount that would be payable from the DTA policy  
following a claim for critical  illness, terminal illness or death and the sum of £100,000 a LTA policy set 
up in February 2003 would have paid, subject  to:
Mr B maintaining  the original DTA policy until it expires on 16 February 2028;
Mr B taking out a second term assurance policy which provides a minimum  sum assured  of 
£100,000 until 16 February 2028, at the earliest, in addition to the reducing level of cover 
provided by the DTA policy he currently holds;
reimbursement of costs Mr B incurs in arranging the second policy;
Mr B receiving compensation for the difference between the monthly premiums he would 
have been  paying to a LTA policy since  2003 of £49.20 and the total monthly  premiums he 
will pay when  he takes out the second policy. In other words, Mr B will pay £15.60 towards  
the second policy  he arranges and Barclays pays the difference.
In addition, Barclays  will pay Mr B the sum of £150 for any inconvenience the time taken  to resolve  
his complaint will have caused him. 
Mr B rejected  this offer because he didnt feel he should pay any further premiums to enhance  
benefits under the DTA policy Barclays admitted had been mis-sold.
Ref: DRN77430075The complaint was considered by one of our investigators, who welcomed  Barclays offer to restore 
Mr B to the position he would  be in now had he taken out a LTA policy in 2003.  But he didnt  think it 
should be Mr Bs responsibility to arrange a new policy, or for him to pay the appropriate premium 
retrospectively.
The investigator thought that Barclays should arrange a new LTA policy as a replacement for his 
existing DTA policy, either through the original policy provider or via the open market, which 
provides life cover and critical illness cover for the remaining term to February 2028, to which 
Mr B should pay a premium of no more than £49.20 per month. Mr B should receive the excess 
monthly premiums he would need to pay from a temporary annuity or the capitalised value of an 
annuity paid to Mr B as a lump sum.
Barclays should also pay him £150 for the delays in investigating his complaint.  
In response, Barclays couldnt accept the investigators  proposals  because  it doesnt  have the facility 
to set up a new policy for Mr B, either in-house  or on the open market, and it couldnt  agree  
compensation without knowing the cost of a new policy.
Mr B didnt accept the investigators assessment either. As he now suffers a medical condition  that 
doesnt allow  him to obtain critical  illness  cover, he cant be returned to the position  he ought  to be in 
now but for the unsuitable  advice. In any event, if he had been  recommended a LTA policy  in 2003, 
he might have looked for a policy  with another insurer  at a cheaper premium of £49.20 per month.
Having considered  the responses for both sides,  the investigator decided Barclays original offer was 
fair and reasonable - Mr B should arrange a LTA policy for £100,000 to February  2028 on the open 
market and Barclays will subside the cost of this policy, and the DTA policy  he already holds, at 
£49.20 per month. In other  words, going forward, Mr B will pay just £15.60 for the new LTA policy.
As Mr B still doesnt  believe  he should  pay any further premium for the correct  level of cover on the 
appropriate basis, the complaint has been referred to me for review.
provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
There appears to be no disagreement between Barclays and Mr B that Mr B should  have been 
recommended to take out a level term assurance (LTA) policy in 2003,  providing life cover, terminal  
illness benefit and critical illness cover of £100,000 over 25 years.  Of course, this policy would only 
repay his mortgage if he died, became  terminally  ill or suffered a critical  illness before the mortgage 
was due to be repaid in February 2028.  I assume Mr B had made  provision  to repay  the capital loan if 
he hadnt claimed  on the LTA policy  by then.
Notwithstanding this, it seems  that Mr B increased  his borrowing to £119,000 a short time after 
February 2003 when the purchase of his first intended property fell through.  So, he ought to have 
been advised  to abandon his application for a DTA policy  for £100,000 in favour of a LTA policy for 
£119,000 over 25 years.
For this reason, I dont think the offer made by Barclays adequately compensates Mr B for the cost of 
the LTA policy he ought to have taken out. Neither  do I think its fair to expect him to find a LTA policy 
on the open market that will provide life cover, terminal  illness benefit  and critical illness cover of 
£100,000 to February  2028.  
Besides, given he already holds a DTA policy which  currently provides cover of around £70,000, this 
LTA policy would  give him too much total cover at all times albeit  that Barclays would be subsiding the 
total monthly premium at £49.20.  But Mr B says he cant now obtain critical  illness cover on the open 
Ref: DRN77430076market at all, and this seems  plausible given the original policy provider wouldnt now offer him critical  
illness cover  of £100,000 on a level basis.  
So, in my view,  Barclays offer to resolve Mr B s complaint doesnt return him to the position  he would 
have been in now had he received  appropriate advice in 2003. Given his current circumstances, the 
only way Barclays can do this is to provide an indemnity  until February 2028 to make a capital 
payment to Mr B that increases the claim  value  he, or his estate, receives before  16 February  2028 
under his existing DTA policy to £119,000. 
In return,  Barclays should be entitled to deduct from any such payment the difference in monthly 
premiums Mr B would  have been expected to pay to a LTA policy providing life cover,  terminal illness 
and critical  illness cover of £119,000 in 2003 and the premiums he will have actually paid to the DTA 
policy of £33.60  per month to the date of the claim. If Mr B makes no such claim on his DTA policy by 
16 February 2028, Barclays  indemnity will expire. 
I understand Mr B has recently re-mortgaged for 140,000,  this loan being repayable on a capital and 
interest basis 12 years  later in 2040. 
So, Mr B needed to bear in mind that, even  if we put him in the position  of having been sold a LTA 
policy in 2003 providing life and critical illness cover of £119,000 over 25 years, he cant  expect this 
policy to guarantee  sufficient  cover for his current borrowing until the outstanding  balance of this loan 
reduces to £119,000 and he has cause to claim  on the DTA policy before it expires in February 2028.
provisional decision
My provisional  decision  is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint.
I require  Barclays  Bank UK PLC to provide Mr B an indemnity to increase the claim value he receives 
from the DTA policy he took out in 2003 to £119,000, whether that is due to death, terminal illness or 
critical illness as decided by Mr Bs current policy provider when assessing his claim.
Barclays should be entitled  to deduct from the amount  it pays  under  the indemnity  an amount equal  to 
the total shortfall in monthly premiums Mr B paid to his DTA policy of £33.60 per month and the total 
premiums he would have been expected to pay to a 25-year LTA policy providing  life cover, terminal 
illness and critical illness cover of £119,000 in 2003 to the date of the claim. 
If Mr B makes no such claim on his DTA policy  by 16 February 2028,  Barclays indemnity  will end.
