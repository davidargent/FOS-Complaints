The complaint
Mr A complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he and his wife paid for some holiday club 
membership points. Hes being represented in his complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr A and his wife had bought a trial membership of a holiday club in March 2009 and they 
entered into an acquisition agreement to upgrade their membership in August 2009 by 
buying some membership points. The purchase price of the points was £15,334 and they 
traded in their trial membership which was given a value of £5,795 so the balance due from 
them was £9,539. Mr A entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance for a loan of £12,775 (which included consolidation of finance that had been taken 
out with another finance provider to fund the purchase of the trial membership). Mr A agreed 
to make 180 monthly repayments of £191.15 to Barclays Partner Finance. 
Mr A and his wife upgraded their membership again in May 2010 when they entered into 
another acquisition to buy some more membership points. The purchase price of those 
points was £7,459 and Mr As wife entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance for a loan of that amount. She agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of 
£112.18 to Barclays Partner Finance.
Mr As and his wifes representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in September 
2017 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that Mr A and his 
wife had relied on misrepresentations made by the holiday company and that those 
misrepresentations and other activities carried on during the sales process meant that there 
was an unfair relationship. Barclays Partner Finance said that Mr As claims were time-
barred under the Limitation act 1980 so it had no obligation to investigate his complaint. Mr A 
wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr As and his wifes complaint should be upheld. 
She thought that Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of their 
misrepresentation claim to turn it down. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest 
that the relationship between Mr A and his wife and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and 
she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was 
unfair. 
Mr As and his wifes representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It says that our investigators recommendations arent 
accepted and it has provided a generic submission from counsel in relation to the holiday 
company.
The August 2009 loan was made to Mr A and he is an eligible complainant to make a 
complaint relating to that loan agreement. The May 2010 loan was made to Mr As wife and 
she is an eligible complainant to make a complaint relating to that loan agreement. There are 
two separate complaints and in this decision Im only considering Mr As complaint about 
Barclays Partner Finance. Mr As wifes complaint about Barclays Partner Finance will be 
considered in a separate decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr As complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr As complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that hed 
made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to his 
claims;
Mr As claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr As claim under section 75 is that the membership points were misrepresented to 
him and his wife and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr A could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into buying the membership points in August 2009 as that was the latest time that 
any misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been 
incurred as that was when he also entered into the loan agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made 
to Barclays Partner Finance until September 2017, more than eight years later so 
was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act and I consider that his 
misrepresentation claim is now time-barred;Mr As representative says that Mr As claim is a speciality so he would have twelve 
years to bring his claim but I dont consider that his claim is a speciality and Im 
satisfied that the limitation period is six years as described above;
Mr As representative says that the misrepresentations and other activities carried on 
during the sales process meant that there was an unfair relationship and section 
140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay 
any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an 
unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner has provided an account statement which show that Mr As loan 
was repaid in March 2013, less than six years before his section 140A claim was 
made to Barclays Partner Finance so I dont consider that Mr As section 140A claim 
is time-barred;
Mr As representative has described what it says were the misrepresentations made 
by the holiday company, including that 
Mr A and his wife easily could divest themselves of the points by selling them, 
or renting out the rights purchased under it;
they could always recoup the cost of purchasing the points by selling them;
they would be able to holiday at any resort they wished in high season with 
accommodation of the same standard as they were enjoying when on holiday 
in August 2009; and
the annual management fees would only increase in line with inflation;
Mr A and his wife signed the acquisition agreement (which included its terms and 
conditions) and Ive seen nothing in those documents to show that Mr A and his wife 
were told that they would easily be able to sell their points, they would be able to 
holiday at any resort that they wished in high season or that the annual management 
fees would only increase in line with inflation;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
were misrepresented to Mr A and his wife by the holiday company in August 2009 or 
that they were induced into entering into the acquisition agreement by any 
misrepresentations;
if there had been misrepresentations by the holiday company at that time, I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect that Mr A and his wife wouldnt have then 
bought more membership points in May 2010;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr A and his wife were 
unduly pressurised into buying the membership points in August 2009, that Mr A was 
unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable sales practices against them  Ive seen no evidence to show that 
Mr L complained to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues until September 
2017 (more than eight years after the loan had been made to him) and I consider that 
it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained to Barclays Partner 
Finance about any such issues before then;
Mr A and his wife bought a trial membership in March 2009, then upgraded their 
membership in August 2009 when they bought some membership points and bought 
more membership points in May 2010  if they were concerned about the way that the membership points had been sold to them by the holiday company in August 
2009 I consider that it would be reasonable to expect that they wouldnt have then 
bought more membership points;
Mr As representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company but Im not persuaded that it shows that Mr As relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr As relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr A and Barclays 
Partner Finance in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance said that Mr As claims were time-barred under the 
Limitation Act so it had no obligation to investigate his complaint, so I cant say that 
its response to his claims was fair and reasonable  but if it had properly responded 
to his claims I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it not to have 
upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mr A for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
memberships, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr A any of the money that 
he paid under the loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 May 2023.
