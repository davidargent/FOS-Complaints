In our most recent review of this case our adjudicator upheld Mr Os complaint about loans 4 
onwards and thought these loans shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed as it felt the 
checks it carried out were proportionate, and that the loans were affordable for Mr O based 
on his declared income and expenditure at the time. So as Sunny disagreed the complaint 
has been passed to me to reach a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr O could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
 
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr O could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Os complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt think Mr Os complaint about loans 1  3 should be upheld. 
MrO appears to have accepted these findings, so as these loans are no longer in dispute, 
I havent considered these further. However, I have thought about all of Mr Os loans 
when looking at his overall lending relationship with Sunny.
Sunny says it carried out an affordability check before allowing Mr O to take out any of 
these loans  which involved it requesting information about Mr Os income and expenditure. 
But by the time Mr O was applying for his fourth loan, I think Sunny shouldve carried out a 
more thorough and proportional check of his financial situation - including a review of the 
lending history so far.
Had Sunny have completed a full check of Mr Os financial position it wouldve realised 
that Mr O had taken out three loans within the same month and was then applying for a 
fourth loan in the same month. So, his borrowing in the month of February 2018 was a total of £1000, and Mr O was earning £1516.67 per month at the time. This borrowing in quick 
succession suggests Mr O was having problems managing his money and may have had 
problems repaying his loans in a sustainable manor. Loan 4 was requested for £500, which 
was the largest amount so far. So, the amounts borrowed werent reducing and this 
suggests Mr O was getting further and further in debt. At the time of taking out loan 4 Mr Os 
combined monthly repayment was £395.40 and considering his monthly income and total 
monthly expenditure I think these loan repayments made up a significant portion of his 
monthly disposable income. And so, a properly carried our affordability assessment was 
likely to lead a responsible lender to conclude that it was unlikely Mr O wouldve been able to 
repay loan 4  or any subsequent loans. So, I dont think Sunny shouldve lent Mr O loans 4, 
5, 6 and 7 on this basis.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 4  7 as I dont think Sunny shouldve provided 
further loans from loan 4 onwards. Sunny should put things right.
putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr O paid on loans 4 - 7;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4, 5, 6 and 7 from Mr Os credit file;
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
my final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Os complaint. Elevate Credit International 
Limited should put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 July 2020.
