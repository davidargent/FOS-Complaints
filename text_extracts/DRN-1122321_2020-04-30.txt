The complaint
Mr C says that Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny.co.uk ("Sunny") lent 
money to him that he couldnt afford to repay.
What happened
This complaint is about 28 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr C between November 
2016 and January 2018. Each loan was due to be repaid over six monthly instalments 
although a number of the loans were repaid early. A summary of the loans is as follows:

Mr C said that when he first took out a loan with Sunny he was already struggling financially 
and had other short term loans outstanding. He said he was taking out new loans to repay 
existing debt and that his credit file showed he had been heavily indebted for many years. 
Sunny said that before each loan was provided it carried out eligibility, creditworthiness and 
affordability checks. It said that its checks showed the loan repayments were affordable for 
Mr C. It also said that C repaid some of his loans early and that when he made contact in 
2018 about his change in circumstances it froze the balance on his account and set up a 
payment arrangement.
Our adjudicator upheld this complaint in regard to loans six to 28. He didn't think he had 
enough evidence to say that the first five loans shouldn't have been provided but thought 
that by loan six Mr Cs overall pattern of borrowing suggested he had become persistently 
reliant on short-term loans. 
Sunny didn't agree with our adjudicators view and provided a counter offer to Mr C. Mr C 
didn't accept Sunnys offer and so this case has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to 
issue a decision.
What I've decided - and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We've set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr C could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and the 
consumer's income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Before the loans were provided information was gathered on Mr Cs income and expenses. 
Mr Cs declared monthly income was £2,550 for the duration of the loans and his expenses 
varied from just under £1,000 to £1,925. 
Our adjudicator didn't think he had enough evidence to say that the first five loans 
shouldn't have been provided and I agree with this. This was the early part of the lending 
relationship and I think the checks were proportionate. Based on the information provided, I 
don't think it unreasonable that Sunny considered these loans affordable. 
The sixth loan was taken out around a week after Mr C repaid the third, fourth and fifth 
loans. The repayment on this loan appeared affordable. But I've  also looked at the overall 
pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to seeing if there was a point at 
which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any 
further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan six. Mr C had taken out six loans in four months  at times overlapping with existing 
loans, and sometimes within days of paying off previous loans. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr C was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Cs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr C took out his next three loans before repaying his sixth loan and his total borrowing from 
Sunny wasn't showing a pattern of reduction. The frequency at which he was taking out new 
loans either days after repaying previous loans or while previous loans were outstanding 
suggested that Mr C was persistently reliant on short term borrowing. And this pattern of 
borrowing continued through the remainder of his borrowing relationship with Sunny. 
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 
six onwards because the loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time. I also think that the number of loans Mr C borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans six onwards.
Putting things right refund all the interest and charges Mr C paid on loans six to 28 (including payments 
made to a third party where applicable);
pay interest at 8% simple a year on all refunds of interest and charges from the date 
of payment to the date of settlement*;
the number of loans from loan six to 28 means that any information recorded about 
them is likely to be adverse. So all reference to these loans should be removed from 
Mr C's credit file.  
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I am partially upholding Mr C complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mr C compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 May 2020.
