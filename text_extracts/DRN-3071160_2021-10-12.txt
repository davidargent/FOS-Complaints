The complaint
Miss S complains that PayPal (Europe) S.a.r.l et Cie SCA (PayPal) didnt uphold her 
complaint leaving her out of pocket. She would like PayPal to refund the money for goods 
not returned, to review its seller protection policies and to investigate the actions of the 
buyer.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again here 
instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons: -
I appreciate Miss Ss frustrations, she says items she sent werent returned , but 
PayPal refunded the seller. So, she neither has the goods nor payment for them
Miss S has shown the package was delivered but the address isnt showing on the 
tracking information. But it seems likely it was delivered since. PayPal has shown 
goods with the same tracking number  were returned to the National Returns Centre 
where, it says, Miss S will need to collect them. Based on the evidence that the 
goods were returned I dont think it was unreasonable of PayPal to refund the buyer 
the payments made.
Miss S would like PayPal to review its seller protection and rights policies but its not 
for us to tell PayPal to do that. And in this case, I havent found PayPal to have done 
anything wrong.
Miss S has shared some correspondence sent to her by the seller which I appreciate 
must have caused her some distress. I understand PayPal had not been given the 
chance to investigate this but is now intending to do so which I think is the right 
course of action. But I think that is a separate issue. And it  doesnt change my view 
that there is evidence that the goods have been returned and so I think PayPals 
actions in refunding the seller were reasonable.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 November 2021.
