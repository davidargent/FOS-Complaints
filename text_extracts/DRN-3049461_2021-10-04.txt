The complaint
Ms B, through her representative, complains that Morses Club PLC, lent to her when she 
could not afford it. 
What happened
Using information from Morses here is a brief table of the approved loans. Both parties refer 
to a loan being approved before August 2013 but neither party has any information about it 
to send to us.

*2 June 2016 was the date on which these three loans were sold to a third party debt 
collector. That collector has confirmed that no payments have been received by it. 
In its final response letter (FRL), Morses agreed with Ms B in relation to loans 7 to 11 and 
set out its proposed resolution. In later correspondence with this Service it has explained 
that once the balance is repaid it will work with the third party to amend Ms Bs credit file. 
Ms B referred her complaint to this Service. One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint 
and thought that Morses planned resolution was in-line with our approach to complaints of 
this sort. She thought that Morses need not do more that what it had outlined in the FRL 
together with the credit file amendment. 
Neither party responded and so it was passed to me to finalise the complaint with a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms B 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. 
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should 
fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the 
consumer. 
These factors include:
having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting 
the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable);
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Morses was required to establish whether Ms B could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being the 
ability to repay without undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Bs complaint.
Ms B has sent to us nothing other than a Claim Audit Form. In it she gives me an idea why 
she feels it was wrong for Morses to give her loans. She says that she lost her job in 
December 2014, Morses knew and still lent to her. 
In its FRL Morses has agreed to uphold her complaint from December 2014 (loan 7). That 
may be coincidence but either way that seems to be a fair point at which to decided to 
recompense Ms B in relation to the lending.
And our approach to these types of complaints dovetails with what Morses has set out in its 
FRL that it will do to make things right for Ms B. So, I endorse that planned resolution by Morses, to include the credit file amendment. Ms Bs CMC can advise her on the 
practicalities and details. 
This FRL and its resolution was issued before the complaint was referred to this Service. 
And as such I do not uphold her complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I endorse Morses Club PLC resolution and I do not uphold Ms Bs 
complaint.. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 November 2021. Acceptance of this decision is acceptance of 
the Morses Club PLC resolution.
