K822xcomplaint
Mr K complains that NewDay Ltd didnt send him the vouchers he was due as part of his 
credit card reward  scheme.
background 
Mr K contacted NewDay in May and August 2018  to query why he was no longer being sent 
reward vouchers. 
NewDay discovered that a mistake  had been  made when Mr Ks account was upgraded at 
the end of 2016. They told Mr K the reward points he was due would be added  in October 
2018. When this didnt happen, Mr K made  a number  of calls to NewDay  to chase things up. 
NewDay replied to Mr K in December 2018. They said the reward  points Mr K was owed 
would be credited to his account. As compensation for what  had happened, NewDay  also 
agreed to add 2000 extra points and credit £30 to Mr Ks credit  card account. They said the 
vouchers Mr K was now due would be sent to him in January 2019.   
Our investigator looked into what had happened. She said that NewDay had made a mistake 
when Mr Ks account was upgraded,  and then given him wrong information. Taking into 
account the time hed spent resolving things,  she thought NewDay  should  pay Mr K an 
additional £100 in compensation.
NewDay have agreed with our investigators  findings. Mr K disagrees and has asked for an 
ombudsman to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its not in dispute  that NewDay made  a mistake when they upgraded Mr Ks account  at the 
end of 2016. As a result, Mr K didnt receive the points  and vouchers he should have under 
the reward scheme. So the key issue I need  to look at is what NewDay should do to put 
things right.
NewDay have credited Mr K with the points and vouchers he should have received since  the 
end of 2016. Theyve also added an extra 2000  points, which they say are worth  £20, and 
paid him £30 in compensation.  
I agree  with our investigator that New Day should  do more to compensate  Mr K. Due to their 
mistake, he wasnt receiving the rewards he was due for many months. And even once the 
problem was identified,  it took more than six months  for things  to be put right. As a result, 
Mr K had to spend a significant amount of time trying to resolve things. So I agree that 
NewDay should pay Mr K an additional  £100  on top of the compensation theyve already 
paid. 
Mr K thinks  NewDay should have to pay him significantly more  compensation because  the 
issue has taken so long to resolve. As Ive said, I agree  that it took too long for NewDay  to 
put things right. But Ive taken account of the fact that Mr K first contacted them  about the 
Ref: DRN35746192problem in May 2018, and of the compensation already paid. And overall, I think the 
compensation that our investigator  has proposed is fair and reasonable.
I realise this wont be the decision Mr K was hoping for, but I wont  be asking NewDay to do 
anything more.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold Mr Ks complaint against  
NewDay Ltd.  
NewDay Ltd should pay Mr K a further £100. This is in addition to the compensation theyve 
already paid.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 April 2019.
