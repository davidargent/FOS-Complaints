The complaint
Mr I complains that National Westminster Bank Plc closed his account and returned his 
funds to source. Hed like the funds returned and compensation for the impact. 
What happened
Mr I had an account with NatWest. 
In January 2022 NatWest received five fraud reports from third party banks regarding 
transactions totalling just over £3,000 into Mr Is account. On receipt of the first report, on 
18 January 2022, NatWest restricted Mr Is account access. 
On 21 January 2022 NatWest contacted Mr I to ask him what a payment for £550 was for on 
14 January 2022. They later made Mr I aware of two further fraud reports received, and 
asked him for details about the payments and any proof of entitlement Mr I had. Mr I 
explained he was carrying out private sales, hadnt asked for any identification and if hed 
been aware that fraud reports would be raised he wouldnt have proceeded. He informed 
NatWest he couldnt provide any evidence to support the sales.
On 4 February 2022 NatWest decided to close Mr Is account with immediate effect. Prior to 
releasing any of the funds NatWest asked Mr I to complete a funds released form, which he 
provided on 18 February 2022. 
Mr I complained to NatWest about their decision to close his account and their failure to 
release his funds. NatWest looked in Mr Is complaint, but generally thought theyd acted 
fairly. In summary, NatWest thought their actions were fair in restricting and closing Mr Is 
account and withholding the funds. They advised Mr I that theyd provide him with an update 
in 60 days regarding the status of his funds.  
Mr I brought his complaint to our service. He asked for his funds to be returned, plus interest 
and compensation. 
One of our investigators looked into Mr Is complaint, they asked NatWest for more details 
regarding their actions. NatWest confirmed that the majority of the funds in Mr Is account, 
minus the funds theyd received fraud reports for, were returned to Mr I on 22 July 2022. 
Our investigator asked Mr I for details of the transactions, including what they were for and 
any evidence he could provide. 
Mr I explained that he was selling cryptocurrency, but he wasnt able to provide any 
evidence of the sales including invoices or identification from the buyers because they were 
private sales. 
Our investigator thought that NatWest acted fairly in returning the funds to source, closing 
and restricting Mr Is account. But thought they should have returned his funds sooner  
namely on 18 February 2022 when NatWest received his funds release form. Our 
investigator recommended that NatWest pay Mr I £100 compensation and 8% interest on the 
funds returned to him from 18 February 2022 to 22 July 2022. 
NatWest accepted our investigators view but Mr I didnt. In summary he said:
What Terms and conditions did they rely on?
Is it being suggested he was lying?
He parted with an asset, and has currently lost both the asset and the payment
As Mr I didnt agree its been referred to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Account closure:
Ive firstly considered NatWests actions in closing Mr Is account
At times, following a review, banks sometimes choose to end their relationship with 
customers. This can be due to a number of reasons and a bank isnt obliged to give a reason 
to the customer. Just the same as if Mr I decided to stop banking with NatWest, he wouldnt 
have to explain why.
NatWest can only close accounts in certain circumstances and if its in the terms and 
conditions of the account. NatWest have relied on the terms and conditions when closing 
Mr Is account. The terms explain that in certain circumstances NatWest can close an 
account without notice, which they did in Mr Is case. I appreciate that Mr I will be 
disappointed by my conclusions, however Ive considered the full circumstances of this 
complaint and I agree NatWest were entitled to close his account without notice.  
Funds returned to source:
Ive moved on to consider NatWests decision to withhold Mr Is funds from 18 January 2022 
to 22 July 2022 and then return some of the funds to source. On 22 July 2022 part of Mr Is 
funds were released to him, with the remainder being returned to source. 
The terms and conditions of Mr Is account state that NatWest will return funds to source in 
certain circumstances, and if contacted by the sending bank to advise them a payment has 
been made to them incorrectly. Condition 8.3 states What well do if the payers bank tells us 
about an incorrect payment. The term states that NatWest will contact their customer to ask 
if the payment was sent to them incorrectly or not  which they did. And if the customer 
disputes that the payment was made incorrectly, which Mr I did, theyd return the money to 
their customers account. In Mr Is case despite Mr I claiming the transactions were genuine 
NatWest still returned the money to source. But, terms and conditions arent the only factor I 
need to consider here, Ill also need to take into account relevant legislation and good 
industry practice  in summary whats expected from NatWest when they receive contact 
from a sending bank reporting fraud. 
Good industry practice dictates that when the receiving bank is put on notice that their 
customer may have perpetrated an Authorised Push Payment scam, it should investigate 
whether their customer is involved and has received the funds fraudulently. If their customer 
can show otherwise and disputes the claim, the receiving bank is under no obligation to 
return the funds to the sending bank. It follows, I need to consider whether NatWest carried 
out an investigation and whether Mr I was given the chance to dispute the claims. Im satisfied NatWest did investigate, and Mr I was given the opportunity to put forward an 
explanation regarding the disputed funds. Mr I did provide an explanation to NatWest but he 
was unable to provide any evidence to support this. 
Our investigator also reached out to Mr I to ask him to provide an explanation and evidence 
for why he received the funds into his account. Mr I explained that due to an increase in the 
popularity of cryptocurrency he started selling it  and the transactions were for private sales 
hed made. However, he was unable to provide any supporting evidence for this  including 
cryptocurrency balances, evidence of the sales or conversations with the buyers. Im afraid 
this means Im unable to conclude that Mr I was in fact carrying out genuine cryptocurrency 
sales as he claims and wasnt complicit in any fraud which may have taken place. I 
appreciate this is disappointing to Mr I, but Im satisfied hes been provided with more than 
one opportunity to provide evidence to support his testimony, and without this I cant fairly 
conclude he made genuine cryptocurrency sales and lost out when the alleged fraudulent 
funds were returned to source. This means I wont be directing NatWest to reimburse Mr I 
the disputed funds. 
Our investigator did conclude that NatWest should have returned Mr Is legitimate funds 
much sooner than they did  on the day he sent back the funds release form. NatWest 
havent provided any explanation for why the funds werent released to Mr I sooner, so I see 
no reason to change this conclusion. And I think NatWest should pay Mr I 8% interest from 
18 February 2022 to 22 July 2022. The restriction of these funds caused Mr I inconvenience 
and distress, and I think £100 is fair compensation for the impact caused to him.  
Putting things right
I think NatWest should pay Mr I £100 compensation and 8% interest between 
18 February 2022 to 22 July 2022 on £6,549.55.
My final decision
My final decision is I direct National Westminster Bank Plc to:
Pay Mr I £100 compensation for the inconvenience caused to him
Pay Mr I 8% simple interest on £6,549.55 from 18 February 2022 to 22 July 2022
HM Revenue & Customs require National Westminster Bank Plc to withhold income tax from 
the abovementioned interest. National Westminster Bank Plc should give Mr I a certificate 
showing how much is taken off if he asks for one. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2023.
