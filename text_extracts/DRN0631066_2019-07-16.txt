Mr G says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.  Mr G also 
says QuickQuid took a payment earlier than agreed and wrongly told him hed have to pay 
for a subject access request (SAR).
background 
I sent both parties  my provisional  decision on 27 June 2019   a copy is attached  and it forms 
part of this final decision. I explained why I thought  the complaint should be upheld  in part 
and asked QuickQuid  and Mr G to let me know if they had anything  to add.
QuickQuid accepted my proposed outcome. Mr G didnt; he thought loans 4 and 5 were lent 
irresponsibly too  although he hasnt sent me any further evidence to consider before the 
deadline.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand why Mr G doesnt agree  loans  4 and 5 were not lent irresponsibly. But with no 
new evidence to consider, Im not persuaded I should depart from my provisional findings.  
Ill summarise  my findings on loans 4 and 5 again   this is now the only part of the complaint 
still in dispute.
Although QuickQuid has provided only limited evidence  for the results  of the credit checks  it 
carried out for loans  4 and 5, the information it has provided suggested  Mr G had a low level 
of indebtedness  when he took out these loans.
In addition to this, as I said in my provisional decision:
There was a significant break of about two years between loans 3 and 4 and a gap of 
four months between  loans 4 and 5. So overall,  theres less evidence of the loans in 
the second chain of lending being unsustainable,  or of Mr G being  dependent  on 
them.
Mr G declared  very low monthly expenditure when he took out loans 4 and 5. And his 
income had increased significantly since loan 3. So theres limited evidence  to 
suggest the loans in the second  chain  of lending were unaffordable,  as Mr G says.
Ref: DRN06310662This means  that I still think proportionate  checks wouldve suggested loans 4 and 5 were 
affordable to Mr G. So, for the same reasons as given in my provisional decision, Im not 
upholding the complaint  about these loans. 
I am upholding  the complaint about loans 2c and 3, again for the same reasons as given in 
my provisional decision.
putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 2c and 3, adding interest at 8% 
simple per year,  from when Mr G paid the interest and charges (if he did) until the 
date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  loans 2c and 3 from Mr Gs credit history
pay Mr G £100,  as it has offered
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mr G a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Gs complaint in part. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 August 2019.

complaint
Mr G says CashEuroNet UK LLC,  trading  as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.  Mr G also says 
QuickQuid took a payment earlier than agreed and wrongly told him hed have to pay for a subject  
access request  (SAR).
background
Mr G had five loans with QuickQuid  Ive included a table at the end of this decision  setting out some 
of the information QuickQuid has provided  about  these  loans.
An adjudicator considered this complaint and recommended it be upheld in part. She thought 
QuickQuid was wrong to have approved  loans 2c, 3 and 4b to 5c. QuickQuid didnt agree  but did offer 
to refund the interest and charges on loan 3. Mr G didnt  accept this offer. 
In respect of the problems Mr G had when QuickQuid took a repayment  on the wrong  date and then 
later asked him to pay for a SAR  QuickQuid offered £100 for the distress and inconvenience 
caused. Mr G accepted that, so I consider  these matters  to be resolved.
As no agreement was reached in respect of alleged irresponsible lending, the complaint was passed 
to me to decide.  I wont be considering loan 3, as QuickQuid has made  a fair offer in respect of that 
loan. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr G could repay  the loans  
in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN06310664Having considered  everything, I dont currently think loans 1 to 2b were lent irresponsibly.  These 
loans were for relatively modest amounts compared to Mr Gs declared income and didnt follow  on 
from a long period of lending or following other indications of financial difficulty.
But I do have concerns about how many times Mr G topped-up  loan 2. The loan was initially for just 
£100 but this was increased to £300 within  30 days. This meant  the largest repayment amount after 
loan 2c was approved was £360  about 45% of Mr Gs declared income. I note that Mr Gs income  at 
this time was relatively modest,  at around £800 per month. 
I dont think such a large repayment wouldve likely been sustainably affordable for Mr G  particularly 
when bearing in mind  hed also have to make  an initial  interest payment of £51 earlier  in the same 
month. That the loan (after top-up 2c) was always likely to be unaffordable is borne out by what 
happened  Mr G does  appear to have struggled to repay the loan  and ultimately repaid  it about  six 
months late.
Ive taken into account that loan 2c may have been due over two pay periods. But I dont think it was 
reasonable for QuickQuid  to assume (if it did) that Mr G was in a position  to put money aside to make 
the large final payment,  bearing in mind how often he was topping-up  his loan. Im therefore planning 
to uphold the complaint about loan 2c.
Ive looked at loan 4 in much  the same  way. But Im not currently planning to uphold the complaint 
about loan 4 and the associated top-ups (4a-4c). Ill explain why.
There was a significant break  of about two years between loans 3 and 4. Mr Gs declared  net monthly 
income increased from £800 to £1,346 in this time. QuickQuid also started  obtaining information from 
Mr G about  his monthly expenditure. Mr G declared total expenditure of £275 a month and said he 
had no other  credit commitments. 
QuickQuid says its credit check verified that Mr G had no other credit  commitments but hasnt 
provided any credit report data to support  this. However,  as this aligns  with what Mr G said,  I see no 
reason to not accept what QuickQuid is saying in this instance.
This all means that Mr G told QuickQuid his monthly expenditure was quite low and that he had 
around £1,000 a month in disposable income and had little or no other debt.  Given  the long break  in 
the lending since loan 3 and Mr Gs significantly  increased  income, I dont think it wouldve been 
wrong for QuickQuid to think Mr Gs circumstances  may have improved  since it last lent to him. And 
the income and expenditure information Mr G provided suggested loans 4-4c were  all affordable.  Im 
therefore not planning to uphold the complaint about  loans  4-4c.
There was then a gap of around four months until Mr G took loan 5. I note that loan 4 was repaid  two 
months later than originally scheduled. It seems  Mr G extended loan 4 twice.
QuickQuid again asked Mr G about his expenditure  when he asked for loan 5. He reported increased 
monthly expenditure of £375. The £100 increase  related to a £50 increase in housing costs  and £50 
for credit commitments, rather than zero.
This time QuickQuids credit  checks  resulted  in a figure for credit commitments of £130  which  didnt 
align with what Mr G had said. Ive thought about whether this shouldve  caused QuickQuid to carry 
out further checks. But Ive seen no evidence  Mr G was significantly  indebted at this time  so its not 
clear to me that further checks  into his credit commitments wouldve made  a significant  difference. 
And I dont think it wouldve  been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask Mr G for proof of his income and 
expenditure.
Ref: DRN06310665In saying  the above Ive taken into account that Mr G had pervious  repayment problems  (before loan 
4) and extended the term of loan 4 by two months. But as Ive noted  above,  there was a long break  in 
the lending after loan 3  so loan 5 was really only the second loan in a new chain  of lending. And I 
dont think Mr G extending  loan 4 automatically represents the sort of serious financial difficulty which 
shouldve prompted  QuickQuid to carry out very detailed income and expenditure checks.
All this means that I dont think proportionate checks wouldve suggested loan 5 was unaffordable. 
And I also dont think the pattern of up to the point of loan 5 demonstrated that the lending  had 
become unsustainable.  So Im not planning to uphold  the complaint about loan 5 or the top-ups.
In summary, this means I plan to tell QuickQuid to refund  the interest and charges  Mr G paid on loan 
2c, as well as loan 3 (as it has offered).  I also plan to tell QuickQuid to pay the £100 it has separately 
agreed with Mr G.
putting things  right
I plan to tell QuickQuid  to:
refund the interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 2c and 3, adding interest at 8% simple  per 
year, from when Mr G paid the interest and charges (if he did) until the date of settlement
remove any adverse  information about loans 2c and 3 from Mr Gs credit history
pay Mr G £100, as it has offered
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mr G a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN06310666Appendix  loan table  and notes
Mr Gs third loan was a FlexCredit  facility. This allowed Mr G to make drawdowns up to a fixed  limit 
and then repay  them  in up to ten monthly payments. The other loans  were payday loans, repayable in 
between one and three payments. Where there is more  than one payment, the final payment was for 
interest and principal and the other payments  for interest  only.
