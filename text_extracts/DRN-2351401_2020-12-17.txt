The complaint
Mr A has complained that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) say that he owes them 
£2,450. He disputes this.
What happened
In January 2020, Mr A bought a service from a supplier for £2,450. His credit card account 
was debited through PayPal. He was unhappy with the service and complained to the 
supplier, who at first declined to refund the amount paid. Because of this, Mr A asked for a 
refund from his credit card company using the chargeback process. In line with this process, 
£2,450 was credited to his card account on 13 February 2020. The supplier then agreed to a 
refund and credited the credit card account with that amount. 
Mr A told the credit card company what had happened. So, his card account was then 
debited with £2,450 on 27 February 2020. PayPal told Mr A in May 2020 that he had 
received two credits and debited his PayPal account with £2,450. This left a balance of 
£2,450 owed to PayPal. Mr A got in touch with PayPal to explain the situation. He sent them 
his card statement and a letter from the card company. PayPal instructed a debt collection 
agency to recover the debt.
Mr A complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service on 24 June 2020. He said he had 
only received one refund. He did not agree that he owed PayPal anything further. He later 
advised that he was being pursued by debt collectors for the amount which was distressing.
PayPal said that they had not had the refund from the credit card company. They believed 
that Mr A had had two refunds. They had therefore debited his PayPal account with the 
relevant amount.
Our investigator looked into this and said she was satisfied that Mr A had only received one 
refund of £2,450. The credit card company had made a refund. which was then taken back 
after the supplier refunded Mr A, leaving him with the one refund. If PayPal are owed money 
by the credit card company, they should pursue them for the amount, not Mr A. She said that 
PayPal should put things right. They should instruct the debt collection agency to stop 
pursuing Mr A for the debt and remove the charge from his PayPal account. Any negative 
information reported to credit reference agencies should be removed. She said that PayPal 
should apologise and pay compensation of £150 to Mr A for the stress and inconvenience 
caused.
PayPal disagreed with the view of the investigator and asked that the case be reviewed by 
an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr A provided copies of his credit card statement dated 7 March 2020. This showed:
a credit of £2,450 on 13 February 2020 with the description disputed charge. 
a credit of £2,450 on 19 February 2020 from PayPal, this being a refund from the 
supplier of the service. 
a debit of £2,450 on 27 February 2020 with the description debit adjustment. This 
was the reversal of the chargeback.
The statements also show the relevant adjustments and impact of these transactions on his 
balance. Mr A also provided a copy of a letter from the credit card company which said that a 
credit of £2,450 had been applied to his account relating to the disputed transaction. And as 
the supplier had now made a refund, the credit would be reversed.
Mr A also showed us an email from the credit card company which said that it refunded the 
money to PayPal on 25 February 2020. So overall here, Im satisfied that Mr A has only 
received one refund of £2,450.
This means its difficult for me to see on what basis PayPal is trying to fairly recover this 
money from Mr A. I can see that PayPal were given copies of the credit card statements and 
letter. They have said that they have not received a refund of the money from the card 
company. They therefore argue that Mr A is liable for the debt. But, Mr A has acted in good 
faith throughout this dispute and fairly demonstrated that he has done all he can to put this 
matter right himself  trying to make sure that hes not keeping any money hes not entitled 
to.
So I think Mr A has done enough here to show that he it wouldnt be fair to hold him liable for 
any money that PayPal thinks it is owed. I dont see that the fact that PayPal have not had 
the money back from the credit card company should mean that Mr A must pay it. So I dont 
think its fair that PayPal should ask him to pay £2,450 to them. 
I realise that PayPal say that they are now owed £2,450. That may well be the case, but my 
role here is to determine whats fair and reasonable in the individual circumstances of a 
complaint and, having done so here, I dont think its reasonable for them to seek repayment 
of any outstanding amount from Mr A. It may be that this is a matter better dealt with by 
PayPal and the credit card company, but it is for them to decide how to pursue this further.
Putting things right
To put things right, PayPal should instruct the debt collection agency to stop pursuing Mr A 
for the debt. They should remove the debt from Mr As PayPal account and if any interest 
and charges have been applied, they should be removed. If PayPal have reported any 
adverse information to credit reference agencies, this should be removed.
This debt has been hanging over Mr A since May 2020. A debt collection agency has been 
writing to him and that must have been confusing and frustrating for him here. So I think 
PayPal should also apologise to Mr A for their error and stress and inconvenience caused. I 
agree with our investigator that £150 is fair in the circumstances here.My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
Instruct the debt collection agency to stop pursuing Mr A
Remove the debt from Mr As PayPal account
Refund any interest and charges debited to Mr As PayPal account, plus any pending 
interest and charges due to be charged as a result of the debit balance
Remove any adverse information reported to credit reference agencies
Apologise to Mr A and pay compensation of £150
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 January 2021.
