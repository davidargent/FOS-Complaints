The complaint
Ms S complains Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to her 
irresponsibly.
What happened
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be partially upheld, from loan 4. But Sunny 
disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. The complaint was then passed to me. 
I issued my provisional decision saying that Mr Ks complaint should be partly upheld, but 
from a different point  loan 10. A copy of the background to the complaint and my 
provisional findings follow this and forms part of this final decision:
What I said in my provisional decision
Ms S took 22 loans with Sunny between June 2018 and June 2019. Ive included some of 
the information weve received about the first 10 loans in the table below. 
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments AmountHighest 
Repayment
1 11/06/2018 17/09/2018 6 £150 £41.88
2 04/07/2018 13/09/2018 6 £100 £70.84
3 12/07/2018 10/11/2018 6 £150 £116.16
4 30/07/2018 15/08/2018 6 £50 £130.85
5 24/08/2018 17/09/2018 6 £100 £146.16
6 13/09/2018 19/12/2018 6 £100 £145.95
7 17/09/2018 10/11/2018 6 £150 £120.32
8 26/09/2018 10/10/2018 6 £50 £136.26
9 10/10/2018 29/01/2019 6 £50 £136.26
10 10/11/2018 27/03/2019 6 £200 £106.79
 Subsequently loans 11 to 22 were taken between 13 November 2018 and 29 June 2019 and 
these ranged between £50 and £200. Many of the loans overlapped. When the complaint 
was referred to this Service loans 15, 20, 21 and 22 had an outstanding balance. 
Our adjudicator thought that loans 4 to 22 shouldnt have been given to Ms S. Sunny 
disagreed with the adjudicator but has told us that it accepts it shouldnt have given Ms S 
loans 10 to 22. It says it will therefore pay Ms S a refund of the interest paid for loans 10 to 
14 and loans 16 to 19 less Ms Ss outstanding principal for loans 15, 20, 21 and 22, plus 
compensatory interest. Sunny says it will also remove loans 10 to 22 from   Ms Ss credit file.
Ms S hasnt accepted this offer, so the complaint has now been referred to me. 
What Ive provisional decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny had to assess Ms Ss applications for borrowing to check if she could afford to pay 
back the amounts shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way 
which was proportionate to the circumstances. Sunnys checks could have taken into 
account a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the 
repayments, and Ms Ss income and expenditure. With this in mind, I think in the early 
stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been proportionate.
But certain factors might suggest Sunny should have done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Ms S. These factors include:
Ms S having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ms S having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms S coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms S.
Sunny was required to establish whether Ms S could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Ms S was able to repay her 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. The FCAs 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) states payments are sustainable if they are made 
without undue difficulties and in particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought 
reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those repayments are 
unsustainable.Ive considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Ms Ss complaint. 
Our adjudicator thought Sunny should have realised that Ms S would have struggled to 
repay loan 4 sustainably because her first three loans hadnt yet been repaid. Sunny 
disagreed. It said that it allows customers to take out up to four loans at any one time and 
that this offers borrowers flexibility.  
Looking at Ms Ss borrowing history, I dont think Sunny would necessarily have had reason 
to think she wasnt able to repay her loans sustainably at the point she applied for loan 4. Ill 
explain why.
Loan 4 was the fourth occasion in seven weeks that Sunny provided a loan to Ms S. The 
loans varied and were modest in relation to Ms Ss declared income. There doesnt appear 
to have been any pattern in the timing of the loans. And Ms Ss declared expenditure 
indicated the loans would be affordable for her. Ive also not seen anything in Sunnys credit 
checks which would have suggested any cause for concern or anything to automatically 
uphold the complaint. 
Ms S has said that she does have a CCJ. So understandably she might think this could have 
affected Sunnys lending decision. However, checks obtained by lenders vary in their extent. 
And the content of a check may differ to the information a consumer can see if they obtain 
their own report. In this case, the information provided by Sunny doesnt show that it was 
aware of a CCJ. Ms S may wish to obtain a copy of her credit file if she would like to find out 
more information about the CCJ she has told us about. All I can really say here is that 
Sunnys credit checks didnt reveal a CCJ, so it wasnt necessary for Sunny to consider 
whether a CCJ would affect its decision to lend.  
Overall, I dont think the circumstances at the point of loan 4 should have given Sunny 
sufficient concern to decline the loan, or to consider lending further loans.
Ms S continued to borrow from Sunny, taking a further five loans in under 2 months. These 
loans ranged between £50 and £150. And some of these loans were taken out the same day 
that previous lending had been repaid. I think these circumstances could suggest that Ms Ss 
financial position may have been deteriorating and, possibly, that she was developing a 
reliance on short-term loans. But I dont think the pattern of lending was sufficiently strong at 
this stage for Sunny not to have lent, so I dont think it was wrong for Sunny to have given 
loans 1-9.
I agree with our adjudicator however that by loan 10 the loan history and loan pattern 
indicated that the lending was likely unsustainable for Ms S. Ms S had taken 10 loans in 
around 5 months and on four occasions she had borrowed again on the same day that 
previous lending had been repaid. Sunny has also agreed that it shouldnt have lent loan 10 
and any subsequent loan. So there is no longer a dispute about these loans. 
Sunny has told us it will therefore pay Ms S a refund of the interest paid for loans 10 to 14 
and loans 16 to 19, less Ms Ss outstanding principal for loans 15, 20, 21 and 22, plus 
compensatory interest. Sunny says it will also remove loans 10 to 22 from Ms Ss credit file. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Ms S accepted the provisional decision and Sunny didnt respond with any further comments 
or evidence it wanted me to consider. So, I see no reason to depart from the findings that I 
previously outlined in my provisional decision. 
So, in summary, I still think Sunny was wrong to have provided Ms S with loans 10  22. Ive 
explained below what Sunny needs to do to put things right.
Putting things right
Sunny shouldnt have given Ms S loans 10 to 22, so its not right that she should have had to 
pay interest, fees or charges on these loans, or have them affect her credit file in a negative 
way. So to put things right I intend to direct Sunny to: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Ms S towards interest, fees and 
charges on these loans. 
B) Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms S which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms S originally made the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled. 
C) Remove all outstanding interest, fees and charges from any outstanding balance Ms S 
still has, and apply the amounts calculated in A and B to repay this balance, paying the 
difference to Ms S. 
D) The overall pattern of borrowing for loans 10 to 22 means any information recorded about 
them is adverse, so these should be removed entirely from Ms Ss credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Ms S a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
If after carrying out the above, Ms S still has an outstanding balance with Sunny then they 
should try and come to a mutually agreeable repayment plan. But Id remind Sunny of its 
obligation to treat Ms S fairly. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I partly uphold Ms Ss complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2020.
