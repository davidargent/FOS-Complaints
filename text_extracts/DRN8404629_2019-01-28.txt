K820x#14complaint
Mr K complains National Westminster Bank  Plc (NatWest) will not refund  money  which he 
says an ATM failed to dispense.
background
On 29th March  2018, Mr K says he attempted to withdraw £250 from a local ATM.  The 
money did not dispense, so he attempted the transaction again.  Mr K says the second 
transaction also failed  to dispense.
When he complained  about this to NatWest, it looked into the ATM in question and in 
particular, looked  at whether there  been  any other  reported faults or whether the machine 
had balanced  on 29th March 2018.
The ATM operator reported back that there  had not been any other reported faults and that 
the machine had in fact balanced.  There were no surplus funds.
Based on this information, NatWest declined Mr Ks complaint.  So,  he came to this service.
Our adjudicator did not think he could ask NatWest  to do anymore  either.  He  explained  this 
to Mr K  but Mr K asked for an ombudsmans decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint  but based on what I have seen, I cannot 
fairly ask NatWest to refund Mr Ks money.
In fact, the adjudicator has already explained  the position clearly  and I dont think there is 
much more I could add.
The documentary evidence shows that the money did dispense  on both occasions.  And in 
the absence of any reported  faults  or indeed a surplus of £500  in the ATM on that day - its 
difficult to see how I can uphold this complaint.
On the basis of the evidence which I have seen, I think it is more likely that the cash did 
dispense on 29th March.
In the circumstances, I wont be asking NatWest to do anymore here.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 February  2019.
