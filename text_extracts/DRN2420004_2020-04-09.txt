K821x#15complaint
Mr K (by way of representative)  says Elevate  Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny) 
shouldnt have provided him with instalment loans as they were  not affordable. And Sunny 
did not take reasonable steps  to ascertain this. Mr K reports  being in a debt spiral where no 
sooner had he repaid a loan, Sunny offered him another. 
Mr K is represented by a third party. 
background
Mr K took out a Running Credit Facility  along with seven instalment loans from Sunny 
between July 2014 and July 2016.  Based on the information provided to us by Sunny,  a brief

In our adjudicators most recent findings,  he didnt think the business had done  anything 
wrong when it provided Mr Ks Running Credit Facility and loans 1-5. The adjudicator did 
think Sunny  should  not have provided  Loans 6 and 7. 
Mr K, through his representative,  has not informed us as to whether he agrees or disagrees  
with the adjudicators assessments. Sunny hasnt responded. No agreement  has been 
reached, and the case has been  passed  to me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to reasonably 
conclude Mr K could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner.
Ref: DRN24200042These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint.
Mr K hasnt said whether  he disagrees with our adjudicators opinion  about his Running  
Account Facility.  Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about this 
facility. So I wont be making  a finding  about  it. And there is a gap in the lending  and I have  
treated Loan 1 as the start of a fresh  loan chain. 
Mr K took out his first instalment loan (loan 1) around seven  months after repaying his 
facility. Sunny says it enquired about  Mr Ks income and all expenses, including  any short-
term lending commitments  and it also used information from Credit  Reference Agencies
(CRAs). And it was satisfied based on what it saw that Mr K would be in a position to be able 
to afford all of his loans.
Whilst I havent seen  anything from the information  Mr K has provided which makes me think 
Sunny was wrong to provide loans 1 to 5, this is not the case for loans 6 and 7. I say this 
because by loan 6, Mr K had two loans still outstanding with Sunny. And it looks  as though 
Loan 6 was taken by Mr K to repay loan 1. Borrowing to repay  borrowing is a sign of 
unsustainable lending  and ought to have prompted  additional checks. 
And I think proportionate  checks would have  shown that Mr K was borrowing  from another  
short term lender.  On top of this, Mr Ks borrowing  history showed a pattern where he was 
taking out a loan as soon  as he repaid one - all on the same  day.  By loan 6, Mr K had done  
this on three  occasions.   In my opinion, this shows he was not making any headway  in his 
need for financial assistance and he was likely having difficulties meeting his commitments  
without the need to keep  borrowing  increasing  amounts. 
In these circumstances, I dont think Sunny couldve reasonably believed  that Mr K would've 
been able to repay loan 6 or any further loans without undue difficulty or without the need  to 
borrow again.
Ref: DRN24200043So Im upholding  Mr Ks complaint about  loans 6 and 7. Sunny should put things right as 
detailed below.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans 6 and 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative payment information about loans 6 and 7 from Mr Ks credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr K a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I uphold Mr Ks complaint in part. Elevate Credit  International 
Limited, trading  as Sunny,  should  put things right for Mr K as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 May 2020.
