Complaint
Miss F has complained about a logbook loan CarCashPoint Limited (CarCashPoint) 
provided to her. She says the loan was unaffordable.
Background
One of our adjudicators reviewed what Miss F and CarCashPoint had told us. And he 
thought that CarCashPoint hadnt done anything wrong or treated her unfairly. So he didnt 
uphold Miss Fs complaint. Miss F disagreed and asked for an ombudsman to look at her 
complaint.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Miss Fs complaint.
CarCashPoint needed to make sure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this 
means is CarCashPoint needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Miss F could afford to repay before providing this loan. Our website sets out what 
we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks were proportionate. 
Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less thorough  in terms of 
how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
CarCashPoint provided Miss F with a logbook loan for £700 in September 2018. The loan 
had an APR of 398.76% and was to due be repaid in 104 weekly instalments of £22.89, 
which meant the total amount to be repaid was £2,380.56. CarCashPoint says it agreed to 
Miss Fs application after she provided details of her monthly income and expenditure. It 
says it cross-checked this against payslip and information from Miss Fs bank statments. 
The information Miss F provided about her income and expenditure showed shed be able to 
make the repayments she was committing to. CarCashPoint says, in these circumstances it 
was reasonable to lend to Miss F. 
On the other hand, Miss F has said she couldnt afford the loan. Ive carefully thought about 
what Miss F and CarCashPoint have said. The first thing for me to say is that this was     
Miss Fs first loan with CarCashPoint. The information provided suggests Miss F was asked 
to provide details of her income and expenditure. 
CarCashPoint did take steps to verify what it was told and it looks like it asked Miss F to 
provide bank statements, which she provided screenshots of. Bearing in mind the amount of 
the repayments, and Miss Fs lack of any previous lending with CarCashPoint, I dont think it 
was unreasonable for CarCashPoint to proceed on the basis of the information it obtained  
especially as there wasnt anything immediately obvious in the screenshotted bank 
statements to suggest that Miss F wouldnt be able to make the payments she was 
committing to. 
I accept Miss Fs actual circumstances at the time might have been worse than she let on. I 
know that she had to leave her job. But the key here is that its only fair and reasonable for 
me to uphold a complaint in circumstances where a lender did something wrong. 
In this case, I dont think that CarCashPoint did anything wrong in deciding to lend to Miss F 
- it obtained enough information to be able to make an informed decision on whether to 
provide this loan, but the information it was provided with might not have told the whole 
story. Nonetheless CarCashPoint reasonably relied on this information and given the amount 
of the repayments involved and its lack of history with Miss F, I dont think it was 
unreasonable for CarCashPoint to provide this loan.
Ive also seen what Miss F has said about being pressured into taking this loan. I accept that 
its possible that Miss F may have felt pressured by her overall financial situation. But as she 
approached CarCashPoint for this loan in the first place, I cant reasonably make the finding 
that it pressured her in to taking a loan she had no intention of taking out.
So overall I cant say that CarCashPoint has acted unfairly towards Miss F given all the 
circumstances and Im not upholding this complaint. I appreciate this will be very 
disappointing for Miss F. But I hope shell understand the reasons for my decision and that 
shell at least feel her concerns have been listened to. Although Im not upholding this 
complaint, Id like remind CarCashPoint of its obligation to exercise forbearance if it collects 
any outstanding payments remaining and its the case that Miss F is experiencing financial 
difficulty.
My final decision
My final decision is that Im not upholding Miss Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss F to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2021.
