The complaint
Miss S complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA didnt refund a payment to her after it 
said it would. She says this issue has caused her a lot of distress and inconvenience.  
What happened
Miss S had purchased an item using her PayPal account in May 2020.  She contacted 
PayPal about this and also raised the issue of the costs shed incurred for returning it. 
PayPal looked into her claim and sent an emailing agreeing to reimburse the shipping costs. 
The email said, 
We have carefully reviewed your return shipping cost refund request and though your claim 
has NOT met the minimum requirements we have elected to approve claim on an exception 
basis.

Your request refund of £8.18 for your return shipping costs will be deposited directly to your 
PayPal account balance within 5 working days from today
Miss S said after waiting the allotted time there was no sign of the refund. So, she contacted 
PayPal again to see when she could get hold of her refund. After contacting PayPal, a 
number of times, Miss S raised a formal complaint with it in September 2020. Miss S later 
came to us.
One of our investigators looked into the complaint and upheld it. He said the available 
evidence showed PayPal had agreed to refund Miss S and without proof to show it had paid 
her, it should reimburse her now. He also recognised Miss S had been put to significant 
distress and inconvenience in pursuing the matter and recommended it give her £100.
Miss S accepted the investigators conclusions. But PayPal didnt. It said, it hadnt had the 
correct account details from us to locate Miss Ss complaint. It had wanted her name as it 
appeared on her PayPal account, the email address linked to the PayPal account and details 
about the transaction, such as, the transaction ID. 
Our investigator went back to PayPal and explained that the first two bits of information had 
been given to PayPal some time ago. And it had written to us in January 2021 to say that it 
had located Miss Ss account. PayPal acknowledged this but said there was still no record of 
Miss S ever having raised this issue as a complaint with it. And it wanted the opportunity to 
resolve this directly with her. It referred to our complaint handling rules. Ultimately our 
investigator didnt change his mind. He felt PayPal had already had enough information and 
time to resolve the matter. 
PayPal later reviewed what our investigator said and offered to refund £8.18.  But it didnt 
agree to the additional compensation. Miss S didnt think this was fair. She felt strongly that 
the trouble and upset she had experienced warranted compensation.
The case was passed to me. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im satisfied Miss S raised her complaint directly with PayPal on 26 September 2020. Ive 
seen the screen shot of her complaint to PayPal in which she gave her name, email address 
and a description of what the complaint was about.  Theres was a reference number and 
her mobile number if PayPal needed to clarify any of the information shed provided. So, its 
somewhat surprising PayPal couldnt trace the complaint. While this particular point is only 
an observation and does not form part of my overall findings, I thought it would be helpful to 
highlight when Miss S complained.
Given PayPals email to Miss S (noted above) agreeing to refund the shipping costs, theres 
no reason why the refund wasnt given within the original timescales or why PayPal would 
need to seek further information about the original transaction many months later. The 
refund of £8.18 was a straight-forward matter   PayPal had agreed to pay it. So, it should 
have been paid to Miss S two years ago or at the very least given her an adequate 
explanation for why it wouldnt be honouring the payment. In not doing this, Im satisfied this 
caused Miss S significant distress and inconvenience, in her having to pursue this to the 
extent she has. Miss S set out the facts of her case multiple times but she wasnt able to get 
any further forwards as to when shed get the money. And I think this was down to PayPals 
customer service. So, I think its only right PayPal should put things right in relation to the 
shipping costs and compensation. While our investigator proposed £100 in addition to the 
£8.18, I thought £200 was more reflective of the frustration Miss S had experienced over the 
many months and couple of years.
I put the proposed award of compensation to PayPal before issuing this decision, inviting its 
comments. It reviewed Miss Ss case further and said it wouldnt agree to the shipping costs 
or compensation as it had terminated its User Agreement with her, following concerns about 
how the facilities had been used. This was in breach of its terms of use. So, it didnt think 
Miss S was entitled to anything. Ive thought about what PayPal has said here. But this 
doesnt change my mind. PayPal issued Miss S with an email agreeing to refund her 
shipping costs. As I have said, it should have paid this to her or responded to explain why it 
would be withdrawing the refund in its original email. But it didnt do either of these things. 
And providing information now, some significant time later doesnt alter the position in 
relation to the complaint Miss S raised and the trouble she was put to. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and require PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
to pay Miss S £8.18 and £200 for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 August 2022.
