The complaint
Ms D complains that she paid too much back to Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) after she 
took out a loan. 
 
I understand Ms D raised concerns about several Barclays accounts. However, just to be 
clear, my decision is only about the loan account that was opened on 7 August 2007. 
What happened
On 7 August 2007, Ms D took out a Barclays loan. In total, she borrowed £22,458.26, which 
was due to be paid back over 84 months. The rate of interest was 10.525%. 
Ms D appears to have got into some financial difficulties in or around June 2009 and she 
missed some repayments. Shortly afterwards, she entered into a debt arrangement scheme, 
which was arranged by a third party. In February 2010, Barclays stopped charging interest 
and regular repayments were then paid to the loan account. 
In or around 2012, Ms D complained to Barclays that it had mis-sold payment protection 
insurance (PPI). Barclays offered to pay compensation in respect of that alleged mis-sale. 
Barclays says it used £6,330.98 from the compensation to reduce the amount Ms D owed on 
her loan. Ms D does not think Barclays did reduce her loan balance. 
On 14 August 2018, Ms D had paid enough to clear her loan balance, but repayments were 
still made after that date. Barclays says Ms D overpaid by £347.49, which was refunded to 
her by cheque. But Ms D says she kept making payments to Barclays through the debt 
arrangement scheme up to December 2021. 
Our investigator looked at all of this, but he didnt think the complaint should be upheld. Ms D 
didnt agree with that view and so the matter has been passed to me for an ombudsmans
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know Ms D will be disappointed with my decision. But I havent upheld the complaint. Ill 
explain why below. 
Barclays provided a copy of all the transactions from Ms Ds loan account from 1 October 
2008, and I have considered this information in some detail. 
As I said above, the loan Ms D took out on 7 August 2007 was for £22,458.26. I can see that 
on 1 October 2008, Ms Ds balance was said to be £19,962.64 and that her contractual 
monthly repayment at that time was £378.96. 
At this stage, interest was being added to the account every month. So, for example, I can 
see that on 6 October 2008, £178.78 was added to the account as interest and Ms D then 
made her monthly repayment of £378.96 on 7 October 2008. 
I know I havent seen the full loan account from 7 August 2007 to 30 September 2008. But 
the balance of £19,962.64 as at 1 October 2008 is in line with what I would expect if Ms Ds 
monthly repayment was £378.96 and she was being charged monthly interest at that time. 
As I said, Ms D ran into some financial difficulties and so the last time Barclays charged 
interest to the account was on 7 December 2009. I can see regular monthly payments were 
then made into the account from 8 February 2010 onwards and that the amount paid was 
deducted from the account balance each month by Barclays. These monthly repayments  
from 8 February 2010 were considerably less than the contractual repayment of £378.96.  
Ms D says she doesnt think Barclays paid the PPI compensation off the loan. However, 
after considering the information before me, Im satisfied it did. I say this because on 13 
June 2012, Ms Ds loan balance stood at £14,567.46. On 14 June 2012, Barclays paid 
£497.32 into the account. The outstanding balance then went down to £14,070.14. On 15 
June 2012, Barclays then paid another £5,833.66 into the loan account and the balance 
went down to £8,236.48. 
So, Barclays says it paid £6,330.98 off the loan balance with Ms Ds PPI compensation. And 
I can see that her loan balance did go down by that much. £14,070.14 less £6,330.98 is 
£8,236.48. This amount has not been added in again anywhere else. With all of this in mind, 
I can see that Barclays did use Ms Ds PPI compensation to reduce her loan balance in the 
way it said it had. 
Ive also looked at the issue of the alleged overpayments. I can see that on 14 August 2018, 
a payment of £107.30 was paid into the loan account. Once this payment had been made, 
the loan account was then £25.62 in credit. Further payments were then made in 
September, October and November 2018, bringing the loan account to £347.49 into credit.
I can see that Barclays then sent a cheque to Ms D for this amount on 6 December 2018 
and Ive seen evidence that it was cashed later that month. 
I know Ms D feels strongly that she continued to make payments towards this account until 
December 2021. But the evidence Ive seen suggests the account was closed in 2018 and 
the £347.49 that was owed to Ms D was paid to her. I havent seen anything to suggest 
anything was paid in respect of this particular loan after November 2018.  
I understand Ms D made a monthly repayment to the third party that arranged her debt 
arrangement scheme. If Ms D has queries about how that payment was apportioned to her 
creditors after 2018, she may find it helpful to seek clarification from that third party. 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint about Barclays Bank UK PLC.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 February 2023.
