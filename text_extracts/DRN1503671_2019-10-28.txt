K821x#15Mr T complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) gave him loans 
irresponsibly.
background
Mr T said that he was in a debt spiral and Sunny shouldnt have given him these 
unaffordable loans.
Sunny provided  10 instalment loans to Mr T between June 2015 and February 2016. The 
amounts he borrowed  ranged between £100  and £750. And some  of the loans were 
overlapping when Mr T took out new borrowing while he was still paying off previous  
borrowing he had with Sunny. 
All the loans  were originally repayable over 6 months  Mr T paid them  all off early. 
Theres a table showing these loans at the end of my decision.
Our adjudicator felt that the complaint should be upheld in part. 
In summary,  he said: 
Sunny  hadnt  done anything wrong  in providing  loans 1 to 5 to Mr T
but by loan 6, Mr Ts overall pattern of borrowing suggested hed become persistently 
reliant on short-term loans 
he had taken 6 loans in 2 months (between June  August  2017)
the amounts  borrowed didnt significantly decrease over this period and for the rest of 
his borrowing relationship with Sunny.
Our adjudicators overall view was that the pattern of lending itself showed  that from loan 6 
onwards the borrowing was unsustainable   so Sunny  shouldnt  have given Mr T any of 
loans 6 -10.
To put things right our adjudicator recommended that Sunny should  refund all interest, fees 
and charges Mr T had paid on loans 6-10,  plus interest on the refunds, and amend his credit 
file to remove all information  about these loans  from Mr Ts credit file.
Sunny disagreed. It mainly said that:
Mr T was only using  6% of his declared  monthly income on average  to repay these 
Sunny loans. So it didnt accept the loans provided were unaffordable  or that Mr T 
demonstrated an over reliance on its short term instalment loans.
Mr T was charged interest  on his loans for less than nine months, which  is consistent 
with the products being used for short term borrowing needs. There  is also no 
balance outstanding.
All of these loans  were paid off early,  with 6 of his loans only paying interest for 
11 days or less. This shows  that Mr T borrowed what he needed  and was able to 
repay these loans back without any difficulty.
Although Mr T was repaying  more than one Sunny loan at the same time, it took this 
into consideration when assessing  each of his loan applications.
Ref: DRN15036712my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr T could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
Ref: DRN15036713Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
I think Sunny  shouldve looked  further into Mr Ts circumstances by the time he took out 
loan 4 - and again when  he applied for loan 5. I say this because  Mr T was consistently  
taking out overlapping loans - and he took out loan 5 just over a week after repaying loan 4. 
However, I havent seen  anything  in the information  available to me which  shows  Sunny 
wouldve decided not to agree these loans had it done so.  
But given the particular circumstances of Mr Ts case, I think  by loan 6 Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was likely  to be unsustainable and it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  I say this because at this point Sunny ought to have 
realised:
Mr T was not managing to repay his loans sustainably. Mr T had taken out 6 loans 
within 2 months or so. Each  loan was to be repaid over 6 months,  and Mr T wasnt 
using these in the way they were intended.
loan 4 was taken out the same day loan 2 was repaid. And loan 5 was taken out a 
little over a week after loan 4 was repaid. Loan 6 was taken out before  loan 5 was 
repaid and it was for more than double  the amount. So it seems to me that Mr T 
needed to keep on borrowing to cover the hole repaying a previous loan left in his 
finances. Sunny didnt  necessarily do something wrong by agreeing a loan for Mr T 
while one was still running. But I think this ought  to have raised concerns for the 
lender when it continued to happen
Mr Ts first loan was for £400 and loan 6 was for £500. At this point Sunny ought  to 
have known that Mr T wasnt likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in income  
but to meet  an ongoing need.
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  10 was 
taken out around 3 months after his first loan - and barely a month after loan 6. 
Loans 9 and 10 were for £750  the largest  amounts hed borrowed.  
Ive carefully considered  what Sunny  has said in response to the view. But for the reasons 
Ive explained,  I think Sunny  shouldve seen that Mr Ts indebtedness  was increasing 
unsustainably from loan 6 onwards  and it shouldve realised then that it was unfair to 
continue to lending  to him.  
I think that Mr T lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans which Mr T borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ts ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN15036714I think Sunny shouldve been  concerned that Mr Ts continued borrowing had 
become unsustainable by loan 6. I appreciate that he repaid his loans earlier than the 
agreed term. But successfully repaying his loans  doesnt mean he managed  to do so 
in a sustainable way. And borrowing and repaying this number of loans early  
suggests to me that Mr Ts finances were not in a stable position. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6-10 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  6 -10 (taken between 9.8.2015 
and 7.9.2015) and pay interest  of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest and 
charges from the date they were paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6-10 should be removed from 
Mr Ts credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ts complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mr T as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 November  2019.
