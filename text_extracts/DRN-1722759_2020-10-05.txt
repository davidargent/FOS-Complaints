The complaint
Mrs C complains that the furniture that she paid for using a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Creation Consumer Finance Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality. Shes being helped with 
her complaint by a relative.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Cs complaint about Creation Consumer Finance, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
of the furniture and that Creation Consumer Finances response to her claim under 
section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Cs 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mrs C bought the furniture in June 2017 and paid for it using a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Creation Consumer Finance but Mrs C and her relative clearly feel 
that the furniture isnt of satisfactory quality and that theres been a breach of the 
guarantee  Mrs C also says that she wasnt told about the routine care requirements 
for the cushions;
she complained to the supplier about the quality of the furniture and it arranged for it 
to be inspected in June 2018;
the inspection report concludes:
All internal frame joints and rails secure and correct, all springs and clips 
secure and performing correct, fibre interiors checked, relaxed and settled in 
line with use, demonstrated to customer daily and weekly dressing steps;
Mrs C complained to Creation Consumer Finance in January 2019 but it rejected her 
complaint because the furniture had been inspected and no defects had been found 
 but it provided her with the names of other inspection companies;
I sympathise with Mrs C for the disappointment that she feels about the quality of the 
furniture, but it was inspected and no faults were found and Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that the furniture isnt of satisfactory quality;
Mrs C was provided with information about the guarantee and the care guide for the 
furniture and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres 
been a breach of contract by the supplier or that she was induced into buying the 
furniture as a result of a misrepresentation by the supplier; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Creation Consumer 
Finance to end the loan agreement, to pay any compensation to Mrs C or to take any 
other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 November 2020.
