The complaint
Miss S complains that ActiveQuote Limited mis-sold her an income protection policy.
What happened
Miss S took out an income protection policy on the advice of ActiveQuote. The aim of the 
policy was to provide an income if she couldnt work because of accident or illness.
After experiencing an injury, Miss S stopped work. She made a clam under the policy, but 
the insurer turned it down because she was an agency worker and therefore hadnt been 
eligible to take out the policy. Miss S complained to ActiveQuote that it had sold her a policy 
that she wasnt eligible to take out. 
ActiveQuote accepted that it had been aware Miss S was an agency worker, and therefore 
the policy had been mis-sold. It returned the premiums Miss S had paid, and also offered her 
a £50 retail voucher. Unhappy with this, Miss S brought a complaint to this service. She 
thought ActiveQuote ought to pay her compensation equivalent to the amount she would 
have received under the policy, had her claim been eligible. 
Our investigator recommended the complaint be upheld in part. He didnt think Miss S 
couldve found an alternative policy that would have covered her in her circumstances, so he 
thought it was correct for ActiveQuote to return the premiums paid. However, he thought 
ActiveQuote should pay interest on the returned premiums, and offer Miss S £50 
compensation in cash rather than a retail voucher. 
ActiveQuote accepted our investigators recommendations, but Miss S didnt. The matter has 
therefore been passed to me to consider.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
To be eligible for cover under the policy that ActiveQuote arranged, Miss S was required to 
be employed, self-employed, or a contract worker (which specifically excluded agency 
workers). As she didnt fall under any of these, she wasnt eligible for the cover.
ActiveQuote has accepted that it was aware Miss S was an agency worker, and so shouldnt 
have therefore sold her the policy.
When a financial business has made an error, the aim of this service is to try and put that 
person back in the position they wouldve been in, had the error not occurred. 
Miss S wants ActiveQuote to pay her compensation equivalent to the claim. For me to 
require ActiveQuote to do so, Id need to be satisfied that Miss S was prejudiced by 
ActiveQuotes error. In other words, if shed known she wasnt eligible for the policy 
ActiveQuote had recommended, shed need to show that she couldve taken out alternative 
cover with another insurer.
ActiveQuote says it isnt aware of another insurance policy that would cover agency workers, 
and so even if it hadnt mis-sold Miss S the policy, it couldnt have offered her cover 
elsewhere. 
Our investigator looked into this for Miss S, and he found one policy that may have covered 
her, however this wasnt available on the market at the time she wanted cover. He wasnt 
able to find any other suitable policies that wouldve provided income protection cover for 
agency workers.
As Miss S hasnt shown that she couldve taken out income protection cover elsewhere, I 
cant conclude that she was prejudiced by ActiveQuotes error. I therefore dont require 
ActiveQuote to pay compensation equivalent to the claim.
However, if ActiveQuote hadnt mis-sold Miss S the policy, then she wouldnt have paid the 
premiums. Im therefore satisfied that a refund of premiums is appropriate compensation in 
the circumstances, though I agree with our investigator that ActiveQuote should pay interest 
on this. 
ActiveQuote had offered Miss S £50 compensation by way of a retail voucher to recognise 
the disappointment she experienced when she found out she couldnt make a successful 
claim. Our investigator thought that was reasonable, but thought ActiveQuote should pay it 
as cash rather than a voucher. I think thats fair.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold this complaint. I require ActiveQuote Limited to pay 
interest on the premiums it has refunded. The interest should be 8% simple per annum 
payable from the date each payment was made to the date of settlement.
If ActiveQuote considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to take off income tax 
from that interest, it should tell Miss S how much its taken off. It should also give Miss S a 
certificate showing this if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate. 
I also require ActiveQuote to pay Miss S £50 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 October 2020.
