The complaint
Mr and Mrs M complain that they were charged penalty fees for withdrawals by Coventry 
Building Society (Coventry).
What happened
In March 2020 - Coventry advised its savers that it was going to reduce the interest rate on 
its 30-day notice account with effect from 10 April 2020. Mr and Mrs M made two 
withdrawals of £50,000 and £6388.27. They were charged penalty fees of £40.98 and £5.24 
because they didnt give 30 days notice.
Mr and Mrs M complained. They said that the email advice from Coventry said they could 
make withdrawals, or close the account without penalty, until 9 May 2020. Theyd made 
withdrawals and been charged and so this was an error. They also said there were problems 
logging onto Coventrys website on Friday 17 April 2020  this meant that the withdrawals 
were delayed by the weekend.
Coventry replied in April 2020. They said the email advice to savers said that accounts could 
be closed without charged until 9 May 2020  but a charge still applied for withdrawals. If a 
closure was asked for, savers would need to call Coventry. Two withdrawals were made - 
£6388.27 (18 April 2020) and £50,000 (21 April 2020). So, two penalty charges had been 
made  but they refunded these as a gesture of goodwill. Coventry looked at their systems 
and there were no problems with their website on 16, 17, 18 and 21 April 2020. They could 
see that Mr and Mrs M tried some unsuccessful attempts to log on, but these were followed 
by a successful ones.
Mr and Mrs M brought their complaint to this service. Our investigator looked at what had 
happened. In October 2020, he found that Coventrys email said that no penalties would 
apply if accounts were closed without notice. Their terms and conditions said that 
withdrawals made without giving notice would attract a penalty. He noted that Mr and Mrs M 
had difficulty logging in  but this wasnt something Coventry could be held responsible for. 
And theyd confirmed there were no known problems with the website on the days in 
question. He noted that the fees had been refunded. So, Coventry hadnt made an error and 
had acted fairly.
Mr and Mrs M asked that their complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs M are frustrated because  following the Coventrys email about reduction in 
interest rates - they thought they could withdraw money from their 30  day notice account 
without penalty up until 9 May 2020. And they had difficulty logging in  so the withdrawals 
were delayed over the weekend, causing a loss of interest.
Ive seen Coventrys email sent in March 2020 and its clear  only if accounts were closed 
would there be no penalties. It said: if you decide youd like to close your account, you 
can do this without giving notice or paying a charge until 9 May 2020.
Coventrys terms and conditions for their 30-day notice account say you can make 
withdrawals.subject to either 30 calendar days notice or a charge equal to 30 calendar 
days interest (at the rate applicable to the account on the date of withdrawal) on the amount 
withdrawn. The charge will be deducted from the balance of the account at the time of 
withdrawal.  Its unfortunate that Mr and Mrs M couldnt recall the email  but Coventry were 
justified in charging a penalty fee. In any case, Coventry have refunded the charges of £5.24 
and £40.98 as a goodwill gesture  and Ive seen this was done on 20 April 2020 and 22 
April 2020.
I have also seen that Mr and Mrs M sent a secure message to Coventry on 16 April 2020 at 
17.43. They asked why a penalty charge was shown on withdrawals when it shouldnt be. 
On 17 April 2020 (at 17.56), Coventry replied I have looked into this for you and I can 
confirm that you are able to close your 30-Day Notice account penalty free until 9 May 
2020. I can see that Mr and Mrs M logged in at 18.28 on 17 April 2020, and again on 18 
April 2020  so they would have been able to see the reply. Mr and Mrs M went ahead and 
made the withdrawals after this - on 18 April 2020 and 21 April 2020  so they shouldve 
been aware of the penalty charges.
Mr and Mrs M say they had trouble logging in on 17 April 2020 at 1800 hours. Weve asked 
Coventry about this. Theyve shown us detailed evidence  minute by minute - which shows 
that their website was working between 1800 and 1830 on that day. 
 
So, it was unfortunate that Mr and Mrs M were not aware that there were penalties to be 
paid on withdrawals. But Coventry have refunded them anyway and have acted fairly  so I 
wont be asking them to do anymore.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M and Mr M to 
accept or reject my decision before 15 March 2021.
