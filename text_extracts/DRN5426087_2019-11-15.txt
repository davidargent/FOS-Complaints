K820x#14complaint
Mr N complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA blocked his accounts.
background
PayPal explained  that in mid-September 2018  Mr N sent a payment of Â£38.23 from one of 
his PayPal accounts  which Ill refer to as the first account - to another of his PayPal 
accounts. PayPal  said the source of the payment  was a card ending  xx12.  It said this card 
was added to his PayPal account  in February 2018.
At the end of October  2018 PayPal said it was notified by issuer of the card ending  xx12 that 
the card holder had filed a chargeback saying this card had been used without their 
authorisation. Ill refer to the issuer of the card ending  xx12  as the Notifying Bank. Due to this 
notification PayPal placed a block on the first account, in line with the PayPal User 
Agreement.
To remove the block, PayPal asked  Mr N to provide  his identification documents and a full 
monthly statement  for the card ending xx12.  It also asked  him to explain  why hed reported 
the transaction as unauthorised to his card issuer.
When our investigator looked  into Mr Ns complaint they noted  that the terms and conditions  
of the PayPal User Agreement allow PayPal to suspend, block,  limit, close or cancel an 
account. And they thought  PayPal  had correctly applied the block because  it received  a 
report  from the Notifying  Bank  about  unauthorised  use of the card.
The investigator didnt  think it was unreasonable of PayPal to ask Mr N to confirm his identity 
and to provide  the further information itd asked Mr N to provide.
Mr N disagrees  with the investigators view. Ive summarised his concerns and the 
investigators response in italics below.
he says he cant send  PayPal a statement for the card ending  xx12  because  he no 
longer has this card. The investigator  explained that Mr Ns bank would be able to 
provide a duplicate statement for him.
he says the investigator didnt  look at his complaint properly because hed also 
complained about  goods hed ordered  but never  received. The investigator  explained  
to Mr N that theyd looked at his complaint about the limitations  PayPal had placed 
on his accounts.  The investigator invited Mr N to provide details regarding the items 
he ordered but didnt receive, so PayPal could investigate this further.
when he tries to send  proof of address to PayPal  he gets an error message. The 
investigator suggested that if Mr N continued to have problems he should provide 
details of the error message so she could forward this to PayPal.
In support of his complaint Mr N provided a final response letter issued by his bank. In this 
letter Mr Ns bank confirmed it didnt have any record of a dispute or fraud claim regarding 
PayPal. So he thinks PayPal was wrong  to block his accounts.
In response, the investigator still didnt  think PayPal had done anything  wrong  - because  itd 
acted within  the terms and conditions when it blocked the accounts.  Mr N also said hed 
destroyed his statements so the investigator contacted his bank and the Notifying Bank  to 
Ref: DRN54260872see if they could  help in providing  the statement PayPal had requested. Mr Ns bank replied 
to say Mr Ns card at the time didnt end in xx12. And the Notifying Bank confirmed they 
didnt have a banking relationship with Mr N at the time.  Based on this information, the 
investigator explained they couldnt offer further  assistance in trying to help him obtain a 
statement for the account ending xx12 that PayPal had requested.
Mr N is still unhappy as his accounts  still havent  been reactivated  by PayPal and he doesnt 
know what card this is. He says hes being  asked  to provide a statement for an account that 
he says isnt his.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so I agree with the 
conclusion reached  by the investigator and for broadly the same reasons.
I realise it must be frustrating for Mr N that his accounts are still blocked. But what  I need to 
think about is whether  PayPal acted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the User 
Agreement when  it blocked the account.  I can only look at the way PayPal  has treated Mr N 
and not at the way hes been treated by the other  financial  businesses Ive referred  to in my 
decision.
PayPal told us it blocked Mr Ns account after it received a report from the Notifying Bank 
that the card ending  xx12  and which was used to transfer funds from one of Mr Ns PayPal 
accounts to another of his PayPal  accounts  had been used without the card holders 
authorisation.
In these circumstances Id expect PayPal to have robust procedures  in place to protect 
Mr Ns account from fraud. Im satisfied that the terms and conditions of the PayPal User 
Agreement allow it to suspend, block, limit, close or cancel an account  in these 
circumstances. So I cant say PayPal  acted unfairly in blocking his accounts.
PayPal has explained  to Mr N the steps  he needs  to take to remove the limitations. Its 
asked him to provide certain identification documents and a copy  statement for the account 
ending xx12 so it can satisfy itself that Mr N authorised  the transaction. I cant say PayPal  
has acted unreasonably in requesting this information.
Mr N has explained to our service that hes unable to provide certain identification 
documents requested by PayPal. I note the investigator invited Mr N to provide other forms 
of identity so these could be forwarded to PayPal to consider, but Im not aware Mr N has 
done this.
Mr N told this service  he cant provide the statement  PayPal has requested because he no 
longer has these. Due to Mr Ns concerns our investigator contacted  Mr Ns bank and the 
Notifying Bank to see if they could provide more information about the card ending  xx12 and 
a statement. Unfortunately neither bank could help. Mr Ns bank said his card at the time 
didnt end in xx12. And the Notifying  Bank  confirmed they didnt  have a relationship  with Mr 
N at the time of the disputed transaction.
In support of his complaint Mr N provided a letter from his bank. This explained that his bank 
didnt have any record of a dispute or fraud claim regarding PayPal. As Ive explained  above  
the investigator made further enquiries  with this business but it confirmed Mr N didnt hold a 
Ref: DRN54260873card with them ending  xx12 at the time. So I dont think this is relevant. But in addition, 
theres nothing to suggest Mr N provided  this letter to PayPal. And even if he had provided it 
to PayPal it doesnt appear  to relate  to the card that was used to transfer  funds between  Mr 
Ns PayPal accounts.
The information provided by PayPal suggests  the card ending xx12 may have been issued 
by a different  financial business. Our service  also contacted this business with the 
information PayPal  had provided  about  the disputed  transaction but it doesnt have any 
record of an active or closed account with Mr N either.
I realise Mr N doesnt recognise the card ending xx12, but I cant  find PayPal acted unfairly  
in blocking his accounts. I say this because  it did so after itd received notification from the 
card issuer  that the card used to transfer  funds between Mr Ns PayPal accounts  wasnt 
authorised by the card holder. PayPal acted as Id expect  it to by blocking the account to 
protect Mr N against any further unauthorised activity.
I realise this isnt the answer Mr N was hoping for but it brings to an end what we as an 
informal dispute resolution service can do to help him.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 December  2019.
