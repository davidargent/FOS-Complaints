The complaint
Ms P says S.D. Taylor Limited trading as Loans at Home (LaH), irresponsibly lent to her. 
She says that she struggled to repay the high amounts that were lent to her. She thinks that 
LaH shouldnt have approved the lending. 
What happened
This complaint is about 38 home collected loans LaH provided to Ms P between July 2004 
and November 2018. Some of the information I have been provided about the lending is in 
the table below (Ive not included some of the loans below to save space).

LaH initially thought that we shouldnt look at some of the lending as it was brought too late. 
But after contacting Ms P it consented to this service looking at all of the lending. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Ms Ps complaint and thought the loans 4 to 38 shouldnt 
have been given. 
Ms P didnt disagree with the adjudicators findings. And LaH didnt respond. As no 
agreement has been reached the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending  including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that LaH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out reasonable or proportionate 
checks to make sure Ms P could repay her loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, there 
may come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same reasons.
Ms P didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion not to uphold loans 1 to 3.  And for the 
avoidance of doubt I dont disagree with what the adjudicator said. I wont comment further 
on this lending. But these loans were part of the borrowing relationship Ms P had with LaH. 
So, they are something I will take into account when considering the other loans she took.
Our adjudicator thought reasonable checks for loans 4 to 8 wouldve shown Ms P couldnt 
have repaid them without financial difficulty. I have independently reviewed the evidence of 
Ms Ps circumstances and Ive come to the same conclusion.
This is because Ms P had a number of loans outstanding with other home credit providers 
that she was making repayments to at the same time she took these loans. And whilst there 
were some breaks in the lending up to this point Ms P had paid her first three loans late. I 
think this is a sign that she was experiencing problems.  
Ive also considered the pattern of lending up to loan 9 and I think the lending history and 
pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that further lending would likely be 
unsustainable. 
This is because Ms P had been borrowing without a break for 23 months. The amounts she 
borrowed didnt decrease and as the loans overlapped, her weekly repayments had 
increased significantly. And as before, Ms P was still struggling to repay her loans on time. 
And added to this Ms P was either at, or approaching retirement, when she started to borrow 
from LaH. I think its reasonable to say that Ms P has spent a large part of her retirement 
repaying significant amounts of high cost credit from what looks to be a modest income. 
Thats not to say a retiree cant use this type of credit at times. But I think to do so 
consistently over more than 10 years, in her situation, is clearly wrong. So, I think LaH was 
irresponsible to continue lending after this point.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress LaH should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms P from loan 4, as Im satisfied it ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Ms P may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between her and this particular lender which she may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how she would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Ms P in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Ms P would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce LaHs liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
LaH shouldnt have given Ms P loans 4 to 38.
A) LaH should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms P towards interest, 
fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B) LaH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms P 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms P originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) LaH should pay Ms P the total of A plus B.
D) LaH should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Ms Ps credit file in 
relation to loans 3 to 8. The overall pattern of Ms Ps borrowing for loans 9 to 38 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from 
Ms Ps credit file. If LaH has sold any of the loans LaH should ask the debt purchaser to do 
the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LaH to deduct tax from this interest. LaH should give 
Ms P a certificate showing how much tax LaH has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Ms Ps complaint. 
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 February 2022.
