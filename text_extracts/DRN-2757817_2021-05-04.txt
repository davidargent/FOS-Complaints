The complaint
Mr P is unhappy that PayrNet Limited restricted his access to his account such that he 
couldnt access his funds.  
What happened
On 20 January 2021, Mr P became aware that the was unable to access the funds held in 
his account. This was of concern to Mr P because the benefit payments that he depended 
on for his day to day living were paid into that account, and this meant that Mr P wasnt able 
to withdraw these funds and had to borrow from friends and family in order to get by. Mr P 
wasnt happy about this, and he wasnt satisfied with the responses that he received from 
PayrNet when he asked them about this, so he made a complaint to this service.
This service asked PayrNet about what had happened. In their response, PayrNet explained 
that Mr Ps account has been suspended because Mr P had violated the terms and 
conditions of the account  specifically, Mr P had attempted to use the account to transfer 
money to a cryptocurrency trading platform.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They acknowledged that Mr P had violated 
the terms and conditions of the account, but they felt that PayrNet hadnt acted fairly or 
reasonably by restricting Mr Ps access to his money in the way that they had, or in how they 
had communicated this information to Mr P. So, they recommended that the complaint be 
upheld in Mr Ps favour and that PayrNet should pay Mr P £50 by way of compensation for 
the inconvenience he had incurred.
PayrNet didnt agree with the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayrNet have explained that the reason that Mr Ps account was restricted was because Mr 
P attempted to make a transaction that violated the terms and conditions of the account. 
While I accept that this may have been the case, it doesnt follow from this that PayrNet 
treated Mr P fairly by restricting Mr Ps access to the funds in his account in the way that 
they did. 
And while it may be the case that PayrNets actions were in line with the terms and 
conditions of the account, it can the case that an unfair outcome can result from the 
application of account terms and conditions, for instance when due regard isnt given to how 
an action mandated by the terms and conditions will impact the customer in question. And I 
think thats the case here. 
What this service would expect, if PayrNet were unhappy with how Mr P had used the 
account, would be that rather than restricting Mr Ps access to money that he needed to be 
able to withdraw, that PayrNet would notify Mr P that he had breached the terms and 
conditions of the account and explain that the account would be closed by a certain date, 
giving Mr P the opportunity to transfer his funds to a new provider before that date.
Additionally, despite Mr P making several inquiries with PayrNet as to why his didnt have 
access to his funds, it appears that it wasnt until PayrNet were approached by this service 
that PayrNet explained that the account had been restricted because of Mr Ps attempt to 
transfer money to a cryptocurrency trading platform.
PayrNet have since explained that they had potential fraud concerns about the attempted 
transfer, and that this was why the transfer was declined and the account was restricted. But 
this doesnt tally with PayrNets earlier explanation that the account was restricted because 
Mr P breached the terms and conditions of the account. And its also the case that, if there 
were fraud concerns, this wasnt explained to Mr P at any time and neither was he 
questioned about this, as would be expected in such circumstances.
PayrNet have also stated that Mr Ps account wasnt restricted and that he could withdraw 
money. But this contradicts an earlier statement to this service by PayrNet which explained 
that the account restrictions were being removed to enable Mr P to transfer his funds from 
the account. Its also notable that Mr P has provided to this service a number of transfer 
attempts made prior to his bringing the complaint to this service, all of which were declined.
This means that its difficult to conclude that PayrNet have acted fairly and reasonably here, 
and it follows from this that I will be upholding this complaint in Mr Ps favour. Our 
investigator recommended that PayrNet make a payment to Mr P of £50 to compensate him 
for the inconvenience he has incurred here, and that recommendation feels fair to me. So, I 
will be upholding this complaint on that basis. 
Putting things right
PayrNet must make a payment of £50 to Mr P to compensate him for the inconvenience he 
has incurred.  
My final decision
I uphold this complaint against PayrNet Limited on the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 June 2021.
