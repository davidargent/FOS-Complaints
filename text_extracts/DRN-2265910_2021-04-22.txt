The complaint
Miss Ls complaint is about the way National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) settled her 
complaint concerning the mis-sale of a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy on a credit 
card. 
NatWest off-set the amount it offered Miss L against the outstanding arrears it said she had 
on the credit card account to which the mis-sold PPI policy was attached. 
Miss L says she doesnt think she had an outstanding balance on her credit card account 
and so NatWests offer should have been paid directly to her.
What happened
In 2019, Miss L complained to NatWest about a PPI policy it had sold her with a credit card. 
RBS responded to Miss Ls complaint in a letter dated 21th October 2019, accepting that the 
policy had been mis-sold and offering her £422.68 (net of tax) in compensation for this. In 
that letter RBS said that: 
To accept our offer you will need to sign and return the declaration at the end of this letter. 
On receipt we will arrange for payment to be made, subject to clearance of any arrears you 
may have with the Group.
And the wording on the attached Declaration and Acceptance form which Miss L signed 
included the following statement:
I understand that the offer will take into consideration any arrears on my credit card 
balance. The remaining balance, if any, will then be paid to me by cheque
Following acceptance of the offer, NatWest paid the updated offer of £423.80 to Miss Ls 
credit card account, where it was used to off-set an outstanding balance on the account of 
£1,409.90.
 
But Miss L wasnt happy with the fact that NatWest had used all the compensation shed 
been offered in this way. She didnt think she did have any outstanding balance on her credit 
card account.
Our adjudicator was satisfied that there were outstanding arrears on Miss Ls credit card 
account and didnt think that NatWest had done anything wrong in using its PPI 
compensation offer to reduce these arrears, rather than paying the compensation directly to 
Miss L. So he didnt think Miss Ls complaint should be upheld. But he told Miss L that she 
could raise a separate complaint if she wasnt happy with the way NatWest had managed 
her card account. And Miss L did subsequently raise a further complaint about this.
 
Miss L didnt agree with the adjudicators view. She said she still didnt think she had 
anything owing on her card account for NatWest to off-set her compensation offer against. 
As Miss L disagreed with the adjudicators view, the case has been passed to me for a final 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has accepted it mis-sold the PPI policy to Miss L and agreed to compensate her for 
this. So, in this decision, I wont be addressing the issue of how the PPI policy came to be 
sold to Miss L. It also doesnt appear as if Miss L is complaining about how the 
compensation figure was calculated by NatWest. So I havent looked at this calculation in 
detail either. In this decision I will only be considering whether NatWest should have paid the 
compensation it offered Miss L to settle her complaint directly to her.
In this case, I consider the most relevant law to take account of is the equitable right to set 
off. This allows, in certain circumstances, an individual (or organisation) to set-off closely 
connected debts. This means one person (A) can deduct from a debt they owe another 
person (B), money which that person (B) owes to them. 
For this right of set-off to apply in this case, I must be satisfied that there is a close 
connection between the PPI compensation and any outstanding debt. I must also consider 
whether it would be unjust not to allow NatWest to set-off in this way. Both tests must be 
satisfied for me to find that NatWest has an equitable right to set-off the PPI compensation 
offered to Miss L against the outstanding debt it says she still owed on her card account.
NatWest has provided monthly statement information for Miss Ls credit card account. And I 
can see that the statement for February 2020 shows an opening outstanding balance of 
£1,409.90, against which NatWest has off-set the updated compensation offer of £423.80, 
leaving a carried forward balance of £986.10. 
Im satisfied from the evidence NatWest has provided that, at the time it made its 
compensation offer, there was an outstanding balance on Miss Ls credit card account which 
had never been repaid. Im also satisfied from what Ive seen that the PPI policy which is the 
subject of this complaint was directly connected to this credit card account. So, in 
considering the right of set-off I have outlined above, I have concluded that the PPI 
compensation and the credit card account are closely connected. They are both for the 
same account of Miss L with NatWest.
Having decided there is a close connection, I need to think about whether it would be unjust 
not to allow NatWest to set off in this way. And, as I have already identified, the offer 
acceptance form which Miss L signed stated that the offer might be used to off-set 
outstanding arrears. So I think NatWest made it clear to Miss L that, if she still had arrears 
on her card account which shed never paid back to it, this would be taken into account in 
determining the amount of compensation, if any, paid directly to her for the PPI mis-sale. Im 
aware that Miss L isnt happy with the way that NatWest has managed her card account in 
the past. But I dont think this is a matter that I can consider further in this decision. This is 
the subject of a separate complaint that Miss L has now made. This complaint only concerns 
the way in which NatWest has settled the mis-sale to Miss L of a PPI policy.
So, in summary and from the information and evidence Ive seen, I think it was reasonable 
for NatWest to apply set off in these circumstances. The PPI policy and the credit card debt 
were closely associated and I consider that it would be unjust not to allow NatWest to use 
set-off in this way. Miss L owed money to NatWest on her card account that shed never repaid including, no doubt, some of the PPI which she was charged for. In these 
circumstances, it would seem evidently unfair if NatWest were required to refunds the money 
she was charged for PPI, some of which was never actually paid to NatWest in the first 
place.
So I dont think NatWest has done anything wrong in the way it has settled Miss Ls mis-sale 
complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, Im not upholding this complaint against 
National Westminster Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 May 2021.
