The complaint
Mrs B, through a representative complains that Morses Club PLC (Morses) didnt carry out 
proportionate affordability checks before it granted her loans. 
What happened
Mrs B was advanced several loans from Morses under two different identification numbers. 
Morses says, that currently, it doesnt hold any more information about the lending. It isnt 
clear why Mrs B has two IDs but as there are two chains of borrowing that may explain it. 
The adjudicator did ask Mrs Bs representative for any more information about the earlier 
loans, but Mrs B said she doesnt have anything else to send. Therefore, the decision deals 
with the loans detailed in the table below.

Following Mrs Bs complaint Morses wrote to her representative to explain that it considered 
there were two chains of lending because it said there was a break of around 10 months 
after loan 22 was repaid and before Mrs B returned for further funds. But Morses did uphold 
Mrs Bs complaint in part. 
Morses offered to put things right in relation to loans 14, 15 and loans 19  22 (under 
Mrs Bs first ID) only. Morses offered to also remove these loans from Mrs Bs credit file. 
Mrs Bs representative didnt accept the outcome and instead referred the complaint to the 
Financial Ombudsman Service, where an adjudicator reviewed the complaint. He thought 
Morses had made a reasonable decision to provide loans 9  13 in the first chain of lending 
and loans 1  3 in the second chain of lending. 
And in addition to what Morses had already agreed to do to put things right for Mrs B he 
thought loans 16, 17 and 18 in the first loan chain and loans 4 and 5 in the second chain 
should also be upheld because these loans were now harmful for Mrs B. 
Mrs Bs representative acknowledged the proposed outcome but didnt have anything further 
to provide. 
Morses responded to the adjudicators view and initially asked whether the Financial 
Ombudsman had all the loan information from the first loan chain. The adjudicator 
responded to say, he had used the information in the final response letter because he had 
been told there was nothing more Morses could provide. Morses then said, it was 
awaiting further information. This was chased with Morses again, who confirmed it had 
nothing further to submit on 5 June 2023. 
As no agreement could be reached, the case was then passed to an ombudsman to make a 
decision about the complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about this type of lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
I just want to start by saying that I am aware the loans are spread over many years and 
therefore straddle regulation by the two different industry regulators - the Office of Fair 
Trading (OFT) as well as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). And Ive kept this in mind 
when thinking about what Morses ought to have been doing at the time. But what is clear, 
from the regulations is the amount of continuity between the OFT and the FCA.  
Morses had to assess the lending to check if Mrs B could afford to pay back the amounts 
shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Morses checks couldve taken into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and 
Mrs Bs income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks 
might have been proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Morses should have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mrs B. These factors include:
Mrs B having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mrs B having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that theborrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mrs B coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid
(also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mrs B. 
Morses was required to establish whether Mrs B could sustainably repay the loans  not just 
whether she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mrs B was able to repay her 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and in particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and 
without having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have 
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, 
then it follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and
thought about what this means for Mrs Bs complaint.
Neither Morses nor Mrs B (or her representative) appear to disagree with the outcome the 
adjudicator reached about loans 9  13 in the first loan chain or loans 1  3 in the second 
loan chain. I therefore no longer think these loans are in dispute. So, I say no more about 
them.
In addition, in the final response letter, Morses conceded that loans 14 and 15 as well as 
loans 19  22 (in the first chain) ought to not have been granted because it considered 
further checks ought to have been carried out at the time. So again, I say no more about 
them as Morses has accepted compensation needs to be paid for these loans. And Ive 
included these loans in the putting things right section at the end of the decision. 
Therefore, as the above loans dont appear to be in dispute, this decision has focused on 
loans 16  18 in the first loan chain and loans 4 and 5 in the second loan chain. 
Loans 16 - 18 
For these loans, there is limited information provided by Morses and the adjudicator 
concluded, given how close together some of them were granted that it is likely this was part 
of one chain of lending. I dont think that is an unreasonable conclusion to draw  given the 
start date of each loan under the first loan ID. 
For these loans, Morses hasnt provided any information about the checks that it carried out. 
But my understanding of Morses process at the time, it is likely it did request details of 
Mrs Bs income and expenditure. However, the results of those checks havent been 
provided. Neither has Mrs Bs representative provided any information about what Mrs Bs 
actual financial position was at the time these loans were granted.  
But its arguable whether the checks Morses likely did before approving these loans went far 
enough considering that by loan 16 there had been at least 7 loans approved (from loan 9) in 
a little over three years. And while the weekly commitment wasnt likely increasing, Mrs B 
was still seeking further credit. 
By now, it wouldve been reasonable for Morses to have at the very least, started to have 
verified the information it was being given. Ive not seen anything to suggest it carried out further checks in this case. However, I dont think I need to try and establish, in this case, 
whether a proportionate check wouldve led Morses to conclude these loans were 
unaffordable for Mrs B because Morses also needed to consider whether the loan 
repayments were sustainable for Mrs B. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Morses lending history with Mrs B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Morses should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Morses should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. It is worth saying here, that Morses has already 
accepted loans 14 and 15 ought not to have been advanced.
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Bs case, I think that this point had already been 
reached by loan 16. I say this because:
At this point Morses ought to have realised Mrs B was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Mrs B had taken out eight loans in 37 months. So Morses ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mrs B was having to borrow further to cover 
a long-term short fall in her living costs. 
From loan 9, Mrs B was being regularly provided with new loans indeed by loan 16, 
Mrs B had returned for a new loan just two months after her previous loan had been 
approved. To me, this is a sign that Mrs B was using these loans to fill a long-term 
gap in her income rather than as a short-term need.  
Over the course of the lending relationship, Mrs Bs weekly commitments likely 
remained fairly similar given she was regularly borrowing £300 over similar weekly 
terms. 
Mrs B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Morses. Loan 18 was 
taken out nearly 4 years after Mrs Bs first loan that we know about in this chain and 
it was to be repaid over the same term  34 weeks. Mrs B had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Morses over an extended period.
Overall, including what Morses has already agreed to do to put things right, I think that Mrs B 
lost out when Morses provided loans 14  22 in the first chain because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mrs B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mrs Bs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
Loans 4 and 5 in the second loan chain 
For these loans, Morses has shown that it asked Mrs B for details of her income and 
expenditure. For loan 4 Mrs B declared a weekly income of £308. For loan 5 she declared 
she received £384 per week. Morses says the income declared for loan 4 was checked with 
a credit reference agency  but the results of that check havent been provided. For loan 5, 
Morses saw evidence of Mrs Bs wages  perhaps through a wage slip but Morses hasnt 
provided the evidence that it saw either. 
In terms of expenditure, for loan 4  Morses has recorded these to have been £224 per 
week and then £84 per week for loan 5. This left a minimum weekly disposable income of 
£84 when loan 4 was advanced. Based solely on Mrs Bs income and expenditure 
information Morses couldve been reasonably confident she would be able to afford the 
repayments she was committed to making for loans 4 and 5. But its arguable whether these checks went far enough considering how long Mrs B had 
been indebted to Morses, her future weekly commitment and what Morses already knew 
about Mrs Bs finances. These loans were approved around five months apart, but Mrs Bs 
weekly expenditure appeared to have drastically decreased by loan 5. 
For loan 5 there was no rent or council tax payments  even though Mrs B was still paying 
utilities. And Morses knew she was still a council tenant. Her food shop decreased as well 
from £60 a week to £40 per week even though Morses knew she had a dependent. I do 
think, given all this, Morses ought to have been concerned about the information Mrs B had 
provided about her living costs. 
By now, it wouldve been reasonable for Morses to have started to have verified the 
information it was being given. Ive not seen anything to suggest it this. However, I dont 
think I need to try and establish because Morses also needed to consider whether these 
loan repayments were sustainable for Mrs B. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Morses lending history with Mrs B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Morses should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Morses should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mrs Bs case in this second loan chain, I think that this point was 
reached by loan 4. I say this because:
At this point Morses ought to have realised Mrs B was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Mrs B had taken out four loans in 18 months. So Morses ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mrs B was having to borrow further to cover 
a long-term short fall in her living costs. 
From her first loan, Mrs B was provided with a new loan on the same day a previous 
loan was repaid. To me, this is a sign that Mrs B was using these loans to fill a long-
term gap in her income rather than as a short-term need.  
Over the course of the lending relationship, Mrs Bs weekly commitments generally 
increased, when loan 4 was granted, her weekly commitment was now 66% higher 
than it was for loan 1. There was no time when her weekly commitment decreased. 
However, the fact that these loans were lent in a consecutive manner, ought to have 
led it to realise these loans werent sustainable anymore. 
Mrs B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Morses. Loan 5 was 
taken out 25 months after Mrs Bs first loan in the second loan chain and was to be 
repaid over the same term as her other loans in this chain. Mrs B had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Morses over an extended period.
I think that Mrs B lost out when Morses provided loans 4 and 5 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mrs B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mrs Bs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
Overall, Im upholding Mrs Bs complaint about loans 14  22 in the first loan chain and loans 
4 and 5 in the second loan chain and Ive outlined below what Morses needs to do in order 
to put things right.  Putting things right
In deciding what redress Morses should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had if it had stopping lending from loan 14 in the first loan chain and from 
loan 4 in the second loan chain, as Im satisfied it ought to have. Clearly there are a great 
many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs B may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere. If this wasnt a viable option, she may 
have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that, 
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how she would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Mrs B in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mrs B would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Morses liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
Morses shouldnt have provided Mrs B with loans 14  22 in the first loan chain and loans 4 
and 5 in the second loan chain. 
A. Morse should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs B towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party 
where applicable, but not including anything you have already refunded.
B. Morses should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Mrs B which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs B originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Morses should pay Mrs B the total of A plus B.
D. The overall pattern of Mrs Bs borrowing for loans 14  22 in the first loan chain and 
loans 4 and 5 in the second chain means any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So Morses should remove these loans entirely from Mrs Bs credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to deduct tax from this interest. Morses should 
give Mrs B a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Mrs Bs complaint in part. 
Morses Club PLC should put things right for Mrs B as directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2023.
