Ms T says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about seven loans Sunny provided  to Ms T between September 2015  and 
February 2016. Ms Ts borrowing history is as follows:

3 10/10/2015 6 26/02/2016 £500.00 226.52
4 13/11/2015 6 27/11/2015 £100.00 256.17

6 30/12/2015 6 *16/08/2016 £150.00 283.12
7 26/02/2016 6 *16/08/2016 £400.00 263.73
*Sunny have informed us that these loans were sold on to a 3rd party on this date. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Ts complaint and thought  the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed with this opinion but have agreed to uphold 
Ms Ts complaint about loan 7. So, the complaint was passed to me to reach a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms T could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN44817172the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms T could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ts complaint.  Our adjudicator  didnt think loans  1  5 
should be upheld,  and Ms T seems to have agreed  with this opinion.  So as these  loans are 
no longer in dispute, I havent considered these further. I have however, thought  about  all of 
Ms Ts loans when looking at her overall lending history with Sunny. 
Sunny have also agreed to uphold loan 7 in-line  with our approach, so as this loan is no 
longer in dispute, I havent considered it further  - but I have set out below what Sunny should  
do when putting  this right for the consumer.  
Looking at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Ms T, Ive thought  carefully 
about whether  I think there was a point  at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Our adjudicator felt that this point had been  reached  by loan 6. Ive thought about this, but I 
dont agree. I say this because loans 1 - 6 were all taken out within  the space of three 
months. So, I dont think it had yet reached the point   considering how long these loans 
were meant to run for - to suggest  that a pattern of lending had developed.  
So, Im not upholding the complaint about loan 6, but Sunny have offered to uphold  loan 7 
and put things right. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny have agreed to uphold loan 7. As Sunny has sold this outstanding debt it should buy 
this back if Sunny are able to do so and then take the following steps.  If Sunny are unable to 
buy back this debt back, then it should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results  
outlined below. 
Ref: DRN44817173A.Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Ms T towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything  Sunny have already refunded. 
B.Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual payments made by Ms 
T which are considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms T originally made 
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled. 
C.Sunny  should  remove all interest,  fees and charges  from the balance  on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made by Ms T as though they had been 
repayments on the principle on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Ms T having 
made overpayments  then Sunny should  refund these overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen  to the date the complaint  is settled. Sunny 
should then refund  the amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step E. 
D.If there  is still an outstanding balance then the amounts  calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should  be paid to Ms T. However, if there  is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan 
with Ms T. Sunny shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principle Sunny 
have already written  off. 
E.Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  recorded on Ms Ts credit file in 
relation to loan 7.   
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Ms T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im not upholding Ms Ts complaint about loans 1- 6. Elevate 
Credit International  Limited have agreed to uphold loan 7 so it should put thinks  right as set 
out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2020.
