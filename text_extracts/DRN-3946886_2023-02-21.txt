The complaint
Ms B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt cancel her debit card 
when it said it would and gave her incorrect information. She would like more compensation 
than NatWest has offered.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving  the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
There is no dispute that NatWest didnt cancel Ms Bs debit card when she advised 
NatWest she had it. NatWest apologised for this and for giving Ms B incorrect 
information. It paid a total of £150 compensation into her account for the trouble 
upset caused. Mistakes can happen but I do appreciate the situation must have been 
very stressful and inconvenient for Ms B, so think it was appropriate for NatWest to 
pay some compensation to Ms B.
I appreciate Ms B doesnt feel the £150 compensation that NatWest has paid is 
sufficient - she feels £1500-£1700 would be more appropriate but unfortunately I 
dont agree. Ms B hasnt evidenced she suffered any financial loss because of 
NatWests actions that I could take into account so I can only consider the distress 
and inconvenience caused to her.
I do appreciate it must have been very stressful for Ms B to have lost her card then to 
have had to chase up her new card and in doing so discovering that her old one 
hadnt been cancelled leaving her account potentially open to fraud. And this meant 
for a short time, this left  her without a debit. However, I understand NatWest did 
advise of other ways  Ms B could access her account so she did still have access to 
her funds. 
Considering all the information that I have  I think the payment NatWest has made is 
appropriate in the circumstances.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 March 2023.
