K821x#15complaint
Mr T says Elevate  Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny) shouldnt have provided  
him with instalment loans because he was in a debt spiral and these loans  werent affordable 
for him. 
background 
Mr T took 23 instalment  loans from Sunny between April 2016  and November 2017.  A 
summary of Mr Ts borrowing, based  on the information provided to us by Sunny, can be 
found in the appendix  at the end of this decision.
Our adjudicator thought Sunny had treated Mr T fairly when it provided loans 1  5, so she 
made no award against Sunny for these loans.  
However, the adjudicator didnt think the sixth loan or any subsequent loans shouldve  been 
provided. The adjudicator felt that by that by this point a pattern of lending had been  
established which shouldve  indicated to Sunny that Mr T wasnt able to sustainably make 
his loan repayments.  
Sunny didnt accept  the adjudicators findings.  It made a number  of points including;
it carried out through eligibility, creditworthiness and affordability checks before  each  
loan was approved:  and
the combined contractual repayments  made  up a small portion of Mr Ts declared 
income.
However, in order to settle  the complaint, Sunny agreed to uphold  the complaint about  loans 
13  23. 
But Mr T rejected Sunnys  offer. As no agreement could be reached,  the case has been  
passed to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr T could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN54923902the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint. And Ive decided  to uphold Mr Ts 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Mr T didnt  disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans  1 to 5. Because  of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Mr T had with Sunny. So 
they are something  I will take into account  when considering the other loans  he took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 12 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  
history with Mr T, with a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ts case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 
6. I say this because:
Mr Ts first loan was for £300, but he quickly took his indebtedness up to £450 and to 
£550 by loan 3. This did fluctuate at some points but didnt decrease by a significant 
amount, and when  it did, the monthly instalments didnt significantly reduce for a 
sustained period. So going  forward I think at loan 6 Sunny ought to have known  that 
Mr T was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet 
an ongoing need. 
Mr T continued  to be provided  with new loans during the time he had other  loans 
outstanding, and when new loans were  taken these tended  to be taken up quickly 
after previous  loans had been  repaid.  For much  of the time Mr T was indebted to 
Sunny he also had as many as three  loans  running concurrently. And the amounts 
Ref: DRN54923903Mr T was borrowing  did fluctuate,  but the monthly instalments didnt decrease in any 
meaningful way over a sustainable period of time. So Sunny ought to have realised it 
was more likely than not Mr T was having  to borrow further to cover the hole the 
repayment of his previous loans left in his finances  and that Mr Ts indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably. 
Mr T wasnt reducing the amounts he owed to Sunny. For example, loan 12 was 
taken out around 11 months after Mr Ts first instalment loan was approved, and this 
loan was for a larger amount, than his first. 
I think that Mr T lost out when Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ts ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 12 and Sunny has agreed to uphold loans 
13  23. So, Ive outlined below, it total what it needs to do to put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  6 to 23;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove all entries about  the above  loans from Mr Ts credit file. The period of time 
Mr T owed Sunny money means that any information still recorded  about loan this 
loan is adverse. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ts complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr T as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 December  2019.
