The complaint
Miss C says Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, irresponsibly lent to her.
What happened
This complaint is about a 12-month instalment loan for £1,000 that 118 118 Money provided
to Miss C on 28 December 2018. The monthly repayments were £116.04 and the total
repayable was £1,392.48.
Miss C says 118 118 Money didnt complete sufficient checks to know the loan was
affordable, she had other loans and was in a spiral of debt.
Our investigator upheld Miss Cs complaint and thought 118 118 Money shouldnt have
given the loan. 118 118 Money disagreed, saying the investigator has relied on a rule that
only applies to revolving credit accounts. And its checks showed Miss C was not using her
overdraft and was at the time managing her credit well.
It asked for an ombudsmans review and so the complaint was passed to me. I reached a 
different conclusion to the investigator, so I issued a provisional decision. An extract follows 
and forms part of this final decision. I asked both parties for any comments or new evidence 
by 28 June 2022. 
Extract from my provisional decision
118 118 Money has provided evidence to show that before lending it asked for some
information from Miss C. It asked for her monthly income and outgoings, her employment
status and her residential status. It completed an income verification check with a third-party.
It carried out a credit check to understand her credit history and her existing credit
commitments. It asked about the purpose of the loan and Miss C selected other. Based on
these checks 118 118 Money thought it was fair to lend.
I think these checks were proportionate given the value and term of the loan; the stage in the
lending relationship and the amount of the monthly repayment relative to Miss Cs verified 
And I think 118 118 Money made a fair lending decision based on the information it
gathered. Ill explain why.
118 118 Money calculated Miss C had £983 disposable income and so could afford to take
on the £116.04 repayment for this loan. It had checked Miss Cs declared income using a
third-party income verification tool. And Miss C said she lived with her parents so her
outgoings of £537 seemed plausible.
The credit check it completed showed Miss C had in total outstanding debt of £2,050 across
five accounts. The majority was on a defaulted loan account from 2015 that it seemed she
was not making payments to reduce. I note there were two other defaults from mid-2014 but
these had been settled in full by January 2016. There was a more recent delinquent account,
but Miss C was now making repayments and it had a relatively low balance of £165. She
was not using her overdraft facility.
So whilst there was some adverse data on Miss Cs file, as the majority was historic, I dont
think it was at such a level that 118 118 Money ought not have lent to Miss C.
Overall, from the information Ive seen I think that the loan repayments would have appeared
affordable for Miss C and they were not so high relative to her income that there was a clear
risk she wouldnt be able to meet them over the loan term while meeting her other
commitments  even if she started to repay the older defaulted loan. In addition, there
werent clear indicators of current financial difficulty in the information 118 118 Money had.
Taking everything into account, I have come to the provisional conclusion that the checks
118 118 Money carried out on this occasion were proportionate and there wasnt enough of
concern in the information it gathered which should have prompted it to make further
enquiries of Miss C before lending to her.
It follows I dont currently think 118 118 Money was wrong to lend to Miss C. And I havent
found any evidence that it acted unfairly or unreasonably towards her in some other way.
Finally, whilst it is not something I have relied on in my provisional decision, I wanted to
respond to 118 118 Moneys point about the investigators reference to an unrelated rule.
The investigator referred to CONC 5.2A.27 in her assessment but she explained this was in
relation to the credit card accounts Miss C held, not this loan. The reference to a guarantor
was however incorrect.
118 118 Money responded, accepting my provisional decision. Miss C did not respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending -
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
As neither party sent in any comments or new information I have no reason to change the 
findings or outcome I set out in my provisional decision. It follows for the reasons set out 
above I do not think 118 118 Money was wrong to lend to Miss C. 
My final decision
I am not upholding Miss Cs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 July 2022.
