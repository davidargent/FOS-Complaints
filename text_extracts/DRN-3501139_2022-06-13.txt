The complaint
Miss M had a motor insurance policy with Soteria Insurance Limited. She says it made an 
incorrect entry on a database that meant she was charged too much for cover.
What happened
Miss M told Soteria that her car was damaged on 19 March 2020. She said she didnt want 
to make a claim on the policy, as the damage was so minor. Soteria recorded the incident on 
the insurance database (the Claims and Underwriting Exchange  CUE) as Notification 
only. But another insurer later told Miss M that a claim was recorded on CUE on that date. 
As a result, her new premium increased. When one of our investigators reviewed Miss Ms 
complaint, she said Soteria had recorded the incident correctly  even if other insurers 
viewed the entry as a claim. Miss M asked for an  ombudsmans review of the complaint.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Soteria has provided evidence of the entry it made on CUE for 19 March 2020. The CUE 
record shows Notification only. So I think Soteria has shown that it recorded the incident 
correctly. Miss M has shown that, unfortunately, her new insurer and others regarded the 
entry as evidence of a claim. Not all insurers would do so  and Soteria cant control the way 
other insurers act. Miss M has faced higher premiums than expected, and I sympathise with 
the position shes found herself in. But as I dont think Soteria has acted unreasonably, I 
cant ask it to remove the CUE record or to pay her compensation, as shes requested.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. Under the Financial Ombudsman 
Services rules, I must ask Miss M to accept or reject my decision before 11 July 2022.
