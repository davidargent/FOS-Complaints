K821x#15complaint
Mr V says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about seventeen  high-cost short term credit loans that Sunny provided to 
Mr V from February 2017 onwards. Mr Vs last loan was provided  in November 2018. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Vs complaint and thought that he shouldnt have been provided  
with loans 6 to 17. Sunny disagreed. So the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the key relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr V could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided. Having 
looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr V, I think that Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that Mr V was unlikely  to have been  able to make his payments in a 
sustainable manner  by the time it provided loan 6. 
I say this because  by this stage, Mr V had an established pattern of taking further loans soon 
after repaying previous  ones.  And loan 6 was provided while Mr V still owing on loan 5. This 
pattern of borrowing went on to continue over an extended number of loans. Im not 
persuaded that the loan repayments being less than a certain percentage of Mr Vs income 
Ref: DRN19264902or the fact that Mr V repaid these loans  means  that they were sustainable or that it was fair 
and reasonable for Sunny  to provide them.
Mr V had to pay interest and charges on loans that Sunny  shouldnt  have provided him with. 
So I think that he lost out and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr V paid on loans 6 to 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
all reference to loans  6 to 17 should be removed from Mr Vs credit  file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr V a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Vs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr V compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 April 2020.
