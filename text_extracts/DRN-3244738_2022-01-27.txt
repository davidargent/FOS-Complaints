The cost per week column is the individual cost per loan per week. Where loans overlapped 
the cost per week will be greater. 
LAH has told us that Ms F had some problems repaying her final three loans and based on 
the information in its file submission to this Service, the outstanding balances on these loans 
was written off. 
LAH issued its FRL on 18 August 2021. It explained that Ms F had made her complaint too 
late about loans 1 - 17, so it didnt investigate Ms Fs complaint further about these loans. 
LAH then considered loans 18 and 19 and following its investigation it concluded it had 
made an error when these loans were advanced. However, it explained that no redress was 
due to Ms F because it had written off some of the capital it had advanced.  
 
One of our adjudicators looked at Ms Fs complaint. The assessment was split into two 
parts. 
In the first part, the adjudicator concluded, this Service could investigate loans 1  17 
because she couldnt see a reason to suggest that the loans had been complained about too 
late. Therefore, these loans were referred to this Service on time. 
Loans 18  19 are within this Services jurisdiction because Ms F complained about these 
within six years of the letter of complaint and so there is no issue about these loans as they 
are clearly in this Services jurisdiction. 
 
In the second part, the adjudicator considered the merits of the complaint to see whether 
LAH had done anything wrong when it advanced these loans. She hadnt seen enough to 
uphold loans 1 - 5. 
But the adjudicator thought loans 6 - 19 should be upheld. She concluded that by loan 6 the 
pattern of lending had become harmful to Ms F. So, LAH shouldnt have approved this loan, 
or any of the remaining loans.   
Ms Fs representative confirmed it had received the adjudicators findings and didnt have 
anything further to add. 
LAH didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment. In its response to the adjudicator LAH 
didnt focus on the merits of the case, instead it focused on whether this Service had the 
jurisdiction to consider loans 1  17. In summary it said:
It disagreed with the approach this Service had taken.
LAH told this Service Ms F received arrears letters in 2012 and again between 2014-
2016. LAH also sent a pre-default letter to Ms F in April 2016. 
LAH has tried to contact Ms F to find out when she became aware she could 
complain, but without receiving a response. 
This has led LAH to conclude there isnt sufficient information to be able to conclude 
the case is in jurisdiction because without a date to use as a trigger, no conclusion 
can be reached about whether Ms F made her complaint within three years. 
The adjudicator went back to LAH and explained why its comments didnt change her mind. 
She also reiterated hed not seen anything to make him think Ms F had complained too late 
and the arrears letters LAH had mentioned hadnt been provided.  
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
Why I can look into this complaint
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments provided by Ms F and LAH to 
decide whether we are able to look at loans 1 -17. Having done so, I have reached the same 
conclusion as the adjudicator  that I have the power to consider loans 1  17. Ill explain 
why. 
The rules I must apply say that, where a business doesnt agree, I cant look at a complaint 
made more than six years after whats been complained about. Or if later, more than three 
years after the complainant in this case, Ms F knew, or ought to really have known they had 
reason to complain. This is set out in Dispute Resolution rule 2.8.2R and can be found online 
in the FCAs Handbook. 
Its clear loans 1 to 17 were complained about more than six years after they were taken. 
Ive thought about what LAH says in this case, about not being able to get hold of Ms F to find out when she became aware she could complain. 
However, in this case Ive not seen anything to persuade me Ms F was aware or ought to 
have been reasonably aware more than three years before she raised this complaint, that 
she had reason to complain. 
LAH has said when Ms F experienced repayment problems and received arrears letters in 
2012 and between 2014  2016. Although LAH hasnt said so, I understand these dates 
have been raised, because these arrears notices shouldve caused Ms F to realise, she had 
reason to complain. But I dont think this is enough in this particular case to demonstrate 
that.
I say this because whilst experiencing repayment problems and therefore struggling to repay 
the lending would no doubt have led Ms F to realise there was a problem (in terms of her 
financial difficulty), Im not persuaded this would have (or ought to have), in itself, made her  
aware that these problems were caused by LAH doing something wrong when it agreed the 
loans.
And I havent seen anything else to persuade me that Ms F was or ought to have become 
aware earlier of cause to complain more than three years before they complained. 
So, like our adjudicator, I think loans 1 to 17 were raised within the time limits I need to apply 
and that I do have the power to consider these loans Ms F was given. Ill now go on and 
consider whether or not I think all the loans complained about were lent responsibly. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice
at the time the loan was provided.
LAH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms F could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that LAH should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Ms F. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become or was becoming
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.I think that it is important for me to say that LAH was required to establish whether Ms F 
could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all mean for Ms Fs complaint.
Loans 1 to 5
The adjudicator didnt uphold Ms Fs complaint about these loans. Ms F agreed with the 
adjudicators findings, so I no longer think these loans are in dispute. 
But I have kept in mind these loans when thinking about Ms F overall lending relationship 
with LAH.  
Loans 6 - 19
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 6 - 19 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. 
In addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Ms F, LAH also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Ms F.
Having looked at the overall pattern of LAHs lending history with Ms F, LAH should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the 
time it provided loan 6. I say this because:
By loan 6 it was around 15 months into the lending relationship with Ms F indebted to 
LAH for the entire time. And, by this point Ms F now had three loans overlapping and 
was repaying £70 per week. In my view, Ms Fs loan history up until this point was a 
clear indication that her underlying financial situation didnt seem to be improving. 
Ms Fs first loan was for £375 with loan 6 being for £300. Although this is for a 
smaller sum, Ms Fs indebtedness was greater because of the overlapping loans. Her 
weekly commitment had increased from £15 to £70, further signs that her overall 
indebtedness had increased significantly.   
Ms F, up to this point, had showed signs that when a loan had been repaid a new 
one was taken out on the same day, for example loans 3 and 4. LAH ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Ms F, on these occasions, was having to borrow 
further to effectively cover a long-term financial need. To me, this is an indication of 
her indebtedness not being sustainable.
From loan 6 onwards Ms Fs pattern of taking new loans shortly after a previous loan 
had been repaid continued and she continued to have a number of loans running 
concurrently. 
By the point of loan 19, Ms F was making a commitment to make repayments to LAH 
for another 42 weeks, after already being indebted for nearly five years. Loan 19 was 
also around twice the value compared to loan one.  The amount of time that Ms F 
spent indebted to LAH meant that she was in effect servicing a debt to LAH over an 
extended period of time.The above further reinforces my view these loans were unsustainable, because 
Ms F went on to have significant repayment problems and loans 17 - 19 werent fully 
repaid. 
I think that Ms F lost out when LAH provided loans 6 - 19 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Fs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the number of loans and time in debt was likely to have had negative implications on 
Ms Fs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 - 19. Ill go on to set out what LAH 
should do to put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress LAH should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what
might have happened had it not provided lending from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought to
have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms F may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative 
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Ms F in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Ms F would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce LAHs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
LAH shouldnt have given Ms F loans 6 - 19. 
A. LAH should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms F towards interest, 
fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything you have already refunded.
B. LAH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms F 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms F originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. LAH may  if it choose to  use the total of A plus B to repay any principal which 
has been written-off.
D. LAH should pay any remaining refund to Ms F. If there is no refund left and still a 
balance outstanding made up of written-off principal, it would not be fair for LAH to 
pursue this further.E. The overall pattern of Ms Fs borrowing for loans 6 - 19 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so LAH should remove these loans entirely from 
Ms Fs credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to take off tax from this interest. LAH must give Ms F 
a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Ms Fs complaint in part. 
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right for Ms F as directed above.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms F to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2022.
