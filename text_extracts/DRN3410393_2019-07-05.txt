Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Hs complaint in part but as QuickQuid disagreed  the complaint 
has come  to me  an ombudsman - for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website 
and Ive taken  this into account  in deciding Mr Hs case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Hs complaint  in part and have explained why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Hs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate. 
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
Ref: DRN34103932There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Hs complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr H would be able to repay in a sustainable way?  If not, would 
those checks  have shown that H would have  been able to do so?
2.Taking  into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending increase Hs indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Hs  complaint.
Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr H would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr H would have been  able to do so?
QuickQuid has provided information about the checks it carried out. From  the information 
provided, it checked Mr Hs income  which was recorded as £1,300  - £1,323. QuickQuid 
also searched his credit  file before lending some  of the loans.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that loans 1 and 2 should be upheld. Having considered 
the circumstances around  those  loans, I agree with the adjudicator.  I also agree with our 
adjudicator that before  agreeing to lend loan 3 onwards, QuickQuid should have been 
carrying out a full review  of Mr Hs circumstances.
Had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks before  lending  loan 3, its likely to have 
seen that Mr H couldnt sustainably afford the loan.  The largest repayment  on this loan was 
£500 and taking into account Mr Hs living costs of around £850 and his income of around 
£1,250, he wasnt  in a position  to afford the repayment.
So Im upholding  Mr Hs complaint about  loan 3 because I dont think  that QuickQuid carried  
out reasonable and proportionate checks and such checks wouldve more  likely than not 
shown QuickQuid that Mr H couldnt  sustainably repay this loan.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 4 to 8 because 
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Ref: DRN34103933Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Hs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending to see if there  was a point at which 
QuickQuid should  reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Hs case,  I think  that this point 
was reached by loan 4. I say this because I can see that Mr H had requested loan 2 within 
weeks of repaying loan 1 and a similar pattern occurred after he repaid  loan 2 and borrowed 
loan 3. And the loan amounts were increasing. QuickQuid ought to have realised  it was likely 
his indebtedness  was increasing  unsustainably.
This pattern of borrowing  within  a short time of repaying a previous loan continued 
throughout the lending  relationship and the loan amounts  were  either  increasing  or staying 
relatively the same. Mr Hs last loan was for four times the amount of loan 1. I dont  think  
Mr H was making any real inroads to the amount  he owed QuickQuid. And was in effect  
paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended period.
Mr H was demonstrating repayment difficulties from loan 3 and had to defer the repayments. 
I can also see that he incurred late fees on loans 6 to 8.
Overall, I think Mr Hs pattern of borrowing shouldve concerned QuickQuid and it shouldnt 
have continued  lending loan 4.onwards. Because QuickQuid continued lending, Mr H lost 
out as these loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit over an extended period of time. Mr H was borrowing from QuickQuid 
for more than two years  without any notable breaks.  This isnt the purpose of these  loans 
and high cost short term credit is unsuitable for long term use  something QuickQuid is 
aware of.
Also, the number  of loans likely had negative implications on Mr Hs ability  to access 
mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Hs complaint about  loans  4 to 8 because  the overall pattern of lending 
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  and he lost 
out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr H in some 
other way.  
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 3 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were  paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
as theres  an outstanding balance on loan 8, QuickQuid should remove any interest 
and charges  applied  to the capital loan amount and if it still owns  the loan, it may 
offset the outstanding  capital amount with the redress.
remove any negative  information about loan 3 from Mr Hs credit file;
Ref: DRN34103934the number of loans taken from loan 4 onwards  means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries  about  4 to 8 should be removed from Mr Hs 
credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Hs 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC should  pay redress  as Ive set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 August 2019.
