The complaint
Ms P complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has unfairly handled a refund for an item 
she purchased and returned and isnt happy information on her account has been deleted.
What happened
Ms P has a PayPal account. She used it to purchase an item from an overseas seller in 
October 2018. Shortly after, she read reviews suggesting the seller sold fake items and she 
decided to cancel the order. She did this via her PayPal account and provided the reason as 
significantly not as described.
The item had already been shipped so PayPal explained she would need to return the item 
to the seller once it was received and then it would make a refund to her account. Ms P 
wasnt happy with this as she said she cancelled the transaction very soon after she placed 
the order and thought the process should have been quicker. 
Sometime later, the item arrived, and Ms P returned it to the seller via registered post. On 
delivery, the seller confirmed the item had been received and PayPal confirmed the money 
would be returned to Ms Ps account. PayPal has said there was a delay in the refund being 
processed due to a system anomaly.
During her dealings with PayPal, Ms P became concerned her account may have been 
hacked as the emails stored on the account were missing certain information. She 
complained to PayPal about this too.
PayPal responded to her enquiries by email a number of times but Ms P remained 
concerned about what had happened and didnt feel her query had been answered. So, 
there was some back and forth before PayPal explained certain information was excluded 
from emails stored on the account for security reasons.
Ms P remained unhappy and brought her complaint to his service. She also raised a number 
of other issues relating to security, her email accounts being hacked and further transactions 
on her PayPal account. Our investigator explained which issues we could consider under 
this complaint, which ones would need to be raised with PayPal first and which would need 
to be looked at by other organisations. 
Overall, the investigator thought PayPal had caused the refund to be more complicated than 
it needed to be and said PayPal should pay Ms P £70 to reflect the trouble and upset it had 
caused. Neither PayPal or Ms P agreed with the investigator so the complaint has come to 
me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
And having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as the investigator and for broadly the 
same reasons. Ill explain my reasoning.
Its clear Ms P has found this complaint, and the other issues shes raised, frustrating and 
stressful to deal with. But that doesnt mean PayPal is automatically responsible for that, 
only if its actions made the situation more stressful for Ms P than it needed to be. Ill be 
considering this when reaching my decision while keeping in mind what I consider to be fair 
and reasonable.
Ms P has submitted extensive evidence on her complaint. Shes also raised a number of 
issues in addition to the original ones she asked us to consider and some of these are being 
looked at under another complaint and some are issues outside our remit.
My role here is to focus on what I consider to the crux of the complaint and that means Ill 
only make comments or findings on those things I think relevant to the decision I need to 
make. Where issues arent relevant to that, I wont comment. 
I consider the crux of this complaint to be threefold. Firstly, whether PayPal handled the 
refund of the item in a fair and reasonable manner. Secondly, whether it satisfactorily 
handled Ms Ps enquiries about missing information from emails stored on her account. And 
lastly, whether PayPal has dealt fairly with the direct debit Ms P says wasnt authorised. Ill 
deal with them in turn.
The refund
Ms P purchased the item and paid by PayPal, using its Pay After Delivery option. With this 
option, the item is dispatched and the purchaser only has to pay for it 14 days later.
Shortly after making the purchase, Ms P changed her mind and filed a significantly not as 
described claim saying she wished to cancel the order. Theres some dispute about this as 
Ms P says she wanted to process a cancellation. PayPal has explained it wasnt possible to 
enforce a cancellation of the order without checking with the seller if the item had already 
been dispatched. I think this was reasonable.
PayPal contacted the seller and it said it had already sent the item. This meant Ms P had to 
wait until the item was received before she could return it to obtain a refund. The item was 
sent from China and took some time to arrive.
During this time Ms P was charged for the item as the 14 day grace period had expired. 
There was a problem with the processing of the payment as the direct debit mandate on 
Ms Ps current account had been cancelled. This caused the payment to be attempted a 
number of times and Ms P says she was charged overdraft fees as a consequence. But Ive 
not seen enough evidence to safely conclude these fees were charged solely as a result of 
PayPals actions.  So, Im not satisfied its fair to hold PayPal responsible for this.
Because of this issue, PayPal took the money from her back-up payment method, the credit 
card recorded on her account. I think this was a reasonable course of action.
Once she received the items, Ms P reiterated her dissatisfaction and returned the them to 
the seller. Im satisfied the terms of the PayPal agreement mean Ms P was responsible for 
the return postage.
A while later, PayPal received confirmation from the seller they were received and so it 
processed the refund. It acknowledges here that the first attempt to process the refund failed 
due to a system anomaly. But it was successfully processed a subsequent time and Ms P withdrew the funds. So Im satisfied the refund was made, albeit not as soon as it should 
have been.
The missing information
Ms P was concerned that when she accessed emails stored on her PayPal account, some of 
the information was missing, specifically, that key data had been redacted. This caused her 
to believe her account, emails and latterly, her computer, had all been hacked. Its clear to 
me she found this distressing.
Theres evidence on file of her emailing PayPal multiple times asking for information about 
why this had happened and if it could shed any light on it. The responses from PayPal were 
varied and sometimes just reiterated the response it had already sent on the complaint about 
the refund. 
Other times it said it didnt understand what she meant and suggested she phone to discuss 
things. It wasnt until a very brief email response on 9 December 2019 that PayPal explained 
that the redaction of the data was a standard security precaution it adopted to protect 
customers data. 
From what Ive seen, this was the explanation and full response to Ms Ps request. And while 
its clear from Ms Ps swift response this didnt resolve the matter for her, I think in part this 
was because of the number of occasions shed asked this question and had unsatisfactory 
responses or PayPal simply hadnt engaged with her query. 
As a result, I think PayPal could have done more here to provide a better explanation to 
Ms P. Because it didnt, I think it caused her more distress than was necessary.
The unauthorised direct debit
Ms P reported a direct debit shed identified on her PayPal account which she said she 
hadnt authorised. The evidence from PayPal and Ms P suggests this related to a continuous 
payment authority shed signed up for some time previously, but I acknowledge she doesnt 
recall this.
Despite the evidence, PayPal agreed as a gesture of goodwill to refund the amount Ms P 
was charged. In doing this, Im satisfied PayPal has done more than I would have asked it to 
do.
Other issues
Ms P continued to be concerned about the issues relating to security and fraud. Whilst she 
didnt explicitly blame PayPal for these issues, it seems she considered it responsible as she 
wanted them included in the complaint against them. She didnt bring any supporting 
evidence to show why she considered it responsible though.
These kinds of issues fall outside the remit of this organisation and I note Ms P has spoken 
to Action Fraud about them so I make no findings here as they may well be better placed to 
comment than me.
She also queried a number of other direct debit mandates set up on her PayPal account. Ive 
seen nothing to suggest these are related to the purchase at the crux of this complaint. 
These issues are now being dealt with under another complaint with this service.Summary
It seems to me this simple transaction became a lot more complicated than it needed to be. I 
think PayPal could have done more to communicate better with Ms P and if it had, I think 
she would have experienced less distress. Having said that, I dont think it was responsible 
for everything Ms P accused it of.
Ive thought carefully about this complaint, and having done so, Ive concluded that the £70 
recommended by the investigator is a fair way for PayPal to recognise the shortcoming Ive 
described above. I realise this is less than Ms P wants and is more than PayPal thinks is 
right, but overall, Im satisfied its fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and instruct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA 
to pay Ms P £70.
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must pay the compensation within 28 days of the date on 
which we tell it Ms P accepts my final decision. If it pays later than this it must also pay 
interest on the compensation from the date of my final decision to the date of payment at 8% 
a year simple.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 September 2020.
