The complaint
Mrs E is unhappy that she was unable to do a balance transfer to a credit card account 
administered by NewDay Ltd.
What happened
In December 2022, Mrs E tried to instruct a balance transfer from a third-party credit account 
to pay off the balance that was present on her NewDay credit card account. But the third-
party bank which Mrs E instructed to complete the balance transfer said that there was a 
problem with the NewDay credit account card details, such that it wasnt possible for them to 
complete a balance transfer to the Mrs Es NewDay account.
Mrs E tried to complete a balance transfer to her NewDay account from a second third-party 
credit account. But the second third-party bank also said they were unable to complete a 
balance transfer to the NewDay account. Mrs E wasnt happy about this, especially as she 
incurred interest on her NewDay balance because she wasnt able to clear what she owed 
on the account by balance transfer as she wanted to. So, she raised a complaint.
NewDay responded to Mrs E and said they didnt feel theyd done anything wrong in how 
theyd administered her account and explained that they cant comment on why a third-party 
bank cant complete a balance transfer. However, as a gesture of goodwill, NewDay 
reimbursed two months of interest payments to Mrs Es account, totalling Â£60.80. Mrs E 
wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel NewDay had acted 
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation and so didnt uphold the complaint. Mrs E 
remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs E has explained to this service that she feels that NewDay issued her a credit card that 
included a card number which mistakenly identified the card as a store card rather than as a 
credit card, and that it was for this reason that she was unable to instruct a balance transfer 
to the card. And Mrs E notes that it was only when she requested and received a 
replacement credit card, which was correctly identified as a credit card and not as a store 
card, that she was able to instruct balance transfers to her NewDay account.
Im not convinced by Mrs Es argument here. One reason for this is because I asked 
NewDay to provide details of the initial and replacement cards that were issued to Mrs E. 
And NewDay have been able to demonstrate to my satisfaction in response that both the 
initial and replacement card were of the same card number type  that is, a credit card, and 
not a store card. 
Notably, I also asked Mrs E to provide any evidence she may have of the difference in the 
card numbers as she was claiming. But Mrs E didnt provide any evidence to support her 
claim, and indeed, she didnt respond to my request at all. 
Furthermore, its notable that Mrs E was able to instruct balance transfers from her NewDay 
account in October and November 2022. And if it were the case that the card registered to 
her account was listed as a store card, and not as a credit card, I feel that these outbound 
balance transfers wouldnt have been possible. As such, I feel that Mrs E being able to 
instruct a balance transfer upon receipt of her new card is likely to be coincidental.
NewDay have explained that Mrs Es credit account had been previously administered by 
another credit provider, and that NewDay issued information about their commencement of 
the account administration in August 2022. As such, while NewDay cant comment on 
exactly why Mrs E couldnt instruct a balance transfer to them  which seem reasonable to 
me, given that Mrs E made the instructions to third-party banks and not to NewDay 
themselves  NewDay hypothesise that it might be the case that the third-party banks hadnt 
updated their understanding of the account, including NewDays new administration of it.
However, it isnt for this service to consider the actions or potential inactions of the third-
party banks here. And this is because this is a complaint against NewDay, meaning that the 
scope of this assessment is focussed solely on whether NewDay should reasonably be 
considered to have done anything wrong or acted unfairly.
And ultimately, I dont feel that NewDay can reasonably be considered to have done 
anything wrong or acted unfairly here. And Im satisfied that whatever trouble and 
inconvenience Mrs E incurred surrounding being unable to instruct third-party banks to 
complete a balance transfer to her NewDay account wasnt in all likelihood the result of any 
error or mistake by NewDay. 
It follows, therefore, that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NewDay to take 
any further or alternative action. I hope that Mrs E will understand, given what Ive explained, 
why Ive made the final decision here that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 December 2023.
