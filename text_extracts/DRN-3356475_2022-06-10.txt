The complaint
Mr B is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his bank account 
with them when he hadnt done anything to breach the terms of the account.
What happened
Mr B had a NatWest current account. In August 2021, Mr B received a letter from NatWest 
which gave him 60-days notice that NatWest would be closing his bank account. Mr B then 
proceeded to move his bank account to another provider using the current account switch 
process. However, he wasnt happy that NatWest had taken the steps they had to close his 
account, so he raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Mr Bs complaint. But they felt that theyd given Mr B fair notice of their 
intention to close his account, and so they didnt uphold his complaint.
Mr B wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also didnt feel that NatWest had 
acted unfairly towards Mr B by deciding to close his account or in how theyd managed the 
account closure, and so they also didnt uphold Mr Bs complaint. Mr B remained 
dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how Mr B may have been upset at receiving the letter from NatWest 
advising they would be closing his account in 60-days time. And this is especially the case 
given that Mr B has autism, which meant that NatWests decision to close his account  and 
the corresponding need for him to open a new account elsewhere  had a particularly 
significant effect on Mr B.
However, in much the same way as a consumer is able to choose which bank account 
providers they want to open an account with, bank account providers themselves  in this 
instance, NatWest  can also decide whether or not they want to continue doing business 
with an existing customer. 
Having reviewed the terms and conditions of the account that Mr B held, its clear that they 
do include permissions for NatWest to close an account, as follows:
12.2 Closure by us
We can close your Foundation account or Basic account immediately if:
 you used or attempted to use your account for illegal purposes;
 you were not entitled to open the account but you provided us with incorrect
information when you applied for your account; or
 you behave in a threatening or violent manner towards our staff.
We can close your Foundation account or Basic account by giving you 60 days 
notice if:
 theres been no transaction in or out of your account for at least 24 months;
 youre no longer legally resident in the European Union; or
 you have access to another current account in the UK which you opened 
after your Foundation or Basic account.
I can confirm to Mr B that NatWest have disclosed the reasons they decided to close his 
account to this service, and having reviewed NatWests reasoning Im satisfied that they 
have acted within the terms and conditions of the account listed above.
Im aware that Mr B would like NatWest to tell him the specific reason they decided to close 
his account, rather than just point to the permissive clauses of the account terms and 
conditions as quoted above. But NatWest have confirmed that they dont disclose the exact 
reasons for account closures to affected customers, and while I can appreciate how this 
might be frustrating for Mr B, I dont feel that NatWests position here is unfair or that they 
should be expected to engage in potentially prolonged dialogue about their decision with a 
customer who may be unhappy with that decision.
Ultimately, while I can appreciate Mr B frustration, Im satisfied that NatWest can reasonably 
decide to close a customers account if they want to do so and if theyre satisfied that the 
closure of that account is permitted by the terms of that account  which in this case, as 
explained above, Im satisfied that they are.
All of which means that I dont feel that NatWest have acted unfairly or unreasonably 
towards Mr B regarding the closure of his account, and it follows from this that I wont be 
upholding this complaint. I realise this wont be the outcome Mr B was wanting, but I trust 
hell understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 July 2022.
