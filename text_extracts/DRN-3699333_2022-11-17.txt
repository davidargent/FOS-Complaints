The complaint
Mr G complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC trading as Barclaycard (Barclaycard) has failed 
to assist him recover £105 following a dispute raised on his credit card. 
What happened
 Mr G purchased flights via a company I shall call P, on 20 April 2022. The total cost was 
£894.21, and the purchase was made by an additional card holder authorised on Mr Gs 
credit card account. Following the purchase, Mr G was sent incorrect travel dates and 
therefore queried this with P straight away.
Mr G has explained that when he spoke to P, an advisor wouldnt book the tickets for dates 
he wanted unless he paid a further £200. P then said if Mr G wanted to cancel, he would 
have to pay a £105 fee. As Mr G didnt want to lose the £894.21 that had already been paid, 
he said he reluctantly agreed to the £105 cancellation fee. 
Mr G contacted Barclaycard for help in retrieving the £105. Barclaycard raised a dispute and 
is satisfied Mr G has now been fully refunded via the chargeback process. Mr G disputed 
this and brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator considered the matter and 
concluded that Mr G had been fully refunded the £894.21 and was therefore not out of 
pocket. 
Mr G disagreed and maintained that he was still owed the outstanding £105. He advised that 
he bank statements dont show he has received the £105. The complaint has therefore been 
passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Barclaycard has provided the credit card statements for Mr Gs account. I have no reason to 
believe these arent true copies or have been doctored in any way. 
Mr Gs statement dated 6 May 2022 shows the £894.21 being debited to P on 20 April 2022. 
A £789.21 credit from P is then shown as being received on 21 April 2022. At this point it is 
clear Mr G is £105 out of pocket. Which is in line with the cancellation fee he says he 
reluctantly agreed to on his call with P. 
Barclaycard has provided system notes that show it raised Mr Gs dispute via the 
chargeback process. It is commonplace for the disputed amount to be credited to the 
account that was originally debited, while the chargeback process is ongoing. 
Taking this into consideration Ive reviewed Mr Gs statement dated 8 June 2022. This 
shows a credit dated 20 April 2022 for a dispute with P. This credit is for the full £894.21. Mr 
G says this isnt showing on his statements when he uses the mobile banking app. He 
therefore doubts whether it is genuine.
On 24 May 2022, the statement also shows a debit to P for £789.21. This is also reflected in 
the screenshots Mr G has provided from his mobile banking app. Therefore, if the credit for 
£894.21 wasnt genuine, then it follows that Mr G would also be out of pocket by the debit of 
£789.21. 
Ive added up all the credits and debits from Mr Gs June 2022 statement and Im satisfied 
the credit of £894.21 and the debit of £789.21 have both been included when calculating his 
outstanding balance. This means Mr Gs balance was reduced by £105 after the debits and 
credits detailed above were applied to his account. 
Im unsure why the credit of £894.21 doesnt show on Mr Gs statements when he looks on 
his mobile banking app. This may be because it was a retrospective credit made following 
the raising of his dispute. However, Im satisfied the statements Ive been provided show it 
was credited and as Ive said I have no reason to doubt the statements provided by 
Barclaycard are genuine. 
In any event, Im satisfied that Mr G had a full refund £789.21 on 21 April 2022 from P 
directly. He was £105 down at that point. He then received the £105 as this was the 
difference between the credit (£894.21) and debit (£789.21) shown on his June 2022 
statement (copy attached).
My final decision
I dont uphold Mr Gs complaint against Barclays Bank UK PLC trading as Barclaycard.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2022.
