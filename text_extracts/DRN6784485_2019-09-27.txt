K821x#15complaint
Mr D complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mr D was given 13 loans  by Sunny  between October 2014 and May 2017. The first loan was 
provided under a running credit  agreement and would be generally repayable over five 
months. The remaining  loans were repayable in 14 monthly instalments. Mr D has fully 
repaid all of his loans and a summary  of his borrowing from Sunny is as follows;

When Mr D first complained to Sunny it agreed that it shouldnt have given the first loan to 
him. But Sunny didnt  think it had been  wrong to agree the remaining loans. So Mr D brought  
his complaint to this Service.
Mr Ds complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think that the offer 
made by Sunny was sufficient. He thought that it had been reasonable for Sunny  to give 
loans 2 to 6 to Mr D. But he didn't think loans 7 to 13 should have been agreed.  So he asked 
Sunny to pay some further compensation to Mr D, in addition  to what it had offered on loan1.
Sunny didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mr D accepts  my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
Ref: DRN67844852my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr D could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint.
Sunny has already accepted that it shouldnt have provided loan 1 to Mr D. So I wont  
consider that loan any further in this decision, save for directing Sunny to pay Mr D the 
compensation it has already offered in respect  of this loan.
Ref: DRN67844853Sunny did some checks before agreed  to give the rest of the loans to Mr D. It asked him for 
details of his income,  and his normal expenditure. And it checked his credit  file before 
agreeing the loans.  Ive seen a summary of those checks and I dont think they showed 
anything that should have  caused  additional  concerns  to Sunny.
As I mentioned earlier most of Mr Ds loans were  repayable over a 14 month  period. So the 
amounts that Mr D needed to repay  each  time were  smaller than if hed taken  a normal  
payday loan. But of course he was committing to making those repayments over a far longer 
period. And at times  Mr D had a number of loans outstanding together.  So Ive needed to 
consider the total amount  that Mr D needed to repay  to Sunny each month.
Mr D often repaid his loans much  earlier than planned. I think this should  have  caused  some 
concerns to Sunny. That might be the sort of behaviour that would indicate  that someone  
was facing problems  managing their money and needing to refinance loans on a regular 
basis. So Ive also taken  that into account  when  looking at whether Sunny should have given 
the loans to Mr D.
There was a gap of over nine months  between Mr D repaying  the first loan and him asking to 
borrow again. I think it would be reasonable therefore for Sunny to have  considered Mr D as 
a new borrower at the time he asked for loan 2 and to base its checks  accordingly.
But I think that given  what Ive said about  Mr Ds borrowing pattern, and that these loans  
were to be repaid  over such an extended  period, Sunny should have taken steps  to verify 
the information that Mr D provided about his income and expenditure. Ive looked at copies 
of Mr Ds bank statements to see what better checks would  have shown Sunny. But from 
those I havent  seen enough to make me to conclude Sunny  it was irresponsible to have 
given loans 2 to 6 to Mr D.
But looking  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr D I think  by loan 7 the 
lender should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise  
harmful. And so Sunny  should have realised  that it shouldnt provide further loans. 
I say this because:
This was now Mr Ds seventh loan request. Hed asked to borrow six times in just 
under a year. Each of the loans  Mr D had taken had been repayable over a period of 
14 months. Mr D regularly  paid those loans off far earlier  than planned, but borrowed 
similar amounts  very shortly afterwards. I think  that pattern  of frequent borrowing and 
repaying early should have indicated to Sunny that Mr D was most likely  having 
significant problems  managing his money. 
When Mr D asked for loan 7 he wasnt making any inroads to the amount he owed 
the lender. Loan  7 was the largest  loan that Mr D had taken for some  time. 
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr D had multiple  loans active at the same time. Towards  the 
end of his borrowing  relationship he had four loans open at the same time. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr D was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loans was leaving in his finances and that 
Mr Ds indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
I think that Mr D lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
Ref: DRN67844854these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ds 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
I have seen that Sunny has said that Mr Ds declared income compared to his monthly 
repayment suggests these loans were  suitable. Therefore it does not accept  the loans 
provided were unaffordable. But Sunny will know from previous decisions (as well as whats  
set out on our website) that there are cases where  this service considers the overall lending 
pattern and not just the affordability of each loan.  When  a consumer borrows numerous  
loans over a long period of time, its most  likely that the loans arent being used for their 
intended purpose of temporary cash flow problems. As Sunny will have seen, the FCA made 
it clear in a recent letter to CEOs  of high cost lending firms that a high volume of 
relending..may be symptomatic of unsustainable  lending patterns. And I think thats the 
case here.
So I dont  think Sunny should  have  agreed  to lend to Mr D from loan 7 onwards. Sunny 
needs to pay Mr D some compensation.
putting things right
Sunny has accepted that it should have lent to Mr D on 15 October  2014  (loan  1). I also 
dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr D after, and including, the loan he was 
given on 9 July 2016 (loans 7 to 13). So for each of those loans Sunny should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr D on the loans.  
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Ds credit file in relation to loan 1.
The number of loans  taken from loans 7 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  7 to 13 should be removed from Mr Ds credit 
file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr D a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Mr Ds complaint and direct  Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things  right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 October  2019.
