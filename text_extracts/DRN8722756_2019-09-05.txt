K822xcomplaint
Mr T complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal)  took a payment from his bank  
account instead of the credit card he said hed chosen to use. Mr T says this meant  that the 
conversion from euros to pounds was carried out by PayPal  instead of his card provider and 
that he suffered  a loss on the exchange rate calculation  equivalent to PayPals  fees. Hed 
like the difference  in the exchange rates  refunded. 
background 
The background to this complaint, and my initial conclusions, were set out in my provisional 
decision dated 6 August  2019  a copy  of which is attached and forms part of this final 
decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I thought PayPals original offer of £100 to resolve  
the complaint  was fair and reasonable in the circumstances  and invited  both parties to 
send any additional  comments  or evidence they wished to make. 
PayPal didnt want to provide any further information  for me to consider and said it accepted 
the provisional decision. But Mr T, although he wanted to accept the compensation, did 
make the following points:
Because hed received a promotional  discount  on the transaction it was financially 
more advantageous to continue with the transaction than to cancel it when  he was 
given that option  by PayPal.
Hed been happy to accept PayPals  offer originally  but wanted  us to look into 
whether this was a one off incident  or an ongoing problem.  Mr T confirmed  he was 
an experienced PayPal user and wanted to help others  and himself  by ensuring 
there wasnt an ongoing problem with PayPals  systems.
He was concerned  about a systems issue because, firstly he wasnt  advised of any 
kind of user error, and also because  PayPal had confirmed the default position had 
occurred because of how his account was set up.
He accepted it was possible for him to have selected the wrong option but said that 
PayPal couldnt  confirm that either.
He thinks it generally unfair  that PayPal doesnt  charge what it displays on the screen 
 with the addition of its fees coming  afterwards.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And, having  considered  Mr Ts further 
points, I see no reason to change the conclusions I came to in my provisional decision.
I note that Mr T wanted us to confirm whether this was an ongoing problem  with PayPals 
systems because he uses it regularly and doesnt  want to suffer  any further  problems. And I 
understand Mr Ts position  here and why he was concerned with what  happened.
Mr T has said that neither  party has been  able to demonstrate  what did actually  happen 
when he tried to use his credit card to pay for the transaction. And as Ive said previously 
there is no way of being able to confirm what happened. But there isnt any evidence for me 
to be able to safely  say PayPals systems were at fault here.  There were a number of 
Ref: DRN87227562different scenarios for what could  have happened here  all of which  might easily have 
occurred, so it wouldnt be fair to rule them all out and say that PayPals system made an 
error, especially when  theres no evidence that happened. 
I explained previously  that I had to make my decision  here on the balance of what  I think 
was most likely to have happened. I decided it was more likely than not that Mr T didnt  
select his credit card, and that the system  carried out the transaction  using PayPals default 
funding source  his bank  account. I havent been  presented with any new information which  
has caused me to consider a different outcome.
my final decision
Both parties  have confirmed the £100 compensation has been credited to Mr Ts PayPal 
account.
So, for the same reasons  Ive already  given  in my provisional decision, I dont uphold Mr Ts 
complaint against  PayPal  Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA in so much as I think the payment  its 
made is a fair and reasonable resolution  to the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 October  2019.

complaint
Mr T complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal)  took a payment from his bank account 
instead of the credit card he said hed chosen to use. Mr T says this meant that the conversion from 
euros to pounds  was carried out by PayPal instead of his card provider  and that he suffered a loss on 
the exchange rate calculation  equivalent to PayPals  fees. Hed like the difference in the exchange 
rates refunded. 
 
background
Mr T bought a phone on an auction website, through PayPal, on 8 August 2018.  He says he wanted 
to use his credit  card  as well as a separate coupon  to pay for the item.  He says thats because  he 
wanted his card issuer to convert the payment from euros to pounds. But he says when  the 
transaction completed the funds had been taken from the bank account that was linked  to his PayPal 
account, which meant PayPal carried out the currency conversion. He says the inclusion of PayPals 
fees for doing this meant he paid more  than he wanted  to. 
Mr T contacted  PayPal straight away and says he was advised that he could  either  dispute the 
payment or cancel it and make the purchase again, but Mr T didnt want to do either  of those things. 
So he complained about the loss hed suffered. PayPal explained that it has a default  payment 
preference when using funds to pay for transactions. The first preference was a balance transfer  then 
a bank transfer and then a card payment.  So  it didnt think it had done anything  wrong as it said it 
had acted within its user agreement   but it offered Mr T £100 as a goodwill gesture to resolve the 
matter. 
Mr T said he would accept  the offer in September 2018 but still wasnt happy about  the currency 
conversion so he brought his complaint to us.
As a result  PayPal didnt make the compensation payment to his account.
One of our adjudicators  looked  into the complaint and thought it should  be upheld.  She said Mr T had 
demonstrated that he was given a choice  of how to make the transaction  and a clear indication of the 
relative costs. She thought he was most likely   on balance  to have chosen to use his credit card. 
And she said PayPal hadnt been able to confirm  that the payment method couldnt  have defaulted to 
his bank account  even if hed chosen to use his credit  card.  She thought that PayPal should refund 
the difference in the exchange rates with interest added at 8%.
PayPal didnt  accept the assessment as it said it had provided screenshots to show Mr T had selected 
his bank account for the transaction. It said it would only agree to pay the £100 compensation  it had 
offered before Mr T brought his complaint to us. 
And Mr T was concerned that following the adjudicators  assessment hed only receive  the difference  
between the exchange rates  and wouldnt get the £100 hed already agreed to. So, as there hasnt 
been a resolution, the complaints been passed  to me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. I can see Mr T feels strongly about this matter and I have some  
sympathy for his position.  He has been clear that he selected  his credit card to be used  for the 
transaction, and says PayPal cant  prove his transaction couldnt have defaulted back to his linked 
bank account. But I think PayPals original offer of £100 to resolve this complaint  is fair and 
reasonable here,  and Ill explain why.
Ref: DRN87227564PayPal has provided a screenshot to show that Mr Ts transaction  was completed using his linked 
bank account and it says theres no evidence that he tried to use his credit card instead. Its also said 
that when a bank account  is used, theres no option  to allow the bank to convert the currency. Thats  
only available when a credit card is used.
But Mr T says he did want to use his credit card and has provided evidence of another transaction  to 
show that he is aware of this option and of PayPals process. He says he would have selected that to 
allow him to convert the transaction through his card issuer. 
Ive looked at PayPals user agreement very carefully. I can see that under funding sources it states 
You can link or unlink  a debit card, a credit card,  a prepaid card (in certain cases), a bank account  
and/or PayPal Credit  as a Funding Source for your Account.  And further You can choose any of the 
funding sources in your account  as your preferred  funding source. So Mr T couldve  used his credit  
card for this transaction. 
Ive also taken  into account that PayPal operates a default funding sources  process  which shows 
the order  in which a funding  vehicle would be used,  and I can see that it applies a bank account 
before a debit  or credit card. So I think that in the absence  of any clear instruction  otherwise,  Mr Ts 
bank account would have  been used as the default position  with the outcome that PayPal would 
have converted his transaction to pounds as indicated  elsewhere in the user agreement. 
So I cant safely say PayPal has acted outside of its user agreement. But to uphold Mr Ts complaint I 
need to be satisfied that he wanted to make his payment with his credit card and that something 
happened at PayPals end which meant that its usual  process wasnt followed here and Mr Ts 
payment wasnt processed as he wanted.
Theres no way of knowing what happened at the point (and shortly  after) Mr T made  the payment  
as theres no evidence available to show  this. So, I have to base my decision on the evidence  that is 
available. 
While I realise Mr T has provided a screenshot of another payment  showing what  it would have 
looked like if hed opted to use his credit card, this doesnt show me what  happened for the payment 
in question. 
PayPal has provided a screenshot to show that the transaction  was made  using the linked bank 
account. And theres no evidence from PayPals systems of any problems or errors at this time to 
suggest that Mr Ts payment was made  this way as the result of a mistake on its part. I know Mr T 
says PayPal hasnt been able to confirm that the system  couldnt have defaulted back to the bank 
account. But to accept that this is most likely here, Id have to rule out a number of other scenarios 
that could just have easily occurred.
Ive carefully considered what Mr T has said here because he has given a very clear account of what  
he says happened. And he has tried to demonstrate  what  he says he did when making this 
transaction. But, based  on the evidence  Ive seen, I cant safely say PayPals systems  made an error 
here. 
So I think on balance, its more  likely  than not, that Mr T didnt select  his credit card to use on this 
occasion, and the default funding source ( the linked  bank  account)  was used instead.  I know that 
this will frustrate Mr T, but I hope hell appreciate  that I have  to reach  my decision impartially. And, 
where information  or evidence is incomplete  and contradictory  as it is here  I must base my 
decision on whats more likely than not to have happened, on balance of all the evidence  available.
I note that in response to his original complaint PayPal offered Mr T £100 to resolve matters. And 
Mr T accepted  this offer as a goodwill gesture although he remained unhappy  about  the fees hed 
been charged  because of the exchange rate issue. PayPal didnt make this payment when  Mr T came 
to us but Ive seen its still prepared to pay the original £100.  So I think thats a fair and reasonable 
offer for any distress and inconvenience Mr T has been caused and any impact this had on him.
