K820x#14complaint
Mr G is complaining on behalf of his business, which I will refer to as D. He says WorldPay  
(UK) Limited wont release payments made  to D. Mr G also complains that WorldPay  closed  
Ds account.
background
Mr G used a merchant account with WorldPay to take card payments for his business. He 
says he took a payment of £6,500 in March 2018, for goods  he provided to a customer, who 
I will refer to as Mr S.
Mr G received notification from WorldPay that the payment hadnt been  authorised  and that 
it was fraudulent. WorldPay asked Mr G to provide more information about the payment and 
his business. In response Mr G sent WorldPay an invoice  dated 15 March  2018, made out to 
Mr S as evidence hed provided  him with goods.  He also provided  WorldPay with paperwork 
to show he traded with Mr S in April and July 2018  to show he was entitled  to the £6,500.
WorldPay wasnt satisfied with the paperwork Mr G provided. So it didnt release the money 
to Mr G. It later gave  Mr G notice  that it was closing Ds account, saying that continuation of 
the agreement  was outside its risk appetite.
An investigator looked into Mr Gs complaint.  She said that WorldPay hadnt done anything  
wrong when it decided to close Mr Gs account. And said D wasnt entitled  to the payment. 
Mr G disagreed. So the matter has come  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
I can understand Mr Gs feelings  on this matter. He says hes lost stock,  and is out of pocket.  
But having  looked at whats happened  here, I have to agree with the investigator,  that 
WorldPay is entitled not to release the payment  to Mr G. Ill explain why.
WorldPay had some concerns about the transaction that had been accepted by D from Mr S. 
I consider that to have been  reasonable in the circumstances. I say this because whilst  I 
appreciate that sales can rise and fall in a business, there were aspects to this transaction 
that were unusual. Having looked  at Mr Gs WorldPay application form which  he completed 
in July 2017; I can see that he told WorldPay that the average card transaction was £3,000. 
The transaction in March  2018, was considerably higher than Mr Gs usual  card transaction  
amount  more  than twice that amount. So I can understand why WorldPay  had some 
concerns and asked  him for more information about the sale and his business.
Unless a card has already  been reported  lost or stolen, the merchant  services  provider wont 
normally know there is a problem until the cardholder objects to the transaction and the 
merchant services provider is notified  of that through the card scheme. And thats whats 
happened in this case - the cardholder didnt authorise the payment. So despite what  Mr G 
says hes not entitled  to the money.  
Ref: DRN44268372Mr G told our investigator and WorldPay that the £6,500 came  from the sale of a wedding  
dress he sold to Mr S, and hes supplied a copy of the invoice for the sale.  Mr Gs also said 
that hes done business with the purchaser since March 2018, and hes provided evidence of 
this. That may well be the case. But unfortunately  this alone is not enough to show  that Mr G 
is entitled to the money. 
I appreciate that Mr G says hes lost a lot of money through this transaction. But a merchant 
could not expect to keep  money that had been  paid to them  by card fraud. It is in the nature 
of this type of card fraud  that the fraudulent use of the card is normally only identified once 
the genuine card holder sees the fraudulent  transaction and reports  it to the card issuer. So 
despite what Mr G says I dont consider that the evidence  hes provided obliges WorldPay to 
release the money for the transaction.
Mr Gs also unhappy that WorldPay closed his account. I can see that on 20 March  2018, 
WorldPay gave Mr G written notice  that it was closing the merchant facility. Im satisfied that 
the notice was in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement. 
In summary,  taking everything  into account,  I find that WorldPay  was entitled to hold back  
the £6,500 and didnt  act unfairly in closing Ds account. So I dont think  WorldPay has done 
anything wrong.
In relation to the withheld funds, I know our investigator has advised Mr G to contact the 
purchaser and to seek legal advice. I cannot add anything further to that advice.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 February  2019.
