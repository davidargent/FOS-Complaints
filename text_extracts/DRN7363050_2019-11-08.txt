The adjudicator concluded that from loan 5, from the information that it had, that it had 
become apparent that Mr M more  likely  than not would have had problems managing  his 
money. The adjudicator  also concluded that the overall pattern of borrowing suggested Mr M 
had become persistently reliant on short-term  loans from loan 8 onwards.
MYJAR didnt accept the adjudicators conclusions.  So as both parties  are still not in 
agreement, the complaint has been passed  to me, an ombudsman, to make  a decision. If Mr 
M accepts my findings it will be legally binding on both parties.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr 
M could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
Ref: DRN73630502the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
MYJAR told us that, when  the loans were  taken, it asked Mr M for details of his income  and 
expenditure costs.  I think those checks were proportionate for the first four loans. Mr M was 
in the early stages  of his relationship with MYJAR and the amounts that 
Mr M needed to repay were relatively  modest compared to his declared income.
Whilst I think by loan 5 MYJAR ought  to be doing  more; for example fully reviewing Mr Ms 
finances and verifying  the information he provided,  I actually think  when MYJAR agreed 
loan 5, it ought to have  realised - without the need  to delve into Mr Ms finances - that Mr M 
was having difficulty  repaying his short term loans  and couldnt really  afford  to repay  them in 
a sustainable  way. I say this because:
There was a pattern  emerging  of credit being  taken out shortly after the previous 
loans had been repaid.
The loans taken  by Mr M were for either  the same amount as previous loans or were 
increasing.
Ref: DRN73630503On each occasion, Mr M was borrowing further to meet the gap repaying the previous loan 
had left in his finances  and as I have already mentioned  Mr M was not making any inroads 
into the amounts  he was borrowing.  Mr M was showing signs  by the time he applied  for loan 
5 of being unable to meet his repayments without having to borrow  further. In these 
circumstances, I think  MYJAR  ought to have realised there was a significant  risk Mr M 
wouldve been unable  to sustainably meet his repayments from loan 5 onwards.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MYJARs  lending history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR  should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think that this point was reached  by 
loan 8. I say this because:
As I have already  mentioned  a pattern had emerged where Mr M was borrowing 
shortly after he repaid his previous loan. I think that by loan 8, MYJAR ought fairly 
and reasonably to have  regarded  that pattern as established.
So MYJAR ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr M was having  to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ms indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR and by this 
stage his borrowing  had increased.  Loan  8 was taken out 7 months after Mr Ms 
second loan. And it was for 5 times the amount  he initially  borrowed. 
Mr M had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to MYJAR  over 
an extended period.
I think that Mr M lost out because MYJAR  continued to provide  borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness  by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The sheer number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ms 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 8, 9 and 10 as well as loan 5, 6 and 7 and 
MYJAR should put things right as set out below.
Putting things right
MYJAR  shouldnt  have  given  Mr M loans  5-10.
If MYJAR has sold the outstanding  debt it should buy this back  if it is able to do so and 
then take the following steps.  If MYJAR is not able to buy the debt back then it should liaise 
with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined below.
Ref: DRN73630504A.Add together the total of the repayments  made  by Mr M towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without  an outstanding  balance.  I understand  this is 
all loans  except  loan 10.
B.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by Mr M which were 
considered  as part of A, calculated from the date Mr M originally  made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint  is settled.
C.Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on loan 10, and treat any 
repayments made  by Mr M as though  they had been repayments of the principal  
on loan 10. If this results  in Mr M having made  overpayments then MYJAR should 
refund  these  overpayments with 8% simple  interest* calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the 
complaint is settled.  MYJAR should then refund the amounts  calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D.If there is still an outstanding balance  on loan 10 then the amounts  calculated in A 
and B should  be used to repay this balance remaining on outstanding loans. If 
this results in a surplus then the surplus should  be paid to Mr M. However if there  
is still an outstanding  balance  then MYJAR should try to agree an affordable  
repayment  plan with Mr M.
E.Remove  any adverse information MYJAR  has recorded on Mr Ms credit file in 
relation to loans  5, 6 and 7. The overall pattern of Mr Ms borrowing for loans  8, 9 
and 10 mean  any information recorded about  them is adverse, so MYJAR should  
remove  these loans entirely from Mr Ms credit file. If MYJAR has sold loan 10 it 
should ask the debt purchaser to do the same and remove adverse information it 
may have reported about his loan. 
*HM Revenue  & Customs  requires  you to deduct  tax from this interest.  You should  give 
Mr M a certificate  showing  how much  tax youve  deducted,  if he asks  for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold  Mr Ms complaint. I require MYJAR Limited trading 
as MYJAR  to put things right for Mr M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 December 2019.
