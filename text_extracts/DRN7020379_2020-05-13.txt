Mr T says Elevate  Credit  International Limited trading as Sunny irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 36 pay day loans Sunny provided to Mr T between August  2017 to 
April 2019. Mr Ts first 10 loans with Sunny were as follows:
Loan Date

7 16/11/2017 24/11/2017 6 150 £86.88
8 17/11/2017 22/12/2017 6 50 £103.55
9 20/11/2017 22/12/2017 6 50 £120.22
10 17/12/2017 25/01/2018 6 50 £50.01
The loans taken  after loan 10 were  for between  £50-£100. The most recent adjudicator  to 
review the case upheld Mr Ts complaint and thought the loans 5-10 shouldnt  have been 
given to Mr T as there were signs he was having issues managing his money.  He also 
thought that loan 10 onwards shouldnt have  been  given as by this stage Mr T had become 
reliant on short term lending. 
Sunny didnt agree with the view, explaining that it carried out adequate checks and there 
were not adequate signs to show Mr T was having  issues managing his finances. But it 
made an offer on loan 25 onwards. This offer was outlined to Mr T, but he chose not to 
accept it.  
As no agreement could be reached, the complaint  was passed to me  an ombudsman  for
a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure
Mr T could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks  could take into
account a number of different things, such as how much  was being lent, the repayment
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages
Ref: DRN70203792of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks might be reasonable and
proportionate. But certain factors might point  to the fact that Sunny should  fairly and
reasonably have done more able for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this
is the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on
time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to
meet the repayments. And it follows  that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do any more  when it lent Mr T loans1 to 4.
Mr T didnt  disagree with this, so I wont be making  further findings on these loans, but I
have considered them when looking at Mr Ts borrowing history and his financial situation
overall.
I agree  with our adjudicator and I think  if Sunny had properly  considered  Mr Ts financial 
situation when  he applied for loan 5 I think it would have seen that Mr T was having  issues 
managing his finances. I say this because Mr T was borrowing was borrowing in quick  
succession. Mr T took out loan 4 around  a week after loan 3. And loan 5 was taken the day 
after loan 4 and was for the same amount. By the time loan 5 was given Mr T had loans 2,3, 
and 4 running. 
Given Mr Ts borrowing within a relatively  short time frame I think it wouldve been  clear to 
Sunny that Mr T may have been  struggling financially. Sunny was under a duty to ensure the 
lending could be sustainably  repaid  and in Mr Ts case I dont  think it was. And I think  this 
wouldve been clear  to Sunny by the time Mr T took out loan 5. And looking at Mr Ts 
borrowing pattern  from loan 5 to 10 there  was a gap of around 4 weeks  until loan 6 was 
Ref: DRN70203793taken out but then Mr T took out four loans in less than ten days. And many  of these loans 
were also running concurrently.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T with a view to
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ts case,  I think that this point was reached  by
loan 10. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr T was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr T had taken out 10 loans in just around 4 months. Many of the loans 
until loan 10 were  taken out within days of each  other. So Sunny ought  to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mr T was having to borrow further to cover  the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ts 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ts first loan was for £100 and his subsequent loans varied in amount. And 
although loan 10 was for £50 Mr T was asking for multiple  £50 loans within days  of 
each other. At this point Sunny ought  to have known that Mr T was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need.
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  36 was
taken out almost two years after Mr Ts first. Mr T had also paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr T lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 10
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely to
have had negative  implications on Mr Ts ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 5 onwards and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Elevate Credit International Limited shouldnt have given Mr T loan 5 onwards.
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts it should buy these back  if it is able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If Sunny is not able to buy the debts back then it should liaise 
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
 
A)Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Mr T towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything  Sunny has already refunded. 
B)Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual payments made by 
Ref: DRN70203794Mr T which were  considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr T originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint  is settled. 
C)Sunny  should  remove all interest,  fees and charges  from the balance  on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made by Mr T as though they had been  
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr T having  
made overpayments  then Sunny should  refund these overpayments  with 8% simple  
interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments  would 
have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Sunny  should  then refund  the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step E.
D)If there  is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts  calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus, then the surplus should  be paid to Mr T. However if there  is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan 
with Mr T. 
E)Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  it has recorded  on Mr Ts credit  file in 
relation to loans  5-10. The overall  pattern of Mr Ts borrowing for loan 10 onwards 
means any information recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove  
these loans entirely from Mr Ts credit  file. If Sunny has sold any of the loans it 
should ask the debt purchaser to do the same. Sunny does not have to remove the 
outstanding loan from Mr Ts credit file until its been repaid, but it should still remove  
any adverse information recorded about  this loan.  
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  you to deduct tax from this interest.  Sunny  should give Mr T a 
certificate showing  how much tax youve deducted, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Ts complaint. Elevate Credit  International 
Limited should put things right for Mr T as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman ask Mr T to accept or reject  my decision before 
13 June 2020.
