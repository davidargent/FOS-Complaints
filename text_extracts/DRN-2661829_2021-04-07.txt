The complaint
Mr C complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Black Horse Limited, trading as Land Rover Financial Services, wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mr C under a hire purchase agreement with Land Rover Financial 
Services that he electronically signed in January 2018. The price of the car was £51,854.20, 
he paid a deposit of £3,250 and agreed to make 48 monthly payments of £747.90 and a final 
payment of £20,978 for the car to be supplied to him.
There were some issues with the car so Mr C complained to Land Rover Financial Services 
in July 2020. It accepted that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality and said that it would 
collect the car and close the agreement. It also said that it would refund £3,754.95 to Mr C 
(based on a fair usage charge) and pay him £600 for the trouble and upset caused. 
Mr C didnt accept those payments so the car wasnt collected from him and he complained 
to this service. Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She 
considered that the payments offered by Land Rover Financial Services (including £80 for 
the transfer of his private registration number) were reasonable (and potentially higher than 
she would have awarded). 
Mr C has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He has responded to 
the investigators recommendations in detail, including an analysis of the applicable sections 
of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, and says that his deposit, the cost of the tracker and 
personal registration number, and the impact on his credit rating havent been considered. 
He says, in summary and amongst other things, that Land Rover Financial Services has 
accepted that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality, hes rejected the car, the agreement has 
been terminated so he has no further obligation to make payments and the car remains 
available for collection. He says that hes considering taking legal action against Land Rover 
Financial Services. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances - although we do take account of applicable law and 
regulations we also consider the overall situation (so its possible that a court would 
reach a different outcome to the decision that Ive made);
Land Rover Financial Services has accepted that the car wasnt of satisfactory 
quality so it offered to refund £3,754.95 to Mr C, to pay him £600 for the trouble and 
upset caused and said that it would collect the car and end the agreement  so the 
total payment offered to Mr C by Land Rover Financial Services was £4,354.95;
the refund of £3,754.95 was based on a fair usage charge of 45p for each of the 
42,849 miles that had been driven in the car  which was then deducted from the 30 
monthly payments that Mr C had made for the car (the refund should have been 
£3,154.94 but Land Rover Financial Services used a figure of £3,754.95 in its final 
response letter);
in circumstances such as these I consider that its fair and reasonable for a consumer 
to pay for the use that theyve had from the car - but rather than using a rate per mile 
I would base the refund on the number of monthly payments;
the permitted maximum mileage specified in the agreement was 81,667 and the final 
response letter referred to Mr Cs mileage as being 42,849 so I consider that it would 
be fair and reasonable for Land Rover Financial Services to have kept the monthly 
payments that Mr C had made under the agreement as payment for that usage - but I 
would have said that it should refund to Mr C the deposit of £3,250 that hed paid for 
the car (with interest) and that it should pay him some compensation for the distress 
and inconvenience that hed been caused;
I dont consider it to be likely that the total amount that I would have said it should 
pay to Mr C in these circumstances would be significantly more than £4,354.95 so I 
consider that Land Rover Financial Services offer to pay him that amount was fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr C didnt accept that offer so the car wasnt collected from him and hes continued 
to use it - the car passed an MOT test in December 2020 when its mileage was 
recorded as 50,341;
Mr C hasnt made any further payments for the car since Land Rover Financial 
Services final response letter to him and earlier this month it said that his account 
was in arrears by £5,235.30 (which is seven monthly payments);
I consider that its fair and reasonable for Mr C to be required to pay for the use that 
hes had from the car since August 2020 and I would consider it to be fair and 
reasonable for Land Rover Financial Services to keep the monthly payments set out 
in the agreement for that period;
Land Rover Financial Services has agreed to pay £80 to Mr C to reimburse him for 
the cost of transferring his private registration number;
Mr C says that it should also reimburse him for the cost of insurance, road tax, new 
tyres, a tracker and shine protection for the car  but insurance, road tax and tyres 
are normal running costs of a car and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Land Rover Financial Services to reimburse him for 
those costs;
it was Mr Cs choice to pay for the shine protection and tracker for the car and hes 
had the benefit of them for more than three years and 50,000 miles so Im not 
persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Land Rover Financial 
Services to refund the cost of them to him;
Land Rover Financial Services is required to report true and accurate information 
about Mr Cs payment history to the credit reference agencies  Mr C hasnt made 
any payments to it for the car since August 2020 but still has it and has continued to 
use it and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that its reported 
untrue or inaccurate information to the credit reference agencies; andI consider that Land Rover Financial Services responded to Mr Cs complaint fairly 
and reasonably and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
require it to take any action in response to Mr Cs complaint.
Mr C says that hes considering taking legal action against Land Rover Financial Services 
but I suggest that he contacts it to try to arrange for the car to be collected and to agree a 
payment arrangement for the arrears on his account  it can then deduct the payments that 
its offered to him from those arrears or make a payment to him.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 May 2021.
