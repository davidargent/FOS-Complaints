K821x#15complaint
Mr M says Elevate Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny)  irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr M says he had poor mental health  at the time of the borrowing which  made him 
vulnerable. He told us that Sunny didnt explain how the lending worked or what  he would be 
repaying, nor did it ask about  his personal  circumstances.

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ms complaint and thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been  given because his borrowing  behaviour suggested he was 
becoming persistently  reliant on the short-term  borrowing. 
Sunny disagreed but as a gesture  of goodwill offered to offer redress for loan six onwards 
but this didnt include the interest we would have  expected to have been offered. But we did 
put the offer to Mr M which he rejected.
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN59745382Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr M didnt  comment  on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt  be upheld.  
Because of this, I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  these  loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But the loans were  part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr M had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint. After  doing so, Ive decided to uphold  
the complaint  in part. Ill explain why.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Ref: DRN59745383Like the adjudicator,  given  the particular circumstances  of Mr Ms case, I think  that this point 
was reached by loan six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr M was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr M had taken  out six loans  within  four months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr M was having to borrow  further to cover  
the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Ms 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr M was regularly  repaying his loans  much earlier than the agreed loan term. And 
while I appreciate  this would have saved  him interest charges it can equally be a sign 
that someone is juggling their finances and potentially re-borrowing to repay  current  
debt. 
For all of the lending  Mr M was provided  with a new loan within  weeks of settling a 
previous one. Again, a further suggestion that Mr M was becoming  reliant  upon  short-
term lending and it was becoming unsustainable. I would question  why someone who 
was repaying their loans early  would then go on to take out a new loan. 
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  16 was 
taken out ten months after Mr Ms first. And it was for the same amount. Mr M had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans which Mr M borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans six to 16 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  six to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  six to 16 should  be removed from 
Mr Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN59745384my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 May 2020.
