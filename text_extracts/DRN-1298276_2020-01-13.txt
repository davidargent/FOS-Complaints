The complaint
Mr B contacted TransUnion International UK Limited (TransUnion) to get a copy of his free 
statutory credit report. TransUnion says it sent the report to him, but Mr B didnt receive it.
What happened
On 29 June 2019, Mr B sent TransUnion a letter asking for a copy of his free statutory credit 
report. On 15 July 2019, when the report still hadnt arrived, Mr B called TransUnion to find 
out what was going on. The person he spoke to confirm that TransUnion had logged Mr Bs 
request on the 4 July 2019 and that the report had been generated and sent to him on the 7 
July 2019. 
Mr B became very upset while speaking to the TransUnion representative as he was 
concerned that his credit report was potentially lost and could have been accessed by a third 
party. He said the report remained the responsibility of TransUnion until it was delivered to 
him and that it the onus was on TransUnion to ensure his data would not be compromised or 
left open to identity theft. He made a formal complaint about what had happened asking 
TransUnion to pay for credit monitoring services for a period of six years in order to ensure 
his information hadnt been compromised. He also asked for up to Â£1,000 compensation for 
the distress the lost report had caused him. 
TransUnion responded to Mr Bs complaint and confirmed that it had sent the report to him 
via first class post. It explained that while Mr B had originally been told by the representative 
he spoke to on the phone that the report had been sent on the 7 July 2019, it had actually 
been sent on 9 July2019. However, it explained that once the report was posted TransUnion 
was no longer responsible for it. It said if the report had been lost Mr B needed to contact 
Royal Mail to see if it could help him track it. It arranged for another report to be sent by 
tracked mail to Mr B, which he received the following morning. 
TransUnion also mentioned in its written response to Mr B that it was no longer prepared to 
discuss his complaint with him over the phone or in writing and that if he remained unhappy 
with its response he should bring his complaint to this service to consider. 
Mr B brought his complaint to our service and explained that hes very worried about what 
could be done with the data in his credit report and how it could be used to steal his identity 
which is why he wants TransUnion to pay for monitoring services on his credit file. He was 
also unhappy that TransUnion had told him in its final response letter that it wouldnt discuss 
the complaint any further with him. He said this showed TransUnion didnt care about what 
itd done and he believes the mix up with the dates the information was sent to him indicates 
TransUnion hasnt been honest in its response.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Bs complaint already. He said person Mr B had 
spoken to on the phone had caused confusion by saying the report had been sent out on 7 
July, when it was actually sent out on 9 July. But he was satisfied the report had been sent 
and agreed TransUnion had no responsibility for it once it had been posted. He suggested Mr B consider contacting Royal Mail to see if the report could be traced that way, but didnt 
think there was anything more TransUnion needed to do in relation to the issue. 
Mr B didnt agree and has said he thinks TransUnion are lying about sending out the report 
in question. He asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint and so its been passed to 
me to consider.
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, Im not going to uphold 
Mr Bs complaint and Id like to explain why.
In complaints such as these where we are trying to investigate what has happened to a 
seemingly lost letter, we ask the business to provide us with evidence to show that the letter 
was posted as requested. In Mr Bs case TransUnion has sent us a screenshot of its system 
data relating to Mr Bs report request. Having reviewed this I am satisfied that TransUnion 
logged Mr Bs request and sent the report to him on 9 July 2019 as it says it did. 
TransUnion has explained its reports are sent by first class with Royal Mail. There is an 
option for people to request the report be sent by recorded delivery but there is a separate 
charge for that service. Mr B opted for the free delivery and, as there arent any 
requirements for how companies like TransUnion should send their credit reports, I dont 
think it was unreasonable for them to send the report in the post without it being tracked. 
Mr B has said that the report remains the responsibility of TransUnion until it is delivered in 
his hands. When he spoke to our investigator he mentioned this was the case when he 
bought physical goods from online stores and so it should be the same with his credit report. 
However, as Mr B didnt pay anything for the credit report, and the transaction didnt involved 
any physical goods, the same level of responsibility isnt placed on the company sending the 
information to him. I can fully understand why Mr B wouldve expected this, especially given 
the nature of the information in the letter, but in this instance TransUnion cant be held 
responsible for letters that may go missing once in transit. The only company that may be 
able to help track letters once theyve been posted is the postal company, in this instance, 
Royal Mail. 
So although I can appreciate why this has caused Mr B so much worry and why he believed 
TransUnion should be held responsible, I cant ask it to do anymore in relation to his 
complaint. I say this because Im satisfied TransUnion sent the letter as requested, and Im 
also satisfied that TransUnion arent responsible for the letter not being delivered. And 
because its not responsible for what went wrong here, it wouldnt be fair or reasonable of 
me to ask it to compensate Mr B.
Mr B has also said the letter TransUnion sent to him, saying it wouldnt discuss his complaint 
with him any further, to be indicative of the poor service hed received since making his 
complaint. Ive listened to the calls between Mr B and the TransUnion representative and its 
clear Mr B was very frustrated and upset at the prospect of his personal information 
potentially being accessed by a third party. And I can understand why. The call did become 
unproductive and when we asked TransUnion why it had included this wording in the letter it 
said it believed there was nothing left it could do to help Mr B in regards to his complaint. So 
while I appreciate it may have upset Mr B further to read that, having listened to the call, I do 
understand why TransUnion believed it was necessary to include it and I wont be asking it 
to do anything else in relation to Mr Bs complaint.
My final decisionFor the reasons set out above I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint against TransUnion 
International UK Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 February 2020.
