The complaint
Mr O complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr O and his wife entered into an acquisition agreement for a holiday club membership in 
August 2009 and Mr O also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance to pay for the membership. Mr Os representative made a claim to Barclays Partner 
Finance under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act in August 2018 that the 
membership had been misrepresented to Mr O and his wife and that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr O and Barclays Partner Finance.
Barclays Partner Finance said that the Limitation Act 1980 states that a claimant has six 
years from the date of a cause of action to bring a claim and that Mr O was out of time to 
bring any claim in respect of the acquisition agreement. It also set out other reasons that it 
considered that Mr Os claims shouldnt be upheld. Mr O wasnt satisfied with its response so 
a complaint was made to this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He said that Mr Os 
claim was more than likely time barred under the Limitation Act so he thought that Barclays 
Partner Finances decision not to look into his claim under sections 75 and 140A was fair.
Mr Os representative has asked, on his behalf, for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, 
that:
no affordability checks were undertaken by the holiday company;
high pressure sales techniques were used and the holiday companys tactics were 
undue influence on Mr O;
Mr O was told that the membership was an investment;
the holiday company acted as an unauthorised broker for Barclays Partner Finance;
the rate of interest under the loan agreement was unaffordable for Mr O so he repaid 
the loan and borrowed from another lender at a more affordable rate  if he hadnt 
done so the first loan  and the limitation period - would have continued;
the holiday company received commission from Barclays Partner Finance which 
wasnt disclosed to Mr O, he was unaware that that gave rise to an unfair relationship 
under section 140A and Barclays Partner Finance should be required to provide 
details of the commission;
the misrepresentations were fraudulent and Mr O couldnt have known that they were 
fraudulent until he received advice from it; and
section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act extends the limitation period in these 
circumstances.
It has also provided a statement from Mr O about what happened before he and his wife 
entered into the acquisition agreement.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Os complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down his claims under the 
Limitation Act and I accept that his complaint was referred to this service within six 
years of that happening - but I need to consider whether Barclays Partner Finance 
has acted fairly in saying that  the Limitation Act applies to those claims;
Mr Os claims are under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  in this 
decision Im not determining the outcome of those claims as only a court would be 
able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Os claim under section 75 is that the membership was misrepresented to him 
and his wife and that they wouldnt have entered into the acquisition agreement if it 
hadnt been misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr O could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into entering into the acquisition agreement in August 2009 as that was when they 
entered into an agreement based on the alleged misrepresentations of the holiday 
company and say that they suffered a loss as Mr O entered into the loan agreement 
with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the membership;
I consider that Mr Os cause of action accrued at about that time, so he would have 
had six years from then to bring a claim against either the holiday company or 
Barclays Partner Finance  but he didnt make a claim against Barclays Partner 
Finance until August 2018, about nine years later which was outside of the time limits 
set out in the Limitation Act;Mr Os representative says that Mr O only became aware that he could make a claim 
to Barclays Partner Finance after he sought advice from it  but when he had the 
knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist him for the purposes of the Limitation Act  
the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are extended where a 
claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but I 
dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr Os claims;
section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors 
right of action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation 
doesnt begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with 
reasonable diligence have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that 
deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some 
time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Mr O and his representative have set out what they say happened before Mr O and 
his wife entered into the acquisition agreement and Mr O entered into the loan 
agreement in August 2009  but I dont consider that theres enough evidence to 
show that theres been a fraudulent misrepresentation by the holiday company or a 
deliberate concealment of any relevant information  I consider that many of the 
things that they say werent right would have been known to Mr O and his wife at the 
time that they entered into those agreements  so I dont consider that section 32 is 
applicable in these circumstances;
Mr Os representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr O and 
Barclays Partner Finance and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Mr O repaid the loan in July 2010 when he paid Â£23,641.05 to Barclays Partner 
Finance by cheque  Mr Os representative says that Mr O borrowed from another 
lender at a more affordable rate to repay the loan but I consider that its the date that 
the loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance ended thats relevant for limitation 
purposes and that Mr O would have needed to make a claim against Barclays 
Partner Finance within six years of July 2010  but his claim wasnt made to Barclays 
Partner Finance until August 2018, more than eight years later, which was outside of 
the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mr Os representative has said that Barclays Partner Finance should have told 
Mr O about any commission that it paid to the holiday company for arranging the 
loan  but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if 
any, was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid 
it tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment and I 
dont consider that it was under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any 
commission paid in these circumstances - I also dont consider that the level of 
commission that was normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high 
to mean that Barclays Partner Finance should have appreciated that not 
disclosing any commission to Mr O risked the relationship being unfair under 
section 140A;Mr Os representative says that no affordability checks were undertaken by the 
holiday company but Ive seen no other evidence to show that the loan was 
unaffordable for Mr O at the time that the loan was made to him and he didnt 
complain to Barclays Partner Finance about the affordability of the loan or ask it for 
any information about the affordability assessment until after August 2018 so I 
consider it to be more likely than not that any complaint about the affordability of the 
loan would now be time barred; 
Mr Os representative says that Mr O and his wife were told that the membership was 
an investment and that the holiday company acted as an unauthorised broker  but 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they were told that the 
membership was an investment and I understand that the holiday company held the 
required authorisation at the time of the sale so Im not persuaded that it acted as an 
unauthorised broker when the loan was arranged - and I consider that any such 
claims would now also be time-barred as the acquisition agreement and loan 
agreement were entered into in August 2009 but no complaint was made about those 
issues until after August 2018  more than nine years later;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday 
company has breached any laws or other legal requirements for which Barclays 
Partner Finance would be liable;
Ive carefully considered Mr Os description of what happened before he and his wife 
entered into the acquisition agreement and Ive also considered what this service has 
learnt about the sales processes that were typically used by holiday companies in 
similar circumstances  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that Mr O and his wife were unduly pressured into entering into the acquisition 
agreement or that Mr O was unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement 
in August 2009 or that the holiday company used unacceptable commercial practices 
against them  they didnt complain to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues 
until August 2018  about nine years after they entered into the agreements and I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have complained to Barclays 
Partner Finance about any such issues before then; 
Barclays Partner Finance said that Mr O was out of time to bring any claim in respect 
of the acquisition agreement and I consider that its response to Mr Os claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr O and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their holiday 
club membership and the difficulties that hes described, but I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr O any of 
the money that hes paid under the loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or 
to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Os complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2022.
