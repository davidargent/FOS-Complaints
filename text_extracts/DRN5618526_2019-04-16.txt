K820x#14complaint
Mr A complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA  (PayPal)  took too long to process a 
refund.
background
On 26 April 2018 Mr A sent a payment  via PayPal. The purchase was cancelled the next day 
and the seller refunded the money to Mr As PayPal account. But in mid May,  when  Mr A got 
his statement, he noticed PayPal hadnt  refunded the payment to his credit  card.
So he complained to them and they initially  blamed his credit  card supplier who in turn 
blamed them. The money appeared on Mr As statement on 21 May. Mr A says,  whilst the 
sum involved was only just under Â£10, he was concerned about the way the refund was 
managed and worried that he could  easily have missed that the payment hadnt  been made. 
PayPal didnt provide a final response in the requisite timeframe  so Mr As complaint was 
referred to this service.
Our adjudicator thought PayPal had made  a mistake  but he didnt think  they needed to take 
further action. He noted that PayPal had credited Mr As PayPal account on 26 April, before 
theyd requested any money  from Mr As credit card. So on 27 April when the seller returned 
the sum,  PayPal hadnt had any money from Mr A. They didnt  request the money from 
Mr As credit  card account until 7 May and therefore the refund wasnt completed until 21 
May. So he accepted that a mistake had been  made but he explained that this service  had to 
consider the detriment that had been  caused to a consumer when a mistake had been made 
and here,  as the sum was so small and the refund  had been made the next month,  he didnt 
think it would  be reasonable to ask PayPal to pay any compensation.
But Mr A disagreed. He was disappointed PayPal hadnt apologised and thought this service 
should hold them accountable for their mistake  and he wanted to see evidence  that wed 
been critical of their service. So he asked  for a final decision by an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Ive reviewed this case and find myself in agreement with the adjudicator.  I can see that an 
error has occurred and can understand Mr As frustration. His payment should have been 
refunded sooner. But I dont think it would be reasonable to ask PayPal to pay any form of 
redress in the circumstances  as the sums  involved, and the delay, have  been  very minimal. 
This services primary aim is to settle disputes between financial  institutions  and their 
customers. We dont fine businesses and we are not their regulators (thats the job of the 
Financial Conduct  authority  (FCA)). But, where we think something has gone wrong,  we 
have the power  to tell businesses what they must  do to provide, what we believe, having 
reviewed all the evidence,  is a reasonable settlement.
I can understand that Mr A may question the processes  PayPal are using and that he may 
wish to ensure these processes dont fail again. But its not the job of this service  to tell 
PayPal how to manage their business.  We get involved when things go wrong  and we help 
to ensure that any disputes are settled  reasonably.  The fact that this case has been found in 
Ref: DRN56185262Mr As favour has been reported and its expected that businesses will act on the statistics 
that these records  generate.  But its not for this service to insist  they do.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given I uphold this complaint and record  it against  PayPal  Europe  Sarl & 
Cie, SCA but I dont  ask them to pay any redress.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 May 2019.
