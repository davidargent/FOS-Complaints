The complaint
Mr C complains about how National Westminster Bank Plc responded when he said he 
couldnt afford his monthly loan payments. He said NatWest didnt explain the implications of 
missing payments, and hes now being asked to pay much more interest.
What happened
Mr C told us he was trying to get his finances in order, but NatWest had refused to extend 
the term of his loan. Instead, it demanded he pay over £4,000 in arrears. Mr C said hed 
complained, but NatWest just wouldnt help. So he wanted us to look into this. 
NatWest said it had given Mr C a six-month payment break under the special coronavirus 
pandemic rules, running from November 2021 to April 2021. In June, NatWest sent him 
paperwork to extend the term of his loan, to cover the payments and interest hed missed 
during this time. But Mr C then contacted NatWest, on 24 June, to say he wasnt able to 
keep paying his monthly loan payments. He told NatWest he was also in arrears with a 
different loan at the time. So NatWest put his loan on hold, to give him breathing space, and 
suggested he talk to a debt management company which is free to use. 
The next day, Mr C got in touch again, to say his monthly payment had been taken by direct 
debit. NatWest sent this money back to him. 
Mr C spoke to NatWest again in July, and said he still couldnt afford his monthly payments. 
NatWest said then his loan was still on hold, it wasnt expecting him to make his payments 
for the moment, and he had until the start of September to work out what he wanted to do. 
In September, Mr C spoke to NatWest, and said he could now afford the payments again. 
He wanted to start paying what hed paid before. NatWests notes from the time say it 
thought the best option for him was to refinance the loan. Mr C complained that NatWest 
would no longer offer him the option of a term extension, and NatWest said it wouldnt do 
that, because of the level of arrears on his account. It said its process is not to offer a term 
extension to someone with such a high level of arrears. Mr C told NatWest that if hed known 
this, he would have kept making his monthly payments. 
NatWest said Mr C had been clear with it in June, and then again in July, that he couldnt 
meet his monthly payments. So it still thought it had done the right thing by allowing him a 
break in his payments, to give him breathing space. It wouldnt uphold his complaint, or 
reconsider its decision about a term extension. But in November NatWest refinanced Mr Cs 
loan, which lengthened the overall term and reduced his monthly repayments from around 
£500 to around £300. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said it was fair and 
reasonable, when Mr C said he couldnt pay his monthly payment, and was behind with 
another loan, for NatWest to respond by putting his payments on hold, and referring him to a 
debt management company
Our investigator said when Mr C contacted newest again in September, to say that he could 
start making his payments again, NatWest wouldnt offer him a payment plan, because he 
couldnt afford to restart his regular monthly payments and pay towards the arrears. She said 
that wasnt unfair, NatWest had to be sure Mr C could afford any payment arrangement it 
reached with him. She understood Mr Cs position, that if hed been told about the impact of 
putting his account on hold, he would have kept making his payments. But she said hed 
repeatedly told NatWest he couldnt afford that, so she didnt think he would have been able 
to do that.
Our investigator said that refinancing Mr Cs loan hadnt put him in a worse position. The 
interest rate on his refinanced loan was lower than the original amount. And if Mr C wanted 
to make overpayments to the loan, he could, which would reduce the interest and total 
amount payable on his new loan. 
Mr C wrote to disagree. He said he would have acted differently if hed been told he couldnt 
go back to his original loan agreement. He said he wanted to pay NatWest more, but all 
NatWest wanted him to do was speak to the debt management company. So his options 
were an IVA or bankruptcy, if he couldnt pay all of the arrears, around £4,500, off at once. 
Mr C said that NatWest only discussed refinancing when he called back, distressed at the 
prospect of an IVA. 
Mr C said that he was only on a payment plan now, paying about £300 a month. His loan 
hadnt yet been refinanced, and he was scared he was going to end up paying much more. 
He didnt think that what had happened to him was fair. 
Our investigator didnt change her mind. She still thought Mr C wasnt able to continue to pay 
his loan in June and July, because hed been clear with NatWest that he couldnt pay. 
Our investigator said that she understood Mr C had spoken to the debt management 
company, which had suggested an IVA or bankruptcy to Mr C. When Mr C then told NatWest 
he could make his payments again, in September, NatWest discussed a repayment plan 
with Mr C. It went through an income and expenditure assessment which showed he couldnt 
afford that. But she thought it did also discuss refinance with him then, because it made him 
aware that this would mean his overdraft would be removed. 
Our investigator didnt think that NatWest had suggested an IVA or bankruptcy to Mr C, she 
thought that conversation happened with the debt management company. 
Mr C said that our service should obtain all the calls that he had with NatWest, so we could 
hear that NatWest didnt initially offer him a refinance option. All it said was that he should 
pay the arrears, or speak to the debt management company. Mr C said when NatWest 
offered refinance, then he was relieved, because hed been faced with having to enter into 
an IVA. He said hed had to argue for the refinancing, it wasnt offered to him, and he 
thought that was wrong. 
Mr C then said hed been offered a refinance option by NatWest, but it was an extra £7,000 
to pay back over 65 months. He said although our investigator thought he wouldnt have 
acted differently, when the other lender told him he had to continue with his repayments, he 
did. He said he wouldve done the same with NatWest if it had made clear that he couldnt 
just return to making his payments after an extended break.
Our investigator still didnt change her mind. And she repeated that Mr C wasnt worse off 
now. He was paying a lower rate of interest on his refinanced loan, and he could make 
overpayments if he wanted to. She didnt think he was paying an extra £7,000 of interest now. Interest was being added to his old loan each month, that had stopped, and interest 
was now being added to his new loan, at a lower rate. 
Mr C said that hed now paid off the loan in full, with a different loan, because he didnt want 
to be paying an additional £7,000. He still thought that was what NatWest was making him 
do. Mr C still thought NatWest had been unfair. Because no agreement was reached, this 
case was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr C has told us that he did manage to keep paying the regular monthly amount for his other 
loan, because that lender told him he had no other options. And he said if NatWest had said 
the same to him, or had explained to him the consequences of missing payments, he would 
have continued to make his full monthly payment. 
NatWest hasnt been able to share with us recordings for the key calls with Mr C in June and 
July, but its notes show what happened when Mr C called. Hed told it he couldnt pay. So it 
put his payments on hold, and referred him to a debt management charity for help. 
I think NatWest took the appropriate step, in responding to what Mr C said. I would not 
expect NatWest, at this stage, to focus on the consequences of missing payments in the way 
Mr C has suggested it should have done. I wouldnt expect NatWest, either directly or 
indirectly, to put pressure on Mr C to make payments that hed just said he couldnt afford. 
For that reason, I dont think the steps NatWest took at this point were unfair, or 
unreasonable.
It seems Mr C considers that an IVA or bankruptcy wouldnt be necessary or suitable for him. 
But, like our investigator, I think its likely that this advice came from the debt management 
charity that Mr C spoke to, not from NatWest. And NatWest isnt responsible for that advice. 
By September, Mr Cs situation had changed, and he wanted to resume making payments at 
the previous amount. Mr C complained that NatWest wouldnt let him do this, and it wouldnt 
let him just extend the term of his previous loan, to cover the arrears that hed built up. 
NatWest said it had checked, and Mr C couldnt afford to just start again with payments of 
£500 per month as well as pay towards the arrears each month. So it wouldnt do that. I think 
thats a fair approach for NatWest to take. Its not fair or reasonable for NatWest to set up a 
payment arrangement that it knows Mr C cant afford
Mr C said NatWest didnt mention refinancing his loan, and hed had to argue for this. But 
NatWests notes suggest that it discussed refinancing with him at the same time as it 
discussed a repayment plan. I do think its likely that this was raised with Mr C, at this point.
NatWest said that it doesnt let people extend the term of their loan, if they have built up 
arrears. But I think its important to bear in mind that what NatWest did instead, has put Mr C 
in what does seem to me to be a bit better position, than if his existing loan had been 
extended. 
NatWest offered Mr C a new loan. This new loan was at a lower interest rate. Although Mr C 
hasnt shared with us the full details of his new loan, I can see that it has an APR of 17.2%, with monthly payments of £298.08 for 65 months. Mr Cs previous loan had an APR of 
17.5%, with monthly payments of just over £500. 
Mr C says that he was worse off with this loan, because hed end up paying more interest. 
He said hed paid it off, as he didnt want to do that.
I can see that this loan was due to run for much longer than his original loan. But I dont 
agree that hes worse off. 
Our investigator said that Mr C could overpay on this loan. Id also expect that he could do 
that, and Ive not seen anything to suggest otherwise. 
What that means is Mr C could have chosen to make bigger monthly repayments if he 
wanted. He could choose to pay perhaps £500 per month, the same amount as his old loan, 
if he wanted to. That would allow him to pay off the loan a lot faster. It would also greatly 
reduce the interest payable. And this new, refinanced loan also had the advantage that if he 
were to get into any difficulties again in future, he could then reduce his payments to £300 
per month, without needing to discuss this with NatWest or to alter the terms of this new 
loan. 
Thats why I think that Mr C was actually slightly better off with his refinanced loan. I do 
understand that Mr Cs overdraft was removed when this loan was refinanced, but Mr C 
hasnt complained about that. 
I know Mr C will be disappointed, but for the reasons set out above, I dont think NatWest 
has been unfair or unreasonable, and I dont think it has to do any more. And that means this 
complaint wont be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 November 2022.
