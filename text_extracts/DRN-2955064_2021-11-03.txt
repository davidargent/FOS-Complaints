The complaint
Mr P complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has deducted money from his account 
following a chargeback.
What happened
Mr P says he found out that two companies were taking money out of his account. He says 
he cancelled both direct debits and asked his bank to raise a chargeback. Mr P says he also 
asked PayPal to look at the transactions. He says his bank carried out a successful 
chargeback, but PayPal appears to have deducted money from his account which he thinks 
is a mistake.
PayPal says the agreements were cancelled in November 2020 and Mr P reported the 
transactions as unauthorised. It says the amounts were credited to Mr Ps account but 
deducted following his successful chargeback. PayPal says it has provided account 
statements which confirm this.
Mr P brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator accepted the statements and amounts were confusing but thought overall that 
PayPal hadnt made a mistake and didnt think Mr P had suffered a financial loss.
Mr P doesnt accept that view and in response to my questions says he doesnt have a copy 
of his bank account statement showing the chargeback amounts being credited. And 
questions if its legal of PayPal to remove the money from his account following a successful 
chargeback.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr P will be disappointed by my decision and I accept that the statements 
showing the credit and debit amounts is confusing.
I think it likely here that Mr Ps PayPal account and his bank account, following the 
successful chargeback, were both credited following Mr Ps claims for unauthorised 
transactions to PayPal and his chargeback to his bank. And that in those circumstances 
there was a duplicate payment. So, I dont think PayPal made a mistake or acted unfairly by 
deducting the payments it had previously credited to Mr Ps account. Im satisfied that if it did 
not then Mr P would have received a double refund in effect.
I appreciate Mr P questions if PayPal is entitled to reverse a credit to his account in these 
circumstances. I think Mr P asks that question as he realises that is what is likely to have 
taken place here, that both his bank and PayPal refunded the same money. And Im satisfied 
that PayPal in line with its user agreement is entitled to reverse the credit to ensure that 
there is not double counting or a double payment.
I have made clear that it is not easy to follow PayPals account statements and that is why I 
asked Mr P for his bank account statements which I hoped would show the corresponding 
chargeback amounts being paid into his account. I appreciate Mr P says he cant obtain 
them. But for the reasons I have made clear I have not seen any evidence on the statements 
PayPal has provided that it made a mistake or acted unfairly by deducting the payments in 
these circumstances or that it made a mistake in calculating the amounts.
Overall, Im satisfied PayPal has dealt fairly with this complaint and that it didnt make a 
mistake or act unfairly. I find this brings an end to what we in trying to resolve this dispute 
informally can do.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2021.
