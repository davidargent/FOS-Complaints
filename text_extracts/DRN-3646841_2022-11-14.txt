The complaint
Mr N complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA restricted access to his account 
after it went into a negative balance. He says he was unable to view his account or make 
payments to it as a result.
What happened
Mr N says he was double charged by an accommodation provider when he made a 
reservation online. He says around £2,000 was taken from both his credit card and 
his PayPal account (which was his back up payment method). After he contacted the 
accommodation provider, they refunded his credit card. However, Mr N was left with 
a negative balance on his PayPal account.
Mr N says he was unable to pay the money owing on his PayPal account because 
PayPal blocked access to it. He says he was unable to make a complaint or inform 
PayPal of the situation because he needed to be logged into the account to contact 
customer services.
Mr N approached our service and we raised a complaint on his behalf.
PayPal said Mr Ns PayPal account was left with a negative balance because it wasnt 
able to recover the funds from his bank account or credit card. It said the account had 
been locked due to the negative balance, but Mr N could phone its customer service 
team.
Mr N remained unhappy and asked us to look into his complaint. He said he wasnt able to 
view or pay the outstanding balance because PayPal wouldnt allow him access to his 
account. He said this was in breach of FCA guidelines and he was concerned about how 
this might damage his credit file. He said PayPal hadnt acknowledged that blocking his 
account meant he couldnt contact them to make a written formal complaint. Hed had no 
choice but to contact the ombudsman service first.
Mr N said his account was still blocked which meant he wasnt able to view or pay the 
balances owed to PayPal and have his services fully restored. He told us he had 
communication and anxiety issues relating to autism. He said PayPal hadnt offered any 
other means or adaptations to allow people with disabilities such as his, to contact him. 
He said it wasnt possible to email PayPal without access to his account.
Our investigator looked into Mr Ns concerns but didnt think his complaint should be 
upheld. He thought PayPal had acted fairly, in line with its terms and conditions.
Our investigator said he hadnt seen evidence that Mr N had let PayPal know that he 
was unable to communicate with it by telephone. He also thought PayPal had given Mr 
N reasonable alternatives to make payment after it became aware of his circumstances.
Mr N disagreed with our investigators view. He said PayPal still hadnt taken steps to 
respond to or understand his needs as an autistic person now that it was aware of his 
circumstances. He gave reasons why the options PayPal had given him to pay the 
outstanding balance on his account werent suitable. He didnt think PayPal had made 
the reasonable adjustments it is required to do under the Equality Act 2010.
Mr N was also concerned that he couldnt access his PayPal Credit account. He said his 
credit profile was showing as being in persistent debt because he couldnt log in or pay 
the balance and close the account.
So, Mr Ns complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ns complaint. Ill explain why.
Mr N has complained that PayPal has failed to make reasonable adjustments for him. In 
other words, has failed its duty to make reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act 
2010. Ive taken the Equality Act 2010 into account when deciding this complaint  given 
that its relevant law  but Ive ultimately decided this complaint based on whats fair and 
reasonable. If Mr N wants a decision that PayPal has breached the Equality Act 2010, then 
he'd need to go to Court.
PayPals records show that a transaction of £1,987 went from Mr Ns PayPal account to 
the accommodation provider on 13 September 2021. Mr N says he was double charged 
by the accommodation provider, which meant the same amount was taken from his credit 
card. Theres nothing to suggest PayPal was at fault here.
PayPal says it tried to take the funds from Mr Ns current account and subsequently his 
back-up source (credit card). However, both of these funding sources were declined. 
This resulted in a negative PayPal balance.
PayPals user agreement refers to Restricted Activities that account holders must not 
do. This includes: Allow your PayPal account to have a balance reflecting an amount 
owing to us.
Under Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities, the user 
agreement says: At any time and without liability, suspend, limit or terminate your access 
to our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide 
any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf, your PayPal account or any of 
the PayPal services, including limiting your ability to pay or send money with any of the 
payment methods linked to your PayPal account, restricting your ability to send money or 
make withdrawals.
PayPal has provided copies of an automated email it sent to Mr N on 20 September 2021 
notifying him that there wasnt enough money in his bank account to cover the payment to 
the accommodation provider. It said it had debited the amount from his PayPal balance 
and, as a result, there was an amount owing to it. PayPal asked Mr N to restore his 
balance at his earliest convenience.
PayPal sent Mr N a further message on 26 September 2021 which showed the amount 
owing to PayPal, with steps to restore the balance by logging into his account. PayPal sent 
Mr N reminders on 3 and 10 October 2021, which said that if he didnt pay the amount owing you may not be able to fully use your PayPal account, and we may continue with 
efforts to collect the amount.
PayPal has sent us a screenshot to show that it placed Mr Ns account in locked charged-
off status in January 2022. So, he would have had a few months to restore his balance 
before he lost access to his account.
I appreciate Mr N might not have been in a position to restore his balance until hed been 
reimbursed for the double payment by the accommodation provider. However, I havent 
seen anything to show that Mr N made PayPal aware of this at the time.
Mr N says he was under a great deal of distress from being double charged by the 
accommodation provider. As someone who is autistic, a situation where circumstances 
unexpectedly change can cause him to panic and not understand. He says he needed 
support from his disability advisor to get the money back from the accommodation 
provider. He says he had an autistic burnout which meant he wasnt able to contact 
PayPal before he was locked out of his account.
I understand this must have been a difficult situation for Mr N. However, I dont think 
PayPal was aware of Mr Ns circumstances or his disability at the time. So, I think it was 
reasonable for PayPal to have locked his account, in line with its terms and conditions.
Mr N says PayPals communication system is flawed because it doesnt offer a way 
of contacting it when locked out of the account, other than by telephone.
PayPal has referred to the accessibility section of its website, which says to contact it 
and provide a description of the specific feature you feel isnt fully accessible or with 
suggestions for improvement. However, a customer is required to log in to send a 
message to PayPal. So, the only way of contacting PayPal without logging in, does appear 
to be by telephone.
Its not this services role to tell a business what processes and procedures to put in place, 
or how it should communicate with its customers. However, I can consider how PayPals 
processes have impacted Mr N.
After we made PayPal aware that Mr N wasnt able to make payment over the phone, it 
suggested some alternative methods of payment. It said he could pay by cheque, postal 
order or bankers draft. However, Mr N has explained why these alternatives also 
werent suitable for him. And Im persuaded by what Mr N has said.
PayPal also made us aware that Mr Ns balance was converted to US dollars which 
means the amount he owes varied according to the exchange rate.
After Mr Ns complaint was moved to me for a decision, I got in touch with PayPal in 
an attempt to resolve his outstanding issues for him.
PayPal says it has now removed the locked-charged-off status from Mr Ns account, so 
he should now be able to access his PayPal account as well as his PayPal Credit 
account. It says the negative balance on his PayPal account has been updated to the 
original amount he owed.
However, Mr N doesnt feel this is enough to resolve his complaint. Hes told us he is 
currently receiving treatment in hospital which means he hasnt yet been able to check 
he has access to his accounts and make outstanding payments.Mr N says his main concern is that PayPal had only taken action to resolve things once 
his complaint had reached an ombudsman.
I appreciate Mr N is frustrated that PayPal didnt agree to give him access to his account 
prior to my involvement. However, its not this services role to fine or punish a business. 
Our services role is to consider whether or not a business has treated a complainant fairly 
and reasonably and to tell them what to do to put things right if we think it hasnt.
Ive explained why I dont think PayPal was wrong to restrict access to Mr Ns account in 
the first place. Im also satisfied that PayPal wasnt aware of Mr Ns disability before he 
made his complaint.

I acknowledge that PayPals processes made it difficult for Mr N to raise his complaint and 
to settle the balance on his account after it was locked. However, PayPal says it has given
Mr N access to his account to allow him to make payment. Weve let PayPal know about 
Mr Ns recent health issues and his request to be given until late November / early 
December to log into his account and settle the balance. PayPal says it has noted this 
and hopes Mr N recovers soon. I think this is a reasonable resolution to Mr Ns complaint. 
So, I dont require PayPal to do anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Ns complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2022.
