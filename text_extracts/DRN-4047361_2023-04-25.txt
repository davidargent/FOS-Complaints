The complaint
Mr A complains that Retail Money Market Ltd trading as RateSetter acted unfairly in asking 
the credit reference agencies to register a default on his account.
What happened
In April 2018 Mr A took out a loan under a peer-to peer agreement (P2P agreement) with a 
third party lender I will call R. 
RateSetter was not a lender in relation to the 2018 finance agreement. Rather it operated an 
electronic system in relation to lending which Mr A used to find a lender. In other words 
RateSetter provided an electronic platform to facilitate lending between Mr A and R under a 
P2P agreement. RateSetter administers the account on behalf of R. R is not a party to this 
complaint.
In October 2021 Mr A contacted RateSetter to let it know he was experiencing temporary 
financial difficulties due to unexpected costs and interest payments on his overdraft. He told 
it his outgoings would reduce in January 2022 and then he would be in a stronger financial 
position. 
There was some to and fro between the parties about how RateSetter could help Mr A. Mr 
As position is that ultimately RateSetter allowed him to temporarily stop making payments 
for three months. But it did not tell him in advance that he would need to make arrangements 
to start paying back the arrears after the three months was up. Rather RateSetter led Mr A to 
believe all he needed to do was resume his normal monthly repayments. In addition, earlier 
in the agreement Mr A and RateSetter had agreed a separate three month payment deferral 
due to financial difficulties Mr A experienced due to COVID-19. After that payment deferral 
Mr A was not asked to bring his arrears up to date. Therefore Mr A assumed RateSetter 
would take the same approach here.
Therefore Mr A was shocked to find that once the three month short term hold was over (it 
ended on 26 January 2022), and without giving him notice, RateSetter asked the credit 
reference agencies to register a default on his account. Mr A tells us I do not believe I have 
done anything wrong, everything was pre-agreed with the company, and I made payments in 
line with what I was led to believe was required. On this basis Mr A wants RateSetter to ask 
the credit reference agencies to remove the default from his credit file. 
According to RateSetters internal notes RateSetter says it agreed to put Mr As account on 
hold for three months, but when it agreed this it also told Mr A upfront, that they would have 
to sort out the arrears at the end of this period. 
Also according to RateSetters internal notes RateSetter emailed Mr A after the short term 
hold was agreed to tell him it would be in touch with him on 26 January to discuss his current 
financial circumstances, which included the arrears. 
On 26 January RateSetter contacted Mr A asking him to contact it to discuss his current 
financial circumstances.  Mr A responded to ask if his repayments would start again as 
usual. It responded the following day to remind him about his arrears and to ask him what he 
wanted to do about them and offering a repayment plan, but it received no response from Mr 
A. Accordingly RateSetter sent Mr A notice of default at the end of January. In that notice it 
set explained what would happen if the arrears were not repaid in line with the notice.  
In addition, on 14th February RateSetter again asked Mr A to contact it to sort out the arrears 
but again it received no response. Nonetheless RateSetter delayed terminating the account 
to give Mr A one last opportunity to contact it about the arrears. Finally, in early March it 
terminated the agreement and contacted Mr A to let him know this had happened.
On this basis RateSetter does not agree it acted incorrectly, therefore RateSetter declined to 
uphold Mr As complaint.
Dissatisfied, Mr A complained to our service. 
Once Mr As complaint was with us he told us he had never received the notice of default 
that RateSetter claims to have sent. He also told us in any event he would not have been 
able to pay off the arrears in full at the end of the short term hold on his account.
One of our investigators looked into Mr As complaint. She did not recommend that it should 
be upheld. 
RateSetter accepted our investigators recommendation. It also pointed out that it could have 
set up a repayment plan if Mr A had contacted it in time and in that way he could have 
avoided the default.
Mr A rejected our investigators recommendation. In explaining why he rejected the 
recommendation Mr A repeated his previous stance. In addition, Mr A told us more about 
what had happened when hed had the payment deferral because he was struggling to make 
his payments due to COVID-19. And he explained further why that experience had led him to 
reasonably believe that RateSetter would not require him to make plans to pay off the 
arrears once the short term hold ended. Mr A told us he had never received the letter in 
which RateSetter told him it had terminated his agreement due to non-payment of his 
arrears.
Mr A asked that an ombudsman review his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First, Im very aware that Ive summarised this complaint in far less detail than the parties 
and Ive done so using my own words. Im not going to respond to every single point made 
by all the parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on what 
I think are the key issues here. 
Our rules allow me to do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as a free 
alternative to the courts. If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive ignored 
it. Rather, Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual argument to be able to 
reach what I think is the right outcome.
Mr As position is that RateSetter acted unfairly and unreasonably in defaulting his account 
because he acted in accordance with the agreement he had with it, and it did not. 
Specifically it never told him how it would treat the arears and he never received proper 
notification that it was going to terminate his account. Moreover, neither did it tell him when it 
had terminated his account. And in any event, Mr A was entitled to assume that RateSetter 
would not immediately pursue him for the arrears following the end of the short term hold. 
This was because it had not done so when he had another separate short term hold on his 
account when due to the restrictions imposed as a result of the Covid pandemic he had had 
money troubles.Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, or contradictory (as some of it is here), I 
reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most 
likely to have happened in the light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
I dont think there is any dispute here that Mr A knew he was going to run up arrears if 
RateSetter agreed to a short term hold on his account. Further, RateSetters records, which 
Ive no reason to doubt show that it told Mr A that the arrears would need to be dealt with in 
some way once the short term hold had ended. Therefore I dont agree that on balance 
RateSetter did not tell Mr A in advance he would need to repay the arrears at the end of the 
three months. 
Those same records show that RateSetter tried on several occasions to talk to Mr A about 
the arrears when the short term hold finished, and he did not reply. Given Mr As lack of 
response and that there was no plan in place to deal with the arrears, I dont find that 
RateSetter acted unreasonably in initiating the process to end the agreement.
In considering what is fair and reasonable, I need to have regard to the relevant law and 
regulations, regulators rules, guidance and standards, codes of practice and (where 
appropriate) what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time. 
Under relevant law Mr A had to be served with a notice of default before his account could 
be properly terminated. I note Mr A says he never received this notice. But I also note the 
notice was correctly addressed and seems to have been sent both by mail and email. And 
since it appears RateSetter had no notification that the mail was returned to sender or that 
the email was not delivered I think I cant hold RateSetter responsible if Mr A did not receive 
the notice, I dont think that RateSetter was at fault here. Neither do I think I can fairly say 
that RateSetter cannot rely on that notice.
For all of these individual reasons, in the circumstances I think RateSetter did enough to let 
Mr A know what would happen if he ran up arrears and did not come to some arrangement 
with RateSetter to pay them off when the three months was up.
Mr A assumed he would not have to make arrangements to deal with the arrears once the 
short term hold on the account ended. But nothing RateSetter did could reasonably have led 
to Mr A making this assumption. Rather Mr A appears to have decided for himself that the 
rules that applied to a very different set of circumstances would also apply to this situation. I 
cant fairly hold RateSetter responsible for this. 
It follows based on everything Ive said above, I find that RateSetter has acted appropriately 
and therefore I have no proper basis to tell RateSetter that it must ask the credit reference 
agencies to remove the default it asked them to register on Mr As credit file.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 May 2023.
