The complaint
Mr N complains Bank of Scotland Plc (BOS) refused to refund money which the ATM failed 
to dispense.
What happened
Mr N complained to BOS about a failed attempt to withdraw money from an ATM on 3rd 
September 2019.  He said he had attempted to withdraw £250 but this had not been 
dispensed.
BOS refunded the money whilst it investigated the matter with the ATM owner.  It then 
returned to Mr N some weeks later and said it was not upholding his complaint and that the 
money would be re-debited from his account.
Mr N complained to this service about BOS holding him liable for the money which the ATM 
had failed to dispense.
Our investigator didnt think he could ask BOS to do anymore  so Mr N asked for an 
ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
For very much the same reasons as the investigator, I will not be asking BOS to refund this 
money.  Whilst Im sure Mr N is certain in what he tells this service, I cannot ignore the 
documentary evidence which shows that the ATM balanced on that day, that the money was 
successfully dispensed and that there were no outstanding notes left at the end of the day 
which had not been accounted for.
This is what BOS has relied upon in holding Mr N liable for the £250  and I cannot say that 
this decision was unfair or unreasonable.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 October 2020.
