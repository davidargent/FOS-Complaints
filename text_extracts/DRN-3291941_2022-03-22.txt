The complaint
Miss W complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Porsche Financial Services, wasnt 
of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Miss W under a hire purchase agreement with Porsche Financial 
Services in April 2017 and she bought the car when the agreement ended. The car broke 
down in February 2021 and a replacement engine was required. Miss Ws solicitors 
complained to Porsche Financial Services about the engine failure but it said that it was 
satisfied that the fault wasnt present at the point of sale and that there was no evidence to 
suggest that the car was inherently faulty from sale. Miss W paid £18,603.56 for the cars 
engine to be replaced and shed also paid £128.40 for the car to be recovered and £338.40 
for an initial assessment of the fault. She then complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She said that it was 
unlikely that the engine fault was present when the car was purchased in April 2017 and that 
it was more likely that a combination of environmental factors and use of the car caused the 
fault to occur. She didnt believe that it would be fair or reasonable to hold Porsche Financial 
Services accountable for the cost of the repairs.
Miss W has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has 
responded to our investigators recommendations in detail and says, in summary, that the 
burden of proof hasnt been applied correctly and that the evidence of causation 
demonstrates that, on a balance of probabilities, at the time the car was sold to her it wasnt 
of satisfactory quality.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Porsche Financial Services, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring 
that it was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss W - whether or not it 
was of satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including 
the age and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Miss W was more than five years old, had been driven 
for 19,377 miles and had a price of £66,000;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car was supplied to Miss W in April 2017 and she bought it from Porsche 
Financial Services when the hire purchase agreement ended and it broke down in 
February 2021 which was nearly four years after it had been supplied to her and its 
mileage was then 30,541 miles;
Miss W paid £18,603.56 for the cars engine to be replaced by a manufacturers 
dealer which said:  there was significant scoring to cylinder No 2 caused by 
broken piston rings. This had in turn damaged the crown of the piston and there was 
also scoring and signs of metal pick up wear on the remaining 5 cylinders most 
likely caused by metal particles within the oil and oil galleries;
it also said that that it was impossible to pinpoint the cause of the failure but it 
identified a number of possible causes;
Miss W has explained why she doesnt consider that any of those possible causes 
would have caused the engine failure and she says that the only possible remaining 
cause is that a fault with the engine existed at the time that the car was supplied to 
her  but shes provided no other mechanical or independent evidence to show that 
the engine failure was caused by a manufacturing defect or a fault with the car that 
was present when it was supplied to her;
the engine failed nearly four years after the car had been supplied to Miss W and in 
that time shed driven more than 11,000 miles in the car  if there had been a fault 
with the car when it was supplied to her I consider it to be more likely than not that 
the fault would have been noticed in significantly less than four years and that 
Miss W wouldnt have been able to drive more than 11,000 miles in the car;
I sympathise with Miss W for the issues that shes been caused as a result of the 
cars engine failing and the costs that shes incurred for the engine to be replaced, 
but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to her, including that it wasnt as durable as 
it was reasonable for her to expect it to be;
I consider that Porsche Financial Services response to Miss Ws complaint was fair 
and reasonable in these circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Porsche Financial 
Services to reimburse Miss W for the cost of replacing the cars engine, to pay her 
any other compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Ws complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 April 2022.
