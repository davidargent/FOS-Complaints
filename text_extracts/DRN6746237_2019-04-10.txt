K820x#14complaint
Miss C complains that Active Securities Limited  (trading as 247 Moneybox) gave her loans 
that she couldnt afford to repay.
background
Miss C has been helped by a claims management  company (CMC) in making her 
complaint. But for ease  I will generally  refer to all actions as having been undertaken by 
Miss C herself.
Miss C was given eight loans by 247 Moneybox  between June 2010 and August 2013. Each 
of the first seven loans  was repaid on time.  But Miss C hasnt repaid the final loan and a 
balance remains outstanding. A summary  of Miss Cs borrowing from 247 Moneybox is as 
follows;

6 14/05/2013 14/06/2013 £   80
7 01/07/2013 09/08/2013 £ 100

247 Moneybox has said that Miss Cs complaint  about the first five loans was made too late. 
As a result Miss C has confirmed that she only wants  us to consider the last three loans. So, 
although I will of course take account  of the earlier  lending  I wont  specifically review those 
loans in this decision.
When Miss C first complained to 247 Moneybox it didnt agree that it had been wrong to give 
her the loans. But, as a gesture of goodwill, it offered to write off the remaining balance  on 
her last loan. Miss C didnt accept  that offer so brought her complaint to this Service.
Miss Cs complaint has been  assessed by one of our adjudicators. He thought that the 
checks 247 Moneybox  had done before agreeing to give the last three loans to Miss C had 
been proportionate. And since those checks suggested the loans  were  affordable  for Miss C 
he didnt think the complaint should be upheld.
Miss C didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process.
Ref: DRN67462372my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
247 Moneybox was required to lend responsibly. It needed to make checks  to see whether 
Miss C could afford to pay back each  loan before it lent to her. Those checks needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Miss C was borrowing, and her lending history, 
but there was no set list of checks 247 Moneybox  had to do.
247 Moneybox has told us about the checks it did before lending to Miss C. Before agreeing 
each loan it asked  her for details of her income,  and her normal expenditure. And it checked 
Miss Cs credit file before each loan too. I havent  seen anything  in the results of those credit  
checks that I think should have caused additional concerns to the lender.
Miss C had previously taken five loans  from 247 Moneybox that she had successfully repaid. 
But there was then a gap of more than a year before she asked to borrow again.  I think it 
would have been reasonable for 247 Moneybox  to have  seen  this gap as an indication that 
Miss Cs finances had moved  on from whatever  situation had required her previous loans.
The amounts that Miss C asked to borrow from 247 Moneybox in 2013  were relatively 
modest compared to the income she declared.  And the repayments appeared to be easily 
affordable based  on what  Miss C had said about  her disposable  income. At this relatively  
early stage of this chain  of borrowing  I think  it was reasonable for 247 Moneybox to base its 
checks on the information Miss C provided. And that suggested the loans were affordable. 
So I dont  think it was wrong for 247 Moneybox  to give Miss C these loans.
Although I am not upholding this complaint 247 Moneybox confirmed to our adjudicator  in 
January 2019  that it was still willing to action its original gesture of goodwill and write  off 
Miss Cs outstanding balance. If Miss C wishes to now accept  this offer she should get in 
touch with 247 Moneybox direct.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I dont uphold the complaint or make  any award against 
Active Securities Limited. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required  
to ask Miss C to accept  or reject my decision before 10 May 2019.
