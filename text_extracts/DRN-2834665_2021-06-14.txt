The complaint
Mrs J complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA would not cover the cost of returning 
goods under its buyer protection policy.
What happened
In March 2020 Mrs J bought an item and paid for it through her PayPal account. When the 
item arrived, it was not what had been described, and so she applied for a refund under 
PayPals buyer protection policy on the ground that it was significantly not as described. 
But PayPal required her to return the item to the seller at her own expense, and since the 
seller was in another country and the item had not cost very much, the cost of returning it 
seemed disproportionate. So she complained, first to PayPal and then to our Service. She 
also told us that PayPal had been ignoring her emails.
PayPal did not agree that it had done anything wrong. It said that its buyer protection policy 
only covers the cost of the goods purchased, not the cost of returning the goods, which must 
be borne by the buyer. It had therefore followed the terms of the policy. But as a gesture of 
good will, it still refunded Mrs J the cost of the item (in July).
Our investigator did not uphold this complaint. She agreed that PayPal had complied with its 
policy, and she quoted the relevant clause. She said that Mrs J had been refunded the cost 
of the item, so in the end she had incurred no financial loss. She did not think compensation 
was warranted for PayPal not responding to Mrs Js emails, because Mrs J had brought her 
complaint to our Service in April 2020, less than eight weeks after she had complained to 
PayPal, and since then there had been no real reason for her to continue to engage directly 
with PayPal. The investigator also noted that this had been during the early weeks of the 
coronavirus lockdown, which would have had an impact on PayPals ability to communicate 
with its customers.
Mrs J was not satisfied with that opinion. She pointed out that British law requires a seller to 
cover the cost of returning goods that are not as described. She asked for an ombudsman to 
reconsider this case, taking that law into account.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It is true that British law does hold the seller of goods responsible for the cost of returning 
goods which are defective or which do not match the description which was given when they 
were sold. But that is a matter between Mrs J and the person who sold her the goods. This 
complaint is about PayPal, not the seller, and so I am only concerned with whether PayPal 
has followed its buyer protection policy or not. It clearly has, since the policy states that the 
buyer shall return goods at her own cost. (I wont quote it again here, since our investigator 
has already done that.)
Its a moot point anyway, since PayPal has refunded the cost of the item without Mrs J 
having to send it back. So she is now in the same financial position she was in before she 
bought it (except that she still has the goods).
I agree with what our investigator said about PayPal not replying to Mr Js emails in April. 
She brought this complaint to us in April, when PayPal still had time left to respond to her 
complaint (its allowed eight weeks). Also, I think it would be fair and reasonable to take the 
impact of the lockdown into account, since many of PayPals staff were no doubt working 
from home, and that may have been disruptive. So although PayPal took longer than eight 
weeks to respond (which it did in July), I wont award compensation for that.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2021.
