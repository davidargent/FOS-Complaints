K820x#14complaint
Miss J complains  that National Westminster Bank Plc paid direct debits from her current 
account despite it being empty and unused.  This caused her account to go overdrawn and 
incur charges.
background
In December 2017, a direct  debit was paid, which caused Miss Js account to go overdrawn 
by £6.01. This caused her account  to go overdrawn and incur  charges. Another direct debit 
for around  £10.17 was taken in January  2018. As Miss J didnt return her account to a credit 
balance, NatWest applied  charges  each  month  until May 2018. By this time,  Miss J was 
around £460 overdrawn  more than £440  of that was charges applied by NatWest.
Miss J didnt  use her account since she moved  abroad and no longer needed it, so she didnt 
check it. On discovering the charges, Miss J complained to NatWest.
NatWest explained  Miss Js account went  overdrawn  because of direct debits being taken 
which hadnt been cancelled. It said the charges  were correctly  applied  in line with the terms 
and conditions of Miss Js account.  But NatWest  offered to reduce the charges to £90. This 
meant Miss J would owe them £106.18  (£90 charges plus £16.18  for the two direct  debits it 
paid). Unhappy  with this response,  Miss J referred her complaint to our service.
One of our investigators  reviewed Miss Js complaint  but didnt uphold it. She told Miss J she 
was responsible for cancelling  her direct debits.  But even  if NatWest had cancelled these, 
the bank could have applied charges for doing  so. The charges applied  were in line with the 
terms and conditions of Miss Js account,  so our investigator didnt recommend NatWest 
refund these. She thought  NatWests  offer to reduce what  she owed to £90 was fair. Miss J 
disagreed, saying the direct debits shouldnt have been paid and the charges were unfair. 
She also said she should have been  allowed to change  her address. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive not upheld  Miss Js 
complaint for the same reasons as our investigator. I realise  my decision is likely to 
disappoint Miss J, but Ill explain  my reasons.
Miss J may well have believed she didnt have any active direct debits from her account.  But 
ultimately, it was Miss Js responsibility to monitor her account;  it was her responsibility  to 
either cancel  any direct  debits shed  set up or ensure  she had enough money  to pay them. 
As Miss J didnt cancel  the direct debits  outlined above, her account went overdrawn.  I dont 
think it was unreasonable for NatWest to pay these  direct debits  it hadnt  been told by 
Miss J that she wanted to cancel them. I wouldnt have expected NatWest to continue  to 
allow the direct debits to be taken  from Miss Js account indefinitely   and that didnt happen  
here. As Miss Js account went overdrawn,  NatWest was entitled  to apply charges to her 
account. Bearing this in mind, I think NatWest is treating Miss J fairly  in reducing what she 
owes to £90. 
Ive reviewed NatWests contact notes, which show it tried to contact her at her last known 
address. Text messages  couldnt be delivered  and Miss J had moved abroad.  It doesnt 
Ref: DRN45505482appear that Miss J followed NatWests  processes  for updating her address either.  I think 
NatWest made reasonable attempts to contact  Miss J to update her about  her account.
I know Miss J says she shouldve been allowed to change her address over the phone  but 
wasnt allowed to because her phone number had changed. But NatWest  is allowed to set its 
own processes for customers  to follow to change their addresses, and I dont  think NatWest 
applied those processes unreasonably  here. Miss J still had options to monitor her account  
and ensure it had sufficient funds to pay any direct debits still active  on her account. I dont 
think not being able to change her address means  NatWest should write-off what  is owed on 
her account.
I know Miss J believes the charges are unfair. But I think NatWest  is treating her fairly in 
offering to reduce the outstanding balance owed  on her account to £90. Ive not 
recommended it do anything else in this case.
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above, I dont  uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 April 2019.
