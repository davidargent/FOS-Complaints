The complaint
Mr I trading as M (a sole trader) complains that ClearBank Limited didnt do enough to
protect him against losing money to a scam.
What happened
The detailed background to this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide
a brief overview of some of the key events here. Mr I was the victim of a scam. On 19
October 2021 he made a payment from his business account with ClearBank to another
account, also held with ClearBank. At the time he believed this to be for the legitimate
purchase of a vehicle that hed seen online. But shortly after he tried to cancel his order, the
seller ceased all contact and he realised hed been scammed.
Mr I reported this to ClearBank on 26 October 2021. ClearBank incorrectly treated this as a
card payment dispute in the first instance, before looking at it as authorised push payment
(APP) fraud. In December 2021 ClearBank told Mr I they hadnt been able to recover any
funds.
Mr I complained. ClearBank accepted that an error had been made when he reported the
scam. They said but for this error, around £77 could have been recovered. However, as a
gesture of goodwill they offered Mr I £2,100 to resolve his complaint. Mr I didnt accept this
and wants a full refund. He referred his complaint to our service.
One of our Investigators recommended that the complaint should be upheld. But she only
thought ClearBank needed to refund £76.97 plus 8% interest along with £250 compensation
for the upset and inconvenience caused by their error. She said it was up to ClearBank if
they wanted to still make the £2,100 payment as a gesture of goodwill.
ClearBank accepted this outcome, but Mr I didnt. He asked for an Ombudsman to review his
complaint. In October 2023 I issued a provisional decision in which I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive reached the same outcome as our Investigator. But as Im providing a
greater level of detail, Im issuing this provisional decision to give both sides a further
opportunity to comment before finalising my decision.
When Mr I instructed his payment for £9,315, believing at the time that this was a legitimate
vehicle purchase, this was unusual activity for his account with ClearBank. So whilst
ClearBanks first obligation is to follow the instructions provided by their customers, they
should also be alert to out of character or higher risk payments with a view to protecting their
customers from fraud, scams and the misappropriation of funds. But even if ClearBank had
asked some questions and provided warnings about the payment before processing it, in the
circumstances of this complaint, Im not persuaded that would have made a difference.
Ive seen the details of the communication between Mr I and the seller. And I dont think
there was anything obviously fraudulent about it. Ive also searched online and havent found
anything from around the time of the payments that might have indicated that it could have
been a scam. Plus I think to a certain extent the risks of buying a vehicle online and it being
delivered are self-evident. So I cant say that this was a risk that would never have occurred
to Mr I. I think its most likely he would have been reassured by the promises made by the
seller and would have gone ahead despite any reasonable level of intervention from
ClearBank.
But here, as well as being Mr Is bank, ClearBank provided the recipient account. So, Ive
gone on to consider their actions in relation to that account. Im satisfied that ClearBank
correctly followed their process when opening the recipient account. I dont think there was
anything at that time where they reasonably could have known that the account would later
go on to be used in connection with a fraud or scam. So, I dont think Mr Is loss could have
been prevented through anything to do with the account opening.
Ive also looked at the activity on the recipient account including the arrival and spending of
Mr Is funds. I dont think there were any failings by ClearBank in relation to their monitoring
of the account which impacted the loss suffered by Mr I. So this too isnt a basis upon which
I can direct them to do more.
Ive next gone on to look at what happened when Mr I reported his payment to ClearBank.
ClearBank accept that initially this was incorrectly recorded as a card dispute. And had that
not happened, then £76.96 of Mr Is money would have been recoverable. Based on the
evidence Ive seen; I agree this is the case and certainly that no more than that amount
could have been recovered at the time. So, I think ClearBank should refund this to Mr I along
with 8% simple interest (yearly). I also think this error would have caused Mr I avoidable
distress and inconvenience. And I agree with our Investigator that taking into account Mr Is
personal circumstances and the impact this would have had on him, that £250 compensation
is a fair amount.
Im aware that ClearBank, sympathising with Mr I being a victim, offered him £2,100
compensation as a gesture of goodwill. I cant make this award as I dont think there is a
reasonable basis upon which to require ClearBank to make that payment. It is a matter for
Mr I to take up with ClearBank as to whether that offer still stands.
For the reasons outlined above, but subject to any further information I receive from either
Mr I or ClearBank, I intend to uphold this complaint in part. I intend to direct ClearBank
Limited to pay Mr I £76.97 plus 8% simple interest between the date of loss and the date of
settlement. They should also pay £250 compensation for the impact of the service failings
described above.
ClearBank responded to my provisional decision to say they accepted it. Mr I responded with 
some further comments which Ill address below. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr I says that ClearBank have now updated the alerts provided in their app. He says had 
this been in place at the time, he wouldnt have made the payment. Ive considered this but 
Im not persuaded that is the case. As Ive covered above, Ive not found any information 
(available at that time) that might have indicated that the seller wasnt genuine. Mr I reiterated that he doesnt think ClearBank conducted adequate KYC checks when 
opening the recipient account. Ive seen evidence of the checks they conducted along with a 
selfie and image of a valid passport provided at account opening. So I dont agree 
ClearBank didnt do enough when opening the account in question. 
Mr I has also said that ClearBank havent reported this matter to the police. He says that his 
funds were sent out internationally and he doesnt believe ClearBank have informed the 
authorities in that jurisdiction either. ClearBank themselves werent victims, so I wouldnt 
expect them to pro-actively contact the police in these circumstances. Im sure that 
ClearBank will co-operate and share information upon a request from the police that they do 
so. 
Mr I also thinks that ClearBank should do more to chase his money. Beyond the delay Ive 
previously mentioned, I dont think ClearBank are responsible for errors which impacted how 
much of Mr Is money could be recovered. And the award Im making compensates him for 
the consequences of that delay. Further to this, the majority of the activity on the recipient 
account that spent Mr Is funds was debit card spending, which isnt something that could be 
pursued for recovery in any case.
Mr I has also referred to the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). He has described himself as 
vulnerable and disabled and thinks that ClearBank didnt take this into account. Mr I has 
submitted medical evidence to support what hes said, and I accept he was vulnerable and 
disabled at the relevant time. 
Ive considered this and I agree that ClearBank should treat vulnerable customers with extra 
care and that, they should make reasonable adjustments for their customers where 
appropriate. My understanding is that the DDA has been replaced by the Equality Act 2010. 
But I understand the core point Mr I is making which is that he feels he needed additional 
support and or adjustments which werent provided. Ive taken the Equality Act 2010 into 
account when deciding this complaint  given that its relevant law  but Ive ultimately 
decided this complaint based on whats fair and reasonable. If Mr I wants a decision that 
ClearBank has breached the Equality Act 2010, then hed need to go to Court.
Im sorry to hear of the difficult circumstances and the ill health Mr I has described. But Im 
not persuaded this impacts the outcome of this complaint. Our Investigator asked Mr I 
whether (prior to the payment relevant to this complaint) hed informed ClearBank of his 
personal circumstances. Mr I said he had. But when ClearBank said they had no record of 
being informed of this prior to the complaint being raised, I asked Mr I whether he had 
evidence of having informed them. Mr I responded to say that ClearBank had failed by not 
having provision to inform them of disabilities or vulnerabilities during their account opening 
process. 
Given the above, I think its more likely than not that Mr I hadnt informed ClearBank as to his 
personal situation prior to his payment being made and the subsequent complaint. And Ive 
not seen anything to persuade me that this is something ClearBank ought to have 
ascertained by themselves. Im confident that ClearBank have open channels through which 
their customers can communicate with them. 
Ultimately, whilst Mr I is correct that financial businesses should take extra care with 
vulnerable consumers and comply with the provisions of the Equality Act. Here, I dont think 
they reasonably could have known about Mr Is personal circumstances without being 
informed. And so I cant say theyve acted unfairly in the circumstances of this complaint. I 
also dont think Mr Is personal situation means that ClearBank need to refund his loss on 
that basis.For completeness, I still think the £250 compensation is fair to reflect the impact of 
ClearBank incorrectly dealing with his claim in the first instance. The situation was corrected 
within a reasonable time. And again, Ive taken account of Mr Is disability and vulnerability 
when reaching this conclusion. 
Im sorry Mr I has lost money to a scam, but having considered all hes said, Im not 
persuaded to change from the outcome explained in my provisional decision. 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. 
Unless theyve already done so, ClearBank Limited must pay Mr I £76.97 plus 8% simple 
interest between the date of loss and the date of settlement. They must also pay him £250 
compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 December 2023.
