K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs D complain that National  Westminster  Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt act fairly or 
reasonably when dealing with their mortgage, including  when dealing  with requests for 
information. They want a full subject access request, compensation and an apology.
background
Mr and Mrs D had a residential  mortgage with NatWest. They  successfully applied  for 
consent to let the property. Mr and Mrs D asked NatWest not to amend their correspondence  
address until they had moved to a more permanent address, but this was overlooked. 
Mr and Mrs D were unhappy  that this change of address was reflected in their credit  records,  
and said that it caused them to be unable  to buy a new property (and unable to sell the 
original property). 
Mr and Mrs D also made  a subject access request (SAR) to NatWest.  They  said that it 
wasnt handled properly,  took too long and believed information had been withheld.
Mr and Mrs D complained  to NatWest. It accepted that it shouldve followed the instructions 
given about the change  of address, and amended its records  and that of the credit  reference 
agencies. It paid £250 compensation for this error.  In relation to the SAR, NatWest  said it 
couldve made the process smoother, but it had used  the email  address given when the first 
complaint was made (after initially mistyping it). It accepted that it hadnt been told to use this 
email address to deal with the second complaint. NatWest  sent the information by post and 
paid £100 compensation  for the trouble and upset caused by its handling  of the SAR.  It gave 
Mr and Mrs D a period of time to move to another lender without paying an early  repayment 
charge as the relationship  between  them  and NatWest appeared to have broken down.
Mr and Mrs D complained  to us. NatWest explained  that when Mr and Mrs D accepted the 
consent to let offer, they ticked the box to say change the address immediately and sent 
details of the new correspondence address. But it also said there was a handwritten note 
saying not to change the address  yet; NatWest said this was the cause of the confusion. It 
pointed out that it had asked for evidence  from the other lender that the sale and purchase 
fell through purely because of the change of address shown in the credit records, and no 
evidence had been provided.
The investigators view was that NatWest did make a mistake by changing the address when 
asked not to do so. But she noted that NatWest did correct the credit file, which  she said was 
reasonable. The investigator said that there had been no evidence  provided that the credit  
file address issue caused the sale of a property to fall through,  and thought £250 
compensation was fair and reasonable for this issue.  In relation to the SAR, the investigator 
accepted that there had been slight delays and NatWest had used an incorrect  email 
address. But she said NatWest put things right by sending the information  and the £100  
compensation offer was fair and reasonable. The investigator also noted  that NatWest  was 
checking all the information had been  provided and would  deal with that issue  direct.
Mr and Mrs D disagreed.  They said NatWest  was allowed to treat consumers  poorly and 
repeated that they believed its failings had caused  them to lose their buyer. The investigator 
asked for evidence that the sale was lost purely due to NatWests  actions;  it wasnt provided.
Ref: DRN74063802my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Address
Its clear that Mr and Mrs Ds instructions  were  overlooked by NatWest. But I can also see 
that when Mrs D told NatWest about  its error, it put things right by changing both its records  
and that of the credit reference  agencies.  
Mr and Mrs D have said that NatWests  addition of the new address affected their credit  
record to such an extent,  they couldnt get a new mortgage to buy a property and their 
property sale fell through. That would  be an unusual situation in my experience  and note that 
no evidence has been provided to show this was the reason why the property sale fell 
through, despite both NatWest and this service asking for it. 
Im not persuaded on the evidence available to me that Mr and Mrs D have suffered financial 
loss or that the £250 compensation  paid for the trouble and upset caused is unfair or 
unreasonable in the circumstances. Its more than I wouldve recommended as theres  no 
evidence that the error  had an effect, other  than clearly frustrating Mr and Mrs D. I also note 
that NatWest offered  to let Mr and Mrs D go elsewhere without paying any early  repayment 
charges for a period  of time,  which  is a fair and reasonable offer as it appears that the 
relationship has broken  down. 
SAR
Data protection issues, including SARs, are a matter for the Information  Commissioners 
Office, not this service.  While I can look at whether NatWest has generally  acted fairly  and 
reasonably when dealing with the mortgage  account, including  dealing with Mr and Mrs D, I 
wont decide whether data protection  law has been breached or whether there is outstanding 
information not supplied to Mr and Mrs D. This is outside the jurisdiction of this service.
I note that the SAR was delivered  slightly late. I dont think it was necessarily unfair or 
unreasonable for NatWest to use an email address given to it by Mr and Mrs D for another  
complaint, though it was a mistake to initially mistype that address. But the process couldve 
been smoother  as NatWest accepts, and I think £100 compensation is fair and reasonable 
for the trouble and upset  caused by the minor  difficulties with the SAR.  I understand that the 
information was also sent by hard copy and if Mr and Mrs D believe not everything  has been 
provided, they should take up this issue with NatWest and the Information Commissioners 
Office.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs D to accept or reject my decision 
before 25 March 2020.
