The complaint
Mr C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed a branch earlier than 
advertised. Hes also unhappy that it didnt address his complaint about another business 
within the same banking group.
What happened
Mr C complained to NatWest about one of its branches closing earlier than advertised. He 
also complained about blocks being put on his credit card.
NatWest apologised for the branch giving Mr C misleading information about its closing time 
and offered him £40 compensation. It paid him an additional £2.70 to reimburse him for call 
costs. But it said there was no restriction on his card, so it didnt uphold this part of his 
complaint.
After Mr C brought his complaint to our service, NatWest told us he had cards with both 
NatWest and another bank in the same group. It said it believed it was reasonable to state 
that the part of his complaint about the block was to do with Mr Cs card with the other bank. 
It didnt think the case handler investigating his complaint had done anything wrong because 
they were investigating his NatWest complaint and there was no record of an issue with his 
NatWest card. It said Mr C should direct this part of his complaint to the other bank.
Our investigator looked into Mr Cs concerns. He thought the compensation NatWest had 
offered him for the inconvenience he experienced due to the branch closing earlier than 
expected was fair. But he said he couldnt look into the issues with blocks on his card as part 
of his complaint against NatWest and suggested he raise a separate complaint with the 
other bank.
Mr C accepted our investigators view about the branch closing. But he asked for his 
complaint to be escalated to an ombudsman because he was unhappy with how NatWest 
had handled his complaint. He said that NatWest and the other bank are the same legal 
entity. A NatWest employee told him that there was a block on his card. NatWest and the 
other bank use the same staff and centre to deal with credit cards. NatWest should have 
signposted him back to the other bank in July 2019, if it didnt wish to deal with that part of 
his complaint.
Following this, the investigator set up another complaint with the other bank to resolve        
Mr Cs concerns regarding the blocks on his card. Mr C said he was satisfied with how the 
other complaint was resolved but he still wanted an ombudsmans decision on his complaint 
against NatWest. So, his complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.I appreciate Mr C feels frustrated that NatWest didnt investigate his concerns about the 
blocks on his card, or at least refer him to the other bank in the group sooner. But the 
financial ombudsman service only has the power to consider a complaint if it falls within 
certain criteria set out in our case-handling rules. These can be found in the Dispute 
Resolution (DISP) section of the Financial Conduct Authority Handbook (available online). 
DISP 2 says that we can only look into complaints about certain activities, for example, those 
regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority or covered by one of our former schemes. 
Complaint handling isnt a regulated or other covered activity. There is also case law 
confirming that a complaint about complaint handling is not a complaint about a financial 
service, so falls outside of our compulsory jurisdiction. 
Mr C says hes seeking a determination from an ombudsman on the legal status between 
NatWest and another bank in the same group. But this isnt something I can comment on. 
The financial ombudsman services role is to settle individual disputes between consumers 
and businesses who provide financial services.
Mr C has accepted the compensation NatWest offered him for giving misleading information 
on its branchs closing time. What Mr C remains unhappy about are matters Im unable to 
consider. So overall, Im satisfied that NatWest had done enough to resolve Mr Cs 
complaint before it came to our service and I wont be asking it to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 May 2020.
