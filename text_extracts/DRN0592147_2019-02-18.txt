K821x#15complaint
Mr L complains  that he was mis-sold a payment protection  insurance (PPI) policy  when he 
took out a Peoples Bank credit card in 2000. 
As NewDay Ltd (NewDay)  has accepted responsibility for this complaint, I will refer to 
NewDay throughout the remainder of this decision.
background
I issued my provisional decision on 9 January 2019. A copy  of my provisional decision is 
attached and forms part of this final decision.
My provisional decision set out the background to this complaint. It explained why I thought  
the complaint  should be upheld.
Mr L didnt respond to my provisional decision. 
NewDay responded saying that it didnt agree with my provisional  decision. It made  a 
number of comments which were,  in summary, that:
The good value  for money  provided by the policy.
The fact that this wasnt an advised  sale, so it wasnt  necessary for it to ensure the policy 
was suitable for Mr L, including assessing  his other  financial resources at point of sale.
The fact that there  was a cooling off period, during which Mr L could have cancelled the 
policy without charge.
The good level of information about the policy given to Mr L, including the full policy 
documents.
The fact that Mr Ls complaint  didnt highlight any restrictions on the ability to claim for 
unemployment under  the policy.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought carefully about NewDays comments in response to my provisional decision. But 
these dont change  my view that this complaint  should be upheld  for reasons that Ill now 
explain.
I dont think the comment  which  NewDay has made  about the policy  providing  good value for 
money is relevant  to my decision. I say this because the policys value for money  wasnt  a 
reason for me thinking this complaint should  be upheld. 
In my provisional decision I say that I think this was a non-advised sale.  This means I didnt  
place an additional  requirement on NewDay to show that it had ensured the policy  was 
suitable for Mr L, given  his particular circumstances at the time of this sale. So I dont  think 
the comments which NewDay  has made about this in responding to my provisional decision 
are relevant.
I accept that there was a cooling off period when Mr L could have cancelled his policy.  But 
unless Im satisfied that NewDay provided Mr L with clear, and sufficiently prominent, 
Ref: DRN05921472information about the requirements that he would need to satisfy  to claim unemployment 
benefit, I dont  think  his ability to cancel the policy changes my mind  about it being mis-sold.
NewDay says that a good level of information  was provided to Mr L about  the policy he was 
buying, including the full policy documents. But I dont think what its said has given me any 
greater confidence  that, at the time of the sale, Mr L would have been made sufficiently 
aware of the conditions  he would need to meet to make  a successful claim for 
unemployment as a self-employed person. And I remain of the view that he wouldnt have 
wanted to buy the policy  if hed been  fully aware  of these conditions.
Finally, NewDay has said that Mr Ls complaint didnt  highlight the restrictions on his ability 
to claim for unemployment  under the policy. But in looking  at whether Mr L was mis-sold  his 
policy, Im not limited to looking at only those issues specifically raised by him. So the 
comment made by NewDay about  this hasnt changed my mind  about upholding this 
complaint.
So for these reasons, together with the ones already given in my attached provisional 
decision, I still think that Mr L was mis-sold his PPI policy  by NewDay  and that hes lost out 
as a result  of this. 
fair compensation
NewDay should put Mr L in the financial position hed be in now if he hadnt taken out PPI. 
The policy should  be cancelled  if it hasnt  been  cancelled already and:
A.NewDay should find out how much Mr L would owe on his credit  card if the policy  hadnt 
been added  to it.
So, it should  remove the PPI premiums added, as well as any interest charged  on those 
premiums. It should also remove any charges that were caused  by the mis-sale of the 
PPI  as well as any interest added  to those charges.
NewDay should then refund the difference between what Mr L owes and what  he would 
have owed.
If Mr L made  a successful claim under the PPI policy,  NewDay can take off what he got 
for the claim from the amount it owes him.
B.If  when NewDay works out what Mr L would have owed each month  without PPI  Mr L 
paid more than enough to clear  his balance, NewDay should also pay simple  interest  on 
the extra Mr L paid.  And it should carry on paying interest until the point when Mr L 
would have owed  NewDay something  on his credit  card.  The interest  rate should be 8% 
a year.
C.NewDay should tell Mr L what its done to work out A and B.
 HM Revenue  & Customs  requires NewDay to take off tax from this interest.  NewDay  must 
give Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN05921473my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above and in my provisional decision, Im upholding this 
complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 March  2019.

complaint
Mr L complains  that he was mis-sold a payment protection insurance (PPI)  policy when  he took out a 
Peoples Bank credit  card in 2000. 
As NewDay Ltd (NewDay) has accepted responsibility for this complaint, I will refer to NewDay 
throughout the remainder  of this provisional  decision.
background
Our adjudicator thought that Mr Ls complaint should  be upheld.  She didnt think  the cost of the policy 
was made clear enough  to Mr L. And if it had been, she didnt think he would still have taken  the PPI. 
This was because he appeared to have other means of making his repayments,  so he didnt have a 
strong need for the policy. 
NewDay didnt agree  with the adjudicators view, so the case has been passed to me. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.  
NewDay has told us that Mr L wasnt given advice  about buying the PPI policy. And having
looked at all the available  evidence,  I think this is likely  to have been the case. This means  that 
NewDay didnt need to ensure that the policy  was suitable  for Mr L. But it still needed to ensure that it 
gave him enough information for him to decide if he wanted it.
In this case, I dont think NewDay did give Mr L good enough information  about  the policy  for reasons 
that Ill now explain.
NewDay has provided  a copy of the Policy Terms & Conditions  document  which it says would have 
applied at the time of this sale. Under the section headed Involuntary Unemployment Insurance 
Cover,  theres  an exclusion from paying any benefit if You are Self-Employed and You cannot 
provide proof that You have stopped trading  and finished  Your Self-Employed business  by production 
of a certificate from Your accountant and Your official notice from the Commissioner for the Inland 
Revenue
I think  these stated conditions for claiming  unemployment benefit when  self-employed were  onerous 
and therefore represented a significant limitation in the policy. As such, they should have  been clearly  
drawn attention to by NewDay as part of its sales process. This was so that customers could  make a 
properly informed choice  about whether  to buy the PPI cover offered.
NewDay has provided  a sample of the credit  card application form that it says Mr L would have 
completed, selecting the option provided  to take PPI cover. But there isnt any information given  on 
this form about the specific conditions applying to self-employed people  claiming unemployment 
benefit under this policy.
NewDay says that Mr L would have received information  relating  to the policys features and benefits  
at the time of the sale. But I dont think that I can be sure that this particular  exclusion was explained  
clearly enough to him. And even if hed had the opportunity 
to look at the policy document before  deciding  to purchase  the cover, I think that its quite likely that 
he still wouldnt have  fully appreciated the terms for claiming unemployment  benefit as a self-
employed person. 
Ref: DRN05921475Mr L says that at the time of this PPI sale he was working in a business  which he owned. So I think 
the conditions that had to be met in order for him to claim unemployment benefit under the policy as a 
self-employed person  would have been of importance to him. And I think  its likely  that, if NewDay had 
drawn Mr Ls attention to these  conditions clearly enough, he wouldnt have bought the policy. I say 
this because I dont think Mr L would have wanted to pay the full monthly  premium for the policy when 
he might have difficulty in claiming for one of the key benefits it offered.
So, on the basis of what Ive seen so far, I think that Mr L has lost out because NewDay didnt  explain 
the policy  conditions relating  to self-employed people clearly enough.
fair compensation
NewDay should  put Mr L in the financial position hed be in now if he hadnt  taken out PPI. The policy 
should be cancelled  if it hasnt been  cancelled already and:
D.NewDay should  find out how much Mr L would  owe on his credit  card if the policy hadnt  been 
added to it.
So, it should remove the PPI premiums  added, as well as any interest charged on those  
premiums. It should also remove any charges that were caused by the mis-sale of the PPI  as 
well as any interest added to those charges.
NewDay should  then refund the difference between what Mr L owes and what  he would have 
owed.
If Mr L made a successful claim under  the PPI policy,  NewDay can take off what  he got for the 
claim from the amount  it owes him.
E.If  when NewDay works  out what Mr L would have owed each month without  PPI  Mr L paid 
more than enough  to clear his balance,  NewDay should also pay simple interest on the extra Mr L 
paid. And it should carry on paying interest until the point when  Mr L would  have owed NewDay 
something on his credit  card. The interest rate should be 8% a year.
F.NewDay  should tell Mr L what its done to work  out A and B.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires  NewDay to take off tax from this interest.  NewDay must  give Mr L 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  given,  Im currently intending  to uphold Mr Ls complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to 
put things right as set out above.
I now invite  both parties to make any further representations  in writing that theyd like me to consider 
by 9 February 2019, before I make my final decision.
