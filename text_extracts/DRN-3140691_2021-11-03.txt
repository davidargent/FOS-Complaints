The complaint
Mr H complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA unfairly dealt with a sale he made
and returned the funds to the buyer.
What happened
Mr H was selling used equipment and entered into protracted negotiations with a buyer who
Ill refer to as V. A price for the equipment was eventually agreed on, and separate
discussions were held about the transport of the equipment.
It was agreed that V would arrange collection and delivery of the items. Mr H received a call
out of the blue that a courier was waiting outside a unit he was using to store the items. Mr H
returned to the unit and the courier took the parcels. Mr H has said the courier accepted
responsibility for them and Mr H confirmed with V about the arrangements to transport the
items.
The next day V raised a dispute about the condition of the items and Mr H said it was the
couriers responsibility. An agreement couldnt be reached, and V escalated the dispute to a
claim which PayPal dealt with under their Buyer Protection Scheme.
Vs dispute was that the items were significantly not as described (SNAD) and PayPal asked
for evidence which V sent them. The evidence was an independent technical report that
identified problems with all of the items sold by Mr H. PayPal accepted the evidence and
asked V to send the packages back to Mr H and provide PayPal with proof of delivery.
PayPal advised Mr H that the items were being returned and once that happened, they
would credit the buyers account from Mr Hs PayPal account. The items were sent back via
courier to Mr Hs home address. At the time there were builders working on the property and
Mr H wasnt home. Mr Hs builders refused the delivery and the items were sent back to the
buyer.
V provided evidence to PayPal that the items had been sent but were refused by the seller at
his home address. PayPal relied on the terms and conditions of their service to credit the
account of the buyer. Mr H tried to get a new delivery of the items, but this wasnt possible
and eventually V advised the items had been destroyed.
Mr H complained to PayPal about how hed lost both the items and the money he was paid
for them. PayPal investigated the complaint but wouldnt change the outcome. Mr H then
brought his complaint to our service for an independent review. It was looked into by one of
our investigators who thought PayPal had acted in line with the terms of the agreements and
didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr H disagreed with the outcome and asked for his complaint to be reviewed again. I issued 
a provisional decision based on additional evidence that Id had chance to consider and 
offered both parties the opportunity to comment before I issued a final decision. In my 
provisional decision I said:
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This complaint has been made by Mr H against PayPal. The complaint doesnt involve V,
apart from understanding that V raised a dispute and then a claim with PayPal.
So, Mr H was a seller of goods and V was the buyer. PayPal have both Buyer and Seller
protection in place for certain goods that are sold. Seller protection (for Mr H) doesnt include
SNAD disputes/claims. Buyer protection is available for SNAD claims and it was this that V
relied on to get her money back.
PayPal recommend in their terms that the seller doesnt use a shipping service arranged by
the buyer, which is what happened here. Mr H said the buyers courier turned up in a shoddy
Luton van and packaged the items himself. Mr H was worried about the transport
arrangements, although he received assurances from the driver that he was insured against
damage. Mr H received the first dispute from V about the condition of the items the next day.
Using the buyers courier was a risk for Mr H as he didnt package the items himself and he
no longer had any control over the transport or delivery of the items.
Mr H explained that he didnt receive any paperwork from the courier, which I would think is
unusual for a legitimate transport company. If there was any damage caused during
transport, it would be more difficult to prove because of the way it was arranged. If Mr H had
packaged and sent the items himself via a legitimate courier company, the condition of the
items would have been easier to establish upon delivery. But, Vs eventual claim to PayPal
was about more than any potential damage caused during transport.
In order to successfully receive a refund from the seller, V had to follow PayPals
instructions, which included proving the items were SNAD. V sent PayPal evidence that
proved to PayPals satisfaction the items were SNAD. Ive seen the document sent to
PayPal, which is an independent technical report that identified several problems with each
item affecting their performance. Mr H, in his complaint to our service, said the items were
fault free and hed had them regularly inspected whilst in use, including a final check done
once theyd been prepared for sale. The independent report is at odds with his claim.
I asked to see Mr Hs evidence on two occasions but never received anything, so Im unable
to compare what each report would have said. But, the independent evidence supplied by V
does show the items werent fault free  as was claimed by Mr H. The faults described are
unlikely to be caused by the transport of the items as theyre related to malfunctioning
components and non-standard fitments within the equipment. I cant say if there was
additional damage caused to the items during transport, because the evidence sent to
PayPal relates to the engineers report about the functioning of the items. The evidence Ive
seen demonstrates that its more than likely that the items werent fault free, as Mr H
claimed, and Im satisfied that PayPal had sufficient evidence to decide that the items were
SNAD based on the engineers report alone.
Once PayPal had sufficient evidence to decide the items were SNAD, all that remained was
for them to be returned to Mr H. Hes complained that PayPal never engaged with him and
that he had reports and photographs showing the condition of the items he was willing to
send them. Theres no evidence that these were ever sent to PayPal and I would think that it
would have been in Mr Hs interest to send all the information he had to PayPal to represent
his case. But, I dont think they change the fact that an independent report showed the items
had several faults and missing or non-genuine parts in them. Once PayPal received this, it
was reasonable for them to conclude the items were SNAD.PayPal updated both parties about the SNAD claim and once the items were returned to Mr
H, PayPal would refund Â£2,070 back to V. Proof of delivery of the items was a requirement
for a refund.
PayPals agreements require the items to be returned to the registered address of the
PayPal member, otherwise the Buyer Protection could be voided. PayPal told V to send
them back to Mr Hs home address, which is what she did. Mr H complained that the items
should have been returned to a different address, but PayPal told V where to send the items
in accordance with their agreement  which was Mr Hs home address. The items were
returned as instructed and I dont think PayPal needed to do anything different as they were
following their own agreement and notified both parties what was happening.
Part of PayPals user agreement states:
b. the Payment Recipient to accept back the item sent to it by the buyer and refund the
buyer the full purchase price plus original postage costs. If the Payment Recipient
refuses to accept an item sent back to the Payment Recipient by the buyer at PayPals
direction), PayPal may award the Claim in favour of the buyer, provided the buyer has
provided satisfactory evidence to PayPal that the item was sent to the Payment
Recipient at an address supplied to the buyer by PayPal during the Claim process.
Further terms state:
If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not
receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back plus pay for return
shipping costs.
V arranged for the items to be returned to Mr Hs home address. Mr H has provided
testimony that his builders refused the delivery because the items were destroyed and not
packaged effectively (rips and dodgy), he also said that because of upheaval at the property
due to building work, they couldnt be stored. The items were then returned by the courier
service to V.
The courier company who tried to deliver the items are a well-known business and their
shipping information doesnt mention any issues with the packaging or damage to the items.
Id expect the shipping company to comment on the reason for refusal if the packaging was
damaged as that would potentially involve them in a claim against them. All the shipping
details say about the delivery is that The receiver does not want the product and refused
delivery. Theres no evidence from the shipping company that the items were badly
packaged or destroyed.
I appreciate Mr H had builders at his home and I dont know the state of the property at the
time, but PayPals notification that the items were being returned would have given him
notice that the items were going to turn up and consider how best to deal with them. The
refusal of the delivery by his builders doesnt mean that the items werent sent back as per
PayPals instructions.
Mr H then stated he made further unsuccessful attempts to get the items returned to him. V
eventually declared the items had been thrown away. PayPal decided that because V had
shown proof that the items had been returned to Mr H (even though the delivery had been
refused), they would refund the cost of the items to V. Ive seen the evidence that the
packages were sent to Mr Hs home address and Im satisfied that V tried to deliver them
back to Mr H.Taking everything into account, Im satisfied PayPal followed the user agreements to settle
the claim made by V. I understand Mr H still hasnt received his items back and believes
them thrown away. But, PayPal had made Mr H aware that the equipment was being
returned and I dont think PayPal had to do any more at that stage. In PayPals terms, they
state that the buyer may not get their items back, which is what ultimately happened here. I
think it has applied the terms of its own agreement correctly and I cant reasonably require it
to go further than those here. So, although I understand Mr Hs position, I dont have a basis
to find that PayPal has made a mistake or acted unfairly, and I wont be instructing PayPal to
do anything further.
My provisional decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not intending to uphold the complaint against PayPal
(Europe) Sarl et Cie.
I invited Mr H and PayPal to give me any more evidence and information they wanted me to 
consider before issuing my final decision. Neither party has commented on my provisional 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, and as neither Mr H or PayPal responded, I see no reason to reach a 
different conclusion. So, this final decision confirms the findings set out in my provisional 
decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2021.
