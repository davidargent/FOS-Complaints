Mrs P complains about how PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA have handled a transaction  on 
her account  with them.
background 
Mrs P sold an item for £600 and received payment for it to her PayPal account.  The buyer 
collected it in person,  but later raised  a dispute saying the item wasnt as described. PayPal 
agreed to refund the transaction and instructed  the buyer to return  the item to Mrs P. They 
debited Mrs Ps account, but she never  received the item back. The transaction  left her 
account overdrawn and she was contacted by a debt collection agency  acting on behalf of 
PayPal. 
Mrs P complained to PayPal in May 2018.  As she didnt receive a satisfactory response, she 
referred her complaint  to us. After  we agreed to take her complaint on and raised  it with 
PayPal, they issued a final response  on 28 August 2018 and offered to refund Mrs P £600. 
But Mrs P was unhappy with that as a resolution.  She rejected PayPals offer as she felt it 
didnt take into account the stress  shed  suffered  as a result of having to go backwards and 
forwards to argue her case, and especially being contacted by debt collectors. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into Mrs Ps complaint. He felt PayPal could have handled 
the dispute better and shouldnt have refunded the buyer without confirming Mrs P had 
received the item back. He endorsed their offer to refund the £600. He recommended  
PayPal should  also pay interest of 8% per year from the day it was debited to the date the 
money is returned to her and £100 for the trouble  and upset this matter caused  Mrs P.
Mrs P accepted our adjudicators recommendation, but PayPal rejected it. They said theyd 
made the offer to refund  the money to Mrs P in their final response and she should have 
gone back to them if she wanted compensation. As theres been  no agreement, the 
complaint has been passed to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its not in dispute  that buyer  was refunded  and that Mrs P didnt receive goods back. So its 
fair and reasonable that she should  receive  a refund for the amount taken from her account. 
PayPal have offered  a refund so I dont need to comment further  on that. What remains in 
dispute  and that I need to decide - is whether or not its also fair and reasonable that 
PayPal should  also pay interest and compensation to Mrs P. I think  they should and will 
explain why. 
PayPal have said they shouldnt have to pay Mrs P more than £600  as theyd offered that in 
their final response,  and theyd have welcomed her response if she was unhappy with that 
as a resolution. But PayPals final response said Mr P could refer the matter  to us if she 
wished. Mrs P asked us to look into the complaint as she wasnt  satisfied  with the outcome. 
Under the complaint handling  rules  set out by the Financial Conduct Authority, there is no 
duty for a consumer to go back to the business  after a final response has been issued.
In Mrs Ps complaint, theres no dispute  that she hasnt had item back so shes been  unable 
to resell it. As PayPal  debited her account without ensuring she had it back, shes been 
Ref: DRN77565102deprived of the money and should have it  or the item - returned.  There seems no prospect 
of the item now being returned  to her because it appears to have gone missing  in transit  
from the buyer. So I think PayPal should  return the money. 
Our usual  approach where we feel a consumer has been deprived  of funds as a result of a 
businesss action or inaction,  is to award  interest of 8% simple per year for the time theyre 
out of pocket. I see no reason to deviate  from that approach here. 
And its clear  that Mrs P has been  encountered  trouble and upset as a result  of the issues  
raised in this complaint  not least being  contacted by debt collectors on behalf of PayPal. 
Taking all the circumstances into account,  I think  an award of £100  is a fair and reasonable 
recognition of this.   
my final decision
I uphold Mrs Ps complaint. PayPal  Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA should:
Pay Mrs P £600.
Pay interest at 8% from the day the £600 was it was debited from her account to the 
date it is returned.  If PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA consider they are required by 
HM Revenue  & Customs to withhold income tax from the interest, they should  tell 
Mrs P how much theyve taken off. They should  also give her a tax deduction  
certificate if she asks for one so that she can reclaim the tax if appropriate.
Pay Mrs P £100 for the trouble and upset this matter has caused her. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 June  2019.
