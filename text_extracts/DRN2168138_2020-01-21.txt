Miss P says Elevate Credit International  Limited,  trading as Sunny, irresponsibly lent to her. 
background
This complaint is about one running  account credit  facility  and 26 instalment loans Sunny 
provided to Miss P between April 2014  and May 2018. I shall refer to the running account 
credit facility as Loan 1. This credit  facility allowed Miss P to drawdown amounts up to her 
credit limit of £750. But her first drawdown  amount  was £400 and she drew down eleven 
further amounts  in the next eight months under  the facility. The instalment loans were 
repayable by 24 weekly instalments. Miss P repaid Loans 1 to 26. Loan 27 was repaid by 
Sunny offsetting  some  compensation  it had offered in relation to Loan  1. Miss Ps lending 
history is as follows:

In its final response letter,  Sunny said that at certain points its product may not have been 
suitable for Miss Ps needs.  It offered  to refund the interest and charges  paid on Loan 1 and 
pay 8% simple interest on the refunds. It said that there were no adverse entries on Miss Ps 
credit file to remove as Miss P had paid the loan on time.
our adjudicators view
Ref: DRN21681382Our adjudicator noted that Sunny had made  an offer to settle Loan 1 but that Miss P had 
rejected the offer.  So the adjudicator investigated Loan 1 in her assessment. The adjudicator 
recommended that Miss Ps complaint about  all the loans should  be upheld.  
Sunny responded to the adjudicators recommendations and said that it noted the 
adjudicators comments  regarding its offer to refund all the interest and charges on Loan 1. 
So it was investigating  Loans 2 to 27 only. It said that it disagreed with the adjudicators  
recommendations about those loans. Sunny said that Miss Ps net monthly disposable 
income which ranged from £167  to £677  per month,  was clearly sufficient to meet the 
contractual monthly repayments. So it believed there was no evidence that approval of these 
loans put undue stress on Miss Ps financial  situation. 
It said that some loans were settled  early and therefore, accrued less interest.  The ability  to 
repay loans  early didnt  appear to be consistent with Miss P being in financial difficulty  at the 
time. 
Sunny said it undertook  a new affordability  and creditworthiness  assessment using the data 
provided and further information provided  by the credit reference agencies before  each  
loan.   After review, Miss Ps loan repayments  were deemed affordable and sustainable 
based upon the income and expenditure information provided and any additional credit 
commitment expenditure  it deemed  relevant on the credit file.    
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Miss P 
and to Sunny on 23 December  2019.  I summarise my findings:
As it appeared that Sunny  had already offered to settle Loan 1, I hadnt investigated this 
loan. I could see that Sunny had already applied part of its proposed compensation on 
Loan 1 to repay the outstanding balance on Loan 27. But it didnt appear to have  paid the 
balance of its redress to Miss P. So Id included the rest of the redress  for Loan 1 in my 
proposed compensation award.
I noted that when  Sunny  lent to Miss P the regulator was the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) and relevant regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit  Sourcebook  
(CONC). The CONC contained guidance for lenders about responsible lending. 
I said that Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this meant that it should have carried out proportionate  checks to make  sure 
Miss P could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner. These  checks  could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I thought  less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors included:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN21681383the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer had been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated  
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There might  even come a point where the lending  history  and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrated that the lending was unsustainable.
I thought it was important  to say that Sunny was required to establish whether  Miss P could  
sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation. 
I explained that the loan payments  being  affordable on this basis  might  be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it didnt automatically follow  this 
was the case.  This was because the CONC defined sustainable as being without undue  
difficulties and in particular the consumer  should be able to make repayments, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it followed that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wouldnt be able to make their repayments  sustainably  if they were unlikely to be 
able to make  their repayments without borrowing further. 
Id carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all meant for Miss Ps complaint.
Sunny had made a number of checks before it lent to Miss P. It appeared that from Loan  1 it 
had asked her for details  of her monthly  income,  and from Loan 2 it had asked her for details 
of her expenditure. Miss Ps declared income  for all the loans ranged from £511 on Loan 1 to 
£1,167.33 on Loans 23 to 27.
Sunny had also checked Miss Ps credit file before agreeing to the loans. It had provided us 
with a summary of the results of its credit checks. 
I noted that under Loan 1 Miss P took 12 credit advances  in eight months. She then took 
until April 2015 to repay these. But before shed finished repaying Loan 1, shed  taken out 
Loan 2 in early  February 2015.
Id looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending with Miss P to see if there  was a point at 
which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ps case, I thought that this point was reached by 
Loan 2. I said this because:
By Loan  2, Miss P had been borrowing from Sunny for over nine months and she still 
had repayments  totalling around  £785 to make  to Sunny when she took out Loan 2.
I thought Sunny should have seen  that Miss P was showing signs of dependency on 
this credit and that further borrowing wasnt sustainable. 
Ref: DRN21681384Miss P had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period.
I could see that as Sunny didnt stop lending at this point, Miss P went  on to take out another  
26 loans in the following 40 months. I thought that Miss P lost out because  Sunny continued  
to provide borrowing from Loan 2 onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ps indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
The number of advances combined  with the total length  of time that Miss P had been 
borrowing from Sunny  was likely to have had negative implications on Miss Ps ability  
to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
The fact that most  of the loans were  repaid didnt mean that they were  repaid 
sustainably, or without causing Miss P undue difficulty. 
Id taken into account the main points raised  by Sunny in its response  to the adjudicators  
view. 
Id noted that Sunny  had said that Miss Ps disposable income was sufficient to meet  her 
repayments. Sunny had also said that it made credit checks  and it had also used the 
information Miss P had provided to assess  the affordability of the loans. But I thought  Sunny 
knew (or ought to have known)  from previous  decisions (as well as what was set out on our 
website) that there were cases where  this service considered the overall  lending  pattern and 
not just the affordability of each loan.  And there would  be times when the pattern of lending  
alone was enough to indicate that a consumer was likely to be in financial difficulty   or 
would otherwise be harmed should  relending  continue. 
Sunny had also said that Miss Ps ability  to repay  her loans early wasnt  consistent  with her 
being in financial  difficulties. Id thought that when  a consumer continuously repaid loans 
early, this should have  raised concerns with her lender  that the consumer might not be 
managing repayments sustainably  and that she might be dependent on short term lending to 
meet an ongoing  need.
And when  a consumer  borrowed numerous loans over a long period of time, it was most 
likely that the loans werent being  used for their intended purpose of temporary cash  flow 
problems. As Sunny  would know, the FCA had made it clear in a recent letter  to CEOs of 
high cost lending  firms  that a high volume of relending..may be symptomatic  of 
unsustainable lending  patterns. And I thought that was the case here.
Subject to any further representations by Miss P or Sunny  my provisional  decision was that 
I intended to uphold this complaint. I intended to order Sunny to take the following steps:
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Refund all interest  and charges Miss P paid on Loans 1 to 27 and pay interest of 8% 
simple a year on such refunded interest  and charges from the date they were paid to 
the date of settlement (less any amount  already used to offset the outstanding 
balance on Loan 1)*;
Remove adverse  entries about Loan 1 from Miss Ps credit  file;
Remove all entries about Loans 2 to 27 from Miss Ps credit  file. 
Ref: DRN21681385*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss P a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one. 
Miss P responded to my provisional decision to say she was happy for me to move forward.  
She provided no further information.
Sunny said that it would await  the final decision.  It provided no further information.
 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Given that both Miss P and Sunny have given me nothing further to consider, I see no 
reason to depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.  It follows  that I 
uphold this complaint and require Sunny to pay Miss P some compensation as set out 
below.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement of this complaint, I 
order Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny, to:
Refund all interest  and charges Miss P paid on Loans 1 to 27 and pay interest of 8% 
simple a year on such refunded interest  and charges from the date they were paid to 
the date of settlement (less any amount  already used to offset the outstanding 
balance on Loan 1)*;
Remove adverse  entries about Loan 1 from Miss Ps credit  file;
Remove all entries about Loans 2 to 27 from Miss Ps credit  file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss P a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 February  2020.
