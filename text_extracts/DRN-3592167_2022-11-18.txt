The complaint
Miss B complains that NewDay Ltd didnt refund a payment she made. 
What happened
In November 2021, Miss B attended a photoshoot with a company Ill call T. Miss B had 
paid a £50 refundable deposit to secure her place following an application she made to be 
assessed for modelling work. Miss B attended the photoshoot and she says T told her that 
she had the potential to get paid modelling work. She says T agreed to help her with this by 
introducing her to modelling agencies that could source her paid work. 
Miss B signed up to a package with T costing £1,500. The £50 deposit she had already paid 
was deducted from that price and she paid the remaining £1,450 using her NewDay credit 
card. The contract Miss B signed with T said that she had agreed to purchase: A digital Z 
card, an online modelling portfolio, a disc containing 30 photos and access to Ts agency 
liaison service.
Soon after the photoshoot Miss B says she realised she had likely been the victim of a scam. 
She said shed seen numerous reports online about T operating a scam. She said she tried 
to visit Ts offices to ask for a refund, but nobody would let her in. She then contacted 
NewDay for assistance in December 2021 to ask it to help her get her money back.
NewDay processed a chargeback through the relevant card scheme, but T defended the 
chargeback stating that Miss B had received all the services T had agreed to provide in the 
contract. NewDay asked Miss B to provide any further evidence or documentation to support 
her claim that T hadnt provided what it had agreed to. When Miss B didnt provide further 
information, the chargeback failed. NewDay also considered Miss Bs claim for a refund 
under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (section 75) but it said that it didnt think 
it had any liability to provide Miss B with a refund. 
Our investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. She thought that NewDay had 
acted fairly in attempting a chargeback to try and recover the payment Miss B had made. 
She didnt think NewDay were unreasonable in not pursuing the chargeback further based 
on the limited information Miss B had been able to provide in support of her claim. For the 
same reasons, she wasnt satisfied that NewDay had any liability to refund her under 
section 75 either.  
Miss B didnt agree with the outcome, so the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss B made a payment to T using her NewDay credit card. Ive therefore thought about 
whether NewDay acted fairly and reasonably in its attempts to assist Miss B with her dispute 
and claim for a refund. 
NewDay initially attempted to recover Miss Bs payment through the chargeback process. 
This is operated by the relevant card scheme and is a way in which payment settlement 
disputes are resolved between card issuers (such as NewDay) and merchants (such as T). 
In certain situations, such as where goods arent supplied or are misrepresented, the 
scheme provides a way for NewDay to ask for a refund of a payment Miss B made.
NewDay isnt obliged to process a chargeback, but I would consider it good practice for it to 
do so where the right exists and where there was a reasonable prospect of success. Miss B 
had indicated that she believed shed been the victim of a scam. In these circumstances 
I think NewDay acted fairly by initiating a chargeback. 
The chargeback was however defended by T. Where a chargeback is defended NewDay 
can make a further presentment to that defence and ultimately it could have also asked the 
card scheme to arbitrate on the matter if T continued to defend it. NewDay chose not to 
pursue the chargeback further following Ts defence and this was because Miss B hadnt 
provided any further evidence of a breach of contract by T. 
Having thought about what Miss B said she understood she would be getting from T when 
she initially raised her complaint with NewDay, this appears to be exactly what was listed on 
the contract she signed with T. For this reason, I can understand why NewDay wanted some 
further clarification and evidence about what part of the contract had allegedly been 
breached. As Miss B didnt provide this information, I dont think NewDay acted 
unreasonably in not pursuing the chargeback further. 
NewDay also considered whether it had any liability to Miss B under section 75. In summary, 
section 75 holds NewDay jointly liable (as the provider of credit) for any breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by T (who Miss B paid using her NewDay credit card), provided that 
certain conditions are met. For completeness, Im satisfied those conditions are met here. 
NewDay didnt think it had any liability to Miss B under section 75 because it said that it 
could not identify any breach of contract or misrepresentation by T despite asking Miss B to 
provide further information or evidence about this. 
Based on everything Miss B has said and provided, Im not persuaded that the goods and 
services she agreed to purchase from T were misrepresented to her or that there has been a 
breach of contract. It seems that everything she believed she would be getting was listed on 
the contract she signed. Further, shes not provided any persuasive evidence to demonstrate 
some or all of those things were not made available to her by T. 
I note Miss B says that there are numerous reports online of T operating a scam. Our service 
is aware of modelling scams which have been publicised online and in the media. This 
service has also seen examples of those types of modelling scams previously. However, Im 
not persuaded that the circumstances Miss B describes and the evidence and information 
shes been able to provide in this particular case, mean that NewDay acted unfairly in the 
way it handled her request for assistance in seeking a refund of what she paid. 
While its possible Miss B was a victim of a scam, in the specific circumstances of this case, 
I dont think NewDay acted unreasonably in not pursuing the chargeback further than it did, 
nor do I think it was unreasonable for it to decline her claim under section 75. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 December 2022.
