K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that five instalment loans  he took out with Harvey & Thompson Limited were 
unaffordable. 
background
Mr B took out five instalment  loans with Harvey & Thompson. These  were:
loan date approved amount instalments monthly repayment date repaid
1 02.01.2014 £500 9 £69.99 21.02.2014
2 21.02.2014 £500 9 £69.00 04.04.2014
3 04.04.2014 £1000 46 £34.99 20.02.2015
4 15.04.2014 £250 10 £31.64 24.04.2015
5 19.12.2015 £500 20 £36.70 25.04.2017
Before providing  the loans,  Harvey & Thompson  says that it asked Mr B about  his income 
and expenditure.  It says that it also asked him to provide bank statements and a payslip for 
review. It says these checks were proportionate  in all of the circumstances that it knew about  
at the time of each loan.
Mr B says that he was in financial difficulties at the time and Harvey  & Thompson should 
have known about this and not lent him the money on each occasion.
Our adjudicator thinks Harvey & Thompson carried out enough checks  when it agreed to 
lend Mr B money, and so they did not think that it needed to do anything more or that it did 
anything wrong.
Mr B did not agree  and so his complaint has come  to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the overarching  questions I need  to consider  in deciding  whats  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint are:
Did Harvey & Thompson, at the time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate 
checks to satisfy  itself that Mr B would be able to repay in a sustainable way?
oIf not, would  those checks have shown that Mr B would have been 
able to do so.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Bs indebtedness in a way that was otherwise 
unsustainable or harmful?
Did Harvey & Thompson act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
If I determine that Harvey  & Thompson  did not act fairly and reasonably in its dealings  with 
Mr B and that he has lost out as a result, I will go on to consider what is fair compensation.
Ref: DRN57280822Harvey & Thompson was required to lend responsibly. It needed  to make checks  to see 
whether Mr B could  afford to pay back the loan before it lent to him. Those  checks  needed to 
be proportionate to things such as the amount Mr B was borrowing and the length  of the 
agreement. But there was no set list of checks Harvey & Thompson had to do.
When it agreed to lend Loan  1 to Mr B in January 2014, Harvey  & Thompson gathered 
information from him about  his income and it also carried  out a review of his bank 
statements and checked a pay slip. By doing this Harvey & Thompson would have been able 
to see what Mr Bs income was at that time. It would have also been able to review  his 
finances including whether he had any other  short term lending and what regular financial 
commitments he had. 
Within the statements Mr Bs income  and his regular expenditure showed that, going forward  
he would  have been able to make  the 12 repayment  amounts comfortably. The monthly 
amount was small compared  to his regular disposable income and this was his first loan with 
Harvey & Thompson. So I think the checks that Harvey & Thompson  carried  out were 
proportionate and from what it would have seen  when it reviewed Mr Bs statements, I think 
it was reasonable  for it to lend the money to him.
Mr B then took out a second loan in February 2014. Mr B borrowed the same amount as his 
first loan and so the monthly repayments  were still relatively low. His income and 
expenditure that Harvey & Thompson  would have seen in his bank statements still showed 
that he had a similar amount of disposable  income to when  he took out Loan  1. So as the 
repayments remained low compared  to Mr Bs disposable income  and affordable, I again 
think it carried out proportionate checks.  It seems reasonable that it would lend him money  
with the information it had in front of it.
In April 2014, Mr B applied to borrow more money but this time for a much higher amount. 
Harvey & Thompson again gathered information about Mr Bs income and expenditure and 
requested bank statements and a payslip.  
This was Mr Bs third loan with Harvey & Thompson and it was over 46 months. But it was 
carrying out a full review  of Mr Bs income and expenditure on each occasion  that it was 
lending him money.  So it could  review  at the time it was looking to lend him money whether 
he could afford to do so. It would  have seen when it carried  out its review of Mr Bs finances 
that he had enough disposable  income  to afford the repayment amounts.
Harvey & Thompson carried  out the same  checks for Loan 4 and 5 also,  asking about Mr Bs 
income and expenditure as well as reviewing his bank  statements and verifying  his payslip. It 
would have seen  from doing this that these loans were affordable too. So I think  it carried out 
proportionate checks on loans 3, 4 and 5 also.
Overall, while  I understand that Mr B has experienced financial difficulties and he says that 
the five loans were  unaffordable, based on the information that has been provided, I think  
that the checks Harvey  & Thompson carried out before lending  the money for all 5 loans 
were proportionate and they showed  that the loans were also affordable.  So because of this 
I do not uphold  Mr Bs complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I do not uphold this complaint.
Ref: DRN57280823Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 February  2019.
