The complaint
Mr Y complains that HomeServe Membership Limited (HomeServe) set up a policy for him 
without consent and didnt cancel it when he asked it to.
What happened
In 2014 Mr Y noticed hed been paying HomeServe, by Direct Debit, for several home 
emergency policies. He already had cover with another insurer, so he called HomeServe to 
cancel the duplicate policies. He said hed never asked for the policies or made a claim.
Despite asking to cancel, Mr Y noticed that HomeServe had continued to take payments and 
even upgraded the policy. He complained to HomeServe.
HomeServe said it cancelled all policies except the water supply pipes cover when he asked 
it to. In 2018 it upgraded the cover to include plumbing. HomeServe refunded the premiums 
for the upgrade because Mr Y confirmed he already had plumbing cover with another 
insurer. However, it said Mr Y hadnt asked to cancel the water supply pipes cover so it 
rejected his request for a refund of those premiums.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She explained that she couldnt consider Mr Ys 
complaint about whether he originally agreed to the policies in 2002. That was because 
HomeServe wasnt regulated until 2005 so it fell outside our jurisdiction. Our investigator 
thought that it was fair for HomeServe to refund the premiums for the upgrade to Mr Ys 
policy because he demonstrated he already had that cover. However, she didnt think it 
needed to refund the remaining premiums because HomeServe had sent him renewal letters 
each year, making it clear the policy was still available to him.
Mr Y agreed but wanted a further review. He said a strong point in his favour was that 
HomeServe collected Direct Debit payments without his authorisation.
The complaint was passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ys complaint for broadly the same reasons as our investigator. 
Ill explain.
Firstly, Id like to repeat our investigators point about the policy set-up. As HomeServe 
wasnt regulated in 2002, whether or not Mr Y agreed to the policy and authorised the Direct 
Debit payments falls outside our jurisdiction. So I wont be deciding that issue. However, its 
worth me mentioning here that Mr Y did make claims under the policies in the years leading 
up to 2014 before he asked to cancel them.
The remaining complaint is that HomeServe didnt cancel the water supply pipes policy in 
2014 when it cancelled the other policies. Ive looked at the complaint summary Mr Y 
provided, and the claim notes recorded by HomeServe. Both sets of evidence show me that 
Mr Y said he didnt want the water cover cancelled. It doesnt appear to me that there was 
any confusion about what he meant at the time, so I think it was reasonable that HomeServe 
didnt cancel the policy.
HomeServe sent an update to Mr Y shortly after it cancelled the other policies. It confirmed 
his remaining water supply pipes cover and the revised payment schedule. It continued to 
take the premium by Direct Debit, and it sent yearly renewal letters to Mr Y. If Mr Y had 
wanted to cancel all policies, I think its likely the letters and payments wouldve alerted him 
to the fact that HomeServe hadnt cancelled the water supply pipes policy. But he didnt 
contact HomeServe again to question these letters or payments, so I cant say it was 
unreasonable for HomeServe to continue with the cover.
In summary, HomeServe cancelled the other policies in 2014 when Mr Y asked it to, and it 
refunded the premiums for the upgraded part of his water supply pipes policy. I understand 
Mr Y didnt dispute these issues. But, for the reasons given above, I can see why 
HomeServe decided not to refund the premiums for the water supply pipes policy. I think that 
was fair.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, my final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 September 2020.
