The complaint
Ms P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc delayed selling her property after shed 
handed over the keys to it. Ms P asks that NatWest refunds all legal costs and mortgage 
arrears and sells the property to settle the mortgage.
What happened
Ms P took out an interest only buy to let mortgage with NatWest in 2009. She moved 
overseas in 2016. Ms P says it was difficult to manage the property and she decided to sell 
it. However, she didnt receive an offer for more than the outstanding mortgage balance. 
Ms P posted the keys to NatWest in September 2017. 
Ms P says she cant understand why the property hasnt been sold after all this time.
Our investigator said NatWest hadnt handled the possession in a timely manner. She said it 
should refund all interest added to Ms Ps account from 26 June 2019 until sales activity 
resumes following possession taking place. She said NatWest must take reasonable steps 
to complete the timely possession of the property. The investigator said NatWest should pay 
£300 compensation to Ms P for the upset and trouble caused.
NatWest agreed. Ms P didnt agree, saying in summary:
How did NatWest find out about the tenant at the property, and why didnt it take action 
when the tenant left in early 2018? 
Can I direct NatWest to sell the property at an agreed valuation, cap further costs of sale 
(including legal fees, interest and administration costs) and not pursue her for any 
shortfall.
The property might have sold for a better price before the Covid-19 pandemic.
Money is owed to the freeholder and it wont consent to the sale until this is paid. 
Shed like mortgage statements as she hasnt received any for the last two years.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the 
balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in 
light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances. 
Ms P called NatWest in August 2017. She said she no longer wanted the property on which 
NatWest had security. She said shed explored all options and had been unable to sell it. 
She wanted to know if there were costs involved in repossession. NatWest gave her contact 
details for its property sales team.
In late September 2017 Ms P posted the keys to her property to NatWest with a letter. The 
letter said she was unable to maintain mortgage payments and had no assets or income. 
She asked NatWest to write off the debt. She said an auctioneer had secured the property 
with all doors and windows locked. She also said it was tenanted and gave contact details 
for letting agents. She gave a forwarding address overseas, but said she wasnt living at that 
address and post was forwarded to her every two to three months.
NatWest says its usual process with a voluntary surrender is for the borrower to remove 
tenants, as the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the borrower. That didnt 
happen here. A tenant was living in the property when Ms P surrendered it, which meant it 
couldnt be sold with vacant possession. NatWest had to follow a process to evict the tenant. 
NatWest says the timing for this varies, depending on circumstances.
NatWest decided not to appoint a Law of Property Act (LPA) receiver. While a LPA receiver 
is usually appointed by a lender, the receiver acts on behalf of the borrower. NatWest said 
this wasnt appropriate here as Ms P wanted the property to be taken into possession. I think 
that was reasonable.
I wont go into detail about everything that happened after Ms P posted the keys to NatWest. 
I think the main cause of delay here was uncertainty about whether the property was 
occupied. Initially, NatWest sent letters to the property to see if the tenant would respond. 
Having received no response, NatWest tried to take vacant possession in February 2018. 
However, it found a tenant was living in the property. NatWest started the process to evict 
the tenant. Its unclear when (or if) the tenant left the property. While Ms P now says the 
tenant left in February 2018, I havent seen anything to suggest that NatWest knew this.
NatWest says Ms P didnt provide information about the tenancy and rent payments. Ms P 
says she didnt have this information, but I think it was reasonable for NatWest to ask for it. 
Ms P had appointed the letting agents and entered into the tenancy contract in place when 
she surrendered the keys. Ms P emailed NatWest (or its solicitors) in August 2018 and in 
May 2019 saying shed received information from the local council that the property was 
tenanted. I dont know if this was the case or not. However, this information meant NatWest 
had again to investigate whether the property was occupied, and this took time.
NatWest sent a field agent to the property in June 2019. The field agent said no intercoms 
were answered and he couldnt get access to the building. He was unable to establish 
whether the property was vacant. Ms P says NatWest had the keys and could have entered 
the property. I think its not reasonable to say that NatWest should have sent someone to 
enter the property when it thought it might be occupied. 
There were further difficulties due to Ms P being overseas. NatWest needed authority from 
the court to serve documents on Ms P as she was outside of jurisdiction. The court made an 
error with this which caused a delay: NatWest wasnt responsible for that. 
Nonetheless, NatWest should have tried to progress matters in a timely manner, and I think 
it could have moved things along more quickly at times. The field agents report from the visit 
in June 2019 wasnt forwarded to NatWest until September. Instructions to seek a 
possession order werent issued until December 2019. Its not clear whether NatWest had 
obtained a possession order by mid-2020. Due to no fault of either party, further action, 
including field agent visits, was put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
I think its fair that NatWest refunds some of the interest applied to the account to reflect the 
delays that it could have avoided. I think it would be fair and reasonable for it to remove 
interest applied to Ms Ps account from 26 June 2019 until such time as the property is being 
marketed for sale. Ms P asked where rent payments went to and whether the freeholder would consent to the 
sale. NatWest said it didnt receive rent payments. Ms P might want to contact the letting 
agents (which she appointed) about this. Once its taken possession, it will be for NatWest or 
its solicitors to contact the freeholder, as necessary. 
Ms P said before handing over the keys, shed tried to sell the property, and was unable to 
sell it for more than the outstanding mortgage, or at all. While Ms P says the property might 
have sold for a better price before the Covid-19 pandemic, she hasnt provided evidence to 
support this. Its possible there could be a shortfall after NatWest sells the property. Ms P 
says shes concerned about the price at which NatWest might sell the property, and I 
understand shes worried about having a shortfall debt. Id expect NatWest to try to obtain 
the best price reasonably available for the property. But I dont think its reasonable or fair to 
require NatWest to agree the price or value with Ms P. 
Ms P bought buy to let properties as a business, to let them out. When Ms P took out the 
mortgage with NatWest she agreed to pay interest each month. She stopped paying interest 
in 2017. Ms P didnt pay ground rent, service charges or maintenance costs, and its likely 
NatWest will have to pay these costs before selling the property. NatWest is entitled under 
the terms of the mortgage to apply these costs to the mortgage account. The property wasnt 
vacant when Ms P handed over the keys, and NatWest couldnt immediately market it for 
sale with vacant possession: it had to evict any tenants. NatWest incurred legal costs, and 
will incur further costs in taking possession and selling the property.
In the circumstances, I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest to write off 
arrears, legal costs or other costs and fees already applied to Ms Ps mortgage account, or 
require it not to apply future costs to the mortgage account. 
Ms P also asked for copies of mortgage statements, saying she hadnt received statements 
for two years. NatWest sent a copy statement which I can see is addressed to Ms Ps 
overseas address. Ms P can contact NatWest about obtaining further copies if these 
statements werent received. 
Putting things right
While taking vacant possession of this property hasnt been a straightforward matter, I think 
NatWest could have moved the process along more quickly. I think it should waive or 
remove interest applied to Ms Ps account from 26 June 2019 until such time as the property 
is being marketed for sale. 
I think its fair and reasonable for NatWest to pay £300 compensation to Ms P for the upset 
and trouble caused by the delay in taking possession and marketing the property for sale.
My final decision
My decision is that National Westminster Bank plc should:
Pay £300 to Ms P; and
Remove or waive interest applied to Ms Ps account between 26 June 2019 and the date 
the property is marketed for sale. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 June 2021.
