Our adjudicator partially upheld Ms Bs complaint and thought the loans from loan two 
onwards shouldnt have been given. This was because the repayments were a significant 
proportion of Ms Bs income and from loan five Ms Bs borrowing behaviour would suggest 
she had become persistently reliant upon this type of lending. 
Mr Lender said it was willing to uphold loans two to six and made an offer. We put the offer 
to Ms B, but she wasnt willing to accept it as she thought loans two to 11 should be upheld. We asked Mr Lender if it was willing to make an offer for loans seven to 11 as well as loans 
two to six. In its response it asked for its comments about loans seven to 11 to be put to the 
ombudsman. These were with reference to loans seven to 11 being affordable for Ms B and 
other affordability and credit checks. 
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms B 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Ms B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. Ms B didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loan one shouldnt be upheld. And Mr 
Lender has already made an offer for loans two to six. Because of this, I dont think there is 
any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I wont be making a decision about this 
lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing relationship Ms B had with Mr Lender. So, 
it is something I will take into account when considering the other loans she took. 
It only remains for me to consider loans seven to 11 (however, Ive included loans five and 
six in my findings and Ive explained why below). 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Bs complaint. After doing so, Ive decided that loans 
seven to 11 should be upheld. Ill explain why. 
Mr Lender has said that for loans seven to 11, and after taking into account Ms Bs monthly 
income and expenditure, she would be left with sufficient disposable income each month. It 
also told us about the affordability questions it asked Ms B and that her responses wouldnt 
have given it any cause for concern. 
But I think this misses the point the adjudicator was making in that Ms Bs pattern of 
borrowing (from loan five onwards) indicated that she had become persistently reliant upon 
this type of lending. Mr Lender should reasonably have seen that further lending, from loan 
five onwards, was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Mr Lender should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
I say this because (and I include loans five and six for completeness because of the 
indication of persistent reliance and unsustainability from now on):
At this point Mr Lender ought to have realised Ms B was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Ms B had taken out five loans within nine months. So, Mr Lender 
ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms B was having to borrow further 
to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and Ms Bs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Ms Bs first loan was for £400 and loan five was for £1,000. At this point Mr Lender 
ought to have known that Ms B was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall 
in her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
 
Ms B was regularly provided with a new loan within days  and sometimes the 
following day  of settling a previous one. After loan four the amounts borrowed 
stayed the same with the exception of loan 11. And up until then the agreed term of 
the loans had consistently increased, so while the loans would have appeared 
affordable on a pounds and pence basis per month, the payments were now spread 
over a longer term. So, Mr Lenders argument that the loans were affordable doesnt 
detract from the fact that Ms Bs pattern of borrowing indicated she had become 
persistently reliant on high-cost short-term lending. 
 
Ms B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Mr Lender. Loan 11 
was taken out over three years after Ms Bs first. Ms B had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Mr Lender over an extended period.
 I think that Ms B lost out because Mr Lender continued to provide borrowing from loan five 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Bs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Ms B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Ms Bs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about (loans two to six and) loans 
seven to 11 and Mr Lender should put things right.
Putting things right  what Mr Lender needs to do  Ive included all of the upheld 
loans for redress purposes -
refund all interest and charges Ms B paid on loans two to 11;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 
remove any negative information about loans two to four from Ms Bs credit file;
 
the number of loans taken from loan five onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans five to 11 should be removed from 
Ms Bs credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
must give Ms B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Ms Bs complaint. PDL Finance Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 August 2020.
