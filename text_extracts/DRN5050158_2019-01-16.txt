K820x#14complaint
Mr K complains that MoneyPlus  Group  Limited has an incorrect  balance for the amount he 
owes under  his Debt Management  Plan (DMP). He complains that MoneyPlus has not got 
the original balances for his debts.
background
Mr K entered into a DMP which  was taken over by MoneyPlus in 2015.  He says that 
MoneyPlus does  not have  copies  of the original  balances of his debts at the time he entered  
into the DMP and that based on his payments he believes  the balance  on his account is too 
high.
MoneyPlus says that Mr K entered into a DMP with another  company in 2010. MoneyPlus 
acquired Mr Ks account and took over the administration of his DMP in August 2015. At this 
time it was provided with estimated  balances of each of Mr Ks debts but balances prior to 
this were not provided. It says it has since contacted Mr Ks creditors  but they are unable to 
confirm the amounts due when Mr K entered  into the DMP.
MoneyPlus says that Mr K discussed  his concerns with it on a call on 11 January 2018  and 
during this call he said he was happy with the explanations given.
Our investigator said that MoneyPlus should review Mr Ks account  statements alongside  its 
records to establish  how much Mr K has left to pay.
MoneyPlus agreed to our investigators view. It carried out a review  of payments and said 
that Mr K was happy that his payments had been  made to his creditors.  It said that if the only 
outstanding issue  related  to the original  amount  of debt of £54,400 this was not an issue  for 
it. MoneyPlus said that the figure  was not part of the actions of our investigators  view and 
that it had been provided prior to when it took over Mr Ks account  in August 2015.
my provisional conclusions
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. I concluded in summary:
this complaint was against MoneyPlus  so I considered what  I thought  it reasonable to 
hold MoneyPlus  responsible for;
it was reasonable  that MoneyPlus  accepted the balances provided to it at the point 
Mr Ks account was transferred to it;
MoneyPlus had tried to get further  information  about the balances so I found  it had 
done enough to try to assist Mr K;
MoneyPlus carried out a review of the payments Mr K had made towards his DMP 
since 2010 which showed Mr K had paid a total of £46,935.02 and these payments 
had been distributed  to his creditors, minus the agreed monthly management  fees;
although our investigator  thought that because neither MoneyPlus nor the creditors  
had been able to confirm the original balances it was reasonable to use the figure  of 
£54,400 which had been provided  in a letter to Mr K from the company that originally 
set up the DMP, I did not agree;
Ref: DRN50501582the letter provided said that the balances were estimated  based  on the information 
provided by Mr K and on the assumption that all creditors freeze interest and charges  
and that if any of the information provided  was not accurate then the estimate  would 
change;
the creditor balances  information provided by MoneyPlus had balances at a migration 
date of April 2015. These  gave a total balance of £30,838. A further balance was 
provided post migration. I did not find that the information provided  in the letter  
mentioned above was enough to say that MoneyPlus was wrong to rely on the 
balance provided  to it at the point of transfer;
I found it reasonable that MoneyPlus accepted  the balances provided to it and that 
these were used as the basis for Mr Ks outstanding balance.
I understood why Mr K was concerned about  the amount he was being told he still has to 
pay, but based on what I had seen I did not find I could say MoneyPlus had done anything 
wrong by relying  on the balances it was provided with when it took over his DMP. Because  
of this I did not find uphold this complaint.
Mr K did not accept my provisional decision.  He said that the original debt balance  was part 
of the investigation and MoneyPlus should  know what  the amount was. He did not think that 
this issue had been properly addressed. He said at present his account  shows  that he has 
paid £47,835 to his creditors for a total debt of £44,200 and his management fee had 
reduced over time. He said that he had been honest  and maintained his payments but has 
not been treated correctly by MoneyPlus. He says this process has been  stressful for him.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As I explained in my provisional decision,  I can see why Mr K wants the original debt 
balances and why he is upset that MoneyPlus has not got these. However I do not find that 
MoneyPlus has done anything wrong. It has tried to assist Mr K and has provided 
information of the balances  on the DMP from the point it took over.
I note the comment Mr K has made about  the facts and figures of his account. However 
based on the evidence I have seen  showing payments up to January 2018, it appears that 
his payments have  been made  to his creditors as well as for his fees and that his 
outstanding balance has reduced  in line with this. The more  recent information Mr K has 
provided shows that his total payments to creditors has continued to increase and that his 
outstanding balance has continued to decline.  I have not seen details of the payments 
between January 2018 and the screenshot Mr K has sent in and if he is concerned  that more 
recent payments  have  not been  correctly allocated to his account then he should raise this 
with MoneyPlus.  However  based  on what I have seen I do not find anything  to suggest that 
MoneyPlus has not managed his account correctly.
I can understand why Mr K believes his balance should be lower  than it is. The letter from 
the original DMP provider which suggests  the total amount payable as £54,400  says this is 
based on the information Mr K provided at that time and creditors agreeing to freeze interest. 
I do not have further information to say whether there were any changes  or whether all 
Ref: DRN50501583creditors froze the interest. However, these issues relate to the time before MoneyPlus was 
responsible for the DMP. In this case  I do not find that I can hold MoneyPlus responsible for 
any issues that occurred  before  it took over the DMP  and I find it reasonable that it relied  on 
the balances provided at the point of taking over the account.
Overall, based on the information I have seen I do not find that I can say MoneyPlus has 
done anything  wrong either in accepting the balances provided at the point of transfer  or in 
the payments  it has made while managing Mr Ks account. Because  of this I do not uphold 
this complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 February  2019.
