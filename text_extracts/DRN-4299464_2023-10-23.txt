The complaint
Mrs B is unhappy she cannot pay her John Lewis Partnership card with NewDay Ltd 
(NewDay) by cheque. 
Mrs B is represented in bringing this complaint, but for ease of reading Ill refer to all 
submissions as being made by her directly. 
What happened
In October 2022, a payment for £51.97 debited a credit card in Mrs Bs name. 
Mrs B believed this payment was made using another credit card she had. So she sent a 
cheque for the outstanding balance to a third party, who provided her original Partnership 
card, however as the card is question wasnt taken out with them, they were unable to 
accept the payment. So, Mrs Bs account with NewDay, where the payment was taken from, 
accrued interest and late payment fees. 
Mrs B says she would like to pay her outstanding balance by cheque, but she doesnt 
believe this is due to NewDay. She is also unhappy about the late payments fees and 
interest added to her account. In recent correspondence Mrs B states that she was not given 
a copy of the terms and conditions and she did not agree to them. 
Mrs B complained to NewDay about the above concerns. NewDay responded to say they 
dont accept cheques but gave details of alternative methods of payment  other than online. 
NewDay also removed the late payment fees and interest that had accrued to that point, but 
it explained that it could not make any amendments to the information that had been 
reported on her credit file as there were no errors made.
Mrs B was not happy with this, so she brought her complaint to us. Our investigator 
considered all the information and evidence provided and did not uphold Mrs Bs complaint. 
Mrs B remained unhappy with this outcome, so the complaint has been passed to me for a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs B disputes using her NewDay card. However, NewDay have sent us a copy of her 
statement dated 7 November 2022 showing a record of the relevant payment for £51.97. So, 
while Ive considered that Mrs B doesnt believe she used this card, the evidence here 
supports that she did and so Im satisfied that its fair that NewDay is asking her to pay back 
the amount that was spent.
Mrs B says she was not provided with a copy of the credit agreement, or the terms and 
conditions and she never wouldve accepted these. NewDay says it wouldve sent Mrs B the 
credit agreement in the post along with the card  which sets out the terms and conditions. 
Mrs B received the card, so I think its likely she wouldve also received the credit agreement 
with it. Mrs B activated her card and used it
I appreciate that Mrs B would like to pay her outstanding balance by cheque. However, 
NewDay have provided a copy of Mrs Bs credit agreement and this document clearly sets 
out the methods of payments accepted by NewDay as direct debit, online automated 
telephone service and internet or telephone banking. Paying by cheque is not included as an 
accepted method of payment. Mrs B has explained that she doesnt use the internet for her 
banking and payments. But NewDay has explained other ways she can make payments, 
including by telephone. So I dont think NewDay has acted unfairly by refusing to accept a 
cheque here.
Mrs B is not happy that fees and interest were added to her account as a result of the late 
payment and that this has also been recorded on her credit file. Mrs B says she is willing to 
clear her outstanding balance and she wouldve already have done so, had they accepted 
cheques. NewDay agreed to remove the fees and interest applied until February 2023 as a 
gesture of good will. But said they would not be able to change the information reported to 
credit reference agencies as the information passed on was accurate. 
As Ive said above, NewDay havent treated Mrs B unfairly by refusing to accept cheques. 
And payment was not made by the date due, so I dont think NewDay have done anything 
wrong by reporting this information to credit reference agencies. The terms and conditions 
also set out that fees and charges will be applied to her account if payment is not paid in 
time. So, I also think its fair that NewDay have applied charges and fees to her account.
My final decision
I am not upholding Mrs Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 November 2023.
