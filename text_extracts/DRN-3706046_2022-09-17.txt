The complaint
Mr I and Miss W complain that U K Insurance Limited mishandled a claim on the home
emergency section of their home insurance policy.
Where I refer to UKI, I refer to the above-named insurance company and I include its claims
management company or home services provider, engineers and others insofar as I hold
UKI responsible for their acts or omissions.
What happened
Mr I and his partner Miss W live in an area with hard water. He works with children.
For the year from April 2021, Mr I and Miss W had a home insurance policy. It had a home
emergency section (Section 5) providing help up to a limit of £500.00.
The home emergency section included repair of their central heating boiler. But it excluded
repair if the boiler was beyond economic repair (BER) in which case UKI would pay
£250.00 towards a new boiler. The home emergency section also excluded work due to
water scale or sludge.
On 12 December 2021, Mr I and Miss Ws boiler wasnt working properly. So they contacted
UKI for help. On 13 December 2021, UKI visited and said that the boiler needed a
replacement diverter valve.
On 17 December 2021, UKI gave short notice of a visit and Mr I and Miss W werent at
home.
On 22 December 2021, UKI replaced the diverter valve and recommended a power
flush.
On 31 December 2021, Mr I and Miss W noticed that the boiler was leaking water. They
reported it to UKI.
On 1 January 2022, UKI visited and said that the boiler had an issue with the pump. 
Between 6 and 9 January 2022, Miss W and Mr I contacted UKI. It said that it wouldnt do
any further work until someone had done a flush. They complained about UKIs
communication.
On 10 January 2022, Mr I and Miss W had the power flush done at a cost to them of
£440.00.
On 12 January 2022, UKI said that either it would treat the boiler as BER, or Mr I and Miss 
W could pay it over £700.00 towards the cost of replacing the hydro block (including the
diverter and the pump).
By a final response dated 14 January 2022, UKI offered £100.00 compensation for the
distress and inconvenience caused by the lack of information provided.
Unhappy with that, Mr I and Miss W brought their complaint to us without delay.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld in part. He didnt think
that UKI had acted fairly. He said that the status of the boiler was known on 1 January 2022
and didnt change up to 12 January 2022 when UKI then decided the boiler should be
deemed BER. He said that poor communication led to the financial loss of £440.00.
He said that the parts wouldve been a maximum of 5 days, so UKI should contribute to the
heater costs from 6 January 2022 when the parts couldve been fitted, up to 14 January
2022 when the complaint was answered.
The investigator recommended that UKI should:
1. pay the costs incurred for the power flush; and
2. issue the payment of the £100.00 compensation previously offered; and
3. contribute to the costs of the heaters that were in use in line with his comments.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr I 
and Miss W and to UKI on 8 September 2022. I summarise my findings:
UKI caused Mr I and Miss W to pay £440.00 for an urgent flush that they wouldnt 
otherwise have paid for.
I found it more likely than not that the cost of fixing the old boiler was more than 85% 
of the cost of a new boiler of similar make and model (excluding the cost of 
installation). So I was minded to find it fair and reasonable to direct UKI to pay Mr I 
and Miss W (rather than the balance left of the £500.00), the £250.00 BER payment.
UKI tried to put things right with an offer of £100.00. But I didnt consider that this was
enough to make up for the impact its poor communication had on Mr I and Miss W. 
Rather I concluded that £300.00 would be fair and reasonable.
Subject to any further information from Mr I and Miss W or from UKI, my provisional decision 
was that I upheld this complaint in part. I intended to direct U K Insurance Limited to pay Mr I 
and Miss W (jointly):
1. £440.00 in reimbursement for the power flush; and
2. £250.00 as a BER payment; and
3. simple interest at a yearly rate of 8% on the £440.00 from 10 January 2022 and on 
the £250.00 from 12 January 2022 to the date of UKIs payment. If UKI considers that 
its required by HM Revenue & Customs to take off income tax from that interest, it 
should tell Mr I and Miss W how much its taken off. It should also give him or her a 
certificate showing this if either of them asks for one, so he or she can reclaim the tax 
from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate; and4. £300.00 for distress and inconvenience.
Mr I and Miss W have responded to the provisional decision. He says, in summary, that:
He bought a new boiler and had it installed. He has sent us an invoice and an 
installation certificate dated 31 January 2022. 
Regardless of a flush being completed only a couple of weeks before, the installation 
company said it couldnt give a warranty without doing another flush. He has sent us 
the installation checklist showing that the installer did a power flush. So effectively he 
and Miss W paid for the flush again within the cost of the new boiler replacement. 
They did receive the £250.00 from UKI towards the replacement boiler.
UKI disagreed with the provisional decision. It says, in summary, that:
In relation to the power flush (£440.00), it proposes to pay 50% (£220.00). This is
because there is evidence (including photographs) of the contamination of the 
system, so the customer benefited from the cleanse. If the customer had their boiler 
replaced, a power flush would be necessary causing no financial detriment.
In relation to distress and inconvenience, £150.00 would be a more fair and 
reasonable amount. The engineer who attended on 1 January 2022 noted as follows:
o "Took Ph refused isolation and drain down of boiler due to wanting services. 
SERVICES STATUS: Has heating and hot water with a leak."
It made the BER payment of £250.00 on 7 March 2022.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The financial limit of £500.00 included VAT and was for each call-out.
The policy included the following definition:
Beyond economic repair (section 5) When the cost of repairing your boiler
exceeds 85% of the manufacturers current retail price (or if this is not available, the
average current retail price available through leading UK suppliers) for a boiler of the
same or similar make and model to your boiler.
The policy didnt cover work caused by scale or sludge. But I havent seen any policy term
allowing UKI to decline a repair until the policyholder has had a power flush.
I accept that UKI shouldve communicated better about its proposed visit on 17 December
2021.
I havent seen enough technical evidence to show that UKIs repair on 22 December wasnt
reasonable.From what Mr I and UKI have each said, I find it likely that on 31 December, there was a
crack in a plastic cover over the pump. I consider that UKI was responsible for some
conflicting and confusing statements about the work to fix this.
But I havent seen evidence of a statement that the work was caused by scale or sludge.
Rather, I accept Mr Is statement that UKI led him to believe it would do the work  after he
showed it evidence of a power flush. I dont consider that UKIs stance was in line with the
policy terms.
Also, UKI took that stance without having taken the opportunity to find out and communicate
the cost of the work to fix the leak (which UKI later said would be in the region of £1,000.00).
I have seen evidence that Mr I and Miss W replaced the boiler. I accept Mr Is statement that 
 notwithstanding the flush on about 10 January 2022  the cost of installation included 
another flush. So I consider that UKI had caused Mr I and Miss W to pay £440.00 for an 
urgent flush that they wouldnt otherwise have paid for.
I find it fair and reasonable to direct UKI to reimburse Mr I and Miss W the £440.00. As 
theyve been out of pocket since 10 January 2022, I find it fair and reasonable to direct UKI 
to add interest at our usual rate.
I accept that the visits on 13 and 22 December were part of the same call-out. But I havent
seen enough technical evidence to show that the visit on 1 January was also part of the
same call-out. Also, UKI hasnt given enough details of its costings.
So I dont consider that UKI treated Mr I and Miss W fairly by saying that they had already
used most of the limit of £500.00 and they would have to pay over £700.00 if they wanted
UKI to fix the leak. However, Mr I and Miss W didnt accept that option.
I had thought about directing UKI to pay Mr I and Miss W the balance which was left of the
£500.00 after deducting the cost of the visit on 1 January. However, Mr I and Miss W have 
now told us that (rather than getting someone to fix the leak) they had a new boiler installed.
In any event, UKI in effect treated the boiler as BER. And notwithstanding the insufficient
detail of its costings, I find it more likely than not that the cost of fixing the old boiler was
more than 85% of the cost of a new boiler of similar make and model (excluding the cost of
installation).
So I find it fair and reasonable that UKI paid Mr I and Miss W (rather than the balance left of 
the £500.00), the £250.00 BER payment. 
Notwithstanding the engineers note on 1 January 2022, I accept Mr Is statement that the 
boiler remained off, so he and Miss W started using heaters costing £4-£8 per day and 
showering at the home of his older relative.
I find that UKIs poor communication caused delay and a prolongation of the period during
cold weather for which Mr I and Miss W had no central heating or hot water.
They have made reference to a smart meter for electricity. But they mustve made a saving
on gas (however unwelcome that was). So I consider that Mr I and Miss W have fallen
short of showing that UKI caused an identifiable financial loss on energy bills.
In any event, the real point is that UKI caused them extra and unnecessary distress and
inconvenience at an already difficult time for them. That included having to shower at thehome of Mr Is older relative, for whose health they were concerned. This was at a time 
when there was still concern about transmission of Covid-19 from children to adults and 
older people. 
The impact also included the need to deal with difficult telephone calls, conflicting and 
confusing information and uncertainty about how the situation could be resolved.
UKI tried to put things right with an offer of £100.00. But I dont consider that this was
enough to make up for the impact its poor communication had on Mr I and Miss W. Neither 
do I consider that its recent offer of £150.00 was enough. Rather I conclude that £300.00 is 
fair and reasonable. 
Putting things right
I find it fair and reasonable to direct UKI to reimburse Mr I and Miss W the £440.00. As 
theyve been out of pocket since 10 January 2022, I find it fair and reasonable to direct UKI 
to add interest at our usual rate.
I conclude that £300.00 is fair and reasonable for the impact UKIs poor communication had 
on Mr I and Miss W. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct U K Insurance Limited to pay Mr I and Miss W (jointly):
1. £440.00 in reimbursement for the power flush; and
2. simple interest at a yearly rate of 8% on the £440.00 from 10 January 2022 to the 
date of UKIs payment. If UKI considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs 
to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr I and Miss W how much its 
taken off. It should also give him or her a certificate showing this if either of them 
asks for one, so he or she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if 
appropriate; and
3. £300.00 for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I and Miss W to 
accept or reject my decision before 15 October 2022.
