The complaint
Mr M complains that NewDay Ltd refused to increase his credit limit and incorrectly told him 
he hadnt been a customer for more than six months.
What happened
Mr M says he applied for an increase to the credit limit on his NewDay credit card account. 
He says he was incorrectly told he hadnt been a customer for more than six months and so 
wasnt entitled to an increase. Mr M would have liked a credit limit increase or an explanation 
why he couldnt have one when his credit score is high.
NewDay accepts it gave Mr M incorrect information about the length of time he had been a 
customer and has apologised. It says its entitled to decide on credit limits and says it will tell 
Mr M when and if he becomes eligible for an increase.
Mr M brought his complaint to us and our investigator thought it was for a business to decide 
on credit limit amounts. The investigator thought NewDay had fairly apologised for its 
mistake. The investigator also looked into a previous complaint made by Mr M about 
NewDay.
Mr M doesnt accept that view and maintains the credit limit caused inconvenience. He says 
the previous complaint has been settled but wished to raise it to provide a further example of 
how he has been dealt with.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that NewDay has fairly apologised for its 
mistake and is entitled to decide what the credit limit on a customers account is without 
providing detailed information for its reason. I appreciate Mr M will be disappointed with my 
decision and appreciate that this is not the first complaint he has had about NewDay.
There is no doubt here that NewDay made a mistake by telling Mr M that he hadnt been a 
customer for six months or more. I appreciate Mr Ms frustration in those circumstances as 
he would have known the correct information. But Im satisfied NewDay has fairly apologised 
for that mistake and I dont think such a mistake justifies compensation. I dont think Mr M 
suffered any financial loss in any event and think that NewDay was entitled to decide upon 
this issue of a credit limit when exercising its commercial judgement and clearly cant tell 
customers the exact reasons for a refusal in every case for commercial reasons.
I appreciate Mr M says the credit limit is too low, but we are not NewDays regulator and so 
its not our role to direct it how it deals with these sorts of issues or order it to reveal more 
information about that process. And it would be for NewDays regulator to look at any wider 
service issues that Mr M suggests are present.
I can see that NewDays says it will tell Mr M when he becomes eligible for a credit limit 
increase but can also see that it may be the case that he no longer wishes to use this credit 
card account.
Overall, Im satisfied that NewDay has fairly apologised for its mistake and am satisfied this 
brings an end to what we in trying to resolve this dispute informally can do.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 February 2022.
