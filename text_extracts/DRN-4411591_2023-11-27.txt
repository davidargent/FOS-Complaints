The complaint
Mr G has complained about a mortgage current account (MCA) linked to his mortgage he 
holds with Barclays Bank UK PLC. He says Barclays kept adding interest to the account 
without notifying him of the increasing balance which denied him the opportunity to do 
something about it.
What happened
Mr G took out this mortgage in 2007. He borrowed around £88,000 on a repayment basis 
over a term of just under 20 years.  The 2007 mortgage offer explained the rate as A 
Variable Rate which is 0.18% above Barclays Bank PLC's Base Rate, currently 5.75%, for 
the whole of the term, to give a current rate payable of 5.93%. 
The mortgage offer said that Mr G was obliged to take out an MCA with a Mortgage Reserve 
(which is a form of secured overdraft) as a condition of the mortgage.
In 2008 Mr G took out a further advance on the mortgage. He borrowed around £30,000 on 
a repayment basis over an 18-year term. The mortgage offer explained the rate for the 
further advance as A Fixed Rate of 6.59% until 31/01/2012. After 31/01/2012, the rate will 
be a Variable Rate which is 1.49% above the Barclays Bank PLC's Base Rate, currently 2%, 
for the remainder of the term, to give a current rate payable of 3.49%.
For ease, going forward Ill refer to the main mortgage and the further advance combined as 
the main mortgage accounts to differentiate them from the MCA.
In February 2014 Barclays obtained a suspended possession order due to arrears on the 
main mortgage accounts. The court order ordered Mr G to pay £100 a month towards the 
arrears of around £10,260.
We have a selection of statements available for the MCA, which Ill detail below.
The 15 October 2010 statement showed:
an opening balance of £4,096.57, 
no money coming in,
£2,012.95 going out,
a closing balance of £6,109.52,

the MCA reserve limit was £19,610.I understand that since February 2012 no payments have been made into or out of the MCA, 
other than the monthly interest payments.
By the end of 2017 the MCA debt had increased to around £26,100 with the monthly interest 
at that time being around £100. By the end of 2018 the debt stood at around £27,500 with 
the monthly interest being around £120. By the end of 2019 the debt stood at around 
£28,900 with the monthly interest being around £120. By the end of 2020 the debt stood at 
around £30,400 with the monthly interest being around £120.
Annual mortgage statements were issued each year for the main mortgage accounts. Whilst 
the majority of the information related to those main accounts, there was a part which 
covered the MCA reserve.
We have a selection of statements available for the main mortgage accounts, which Ill detail 
below.
The 6 October 1010 statement enclosed the following information:
Paying off your mortgage
[]
**Mortgage Current Account Reserve (overdraft) borrowing £12,031.18
[]
** Your reserve balance is the amount that you have borrowed using your Mortgage 
Current Account Reserve facility (overdraft)
Important Information
Additional borrowing drawn down from the Mortgage Current Account Reserve is charged 
at the Woolwich Standard Variable Rate []. On any outstanding Reserve Facility balance 
interest will accrue and the Reserve Facility balance will increase as a result of this []. 
Any funds drawn from the Reserve Facility are secured against your property, must be 
repaid by the end of the mortgage term and will require you to put additional arrangements 
into place to repay this, as your monthly contractual mortgage repayments do not cover the 
additional borrowing.
There was similar wording on the other statements, with the Mortgage Current Account 
Reserve (overdraft) borrowing figure increasing each year as follows:
October 2011 £18,281.52
October 2017 £25,805.31
October 2018 £27,099.16
October 2020 £30,003.34
October 2021 £31,405.77
October 2022 £32,941.56
Mr G has said he became aware of the size of the MCA reserve debt in April 2021 when he 
received a letter from Barclays.
The first complaint that was raised was that Mr G said he was unaware of the MCA and it 
shouldnt have been sold to him. Barclays said that complaint hadnt been made within the 
time limits set out in our rules and our Investigator agreed. The Investigator said Mr G had used the MCA account, building up a debt owed through the reserve facility, so he ought 
reasonably to have been aware he had the product and that he had potential cause to 
complain if he was unhappy with it.
Mr G responded to say that wasnt the entirety of this complaint. He said he was also 
complaining about the consequence of this product. That is, the MCA had been hidden from 
view for many years as he wasnt sent statements showing the MCA. He said Barclays 
hadnt contacted him about the product since 2010, at which time the borrowing was around 
£12,000 and it now stood at around £30,000. By not contacting him about the MCA reserve 
debt Mr G says he wasnt afforded the opportunity for any corrective action.
It was agreed that the original complaint would be closed (which was noted to just be that 
the MCA was mis-sold), and this new complaint (which Im deciding here) would be raised 
relating to the lack of contact over the years.
As Mr G was unhappy with Barclays response to the follow up complaint, he referred the 
matter again to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
In July 2023 one of my Ombudsman colleagues issued a decision about our jurisdiction to 
consider this complaint. She said:
My decision is that our service cannot consider Mr Gs complaint to Barclays Bank UK Plc 
about 
the amount of his Mortgage Current Account debt which had accrued by 
3 January 2012, when he last used the account.
the amount of his Mortgage Current Account debt which accrued between 4 January 
2012 and 7 April 2015, which is more than six years prior to when Mr G first made 
his complaint.
But I think our service can consider Mr Gs complaint to Barclays Bank UK Plc about 
the amount of his Mortgage Current Account debt which accrued from 8 April 2015 
onwards, which is within six years of when Mr G made his complaint.
a decision taken in 2021 to enforce this debt.
Our Investigator then looked at that complaint and didnt uphold it. He said he wasnt 
persuaded Mr G didnt know the debt was growing and as interest had been added to the 
account when Mr G had been using it, he had no reason to believe that wouldnt still be the 
case over the years. He said the annual mortgage statements showed the level of the MCA 
reserve debt each year and he didnt think it was reasonable to ask Barclays to waive or 
reduce the amount due. That said, he said he could understand Mr Gs confusion and 
frustration and he felt Barclays had provided a poor level of service. He also felt the 2021 
contact was out of the blue but was satisfied that despite the letters talking about legal action 
none had actually been taken. In all he felt £250 compensation was due for the poor service. 
Barclays accepted our Investigators findings and agreed to pay £250 compensation. Mr G 
didnt agree and so the case was passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.I recognise that Mr G feels very strongly about this, and I thank him for the frankness and 
detail of his submissions. Hes clearly been through some very difficult times. I wont detail 
everything that hes told us here to protect his privacy, however I can assure Mr G that Ive 
read and understood everything and taken it all into account.
I trust Mr G wont take it as a discourtesy that Ive condensed this complaint in the way that I 
have. Although Ive read and considered the whole file Ill keep my comments to what I think 
is relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive not considered it but 
because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach the right outcome. 
This service is impartial between, and independent from, consumers and businesses. What 
this means is that we dont represent either party, we look at things independently without 
taking sides, and I dont act under eithers instructions or take directions on what questions 
should be asked and answered.
I understand our Investigators findings were disappointing. Its the nature of what we do that 
we generally have to find in favour of one party or the other. Our findings are based on 
consideration of all the facts and all the submissions made by both parties. We look at what 
happened and decide whether, bearing in mind any relevant law, regulations, and good 
industry practice, the lender acted fairly and reasonably. We also have to decide, if we think 
something went wrong, whether it is more likely than not that the situation now would have 
been any different if nothing had gone wrong.
As my Ombudsman colleague said, we can only consider the period from April 2015. But in 
reaching a decision about what has happened since then, it is important I think about what 
happened before that date albeit I cant make any findings about whether or not Barclays did 
anything wrong before then.
On 8 April 2015 the outstanding balance on the MCA was £22,936.41.
Based on Mr Gs more recent submissions he has said the last MCA monthly statement he 
has in his possession is the one covering the period from 18 October until 16 November 
2012.
Ive reviewed the MCA transaction history from the start and I can see Mr G started to use 
the facility in November 2008, with the last withdrawal around then being in December 2008 
at which time the balance stood at around £2,980. Interest was then added each month, and 
Mr G made a payment into the account of £1,000 in March 2009. 
At the end of October 2009 the balance stood at around £2,080, and then Mr G started 
withdrawing money again in November 2009. The withdrawals continued until December 
2010, with the next receipt (after March 2009) being around £11 in December 2010. At that 
time the balance stood at around £15,240. For a few months payments were made into the 
account each month to keep the balance (once interest was incurred) within the limit at the 
time of £15,250.
Withdrawals started again in March 2011 increasing the balance from around £15,310 to 
£17,390 by the end of April 2011. Payments in were made in May, June and August 2011, 
with withdrawals again between September and December 2011. The last withdrawal was 
on 19 December 2011 at which time the balance stood at around £19,560. Payments were 
made into the MCA in January 2012 and February 2012, with the balance after the last 
payment in standing at around £19,600. Since then the only transactions on the account 
were the interest that was accruing.From this we can see that Mr G was actively using the MCA account up until February 2012, 
taking money out and putting some money in. It seems likely Mr G was broadly aware of 
how the account worked in terms of the monthly interest and reserve limit as it can be seen 
that he made credits to the account of just enough to keep the account within limit, but not 
enough to clear the full interest due. For example, the January 2011 statement showed Mr G 
paid exactly the amount needed into the account to keep it within the reserve limit.
In the January 2012 statement the closing balance was around £19,600 against a reserve 
limit of £19,610. The statement said £85.57 of interest would be debited the following month. 
I can see from the transaction history that Mr G matched that amount by paying £85.57 into 
the MCA on 8 February 2012, so the closing balance in February 2012 remained the same.
As Mr G made no further payments into the account the MCA went over its limit in March 
2012 when the interest of around £83 was added to the account that month.
So Mr G received nine monthly statements (March 2012 until November 2012) all showing 
the MCA was over its reserve limit of £19,610 and that interest was being added at a rate of 
between around £75 to £90 a month.
The November 2012 statement showed a closing balance of around £20,350 and Mr G has 
had that statement in his possession to refer back to.
At no time has Barclays implied its either written off that debt, or that interest would no 
longer be charged on it. When our Investigator asked Mr G what he thought had happened 
to that debt he said it was out of sight and out of mind. He said it is quite easy to forget about 
it especially when ones mind is processing other types of information. He went on to explain 
his personal circumstances at the time meant his mind was full of other things, and he relied 
on companies to send him bills so he paid them.
In addition, in relation to the November 2012 statement, he said This statement shows an 
end balance of - £20,346.41 with the agreed limit of £19,610.
So, my first question is how come its over the limit? I have attached this statement and you 
can clearly see an over limit of £734.41. This over limit amount is not highlighted or ever 
mentioned. When I received this statement I was in a state of financial distress which made 
me vulnerable and Woolwich / Barclays knew this.
Ive considered these points very carefully and Ive a great deal of sympathy for the difficult 
situation Mr G was in. He had financial issues, as well as going through a hard time 
personally. Things certainly cant have been easy for him.
But I cant hold Barclays liable for that as it sent Mr G the information which set out the 
status of his account at that time. To be clear, Im certainly not blaming Mr G for the situation 
but sometimes things happen that arent the fault of either party. Just because Mr G wasnt 
to blame, doesnt mean Barclays was to blame. Up until the end of 2012 Barclays sent Mr G 
monthly statements that set out how his MCA was running, and those included nine 
statements showing he was over the reserve limit.
Mr G has said:
Do you really believe if I were aware of interest being added monthly I would ignore this? I 
would agree it is reasonable to assume that if I were aware of interest being added to the 
MCA on a monthly basis I would not intentionally ignore it. If I had know about it! I could 
have taken steps to address the matter by making extra payments, especially if I were 
aware of it!But Mr G didnt make regular monthly payments to the account to cover the interest and/or 
reduce the debt either before his financial difficulties (when he was receiving monthly 
statements) or after he found out about the debt in April 2021. 
Mr G has said he isnt in a position now to make payments to the account due to the war in 
Europe, high energy costs, high raw materials costs and interest rates being at an all-time 
high. But those werent factors until the end of 2021 onwards, many months after Mr G 
became aware of the level of this debt. Even if Mr G disputed the extra interest that had 
been added, he would have been aware that he, at the least, still owed the amount that was 
outstanding all those years ago and so could have started making payments towards it.
The suspended possession order from February 2014 was due to take over eight years to 
clear the arrears, and we can see from the arrears statement Mr G has provided from 
January 2017 that the arrears still stood at around £6,200 at that point. Whilst Mr G has now 
said that he could have comfortably paid back £200 to £300 a month towards the MCA debt, 
thats not supported by the fact he didnt make those increased payments towards clearing 
his arrears sooner which I would have expected him to do if those funds were freely 
available each month.
Mr G had in his possession the monthly MCA statements up until November 2012 so even if 
he wasnt in a position to make payments towards the debt at the time he received them, 
they were there for him to review and start making payments when he was later able to. I 
understand Mr G feels it is out of sight out of mind, but it seems unlikely that Mr G forgot that 
he had owed around £20,000 on the MCA even if he hadnt thought the balance would build 
up further than that.
In any event, the increasing balance was on every annual statement for the main mortgage 
accounts that Mr G was sent over the years (not just the 2017 one, our Investigator only 
used that as a single example). I understand Mr G feels this information was hidden away as 
small print, but it was exactly where Id expect that information to be and was in the same 
size font as all the other information.
I set out in the background to this decision the increasing MCA reserve debt balance that 
was set out in various statements as:
October 2010 £12,031.18
October 2011 £18,281.52
October 2017 £25,805.31
October 2018 £27,099.16
October 2020 £30,003.34
October 2021 £31,405.77
October 2022 £32,941.56
In addition, as I also set out, the wording explained what the reserve balance was:
Your reserve balance is the amount that you have borrowed using your Mortgage Current 
Account Reserve facility (overdraft)
It also explained that:
interest was accruing on the debt,
the balance would therefore increase as a result,
the funds were secured against the property, 
the debt must be repaid by the end of the mortgage term, andadditional payments were needed towards the debt as the payments being made to 
the main mortgage accounts didnt cover it.
That information was all contained within the statements that were sent to Mr G each year 
and I cant hold Barclays liable if Mr G didnt read it. Having considered those statements I 
simply cant reach a conclusion that Mr G was unaware of the size of the MCA debt building 
up or that he needed to make payments towards it.
Ive considered everything very carefully, including what Mr G has told us about his personal 
circumstances over the years. Having done so, for the time period I can consider which is 
from April 2015 until August 2022 (when Barclays responded to the complaint) I simply cant 
order Barclays to waive any of the interest that has been charged on the MCA. Thats 
because Im satisfied Mr G had the information he needed in his possession to know how 
this account operated (from the pre-November 2012 MCA monthly statements and how he 
previously operated the account), and how the debt was building up (from the annual 
statements issued on the main mortgage account). It may be Mr G didnt read that 
information, but I can only uphold this part of the complaint if I think Barclays did something 
wrong and I cant hold it liable for Mr G not reading the information that was provided. As I 
explained earlier, just because Mr G isnt at fault doesnt mean that Barclays is.
All that said, as our Investigator explained, due to the lack of direct chase ups about the 
MCA reserve being over its limit, suddenly receiving the letter in April 2021 would have been 
a shock to Mr G, especially as that letter set out the risk of legal proceedings. To explain, at 
that time there were still arrears on Mr Gs main mortgage accounts following the suspended 
possession order (albeit they were within months of being cleared), which is why the 
warnings were so strong about the possibility of repossession. I understand up to the point 
we can consider, which is August 2022, Barclays hasnt taken any legal action against Mr G 
about the MCA reserve debt and so he hasnt incurred any fees or charges. But we do need 
to think about the shock that letter caused Mr G.
Mr G said 
The next issue pertains to the £250Are you serious? This amount is not even equivalent 
to three months worth of interest! The fact that you and the bank appear to treat this matter 
as unimportant, trivial, or insignificant makes the £250 seem almost negligible in 
comparison! You have completely overlooked the over-limit situation on the MCA. They 
should have contacted me, but they didnt. This is not my fault, and I should not be held 
responsible for their failure to communicate.
It is clear that you havent taken into account the considerable stress Ive endured 
throughout this process. Its essential to consider the emotional toll this situation has had 
on me.
But the £250 isnt supposed to cover any of the interest charged on the account because, for 
the reasons already explained, I dont think Barclays needs to waive that. That interest was 
fairly due and Im not persuaded that Mr G ought reasonably to have been unaware of how 
the debt was increasing over the years.
The payment of compensation here is to recognise the fact that Barclays went from not 
directly contacting Mr G about the MCA reserve debt, to issuing a letter which talked about 
potential legal action. Mr G owes the total outstanding debt so I cant take into account the 
ongoing emotional toll as Ive not upheld that part of the complaint. All Im thinking about 
here is the April 2021 letter (after there being no direct contact specifically chasing up this 
debt over the years) and the shock that would have caused.Having considered everything very carefully Im satisfied the £250 Barclays has already 
agreed to pay is fair and reasonable for that.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part and order Barclays Bank UK PLC to pay £250 to Mr G in full 
and final settlement of this complaint. I make no further order or award.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 December 2023.
