The complaint
Mr Ws complaint is that the phone he bought using his account with PayPal Europe Sarl & 
Cie, SCA wasnt as described. 
What happened
Mr W bought a phone through an online retailer site in July 2019. The phone was described 
as being brand new. Mr W made the payment for the phone through is PayPal account. 
Mr W says the phone developed an issue with the screen and after trying unsuccessfully to 
contact the seller, he raised a claim with PayPal that the phone wasnt as described. His 
initial claim wasnt upheld, and he then took the phone to the manufacturer for investigation. 
He was told the phone had been activated in 2017 and that modifications had taken place by 
a third party using non-genuine parts which meant the manufacturer wasnt able to repair the 
phone.
Mr W provided PayPal with a copy of the report and said the phone was significantly not as 
described. He said he had tried to contact the seller to return the phone but it wasnt 
communicating with him and so he had needed to buy an alternative phone.
PayPal responded to Mr W on 31 January 2020, saying that his claim was initially denied as 
Mr W had said the seller hadnt acted on the warranty provided on the phone and that 
warranties werent covered by its Buyer Protection. It then said it had been asked to make a 
decision based on an item it hadnt seen or evaluated and noted Mr W had had the phone 
since July 2019. It also noted that its Buyer Protection program was a goodwill program and 
PayPal make a final decision at its full and sole discretion. 
After further correspondence between Mr W and PayPal, PayPal issued its final response 
letter dated 3 March 2020. It didnt uphold Mr Ws complaint. 
Mr W didnt accept PayPals response and referred his complaint to this service.
Our investigator upheld his complaint. He noted PayPals comments about applying the 
Buyer Protection program at its sole discretion but said it had a duty to apply the terms of 
this policy in a fair and reasonable manner. He said the seller had confirmed to Mr W that 
the phone was brand new, but the evidence provided by the manufacture showed this not to 
be true. He said the Buyer Protection program was designed to help buyers recover money if 
goods werent delivered or were "significantly not as described". He said that Mr Ws claim 
met the eligibility criteria in terms of timing and the goods he acquired, and he thought the 
evidence showed the phone was "significantly not as described". Because of this he said 
PayPal should have investigated Mr Ws complaint further and had it done so he thought 
Mr Ws claim would have been agreed. Therefore, he recommended that PayPal refund 
Mr W the £365.55 he paid for the phone.
Our investigator also noted the number of times Mr W had needed to contact PayPal and the 
inconvenience and distress he had been caused. Because of this he recommended PayPal 
pay Mr W £100 compensation. 
PayPal didnt accept our investigators view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I do not find that Mr W has been treated fairly by PayPal and I agree with 
our investigators conclusions for the following reasons:
Mr W acquired a phone in July 2019. The information he was provided with at this 
time, including the correspondence he had with the seller, confirmed that the phone 
was brand new. I accept that it was on this basis that Mr W bought the phone.
Mr W had use of the phone and says that an issue developed with the screen. The 
phone was supplied with a six-month warranty and I understand Mr W took actions to 
try to resolve issues with the supplier but his attempts at contact were unsuccessful.
Mr W raised a claim with PayPal. In the PayPal user agreement, it sets out its Buyer 
Protection. This says that a refund may be provided in certain circumstances such as 
goods not being received and goods not being as ordered, noted as Significantly Not 
as Described.
Mr W made his claim based on the phone not being as described. I note PayPals 
comments about Mr W having use of the phone for several months and the fault 
developing and it considering this a warranty issue and therefore not eligible under 
the Buyer Protection. However, while I note the initial information from Mr W was 
about a fault developing, Mr W then provided further evidence of a report from the 
manufacturer. His claim was made about the phone not being as described and 
based on the manufacturers report I find that PayPal should have investigated this.
PayPal lists in its use agreement examples of when an item might be considered as 
Significantly Not as Described. One of the examples is when the condition of the 
item has been misrepresented  and the example provided is when an item is 
described as new when it is used. In this case, the evidence shows that Mr W was 
told the phone was brand new but the manufacturers report says that the phone was 
purchased in November 2017 (almost two years before Mr W bought it) and that 
modifications had taken place using third party non-genuine parts.
I have nothing to suggest that Mr W undertook any modification to the phone and 
based on the information provided I think that it would have been reasonable for 
PayPal to accept the phone wasnt as described. 
I havent seen anything to suggest that Mr Ws claim was ineligible due to any of the 
criteria set out in the Buyer Protection information.
PayPal has said that its Buyer Protection is a goodwill program and the final decision 
is at its sole discretion. While I note these comments, I dont think that Mr W was 
treated fairly by PayPal. I say this as he clearly raised his claim regarding the goods 
not being as described but it appears his claim was considered a warranty issue. I 
think had the evidence he provided about the phone being said to be new and the 
subsequent evidence provided by the manufacturer been fully considered, I find it 
more likely than not that Mr Ws claim would have been upheld.Because of the reasons set out above, I uphold this complaint. I find the fair resolution is for 
Mr W to be refunded the amount he paid for the phone (£365.55). I also find that Mr W has 
been caused inconvenience by having to contact PayPal on several occasions while trying to 
get his complaint considered. Because of this I agree with our investigators 
recommendation that he is paid £100 compensation.
Putting things right
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should refund Mr W the amount he paid for the phone 
(£365.55) as well as pay him £100 compensation for the inconvenience he has been 
caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA. 
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should carry out the actions set out above in resolution of 
this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 December 2020.
