K821x#15complaint
Mrs R complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid)  lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mrs R was given five loans by QuickQuid between November 2016 and January 2018. 
Around a month after taking  the first loan Mrs R borrowed some further money. Borrowing  
this money changed  both her repayment  amount and the date her repayment  was due. So 
I consider this to have  formed a refinancing of the loan. And Mrs R topped up her borrowing 
on loans 2, 4 and 5 by taking additional  borrowing too. Mrs R has successfully repaid her 
first four loans but a balance  remains outstanding on the final loan. A summary of Mrs Rs 
borrowing from QuickQuid is as follows;

Mrs Rs complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. She didnt think QuickQuid 
should have agreed to lend to Mrs R after, and including, loan 4a. So she asked QuickQuid 
to pay Mrs R some compensation.
QuickQuid didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mrs R accepts  my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN65542142QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mrs R could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment  amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mrs R could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Rs complaint.
I think there were a number of indicators in Mrs Rs borrowing that might have suggested to 
QuickQuid that she was having problems  managing  her finances. She had needed to 
refinance her first loan and so paid some  additional  interest to support the additional 
borrowing. And her second  loan was significantly higher than her first. But offsetting  those  
concerns was a gap of almost six months between Mrs R repaying her first loan and asking 
for the second.  And the amount she asked to borrow for the third loan was significantly  less 
than before.
Ref: DRN65542143So on balance, when it agreed to give the first three loans  to Mrs R, I dont  think  it wouldve 
been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask her for the amount of information that would be 
needed to show  the lending was unsustainable.  So I dont think QuickQuid was wrong  to 
give the first three loans  to Mrs R.
Around three weeks after repaying  her third loan Mrs R asked to borrow  again. And the 
amount she asked to borrow  was much larger again. This was now the sixth time shed 
asked to borrow from QuickQuid in less than a year. But although I think  QuickQuid should 
have been increasingly worried that Mrs R was likely  to be borrowing to support her day to 
day living costs, rather than in response  to a one off emergency, I dont think there was 
enough here to say that QuickQuid shouldnt give her that fourth loan.
But I think that assessment should have changed when Mrs R asked to top up her borrowing 
just two days later. And in particular given  the size of the additional amount she asked for. By 
that time Mrs R would need  to make a repayment equivalent to almost  60% of her normal 
income on that loan.  Mrs R needed  to make that repayment just over two months after taking 
the loan so QuickQuid says she could  save some disposable income in the first month  to put 
towards her final repayment. So it is effectively  saying that I should consider the average 
repayment Mrs R needed to make each month  on her loan.
But I dont agree that was reasonable here.  By then Mrs R had been borrowing regularly 
from QuickQuid for some  time. I dont think that should have given QuickQuid any 
confidence that Mrs R was in a position  to save money each month  or indeed  that what  
shed said about  her disposable income  was likely to be entirely accurate. So I dont think  it 
was reasonable  for QuickQuid to have  given this, or the subsequent, top up to the loan to 
Mrs R.
Mrs R complained to QuickQuid about the borrowing she had been given on 24 January 
2018. At that time she explained that she was dependent on payday  loans.  And she 
explained to QuickQuid that her expenditure was such that she had no disposable  income 
each month. I think that, on receipt of the complaint, QuickQuid should have taken 
immediate steps  to prevent Mrs R from borrowing  again.
But QuickQuid approved Mrs Rs loan request on 29 January. And it also approved three  
further top up requests over the following five weeks. The final top up was approved  on the 
same day that QuickQuid issued its final response to Mrs Rs complaint. And the information 
that QuickQuid used relating to Mrs Rs expenditure in assessing these loan requests was 
markedly different to what shed said when making  her complaint.
I think it should have  been clear to QuickQuid that Mrs R shouldnt have been given loan 5 
or the subsequent top ups. I think its decision to lend, after receiving a complaint from Mrs R 
was a serious failing  in its processes and its duty of care to Mrs R. So although  Mrs R still 
owes a significant  part of the principal  she borrowed here Im not going  to require her to 
repay it to QuickQuid.
Ref: DRN65542144putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to give Mrs R the top up loans that she took on 
14 and 21 October 2017. So for each of those  loans QuickQuid  should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mrs Rs credit file in relation to the loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mrs R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
 
I also dont think that QuickQuid should have  agreed to lend to Mrs R after she had made 
her complaint to the lender. So for loan 5 and the subsequent top ups to that loan QuickQuid  
should write off any outstanding balance and not require any further payment from Mrs R in 
relation to that borrowing. QuickQuid should  also remove all entries  about  loan 5 and the top 
ups from Mrs Rs credit file.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mrs Rs complaint and direct CashEuroNet UK LLC 
to put things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 July 2019.
