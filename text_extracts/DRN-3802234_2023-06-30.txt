The complaint
Mrs J complains that MoneyGram International Limited (MoneyGram) wont refund the 
money she lost after falling victim to an investment scam.
What happened
Mrs J was the victim of a scam in which she was told she was investing in a trading platform 
making trades in binary options.
Mrs J sent seventeen transfers in total using MoneyGram between January 2017 and March 
2017. The lowest transfer was for £240 and the largest was for £980. These were made from 
three different MoneyGram locations, and no two transfers were made on the same date. 
MoneyGram made the transfers in line with Mrs Js instructions.
Mrs J says that she stopped sending money for a while, as she had suspicions. Then when 
the trading platform closed, she saw this as a significant red flag. The scammer made 
contact again and told Mrs J theyd managed to rescue her money and she needed to make 
a larger payment to have the funds transferred back to her bank account. Mrs J says she 
learned from the FCA that such a payment would not be necessary for a bank transfer, and 
that this was a scam. She reported the matter to Action Fraud.
However, when MoneyGram was made aware of the scam, it could not recover the funds 
shed sent, which amounted to a total of £10,720.
Left significantly out of pocket by the scam, Mrs J complained to MoneyGram. She didnt 
think it had done enough to protect her from the scam.
MoneyGram said that all the transfers had been correctly received and it was satisfied its 
agents had correctly followed the relevant procedures. It has also said that Mrs J had filled in 
a form which contained a prominent fraud and scam warning at the top. It said that its 
transfer service was intended for transfers between people who knew each other, not for the 
purchase of goods or services. Its transfer forms stated this in a prominent warning 
message. MoneyGram didnt think it was liable to refund Mrs J for the money shed lost.
Mrs J didnt accept this and referred her complaint about MoneyGram to this service.
Our Investigator looked into what had happened but didnt think MoneyGram had been at 
fault. The transfers Mrs J had made wouldnt have looked different to the MoneyGram agent 
to the typical transfers that a MoneyGram transfer might be used for. She didnt think there 
was anything that MoneyGram could have done to recover the funds because theyd been 
collected before the scam had come to light.
Mrs J didnt agree. She thought MoneyGram should be held to the similar standards as 
would apply if shed made bank transfers from her bank account. She recalled that a long 
time before 2017, shed attempted to make an unconnected transfer, but that MoneyGram 
had blocked it and told her it was a scam. She thought it should have done the same in 
2017.
The Investigator explained that the guidance and rules referred to by Mrs J were applicable 
to banks but didnt apply to MoneyGram  it isnt a bank. She reiterated that she didnt think 
the pattern of transactions would have obviously been a concern to MoneyGram given the 
typical usage of its service to transfer funds between two individuals in different countries.
Mrs Js case was referred to me to review afresh and reach an impartial final decision. As 
part of my investigations, I obtained further information from MoneyGram about the transfers 
in question and its procedures to reduce the incidence of frauds and scams. I cannot detail 
all of that information here given its commercially sensitive nature. But I can reassure Mrs J 
that I have thoroughly explored whether MoneyGram is somehow at fault and should bear 
liability for her losses either in full or in part.
Im also conscious that Ive summarised this complaint briefly, in less detail than has been 
provided, and in my own words. No discourtesy is intended by this and instead, Ive chosen 
to focus on what I think is the heart of the matter here. If theres something Ive not 
mentioned, it isnt because Ive ignored it - I havent. However, Im satisfied I dont need to 
comment on every individual point or argument to be able to reach what I think is the right 
outcome. Our rules allow me to do this and this simply reflects the informal nature of our 
service as a free alternative to the courts. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I am extremely sorry to hear about what has happened to Mrs J. She was the innocent victim 
here, and has suffered a significant loss to a cynical scam. Rather than investing her money 
and earning profits, it appears the scammer has simply stolen her money. This was a cruel 
and criminal action. While a considerable time has passed since the scam occurred, Mrs J 
has detailed the impact it had on her, and I can appreciate why she believes MoneyGram 
should refund her the financial losses she incurred.
But despite my natural sympathy for Mrs J as the victim in this, it doesnt necessarily follow 
that MoneyGram is at fault or is liable for the transfers she made. The primary cause of 
these losses were the criminal actions of the scammer. I simply dont have the power to 
investigate the scammer, and I cant fairly hold MoneyGram responsible for Mrs Js loss 
unless I can establish that the loss followed from something MoneyGram did or didnt do in 
the specific circumstances.
Its important for me to note at the outset that MoneyGram isnt a bank and doesnt operate 
as a bank. While a customer can register with MoneyGram  meaning it stores their data 
and so facilitates easier transactions using a form of loyalty card  that registration does not 
create a depositary account (and the customer relationship with MoneyGram is therefore 
very different in nature to a bank account for example). That has a number of implications 
when considering MoneyGrams obligations in a situation such as the one here. It also 
means that the usage of MoneyGram by a typical customer will not be readily comparable to 
that of a current account held with a bank. 
Crucially, most of the guidance, legislation and industry good practice that apply to payments 
made through a bank or building society either dont apply or have only very limited 
application to a money remittance service such as MoneyGram. Amongst other matters, 
Mrs J refers in her submissions to the BSI voluntary code of practice. But this is not 
something MoneyGram was required to follow. The same applies to the other guidance she 
quotes which is relevant for banks and building societies. While the position has somewhat shifted in recent years, the events in question here took 
place around six years ago, and I must apply the expectations and requirements that were 
relevant then. It would not be fair and reasonable for me to use the benefit of hindsight to 
retroactively impose a higher standard on MoneyGram.
The events in question occurred almost five years before Mrs Js complaint to MoneyGram. 
So the quantity and quality of information available to me now is limited. In particular, due to 
the passage of time, MoneyGram says its agent no longer retains the transfer forms it says 
Mrs J would have completed at the time. 
It is possible these would have included a question about the transfer purpose. But Mrs J 
does not recall the forms or being asked that question. Based on her recollections, it doesnt 
seem such a conversation took place. My further enquiries to MoneyGram about its 
processes in 2017 lead me to believe that the question about transfer purpose was only 
made mandatory where a transfer exceeded a specific threshold  and this did not apply to 
any of the transfers made by Mrs J.
So in one sense the evidence here is consistent  neither Mrs J nor MoneyGram believe that 
she was asked about the purpose of any of the transfers she made. Indeed, it seems most 
likely to me, given the limited information I can establish, that these transactions did not 
involve any real discussion on that subject  whether prompted by Mrs J or prompted by 
MoneyGram.
I suspect Mrs J would only have asked the MoneyGram agents for advice about the transfer 
if shed had doubts about it herself  and that doesnt seem to have been the case. But I 
have gone on to consider whether, nonetheless, MoneyGram was at fault for not initiating 
that interaction  for not querying the purpose with Mrs J at the time of her transfers or 
otherwise prompting a discussion about the transfers with her.
As mentioned above, the requirements and expectations I can reasonably apply to 
MoneyGram at the relevant time are limited. And of course, each MoneyGram agent would, 
not unreasonably, have a broad expectation that the transfers they were being asked to 
process were legitimate in nature. The risk of using the service for transferring money to 
someone the sender didnt know was prominently stated at the head of the transfer form 
Mrs J likely must have completed at least once  even if just in the context of setting up her 
details with MoneyGram. But despite this, I consider the agent should still have had in mind the possibility of the 
service being misused to facilitate fraud. Specifically, I consider it reasonable that 
MoneyGram should have queried the circumstances of a transfer where I think it ought 
reasonably to have become aware that there was significant risk of financial harm to one of 
the users of its service.
I might think that should have been apparent had any one of the transfers been for a 
remarkable amount (or otherwise should have caused significant concern taken on face 
value). Indeed, MoneyGrams procedures recognised the higher risk associated with some 
large value transfers. But none made by Mrs J were for a remarkable sum in themselves 
(reflecting perhaps the scammers awareness of the risk thresholds applied by MoneyGram 
at the time). 
I have therefore weighed the question of whether a fraudulent pattern ought to have been 
sufficiently apparent to MoneyGram (or its agents) at the time, and if so, whether this should 
have raised significant concerns to the extent that I could fairly and reasonably find 
MoneyGram at fault for not taking additional steps to protect Mrs J.
Unfortunately, whether by chance or perhaps by the design of the scammers involved, the 
transfers Mrs J made were separated in both time and location. The transfers were also 
made to more than one different recipient and for variable sums. I consider these factors 
made the detection of the overall pattern of transactions far more challenging. 
This was the case particularly given the nature of the MoneyGram service - operating from 
the offices of agents for one-off transfers of funds between individuals. I find that is 
significantly different from the closer links that might be expected of a bank for example. 
All considered, looking at the dispersion of the transfers I dont think I can fairly say this 
should have been identified as fraudulent in nature by any of the individual agents at the 
time. I dont think the broader pattern would have been apparent.
Neither do I consider MoneyGram was at fault for not identifying the pattern centrally. The 
transfers wouldnt necessarily have looked out of keeping with the typical transfers 
MoneyGrams platform is used for daily. It doesnt appear there would have been any 
substantive prior usage history for Mrs J, against which MoneyGram could assess whether 
the pattern was significantly unusual for her (in the way I might expect had this been her 
bank account). I simply cannot reasonably expect MoneyGram to have had the same type of 
relationship with its customers as a bank might with a longstanding current account holder 
for example.
Ive carefully considered whether there might be any other reason that MoneyGram could be 
held responsible for Mrs Js losses to this scam. But I havent found evidence to show there 
was fault on its part. When Mrs J reported the scam, MoneyGram was unable to recover any 
of her transfers because they had been collected by the recipients some five years prior. I 
dont think MoneyGram could possibly have done more in this respect.
I havent reached this decision lightly, and I know how much the outcome matters to Mrs J. 
I do not underestimate how much of an impact this has had on her and continues to have. 
But it is simply the case that I dont find MoneyGram was responsible for what happened and 
the resultant losses, so I cant fairly require it to repay Mrs J.My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold Mrs Js complaint about MoneyGram 
International Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2023.
