K821x#15complaint
Mr P complains that Startline Motor  Finance Limited  placed a marker on his credit file.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy  of which  is attached and forms part 
of this decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I didnt propose to uphold  Mr Ps complaint. I 
invited Mr P and Startline to let me have any further  evidence or arguments they wanted to 
make before I finally determined the matter.
Mr P said he didnt  know why the CCJ was registered at his previous address. He also said 
he didnt care because  he had paid the debt in full. He said that if he had omitted to include 
his previous address on his application then it had been a genuine  mistake.
Startline didnt respond to my provisional  decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive taken account of what  Mr P has said but these are points which hes made previously 
and Ive already  covered them in my provisional  decision. So I see no reason to reach  
different conclusions to the ones set out in my provisional decision.
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 July 2020.
