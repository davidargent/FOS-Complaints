K821x#15complaint
Mr R has complained PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wont refund him for gambling 
transactions which he didnt make.
background
In June 2018 Mr R (under his previous name of Mr T) brought a complaint to the 
ombudsman service. Hed complained to PayPal about sets of gambling transactions.  Hed 
told them  he thought his PayPal password had been  compromised by using a shared pc. 
They refunded him money for transactions that happened on 8 and 10 June 2018. Theyd 
then rejected his claim for nearly £700  worth of transactions.  He didnt think  this was fair. 
PayPal had subsequently decided to close Mr Rs account.
Mr R told us a bank  card hed expected to be delivered hadnt arrived. It looked  as if this 
card had been added to his PayPal account allowing payments and withdrawals to be made.  
We asked PayPal for additional information relating to the disputed  transactions.  They 
refused to provide this as we had a complaint from a Mr T but their account was in the name  
of Mr R. Despite us sharing other information  about  Mr T (or Mr R), PayPal refused to 
provide us with further information. They cited GDPR regulations which  prohibited them  from 
doing this.
Having considered the limited information available but finding Mr Rs story plausible,  our 
investigator asked PayPal to refund Mr R along  with 8% simple interest a year.
PayPal disagreed with this outcome  but didnt provide us with any further information. They 
asked this complaint  to be considered  by an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion and for roughly the same  reasons as our investigator. Ill explain why.
The Payment Services Regulations primarily  require banks to refund customers if they didnt 
make or authorise payments themselves. Certain  other circumstances do apply  but 
nothing thats  had a bearing  on the outcome Ive reached here.  So when we look at whether 
a bank has acted  fairly  in rejecting someones  fraud complaint, one of the things we consider 
is whether the customer made the transactions  themselves or allowed  them  to be made. If 
they did, then we generally wouldnt  ask the bank to refund them.
So to help me decide what happened, Ive looked at the evidence of the transactions, as well 
as what both PayPal  and Mr R have told us. 
Firstly I can see the timeline of events and how the transactions were made were covered in 
our investigators view of 26 July 2019. I dont intend  to repeat everything that was said 
there. Except to say Im satisfied Ive reviewed the complaint thoroughly.
The facts  I think that are pertinent to this complaint include:
Mr Rs missing bank  card was added to his PayPal  account. PayPal has given us 
nothing to suggest this isnt the case.
Ref: DRN63306742PayPal accepted Mr Rs fraud  claims for similar transactions on 8 and 10 June  2018  
and repaid him what hed lost.
At that stage Mr R told PayPal he had accounts  with two other gambling 
organisations. This can also be seen by a review  of Mr Rs PayPal history which  
PayPal sent us before their new GDPR guidelines were in place.
It is the fact that Mr R had these  accounts  that PayPal seem to have relied  upon  to 
reject Mr Rs fraud claim. But hed already said his PayPal account had been  
compromised so I dont think that would be enough to decide Mr R had made  these 
transactions.
Theres obviously a different pattern of use in Mr Rs PayPal account. Hed made  
transactions in early  June with the same company  as the disputed transactions on 
22 June. Mr R hadnt disputed those earlier transactions  so Im not sure why hed 
have disputed the later transactions  if hed made  them.
So based  on the evidence we have I believe  Mr R didnt make  or authorise those 
transactions. I will be asking PayPal to reimburse  him along with 8% simple interest a year.
I find PayPals attitude to sharing evidence troubling.  Our rules (DISP 3.5.8 to 3.5.10) show 
we can oblige businesses  to provide  us with evidence that we will then treat securely. I 
should stress here that its not just their failure to provide  us with the evidence we requested  
that has had a bearing on the outcome. Ive considered the limited evidence  they provided 
and also taken into account what Mr R has told us to come to my decision.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is to instruct  PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
Refund Mr R £690 for the transactions he didnt make;  and
Add 8% simple interest a year from 22 June  2018 until the date of settlement.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 February  2020.
