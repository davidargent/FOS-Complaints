The complaint
Ms K complains about NewDay Ltd (NewDay) for proactively increasing her credit card limit 
on multiple occasions. She feels that the lending was irresponsible and caused her to incur 
greater debt. She wants NewDay to refund the interest and charges applied to her account.  
What happened
In April 2019, Ms K searched for a credit card through a price comparison site. She was 
guided to an application for an Aqua card, offered by NewDay, and applied for it.
She completed information on her income as being a gross annual income of £24,000. She 
detailed that she rented her home. 
Aqua carried out searches on Ms K and learned that she had around £14,500 of unsecured 
debts elsewhere. Aqua considered that Ms Ks application was medium risk and approved 
her application, offering her a card with a credit limit of £250. The card carried an interest 
rate of 34.9%
Ms K initially did not use the card but began using it in June 2019. She made repayments 
above the minimum repayment, but in July, August and September 2019 left a residual 
balance on the card. 
In October 2019, NewDay wrote to Ms K, proactively increasing her credit limit. This 
increase was to £1500. The letter allowed Ms K the option to opt out of the increase and 
stated that if she didnt opt out her limit would be increased. 
Ms K did not opt out and her limit was increased. 
Ms K spent more on her card and, although she made significant repayments, her balance 
increased, ranging between £430 and £1090 over the next four months. 
In January 2020, NewDay again wrote to Ms K, offering to increase her limit by a further 
£1000. Again she did not opt out so her limit increased to £2500.
Ms Ks spending increased, and her balances increased until, by September 2020, she had 
a balance close to her limit. In October 2020, NewDay again proactively increased Ms Ks 
limit by a further £750, bringing her limit to £3250. 
On two occasions over this period Ms K exceeded her credit limit and incurred charges. 
Ms K has subsequently fallen into financial difficulties and a repayment plan has been set up 
for her. In January 2021 she complained to NewDay. She felt that the credit limit increases 
had been irresponsible and had contributed to her indebtedness and financial difficulties. 
NewDay sent its final response to her complaint in February 2021. NewDay rejected that the 
first two credit limit increases had been irresponsible, but accepted that the increase in 
October 2020 was inappropriate. NewDay offered to refund to Ms Ks account all interest 
and charges applied to her balance above £2500.
Ms K was not happy with this and contacted us.
Our investigator has looked into this matter and set out his view to the parties. This was that 
he thought the initial decision to lend to Ms K was reasonable and affordable, but he did not 
think that the subsequent increases were responsible. He recommended that NewDay 
rework Ms Ks account to remove interest and charges which were applied to her balance 
above the initial limit. 
NewDay did not accept that view and made some further submissions. The complaint has 
therefore been passed for an ombudsman decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have borne in mind that NewDay has submitted that its Aqua card is offered on a low and 
grow basis whereby the initial credit limit is low but can be increased. NewDay has indicated 
that this is to allow consumers to build their credit. 
I have also borne in mind that the card offered to Ms K was offered at a high interest rate, of 
34.9%, making it a relatively expensive way to borrow. 
NewDay has provided the information which informed its decision to lend and this shows that 
NewDay initially assessed Ms K as having high indebtedness and below average income. It 
noted that she had around £14500 of unsecured debt elsewhere. Ms K did not have any 
CCJs or defaults on her credit score so NewDay considered it was content to lend to her. On 
balance, I think that approving her application with a level of £250 was reasonable.  
NewDay initially offered a low limit and, when Ms K demonstrated that she could manage 
that lower limit increased it rapidly. 
From the evidence I have seen, I accept that NewDay undertook checks to ensure it was 
satisfied with the risk which Ms K presented to NewDay, and that it increased her credit limit 
to higher levels after Ms K had demonstrated that she would meet her repayments, but I 
have not seen evidence that NewDay adequately considered whether the lending was 
affordable for Ms K. 
NewDay has referred to an affordability model which uses ONS data, and has stated that it 
is not required to request payslips or other information of its consumers. NewDay states that 
when considering a credit limit, it ought to assume that the cardholder will draw down the 
full amount available at the earliest opportunity and repay it over a reasonable period. 
I do not dispute the usefulness of such models generally, but in this instance the information 
before NewDay was that Ms K had an income of £24,000 per year, unsecured debts of more 
than £14,000, and rent to pay. She had managed to meet repayments by borrowing money 
from her partner for a period, but this was not sustainable. 
I cannot see that either the model used, nor any other check undertaken, gave consideration 
to whether Ms K would be able to repay the full amount of lending, if she utilised it. I also 
cannot see that consideration was given to whether it was in Ms Ks interest to have access 
to a further £3250 of unsecured debt, at a high rate of interest, on top of her existing 
unsecured debt. 
Consequently, I agree with the investigators view and I do not think the increases in lending in this case were offered responsibly or appropriately, and I uphold Ms Ks complaint. 
Putting things right
My colleague set out his view on how NewDay ought to put matters right, and I think this is 
sensible. NewDay must rework Ms Ks account to remove all interest and charges accrued 
on the account from the date of the first increase. If this results in any amount owed to Ms K 
this should be repaid to her, with 8% p/a interest from the date of payment up until the date 
of settlement.  
In light of the above redress, I do not make any award of compensation for distress and 
inconvenience.  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Ms Ks complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to:
Re-work Ms Ks account removing all interest and charges applied after the datae of 
the first credit limit increase.
If the above recalculation results in a payment owed to Ms K to return this to her, with 
interest at a rate of 8% per annum from the date of her overpayment up until 
settlement. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 November 2021.
