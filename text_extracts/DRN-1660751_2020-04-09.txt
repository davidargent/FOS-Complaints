The complaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc declined an online debit card payment.
What happened
On 20 June 2019 Mr S attempted to make an online payment from his NatWest debit card to 
a company that Ill call V in this decision. He received a one time passcode from NatWest 
by email, which he entered correctly. But he said his payment was declined. Because Mr S 
needed to make this payment urgently he had to ask a friend to make it on his behalf. He 
said this incurred an additional expense. So, Mr S suffered a loss.
Mr S complained about what happened in early July 2019 during a telephone call with 
NatWest. During that telephone call he said he was kept on hold for over an hour. He said 
this was particularly inconvenient because he was at work at the time he made the call. To 
recognise the period of time Mr S spent on the phone and the cost of that call NatWest 
offered him £15 compensation, which he rejected.
The day after Mr S call to NatWest it issued its final response to his complaint. In its 
correspondence it told Mr S it had emailed him an authorisation code to ensure it was him 
making the payment. It confirmed that, as he entered that code correctly, it was happy to 
make the payment in question. But it said V didnt complete the transaction at its end, which 
meant it didnt fully request Mr S payment from NatWest. So, it said Mr S payment had 
been unsuccessful due to an error on the part of V. It therefore declined to cover the 
additional expense Mr S said he had incurred by not being able to make his payment when 
he wanted. But it reaffirmed its previous offer to compensate Mr S for his call costs.  
Mr S remained unhappy with NatWests response to his complaint and referred it to our 
service. Our investigator looked into what happened and, while they empathised with Mr S, 
they didnt uphold his complaint. Overall, they didnt think that NatWest had made an error or 
needed to do anything more here. And they thought the £15 offer it had made to cover the 
cost of Mr S call was reasonable But Mr S disagreed and asked for his complaint to be 
referred to an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear about the difficulties Mr S experienced here. I can see how strongly he feels 
about his complaint. But, having thought about everything he and NatWest have said, Ive 
reached the same overall conclusion as the investigator. I appreciate Mr S will be 
disappointed by this outcome. But I hope he can understand the reasons behind my 
decision.
The starting point here is that NatWest should follow its customers requests, unless theres 
good reason not to. Here, Mr S gave it instructions to make an online payment from his debit 
card.When Mr S attempted to make his payment NatWest sent him an authorisation code by 
email. Its clear that concerns over the authenticity of this payment triggered that email. 
Banks have a duty to have robust strategies to safeguard customer accounts from potentially 
fraudulent transactions. Preventing fraud is as important for the bank as it is for its 
customers. To do so a bank may subject debit card payments to a security check. So, I cant 
fairly criticise NatWest for wanting to check it was Mr S attempting to make this payment.   
NatWest confirmed that Mr S entered the authorisation code it sent him by email correctly. 
So, it was satisfied it was him making the payment in question. On this basis, NatWest 
confirmed it was happy for the payment to debit Mr S account. It had no reason to decline 
this payment. 
NatWest reviewed its records and has nothing showing for the payment attempt to V. It said 
the absence of an entry means it didnt decline or approve that payment  otherwise there 
would be a record showing this. It said it had investigated the payment with its Card 
Authorisation Department who confirmed the payment code had been sent and accepted. 
So, NatWest didnt stop or decline the payment. Rather, Mr S payment was unsuccessful 
because it was either declined or not properly processed by V.
I appreciate that Mr S thinks NatWest declined his payment to V. But, for the reasons 
outlined above Im not persuaded thats what happened here. Based on the evidence Ive 
considered, Im satisfied that this payment was unsuccessful due to V not completing the 
transaction. 
I appreciate that the problem Mr S experienced in attempting to make a debit card payment 
to V impacted on him financially. But that wasnt caused by anything NatWest did. It correctly 
sent payment information to the card issuer and confirmed the funds required were available 
in Mr S account. NatWest had no control over what happened after it authorised that 
payment. As it hasnt made an error I dont require it to compensate Mr S for his loss.
Finally, I understand that Mr S is unhappy with the length of time he spent on the phone to 
NatWest during his telephone call in early July. I can appreciate how Mr S might feel 
frustrated by his experience here.
Ive listened to the call he made to NatWest. It offered to email a complaint form to Mr S at 
the start of that call, which I think was an effort on NatWests part to minimise his 
inconvenience. He confirmed, however, that he was happy to continue with the call. I 
appreciate that the call was lengthy and Mr S was inconvenienced while making that call at 
work. But it was his choice to call NatWest at that time. 
NatWest has offered Mr S £15 in respect of call costs and time spent on the phone. Ive 
carefully considered everything that he and NatWest have said in reaching my decision. 
Having done so, Im satisfied the offer NatWest has already made is in line with our 
approach in similar scenarios and fair in all the circumstances. If Mr S would like to accept 
the £15 NatWest offered him he should contact it directly to do so.
As I think NatWest has dealt with Mr S complaint fairly Im not telling it to take any further 
action. I realise Mr S will be disappointed with this decision. But it brings to an end what we, 
in trying to resolve his dispute with NatWest informally, can do for him. Im sorry we cant 
help Mr S any further with this.My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. Ill leave it to Mr S to decide whether he 
wishes to approach National Westminster Bank Plc to accept the £15 it offered in relation to 
his call costs.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 May 2020.
