The complaint
Mr S complains about the service National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) provided when 
he applied to remove his brother from their joint mortgage and transfer it into his sole name.
What happened
Mr S and his brother had a joint mortgage with NatWest. Mr Ss brother wanted to take out a 
separate mortgage to buy his own property. So that could happen, Mr S approached 
NatWest about making a transfer of title (TOFT) application to put ownership of the existing 
property and mortgage into his sole name.
In August 2021 NatWest carried out an initial check of income and expenditure with Mr S to 
see what they might be able to lend him. Based on his financial circumstances at the time, 
NatWest said the most they could lend was around £158,000, which meant hed need to pay 
around £72,500 off the mortgage. 
Mr S spoke to NatWest again in October. He says they told him then they could lend him 
around £214,000 provided he paid off unsecured debt of around £21,000 and reduced the 
existing mortgage by around £12,000.
When Mr S made a formal application in December 2021, NatWest would only lend him 
around £206,000, which meant he had to pay £8,000 more than hed expected to reduce the 
mortgage. He went ahead with the application on that basis and completed the TOFT 
mortgage with NatWest in early 2022. 
Mr S was unhappy with the process hed gone through. He felt NatWest had given him 
inaccurate information about what hed be able to borrow; theyd put him under pressure to 
repay his unsecured debt to get the TOFT through; and he was unhappy that once he paid 
off that debt, NatWest offered him less than theyd originally said hed be able to borrow.    
Mr S said the detailed questions NatWest asked about his financial circumstances made him 
feel inadequate and theyd used an aggressive tone. And Mr S said NatWest had delayed 
the process and cancelled appointments knowing he wanted to push the application through 
quickly.
NatWest acknowledged there had been some inconsistencies in the approach different 
advisers had taken to assessing Mr Ss income, and some delays. They apologised for poor 
customer service. And they offered to pay Mr S £485 made up of £300 compensation and a 
refund of the TOFT fee of £185. Mr S didnt think that was enough to put things right. So, he 
brought his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
Our investigator felt the information NatWest had given Mr S during the application was 
appropriate. He hadnt seen any evidence Mr S was advised or pressured to pay off his 
unsecured debt. And he thought the information NatWest had gathered and tone used by 
their staff on calls were appropriate. Our investigator agreed Mr Ss experience with NatWest 
would have been smoother if he hadnt had to deal with various advisers. But he didnt think 
NatWest had made any mistakes or that they needed to take any action beyond their 
apology and offer of compensation to put things right. Since Mr S didnt agree with our 
investigator, his complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I may not mention in my decision everything Mr S and NatWest have told us. No discourtesy 
is intended by that. It reflects the informal nature of the service we provide. Id like to 
reassure the parties Ive carefully considered everything theyve said. 
Im aware NatWest werent able to find recordings of all of the calls Mr S had with them. But 
Im satisfied that from those theyve provided - which Ive listened to  and the other 
information the parties have provided, I have a good enough understanding of what was 
discussed to enable me to come to an outcome that is fair and reasonable.
I acknowledge Mr Ss strength of feeling about his complaint. And Im sorry to hear about the 
difficult circumstances which led to Mr Ss brother wanting to buy his own property. Im not 
aware Mr S let NatWest know initially the full circumstances surrounding his brothers wish to 
move, or any urgency. He mentioned when making some general enquiries in October he 
wanted things to happen as soon as possible. But during an affordability assessment at 
around the same time, Mr S chose to arrange an application appointment on a date later 
than the one offered by NatWest. And he postponed the appointment until more information 
about his bonus income would be available. I think he was probably trying to secure the 
highest level of mortgage NatWest would provide based on his own financial situation and to 
balance that against a gift a family member was providing to cover any shortfall. Even if Im 
wrong about that, I dont think NatWest would reasonably have understood there was any 
urgency until Mr S complained in early December 2021. 
I acknowledge Mr Ss concerns that the amount NatWest were willing to lend him changed 
over time. And I can understand it will have been awkward for Mr S to have to keep 
discussing with his family the level of gift he was going to need in the circumstances. But any 
information NatWest gave Mr S about the amount he could borrow was no more than an 
indication of what they might be prepared to lend him, subject to him sending in 
documentary evidence of his financial situation and going through a formal application. I 
think NatWest made that clear to Mr S, as Id expect.
The conversation Mr S had with NatWest in August 2021 was clearly an enquiry by him into 
the possibility of removing his brother from their joint mortgage. The adviser took some initial 
information about Mr Ss income and expenditure to assess what level of mortgage he could 
afford and what NatWest would be willing to lend him. Based on that, the adviser said Mr S 
could borrow around £158,000 and would need to pay off around £72,500 of the mortgage. 
They explained it wasnt possible to take Mr Ss bonus income into account as hed need to 
provide payslips showing he'd received one three months in a row. And they discussed how 
the early repayment charge on the mortgage worked, whether the value of the property 
affected things and the possibility of adding an additional person to the mortgage to make it 
more affordable. 
I think the information the adviser provided was clear and informative, and Mr S went away 
to think about things. His income had been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and he 
expected it to improve through bonus payments over time. I think he understood the impact 
his income had on the level of borrowing he could get - he rang back in early October to see 
what the position was after hed earned some bonus income in the months following the 
August call.NatWest carried out an affordability assessment then. Mr S wasnt able to show hed 
received a bonus three months in a row. And information relating to his usual level of bonus 
and some benefits he received wasnt clear. The adviser gave an indication of the amounts 
he might be able to borrow, using the information she had, depending on whether he paid off 
all or some of his unsecured borrowing. Using approximate figures, his options were to 
borrow £189,000 and reduce the mortgage by just over £40,000; pay off one of his loans and 
borrow £195,000; or pay off both his loans and borrow £222,000 reducing the mortgage by 
around £8,000. Mr S said he could do any one of those. The adviser made clear Mr S didnt 
need to make any overpayment to reduce the mortgage until hed got a formal offer of a 
loan. 
The adviser explained the next step was a formal application and the information Mr S would 
need to upload to NatWests portal before the application appointment. He agreed an 
appointment should be booked with another adviser based on borrowing around £189,000 
and hed consider the options before the appointment took place. 
When Mr S spoke to another NatWest adviser in early November 2021, he decided to 
postpone the application until later in the month when further bonus information would be 
available. The adviser he spoke to then made clear that postponing the appointment would 
mean NatWest would need to assess affordability again. They explained NatWests criteria 
could change and said that no guarantee as to the amount they would lend could be given 
until a formal offer was issued.
Bearing in mind the discussions that took place, I think NatWest clearly explained, and Mr S 
ought reasonably to have understood, that the amount NatWest would lend wouldnt be 
confirmed until hed gone through a formal mortgage application.
I acknowledge Mr S feels he was pressured into repaying his unsecured borrowing. He says 
once hed paid off the loans, he felt he had no choice but to continue with the application 
even though the amount NatWest would lend had gone down to around £206,000 by the 
time he made a formal application in December.
Ive considered the message NatWest sent Mr S in early October 2021 around the time hed 
gone through the affordability assessment with them Ive referred to above. I dont think 
NatWest were putting pressure on Mr S to pay off the loans then or saying his application 
couldnt go ahead unless he did. The message informed him that to avoid the loans being 
taken into account in assessing affordability, hed need to pay them off and provide evidence 
hed done so before an application was made. Based on the figures NatWest indicated they 
might be able to lend in early October, he would have had to pay less to reduce the 
mortgage if hed paid off all his unsecured borrowing. So, I can understand why Mr S would 
have chosen that option at the time.
NatWest sent Mr S another message following the call in early November, which asked him 
to upload evidence the loans had been repaid. I dont think it suggests NatWest were putting 
pressure on Mr S to repay the loans. NatWest say hed repaid one of the loans then, but 
their adviser mistakenly thought hed repaid them both. The message sets out what Mr S 
had discussed with the adviser on the call about the way forward. Uploading the evidence of 
repayment meant NatWest would have up to date information regarding Mr Ss financial 
situation. That was reasonable since he planned to apply for the TOFT later that month. 
Even if Mr S felt NatWest were putting pressure on him, I dont think it affected his position 
substantively overall. Mr S said in October hed be able to go ahead whether he repaid one 
or both of the loans, or neither of them. If hed chosen not to repay the loans, based on the 
October figures, hed have had to reduce the mortgage by over £40,000. In the end he 
repaid the loans of around £21,000 and had to reduce the mortgage by around £20,000, a total payment of around £41,000. And NatWest have confirmed theyd have required him to 
pay off the loans to secure the borrowing of £206,000. So, his position in the end wasnt 
substantively different. 
Mr Ss decision to carry out the TOFT was driven by family circumstances. From what hes 
told us, on balance, I dont think hed have changed his mind about going ahead even if hed 
taken more time to decide about paying off the loans. 
Mr S was unhappy with the questions NatWest put to him about his financial circumstances 
and the gift a family member was providing. I can understand it was a stressful time for Mr S. 
But NatWest are required by Financial Conduct Authority rules to ensure borrowing is 
affordable for their customers. Id expect them to have questioned Mr S closely about his 
financial situation. The questions they asked were reasonable against that background. And 
its fair NatWest required confirmation Mr S wouldnt be required to repay the gift. That may 
have impacted the affordability of the mortgage and the risk NatWest were taking on by 
lending to Mr S. From the calls Ive listened to, I dont think the NatWest advisers adopted an 
inappropriate tone in their conversations with Mr S. 
Looking at the progress of Mr Ss application, I can see he told NatWest in around early 
December 2021 that he was concerned about the time things were taking. I dont think 
NatWest were responsible for any delays until late November. Until then Mr S had been 
waiting for information relating to his bonus that would potentially help with the affordability 
calculation. And NatWest had made clear from August onwards, theyd need to see three 
months bonus in a row even if theyd given him an indication of what they might lend using 
the incomplete financial information they had at the time.
There was a short delay when the NatWest adviser Mr S had been dealing with in early 
November moved roles and his appointment was moved to mid-December. Its unfortunate 
the adviser wasnt available, and I can understand Mr S felt let down. But its not uncommon 
for staff to change roles and NatWest appointed another adviser to help Mr S reasonably 
quickly. In the end, his application was delayed until later in December since Mr Ss bonus 
information was still incomplete. The new adviser was concerned about demonstrating to 
NatWests underwriters, who would decide on the TOFT application, that the mortgage 
would be affordable for him. So, whilst his application was delayed until additional bonus 
information was available, I dont think that was unreasonable in the circumstances.
I can see NatWest have acknowledged there were some inconsistencies in the way different 
advisers used information about Mr Ss income to calculate the amount they might be willing 
to lend. And they acknowledged some delays and cancellations. NatWests actions havent 
caused Mr S to lose any money. He was always going to be liable to repay his unsecured 
borrowing. And to transfer the mortgage into his sole name required him to reduce the 
mortgage. Overall, I think NatWest provided clear information as to the process they would 
follow to assess affordability and explained there were no guarantees about the amount until 
a full application had taken place. So, I wont ask NatWest to pay the level of compensation 
Mr S was seeking. 
Bearing everything in mind, whilst I understand Mr S will be disappointed, I think the offer 
NatWest made to pay compensation of £300 and refund the TOFT fee of £185 was fair and 
reasonable in all the circumstances. Putting things right
To put things right NatWest should now pay to Mr S the £485 theyve already offered him.
My final decision
I direct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mr S £485 made up of £300 compensation for 
distress and inconvenience and a refund of the TOFT of £185.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 September 2022.
