K821x#15complaint
Ms S complains  that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA wont refund her for items she bought  
online using  her PayPal  credit account.
background
Ms S says that in January 2018 she bought two phones online for £1,068. But she didnt 
receive them, and neither  did her neighbours. She says the signature of the person that 
signed for the parcel is unrecognisable and the delivery business said the parcel was given 
to a man outside of the property. Ms S reported  the matter to the police.
Neither PayPal nor the supplier has reimbursed Ms S for the phones.
PayPal says it didnt  reimburse Ms S because the seller provided  it with evidence to show 
that the phones were  delivered and signed  for at the relevant address on 26 January 2018. 
The delivery business said it had checked its systems, and it could see that the delivery 
person was on the correct street at the time of delivery. 
So PayPal thought the seller sent the phones to Ms S.
Our investigator also thought the seller  had sent the phones to Ms S. He appreciated that 
she wanted to be reimbursed for the lost phones  under section 75 of the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974 (Section  75), but he didnt  think PayPal had made a mistake when it decided  not 
to reimburse her on that basis. He understood why PayPal thought  there wasnt enough  
evidence to show that the supplier didn't send the phones to her. 
Ms S asked for her complaint to be reviewed. She thought that PayPal should  refund her. 
She also told us that the seller was willing to refund  her but PayPal blocked the refund.
my provisional decision 
In my provisional decision I said I thought Ms S complaint should be upheld.  I said that 
Section 75 allows a customer to claim a refund  of money they paid to a supplier from their 
credit provider in very specific  circumstances.  There needs to be enough evidence to show 
the supplier:
said something about the goods or service being sold that wasnt true; and this made 
the customer enter into the contract (a misrepresentation); or
had broken the terms of the contract.
I said my role isnt to decide  whether Section  75 applies. Rather,  I need  to think about  
whether PayPal made a mistake in the way it considered  the Section 75 claim. As there was 
nothing to suggest misrepresentation in this complaint, I considered  breach  of contract.
Ms S was adamant  she didnt receive the phones.  She says she wasnt at home  when the 
delivery company  says they were  delivered,  and the courier should only have delivered  them  
to her. She reported the matter to the police. 
Bearing all that in mind, I was persuaded that Ms S didnt receive the phones  she ordered.
Ref: DRN88554212I said the evidence  Ive seen shows the phones were delivered and signed for on 
26 January 2018.  The signature  of the person  that signed for them isnt readable. The 
delivery business hasnt been able to provide us with any information about who signed for 
the phones. It simply says the person that delivered  them was on Ms S street  at the time of 
the delivery. Ms S told us the delivery business told her that the parcel was given to a man 
outside of the property.
I couldnt see that PayPal considered Ms S claim under section 75, despite her asking it to. 
After we got involved, PayPal accepted  that section 75 was relevant to this transaction  as 
Ms S paid for the phones  using PayPal credit. But it didnt think  there was a breach of 
contract in this case, so it didnt think PayPal had to reimburse her under section 75. It didnt 
give us any details of the section 75 investigation  it carried out, or say why it thought  there 
wasnt a breach of contract.
I said there was no dispute  that Ms S paid the supplier  £1,068  for the phones  using  PayPal 
credit, and that delivery to Ms S at her address formed part of her contract  with the supplier. 
I was persuaded  that Ms S didnt receive  the phones. And I wasnt  provided with any 
evidence to suggest that Ms S told the supplier it could deliver  the phones  to a third party.
In the circumstances, I didnt think the delivery of the phones was carried  out with the skill 
and care Ms S could reasonably expect when she entered into the contract  with the supplier 
to get the phones. I was conscious that the delivery  business that acted as the sellers  agent 
couldnt say who the person they delivered the phones to was, or whether they were 
connected with Ms S in any way.
Bearing all that in mind, I thought that PayPal should  refund the £1,068 Ms S paid for the 
phones plus interest.
I also said that Ms S provided us with an email from the seller  that said that it would 
reimburse her for the phones. But it didnt do this. Ms S suggested that PayPal blocked  this 
payment. But I wasnt provided  with any evidence to suggest that PayPal did this. And 
PayPal has denied doing this, saying it wouldnt be in its interests to do so.  
In the circumstances, I didnt think PayPal made a mistake on this point.
responses to my provisional  decision
 
Ms S responded to my provisional decision to say that she agreed  with it.
 
PayPal responded  to say that it doesnt  think it should have to pay Ms S interest on top of 
the £1,068 refund because Ms S didnt  make any payments towards  the £1,068 she 
borrowed from PayPal to get the phones.
But after we put this to Ms S, she provided  us with evidence to show that she made two 
payments towards  her PayPal credit account  in July 2018. Ms S made  a £25.41  payment on 
28 July 2018,  and a £1,072.41 payment on 30 July 2018.
After we provided PayPal  with this information it said it be willing  to resolve this complaint by 
crediting the settlement amount (£1,068 plus interest) to Ms S PayPal account. She would 
then be in a position to transfer the money to another bank account. Ms S has told us that 
shes happy with this.
Ref: DRN88554213my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Taking the matter  as a whole and for the reasons  set out above,  I remain of the view that 
PayPal should  refund the £1,068 Ms S paid for the phones. It needs to add 8% simple 
interest a year to this amount and pay that to Ms S. The interest should be calculated from 
30 July 2018 (the date Ms S paid for the phones)  to the date of settlement. 
PayPal should  credit that money to Ms S PayPal  account.
my final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA should refund the £1,068  Ms S paid 
for the phones to Ms S PayPal account, adding  8% simple interest per year from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement. 
If PayPal thinks tax should be deducted  from the interest element of my award, it should 
provide Ms S with a tax deduction certificate  so she can reclaim that amount, assuming she 
is eligible to do so. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2019.
