K822xcomplaint
Ms M says that Elevate  Credit International Limited irresponsibly lent to her.
background 
The background to this complaint, together with my provisional findings, is contained in my 
provisional decision dated 25October 2019,  an extract  of which  is appended  to this final 
decision.
Ms M accepted my provisional  decision.  But Elevate didnt comment  on it.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Neither party has sent us any further information  on my provisional decision. And, apart from 
Ms M accepting it, nor has either party made  any comments on it. So I see no reason to vary 
my provisional decision. This means that Im upholding the complaint  in respect of loans five, 
and nine to seventeen
putting things right  what Elevate needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms M paid on loans five and nine to seventeen;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove all negative information  about  loans five and nine from Ms Ms credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan ten onwards  means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans ten to seventeen  should  be 
removed from Ms Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate to take off tax from this interest. Elevate must 
give Ms M a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive set out above  and in my provisional decision, my decision is that I 
uphold Ms Ms complaint  in respect of loans five and nine to seventeen. And I order  Elevate 
Credit International  Limited to pay Ms M compensation  and to make the adjustments  to her 
credit file as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 March 2020.

Our adjudicator partially upheld Ms Ms complaint  and thought the loans from the sixth loan onwards  
shouldnt have been given. Elevate  disagreed  and the complaint  has been passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
Elevate needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Ms M could repay  the loans 
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Elevate  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
Ref: DRN07729264the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Elevate was required to establish  whether  Ms 
M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable  on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Ms Ms complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Elevates lending  history with Ms M, with a view to seeing  if there 
was a point at which  Elevate  should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful.  And so Elevate should have realised  that it shouldnt have provided any further  
loans. 
Loans 1  5
Elevate had information about Ms Ms income  and expenditure at the time it gave her these  loans. I 
think that this was proportionate  for the first three loans as Ms M was in the early  stages of her 
borrowing relationship with Elevate. And the monthly repayment amounts were a small proportion of 
her declared  income.  However, by the fourth loan I think that Elevate ought  to have specifically  asked 
Ms M about  any other short term lending  she had outstanding.  I cant  be sure that it did that. But I 
have no information to show that this would  have  shown  that Ms M was unlikely  to have been able to 
sustainably repay this loan.
Ms M had taken out four loans in just over two weeks.  Each of Ms Ms loans was to be repaid over a 
period of six-months. But Ms M didnt use the loans  this way. Instead she used them  in a way that 
suggests that she didnt have control of her finances. She repaid the first three loans before taking out 
the fourth loan on the same  day. And having paid off this fourth loan just 3 days after taking it out, she 
proceeded to take out a fifth loan within  just a further few days. This was Ms Ms third loan for £200.  It 
should have been clear  to Elevate that Ms M was having trouble managing her money and that she 
needed this fifth loan to help cover the hole in her finances left by repaying the earlier ones . And it 
ought nor to have given her that loan. So I provisionally intend to uphold the complaint about  loan 5.
Loans 6  17
Loan 1  5 were  all taken our and repaid within six weeks. And as there was then a gap of four 
months before Ms M applied to Elevate for another loan I think it would have been reasonable for 
Elevate to have considered that she had had her finances under  control  at that point and to treat her 
as a new customer. So Ive looked at loans  six to seventeen  as a new chain of lending. 
The sixth loan was for a small  amount.  But within just a few days Ms M took out a further two loans, 
each for this amount. Then a week after paying off these three loans she took out a ninth loan. The 
amount of this loan was equal to the total of the sixth, seventh and eighth loans.  I find that Elevate 
Ref: DRN07729265should have realised  that she needed this ninth loan to cover  the hole in her finances resulting  from 
settling the two previous ones. And it ought not to have  given her that loan. So I provisionally  intend to 
uphold loan nine.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Elevates lending  history with Ms M, with a view to seeing  if there 
was a point at which  Elevate  should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful.  And so Elevate should have realised  that it shouldnt have provided any further  
loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Ms Ms case I think that this point was reached by loan 10. I say 
this because:
At this point Elevate  ought to have  realised  that Ms M wasnt managing to repay her loans  
sustainably. She had taken out her last four loans within a little over two months.  And Elevate 
ought to have realised that her indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
The first loan in this second chain of lending,  that is to say loan six, was for £50, whereas loan ten 
was for £250.  I think that by this stage Elevate ought  to have seen that Ms M was unlikely to have 
been borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in her finances but to fund an on-going shortfall.
Overall from what I have concluded above, I think that Ms M lost out because  Elevate  gave her the 
fifth and ninth loans and continued to provide borrowing from loan ten onwards  because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Ms Ms indebtedness  by allowing her to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number of loans and the length  of time over which Ms M borrowed were likely  to have had 
negative implications  on Ms Ms ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the 
market for these  high-cost  loans.
So Im provisionally upholding the complaint about loans  five, and nine to seventeen, and Elevate 
should put things right.
putting things  right  what Elevate needs to do
refund all interest and charges Ms M paid on loans  five and nine to seventeen;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove all negative information  about  loans five and nine from Ms Ms credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan ten onwards means any information  recorded  about  
them is adverse. So all entries about loans ten to seventeen should  be removed from Ms Ms 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Elevate to take off tax from this interest.  Elevate must  give Ms M 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  given  above, and subject  to any more  information or comments  I receive,  as above,  
Im intending  to partially uphold Ms Ms complaint.  And I will order Elevate Credit  International Limited 
to pay Ms M compensation as set out above.
