Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought Sunny shouldnt have approved 
loans 6 to 16. Sunny  disagreed with the adjudicators opinion in part. But it did think  that it 
was likely that Mr W was reliant  on credit after loan 8. So it agreed to pay compensation 
from this point onwards.  
Mr W didnt accept this offer. So as no agreement has been  reached this complaint has been 
passed to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN36197782Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. Ive decided  to uphold  Mr Ws 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Mr W didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 5. And Sunny agrees 
that it shouldnt  have approved loans 8 to 16. Because  of this I dont think there  is any 
ongoing disagreement about these  loans. So I wont be commenting fully about them. Ill 
only be considering  here whether it was apparent that Mr W was becoming reliant on short 
term lending at loan 6 rather than loan 8. That said,  loans  1 to 5 were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr W had with Sunny. So they are something I will take into account when 
considering loans 6 and 7. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that by loan 6 Sunny should  
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
I say this because:
Ref: DRN36197783At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr W had taken out 5 loans beforehand and hed been indebted to 
Sunny for around 9 months. So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more likely than 
not Mr W was having  to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan 
was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ws indebtedness was unsustainable.
And Sunny ought to have known  that Mr W was not likely borrowing to meet  a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. At loan 6 he was 
committing to a lending  relationship for over a year.  
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr W was provided with further loans while he hadnt repaid his 
earlier loans. At most of the lending relationship he had more  than one loan running  
at a time.  
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 16 was 
taken out not far short of two years  after Mr Ws first. Mr W had paid large  amounts  of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time. 
I note that Sunny  accepts this is the case for much  of the lending. 
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 and 7 and I agree with the offer Sunny has 
made in respect  of loans 8 to 16. Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 6 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 16 should be removed from 
Mr Ws credit file.
If Mr W still owes Sunny any of the principal balance  he borrowed on his final loan Sunny 
should remove all the interest and charges applied to the outstanding balance. Sunny  should  
then re-work the account as if all payments made by Mr W went to towards  the principal. But 
importantly, Sunny needs to make sure that Mr W doesnt repay more  than the principal 
amount borrowed.  
If after doing this Mr W hasnt repaid the principal he borrowed  Sunny can deduct this from 
the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr W has already  paid enough to repay  the principal 
then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple*  interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement
And if Sunny no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Mr W.
Ref: DRN36197784*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ws complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr W to accept 
or reject my decision before 23 January 2020.
