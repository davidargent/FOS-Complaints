K820x#14complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt make  a gesture of goodwill 
payment to his account as agreed. As a result his account remained over its agreed  
overdraft limit and a default was later applied.
To settle matters Mr A would like the default to be removed.
background
I issued my provisional decision on 15 March 2019,  a copy  extract  of which is attached and 
forms part of this final decision. In my provisional  decision I explained  why I wasnt  proposing 
to uphold Mr As complaint.
I invited both parties to let me have any further  comments for consideration before I issued 
my final decision. Mr A hasnt provided  any further information for my consideration.
NatWest agrees with my provisional decision. However where my provisional  decision refers 
to Mr A saying NatWest wouldnt speak to him in October 2017, NatWest  wanted to clarify 
that Mr As account was passed to recoveries  in August 2017 and an agent was appointed  to 
collect his debt in September  2017. NatWest  wanted  to clarify that once an account passes 
to recoveries it wouldve  been too late to prevent  the default. And therefore any discussions 
Mr A had with NatWest after the middle  of August 2017 wouldnt have changed the outcome.
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I see no reason to depart from the conclusions I set out in my provisional  
decision. It follows that I do not uphold this complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 August 2019.

complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt make  a gesture of goodwill 
payment to his account as agreed. As a result his account remained over its agreed  
overdraft limit and a default was later applied.
To settle matters Mr A would like the default to be removed.
background
Mr A had an agreed overdraft limit of £2000. He called NatWest  in late July 2017 after hed 
received a letter about his account being over this limit. During  the call it was agreed Mr A 
would pay £180  and NatWest would refund the remainder  of the overdrawn balance to bring 
the account under the agreed limit.
Mr A made his agreed  payment of £180 but NatWest didnt apply the refund  it had agreed  to. 
Due to this his account  remained over the agreed overdraft limit and NatWest issued a 
formal demand for payment in early August 2017. Mr A says he never  received this  and 
hes not received  anything  since he moved  house. NatWest then applied a default to the 
account in late September  2017 because Mr A failed to pay the amount demanded.
Mr A complained to NatWest. NatWest accepted itd failed to credit his account  as agreed. It 
also accepted  that had it made the refund  his account would have been returned to a 
satisfactory position. NatWest didnt  agree  itd made  an error when it defaulted the account  
because interest and charges were due on the account. So it made a commercial  decision to 
transfer his account to its recoveries centre.  And it didnt agree that any error was made  with 
his address  which itd changed in late November 2017.
Mr A remained unhappy  with NatWests response  so he brought his complaint to this 
service. Our investigator thought the default  had been  applied  correctly. She reviewed Mr 
As statements and could see he wasnt actively using his account  and hadnt been for some  
time. NatWest had issued  a notice of termination, and subsequently a default notice to Mr 
As address, so she thought itd followed the correct process.
She said NatWest sent the notices to the address it had on file for Mr A, and she couldnt  
hold it responsible for any failings in the postal service. She noted Mr A hadnt contacted 
NatWest between July 2017 and February 2018,  and hed made no further payments 
towards the overdraft.  So she thought that even if NatWest had correctly applied  the gesture 
of goodwill  when it agreed to, Mr As account would have still reached the same position in 
due course  simply with a later default  date.
Mr As unhappy with the investigators view so hes asked for an ombudsmans decision. He 
says that but for NatWests error he would have been within his agreed overdraft limit. He 
also says he contacted NatWest in October  2017 but it wouldnt talk to him because  his 
account had been passed to a third party.
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN15155653In its final response letter NatWest accepts that had it made  the agreed refund Mr As 
account would have returned  to a satisfactory  position. But Im of the opinion  that had it 
done so Mr A would still have gone on to exceed his agreed credit  limit, so Ill explain why.
Ive listened to the call made by Mr A to NatWest in late July 2017. In that call there was no 
reference to NatWest refunding £300 - although  I can see that it has now refunded that 
amount. The call handler explained that Mr As account was £431.24 in excess of his limit. 
And it was agreed  that if Mr A paid £180  into his account, NatWest would refund the balance 
to bring it within limit.
The call handler also explained  that Mr A would still need to make a further payment to 
cover the interest  that would be due in August 2017.  Mr A confirmed hed do this after 
hed been paid.
I can see from Mr As statements that even if NatWest had refunded  the balance to bring 
his account within his limit, hed still have  exceeded his agreed  overdraft  once interest was 
applied in August.  I say this because Mr A failed  to make that crucial further payment to 
cover the interest  due  even though he said he would do so.
So while NatWest failed to do what it agreed to, I cant agree that had it done so the 
default would have been avoided. Im satisfied that it would still have happened due to a 
lack of action on Mr As part.
In the circumstances  Im provisionally of the opinion  that the default was correctly  applied 
by NatWest so I wont be asking it to do anything further.
I realise Mr A says he never received the formal demand or correspondence  since he 
moved house. But Im satisfied that NatWest  sent correspondence to the address it had on 
file for him. And I dont think it would be fair to penalise it because of any problems with the 
post.
my provisional decision
Unless anything changes  my mind, for the reasons  given I dont  intend  to uphold this 
complaint.
