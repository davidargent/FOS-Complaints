The complaint
Mr G complains that Honeycomb Finance Limited wont refund to him the money that he 
paid for some holiday club membership credits. Hes being represented in his complaint by a 
claims management company.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint last month in which I described what had 
happened as follows:
Mr G and his wife entered into a membership application agreement with a holiday 
company in June 2018 to buy 6,000 holiday club membership credits. The purchase 
price of the credits was £18,360 and Mr G entered into a fixed sum loan agreement 
with Honeycomb Finance for a loan of that amount. He agreed to make 179 monthly 
loan repayments of £187.42 and a final payment of £187.61 to Honeycomb Finance.
Mr Gs representative made claims to Honeycomb Finance in June 2019 under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and for breach of fiduciary 
duty. It said that the holiday company was is in breach of contract, there was a 
breach of fiduciary duty because Honeycomb Finance paid a commission to the 
holiday company but didnt obtain Mr Gs informed consent to the commission, and 
the agreement, and the related agreement, are unfair. It also said that the credit 
intermediary wasnt regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
Honeycomb Finance said that the misrepresentation claims werent evidenced and 
were in contradiction of the sales and compliance documentation received, signed 
and acknowledged by Mr G and his wife. It said that theyd purchased credits to 
utilise for a wide range of holidays and lifestyle experiences, from accommodation in 
varied locations (subject to availability) to luxury cars. It said that it was made clear in 
the product disclosure document that a resale facility for the sale of credits would not 
be available until five years after purchase. It said that it didnt pay commission to the 
holiday company, it identified the credit intermediary and said that its regulatory 
status was detailed in the pre-contract credit information, and it set out the reasons 
that its relationship with Mr G wasnt unfair.
Mr G wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. His 
complaint form says that: Honeycomb Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment 
of his ability to afford the loan and paid a commission to the holiday company which 
wasnt declared to him; and the holiday company unduly pressured him into entering 
into the agreements; all of which rendered the agreement unfair pursuant to section 
140A. 
Our investigator recommended that Mr Gs complaint should be upheld. He was 
persuaded that the holiday company most likely did tell Mr G that the credits were an 
investment that could be sold for a profit and he thought that it had misrepresented 
the credits as something that could be re-sold easily in the future, but the evidence 
suggested that that couldnt have been the case. He recommended that Honeycomb 
Finance should: cancel the loan and refund all loan payments made, with interest; 
refund any membership fees that Mr G paid to the holiday company; and either 
procure his release from his obligations to the holiday company or agree to take over 
his points and/or indemnify him for any future maintenance costs.
Honeycomb Finance has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has provided an explanation of how the credits work and a detailed 
response to our investigators recommendation. It says, in summary and amongst 
other things, that:
theres been no evidence put forward by Mr G to back up his claims that the 
credits were misrepresented to him and the holiday company doesnt have 
any record of Mr G contacting it to initiate a sale;
it has referred to a compliance video that was recorded before and during the 
signing of the agreements in which Mr G confirmed that the rental and sales 
process were explained to him; and
it doesnt agree that he only bought the credits because they were an 
investment that could be sold for a profit in a short time as the credits offered 
him flexibility and he received additional benefits (including £1,250 cashback 
and £500 flight vouchers) which would have been unnecessary if Mr G had 
been told that the credits were an investment.
Mr Gs representative has raised its serious concerns about the way that the finance 
was sold to Mr G.
I said in my provisional decision: I dont consider that Mr Gs complaint should be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Gs complaint form says that Honeycomb Finance failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of his ability to afford the loan and paid a commission to the holiday 
company which wasnt declared to him; and the holiday company unduly 
pressured him into entering the agreements; all of which rendered the agreement 
unfair pursuant to section 140A;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor 
to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines 
that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Honeycomb Finance says that it assessed the affordability of the loan based 
upon the information provided by Mr G and by seeking information from credit 
reference agencies, and it deemed the loan affordable but it hasnt provided any 
other evidence of the affordability assessment that it conducted  it also says that 
Mr G confirmed during the compliance interview that the loan was affordable for 
him;
Mr G and his wife are both pensioners and Mr G says that £187.42 is a lot of 
money for them to pay each month but neither Mr G nor his representative has 
provided information about their income and expenditure to show that the loan 
wasnt affordable for Mr G - and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that the loan wasnt affordable for him in June 2018 when it was made to 
him or that Honeycomb Finance shouldnt have made the loan to him;
Mr Gs representative says that its aware that Honeycomb Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company but it hasnt provided any more information 
or evidence to show that such a commission was paid and Honeycomb Finance 
says it didnt pay commission to the holiday company;
Im not persuaded that theres any evidence to support Mr Gs representatives claim that Honeycomb Finance paid a commission to the holiday company;
Mr Gs representative says that Mr G and his wife were forced to endure an 
extremely high-pressured presentation and were put under considerable pressure 
to make a decision on the day of the presentation but Honeycomb Finance says 
that, throughout the compliance video, Mr G and his wife demonstrated that they 
were meticulous in checking the documentation;
if Mr G and his wife had been forced to stay in the presentation or had been 
subjected to unacceptable sales practices and didnt want to buy the credits, I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have complained about 
those issues soon after theyd taken place but Ive seen no evidence to show that 
they complained to the holiday company or Honeycomb Finance about those 
issues until June 2019, a year after theyd bought the credits;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr G and his wife 
were unduly pressured into buying the credits in June 2018 or that Mr G was 
unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Gs relationship 
with Honeycomb Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr G and 
Honeycomb Finance in these circumstances;
although Mr Gs complaint form didnt refer to a claim under section 75, his 
representatives June 2019 letter to Honeycomb Finance referred to its liability 
under section 75 for breaches of contract, misrepresentations and negligence 
and said that the credit intermediary wasnt regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority;
that letter described the alleged misrepresentations that were made to Mr G and 
his wife by the holiday company but theres no further information in that letter 
about a claim for breach of contract or negligence  and section 75 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section are met);
I understand that the holiday company went into liquidation in May 2020 and I 
consider that the liquidation of the holiday company would be a breach of 
contract for which Honeycomb Finance would be liable under section 75;
but I also understand that a new management company has been appointed to 
provide the services in connection with the credits that Mr G and his wife had 
bought from the holiday company in June 2018 and that the credits are available 
for them to use;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr Gs use of the credits has been adversely 
impacted by the liquidation of the holiday company and I consider the 
appointment of the new management company to have been a suitable remedy 
for any breach of contract;
Mr G says the agreement has been cancelled, hes never used the credits and 
doesnt own them anymore but Ive seen no other evidence to show that the 
agreement has been cancelled  the holiday company says that it sent 
relinquishment forms to Mr G and his wife but they hadnt been returned  the 
relinquishment of the credits would relieve Mr G and his wife from liability for any 
further management fees but wouldnt entitle them to a refund of the purchase 
price or settle Mr Gs loan from Honeycomb Finance and he would continue to have liability to repay the loan on the terms set out in the loan agreement;
Honeycomb Finance has identified the credit intermediary for Mr Gs loan and 
details about it were included in the pre-contact credit information that was 
provided to Mr G - Im not persuaded that Mr Gs representative has provided any 
evidence to support its claim that the credit intermediary wasnt regulated by the 
Financial Conduct Authority when the loan was made to Mr G;
Mr Gs representatives June 2019 letter says that Mr G and his wife were: 
advised that the credits they would be purchasing were an investment and the 
holiday company assured [them] that they would be able to make a profit on the 
resale of the property a year after purchasing the same; advised that the credits 
were worth the sum paid; advised that the credits would be sold within a short 
time and guaranteed that they would make a profit; assured that after entering 
into the agreement in 2016, they would be assigned accommodation with a sea 
view; and assured that they were members of an exclusive club and that the 
resort could only be utilised via membership;
it says that: Mr G and his wife have attempted to sell their credits via the holiday 
company and there has been no success; the credits are worth little or nothing; 
they will make a significant loss if their interest is sold; when theyve utilised the 
agreement they havent been assigned a room with a sea view; and the resort 
can be accessed by non-members via third party booking agencies;
Ive been provided with a copy of the membership application agreement that Mr 
G and his wife signed in June 2018, the terms and conditions and the loan 
agreement that Mr G signed in June 2018 but Ive not been provided with the 
other documents that its likely that they would have also signed at that time;
Honeycomb Finance has provided extracts from a product disclosure document 
that it says would have been provided to Mr G and his wife but Ive not been 
provided with a full or signed copy of that document and it has also referred to the 
compliance video but it hasnt provided that either;
the terms and conditions that Mr G and his wife signed say that the credits grant 
the right to use accommodation and other use on the terms set out in the rules of 
membership, reservation rules, deed of trust, club regulations and the standard 
information document;
one of the extracts from the product disclosure document that Honeycomb 
Finance has provided says that the credits can be exchanged for rights of 
occupation and use in a unit of accommodation or a yacht or use of other lifestyle 
products such as luxury cars at various locations;
another extract from that document says that the resale facility for credits for new 
members will be available five years following the start of membership;
neither Mr G nor his representative has provided any documentary or other 
evidence in support of Mr Gs claim that the credits were sold to Mr G and his 
wife as an investment and I consider it to be more likely than not that they were 
aware that the credits could be exchanged as described in the product disclosure 
document;
nor have they provided any documentary or other evidence in support of the 
claim that Mr G and his wife have unsuccessfully attempted to sell their credits 
via the holiday company and Honeycomb Finance says that the holiday company 
doesnt have any record of Mr G contacting it to initiate a sale;
I also consider it to be more likely than not that they were aware that the resale 
facility for their credits wouldnt be available until five years later and Im not persuaded that its likely that the holiday company would have guaranteed that 
Mr G and his wife would be able to sell their credits or that they would make a 
profit if they sold them;
Mr G and his wife considered that the credits were worth the sum paid and I 
consider that the credits clearly have value as they can be exchanged for 
accommodation and other experiences  but they give Mr G and his wife no 
interest in property and they can be used at various locations so arent linked to 
one resort;
Im not persuaded that its likely that the holiday company would have told Mr G 
and his wife that any of the locations were exclusive to members of the club as 
thats not consistent with the way that the credits operate;
Mr Gs representative says that Mr G and his wife were assured that after 
entering into the agreement in 2016, they would be assigned accommodation 
with a sea view but when theyve utilised the agreement they havent been 
assigned a room with a sea view;
Mr G and his wife bought the credits in June 2018 and Mr G says that theyve 
never used them - Im not persuaded that its likely that they would have been 
assured that they would be assigned accommodation with a sea view and, if 
theyve never used the credits, they cant have been assigned a room without a 
sea view;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday 
company sold the credits to Mr G and his wife as an investment, that it 
guaranteed that theyd be able to sell them for a profit, that the credits were 
misrepresented or mis-sold to them by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the membership application agreement by any 
misrepresentations;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Gs claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Honeycomb Finances response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Honeycomb Finance responded to Mr Gs claims in December 2019 and I 
consider that it was fair and reasonable for it not to uphold those claims for the 
reasons that it gave - so I consider that its response to his claims was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr G and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their 
credits, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require 
Honeycomb Finance to refund to Mr G any of the money that hes paid under the 
loan agreement, to cancel the loan, to pay him any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
Mr G says that the monthly payment is a lot of money and, if hes struggling to pay it, 
I suggest that he contacts Honeycomb Finance and explains to it his financial 
situation. Its required to respond to any financial difficulties that hes experiencing 
positively and sympathetically.
Subject to any further comments or evidence that I received from any of Mr G, his 
representative and Honeycomb Finance, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend to 
uphold this complaint. Mr Gs representative has provided a generic submission from 
counsel about various consumer complainants and providers of consumer credit for 
purchase of [credits from the holiday company].What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
That includes consideration of the generic submission from counsel that has been provided 
by Mr Gs representative but Im not persuaded that I should change the findings that I set 
out in my provisional decision. I dont consider that the generic submission contains enough 
evidence to show that the holiday company misrepresented the credits to Mr G or that 
Mr Gs relationship with Honeycomb Finance was unfair. And I dont consider that it contains 
enough evidence to cause Honeycombs response to Mr Gs claims under section 75 and 
140A to be unfair or unreasonable. 
For the reasons set out in my provisional decision, Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that: the credits were misrepresented or mis-sold to Mr G and his wife by 
the holiday company; that they were induced into entering into the membership application 
agreement by any misrepresentations; or that Mr Gs relationship with Honeycomb Finance 
was unfair; and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an 
unfair relationship between Mr G and Honeycomb Finance in these circumstances. 
I sympathise with Mr G and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their credits, but I 
find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Honeycomb Finance to refund to 
Mr G any of the money that hes paid under the loan agreement, to cancel the loan, to pay 
him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 August 2023.
