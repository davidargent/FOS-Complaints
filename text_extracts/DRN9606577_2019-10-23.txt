K821x#15complaint
Mr K says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He 
says that Sunny failed to identify that he had become dependent  on short  term lending  and it 
shouldnt have lent to him.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that Sunny  shouldnt have 
approved loan 3 and loans 5 to 10. Sunny disagreed  with the adjudicators opinion so the 
complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr K could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN96065772the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Ks complaint 
in part and have explained why below.
Mr K didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion about loans 1, 2 and 4. Because of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about  these loans. So I wont  be making a 
decision about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Mr K had with 
Sunny. So they are something I will take into account when considering the other loans he 
took.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 3 and 5 would most likely have 
shown that Mr K did have  some money left over when his general expenditure was taken 
from his income. But he was also spending a significant amount  on other debt including  
short term lending. For example he owed over £900 to other short term lenders when he 
took loan 3 and just under £500  when he took loan 5. He was also very overdrawn.  
I think that Sunny wouldve found  out this information if it had made proportionate checks.  I 
think it wouldve most likely have seen  that Mr K was having problems managing  his money  
and that he wouldnt  have been  able repay  the loans in a sustainable way. So I think that 
Sunny shouldnt have given loans  3 and 5 to Mr K and I think  hes lost out as a result of this. 
So Im upholding  Mr Ks complaint about  them. 
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 10 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  
history with Mr K, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which  Sunny should  
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN96065773Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ks case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
up to loan 6 the amounts Mr K was borrowing hadnt been  decreasing.  And Mr K had 
been taking more than one loan at once. And going  forward  Mr K carried on doing 
this. He also took new loans within a very short time of settling  his earlier  loans. 
Sunny  ought  to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr K was having to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Ks indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 10 was 
taken out around 11 months after Mr Ks first. And it was for a similar amount. So 
Mr K had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr K lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ks indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ks 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 10 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loan 3, and loans 5 to 10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 and 5 from Mr Ks credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 10 should be removed from 
Mr Ks credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr K a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ks complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 November  2019.
