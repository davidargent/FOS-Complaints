The complaint
Ms C complains about the sum she was asked to pay by Close Brothers Limited 
(Close Brothers) when she settled her conditional sale agreement (agreement) with it 
early.
What happened
In November 2014 Ms C entered into an agreement with Close Brothers for a car.
The cash price of the car was £69,979.
Ms C received a trade in allowance for her old car of £13,372 leaving her to finance the 
balance of £56,607 over a 60 month term with Close Brothers.
Under the agreement, and everything else being equal, Ms C agreed to make 60 monthly 
payments of £1,187.60  total repayable £71,256  made up of the following:
Capital                         £56,607
Interest                        £14,251
Acceptance Fee          £199
VPP Fee                      £199
 
In May 2019 Ms C settled her agreement by paying Close Brothers £9,992.65.
After settling her agreement Ms C complained to Close Brothers that she had been required 
to pay it more than she should have been.
Close Brothers considered Ms Cs complaint but didnt uphold it. In summary it said her 
agreement had been managed and administered correctly and the sum it had sought from 
her of £9,992.65, to settle it early, was correct.
Unhappy with Close Brothers response Ms C complained to our service.
Ms Cs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that 
Close Brothers had managed and administered Ms Cs agreement correctly and no refund 
was due.
Ms C didnt agree with the investigators conclusion so her complaint has been passed to me 
for review and decision.
 
What Ive decided  and whyIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. In considering what is fair and 
reasonable, I need to have regard to the relevant law and regulations, regulators rules, 
guidance and standards and codes of practice and (where appropriate) what I consider to 
have been good industry practice at the time. I would also add that where the parties 
disagree, Ive made my findings on the balance of probabilities - in other words, what I think 
is most likely based on the evidence Ive seen and the wider circumstances. 
Its clear Ms C has very strong feelings about this complaint. She has provided detailed 
submissions in support of her view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their 
entirety. However, I trust that Ms C will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I 
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as 
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised.
The amount of an agreement payment is composed of a combination of interest and 
principal. Over the life of the agreement, the proportion of interest to principal will change. 
Initially a consumers payment will be primarily interest, with a small amount of principal 
included. As the agreement progresses, the principal portion of the payment will increase 
and the interest portion of the payment will decrease. This is because interest is based on 
the current outstanding balance of the agreement, at the relevant point in time, which 
decreases as more principal is paid.
So by way of example, and on the assumption that all payments required under Ms Cs 
agreement were made on time, the following would have been payable/paid:
Payment No Capital Interest Total Balance (capital)
     
1 £744.80 £442.80 £1,187.60 £55,862.20
13 £817.80 £369.80 £1,187.60 £46,456.86
25 £897.12 £290.48 £1,187.60 £36,238.52
37 £985.04 £202.56 £1,187.60 £24,909.80
49 £1,073.19 £114.41 £1,187.60 £13,552.29
53 £1,115.83 £71.77 £1,187.60 £8,059.07
60 £1,178.38 £9.22 £1,187.60 £0.00
     
Total £56,607.00 £14,251.00 £71,256.00  
 
Ms C says the above repayment profile/schedule wasnt explained to her and that she 
understood that she would repay £238.52 interest and £950.08 capital each month.But this isnt how Ms Cs agreement operated, nor is it the way agreements of the type taken 
out by Ms C operate in the industry more widely. So although I can understand why Ms C 
understood her repayments would be split in the manner that she did Im satisfied that Close 
Brothers didnt do anything wrong in not bringing the correct repayment profile/schedule to 
her attention.
At the time of settling her agreement early Ms C says she had made 53 payments against it. 
However in the absence of any documentary evidence from Ms C (such as copies of her 
bank statements) Im satisfied that Close Brothers records can be relied upon as being an 
accurate reflection of the payments made by Ms C. And these records show only 52 
payments having been made, not 53. 
Ms C disputes the number and amount of charges debited to her agreement by 
Close Brothers.
Over the course of the agreement Ms C was charged the following:
Type No and (£) Amount (£) Total
   
arrears letter 13 x £15 £195.00
direct debit return fee 13 x £25 £325.00
notice of default fee 14 x £15 £210.00
house visit (net of VAT) 1 x £75 £75.00
house visit (inc of VAT) 4 x £90 £360.00
Interest  £41.64
(number) plate change 2 x £25 £50.00
   
Total  £1,256.64
 
I appreciate £1,256.64 represents a not insignificant sum of money to be charged. However I 
can see that Close Brothers refunded, before the agreement was settled by Ms C, £657.08 
of the above charges taking the sum ultimately charged down to £599.56. I can also see that 
it offered to refund, and may well have refunded, a further £120.00.
So given the above, the terms and conditions of the agreement, Ms Cs payment history, 
Close Brothers detailed contact notes, and given that Ms C doesnt appear to dispute the 
number plate change charges totalling £50, Im satisfied that Close Brothers has acted 
appropriately in charging what it has to the agreement and that it has, in all the 
circumstances, acted fairly and reasonably.I can see that Ms C is also of the view that she was charged, at the outset, a fee of £199 
twice rather than once. But having considered what both parties have said and submitted Im 
satisfied that these two fees are for two separate things and have been charged correctly.
Finally on the point of charges I note that Ms C says that for a period of six months in 2017 
Close Brothers attempted to collect payment from her bank account by direct debit at the 
same time she had a standing order set up to make payment. And this caused her to incur 
charges on her bank account.
Ive looked at both Close Brothers contact notes and Ms Cs loan statements. And having 
done so its my understanding that what was ultimately agreed between the parties was that 
payment would be made by standing order between April 2017 and November 2017 
inclusive. And that during this period there was no attempt by Close Brothers to collect 
payment by direct debit. Therefore I dont think that Close Brothers can be held responsible 
for any bank charges that Ms C says she incurred during this period.
I will now turn to what I understand is Ms Cs main concern, and that is she was charged 
more than she should have been when she settled her agreement early. But taking 
everything into account Im satisfied that what she was asked to pay by Close Brothers was, 
in all material respects, correct.
After Ms C made her May 2019 payment, and on the assumption that she had made all the 
previous payments required of her, she would have been left with an outstanding balance to 
pay of £8,059.07.
However in May 2019 Ms C hadnt made all the previous payments required of her. Its my 
understanding that including her May 2019 payment Ms C had made 52 payments against 
53 scheduled. So on repaying her agreement early Ms C would have been required to pay 
not only the sum of £8,059.07, but one missed payment of £1,187.60  bringing the total to 
£9,246.67.
And when charges of £599.56 and various other adjustments totalling £146.42 are taken into 
account you can see how an early settlement figure of £9,992.65 was calculated by 
Close Brothers.
Another way of looking at the settlement of Ms Cs agreement is as follows:
Capital                                                                                     £56,607.00
Fees x 2                                                                                  £398.00
Interest                                                                                    £14,251.00
 
Balance as at December 2014                                               £71,256.00
 
52 payments made of £1,187.60                                            (£61,755.20)
 
Balance as at May 2019                                                         £9,500.80
 
Charges                                                                                  £599.56
Other debits/credits                                                                 £27.12
Early settlement rebate                                                           (£134.83)         
 
Sum required to settle:                                                            £9,992.65
 Now I appreciate Ms C believes the interest rebate of £134.83 is too low. But taking into 
account The Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) regulations 2004, Im satisfied this figure 
isnt materially wrong.
Finally on this particular point Ms C says that she shouldnt have been charged more than 
0.5% of the capital remaining on early settlement of her loan. Ms C is correct in what she 
says here but this is in respect of penalty fees that a lender can charge on early settlement. 
And Im satisfied that no such fees were levied by Close Brothers.
I appreciate Ms C will be disappointed, but taking everything into account Im satisfied that 
having offered to refund a further £120 in charges, and possibly having already paid the 
same, Close Brothers need do nothing further.
My final decision
My final decision is that Close Brothers Limited, to the extent it hasnt done so already, must 
pay Ms C £120 (by way of a charge refund) but it need do nothing further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision before 19August 2020.
