The complaint
Mrs C complains that a hire purchase agreement, under which a car was supplied to her, 
was mis-sold to her by Hodgson Newcastle Limited. Shes being helped with her complaint 
by her representative.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mrs C under a hire purchase agreement with a credit 
provider that she signed in December 2017 for which Hodgson Newcastle was the 
dealer and credit broker;
the car was supplied to Mrs C under the agreement by the credit provider - the price 
of it was £9,200 and she agreed to make 41 monthly payments of £124.51 and a 
payment of £4,095.09 to the credit provider for the car to be supplied to her;
Mrs C was made redundant and a complaint was then made to Hodgson Newcastle 
in May 2019 that the car had been mis-sold to her  her representative says that: the 
hire purchase agreement wasnt properly explained to Mrs C; Mrs C thought that the 
agreement was for 36 months; the information about voluntary termination that she 
was given was incorrect; the signature on the statement of demands and needs 
wasnt Mrs Cs and it was dated eight months before the car was supplied to her; and 
she cannot afford to keep the car and doesnt have the funds available to pay the 
negative equity on the car;
Mrs C wasnt satisfied with Hodgson Newcastles response so complained to this 
service but our investigator didnt think that the arguments raised about the demands 
and needs document demonstrated that Hodgson Newcastle made a false statement 
of fact which induced her into entering the agreement and he didnt agree that the 
agreement had been misrepresented to her;
our investigator said that the complaint form supported that a change in 
circumstances meant that the car was no longer affordable for Mrs C but he couldnt 
agree that the agreement had been mis-sold to her;
Mrs C has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman and says that 
she only wanted to keep the car for 18 months so wouldnt have agreed to a term of 
more than 18 months, her complaint was made when she became aware of the cost 
of voluntarily terminating the agreement and wasnt caused by her redundancy as 
she found other work, the demands and needs statement was completed post sale 
and signed on her behalf and the agreement was misrepresented and mis-sold to 
her;
Hodson Newcastle has provided a copy of the pre-contract credit information that 
was prepared for Mrs C and the statement of her demands and needs that it says 
was signed by her before she signed the hire purchase agreement;
immediately above Mrs Cs signature on the agreement it says: This is a Hire 
Purchase Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you 
want to be legally bound by its terms and I consider that the terms on which the car 
was being supplied to Mrs C were clearly set out in the agreement;
the duration of the agreement was specified as 42 months and the agreement 
described the 42 monthly payments that were to be made by Mrs C for the car to be 
supplied to her;
the agreement also set out Mrs Cs right to terminate the agreement which said: You 
have a right to end this Agreement. To do so, you should write to the person you 
make your payments to. They will then be entitled to the return of the Goods and to 
half the total amount payable under the agreement that is £4,600;
Mrs C says that her signature has fraudulently been added to the statement of 
demands and needs  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to support 
that allegation and Hodgson Newcastle says that the date on it was in the form 
month/date/year and that it was completed and signed in December 2017;
Mrs C didnt complain about the agreement being mis-sold to her until May 2019, 
nearly a year and a half after the car had been supplied to her and after shed been 
made redundant  but she says that she found other work and that her complaint 
hasnt been made because of her change in circumstances;
Mrs C signed the agreement and accepted the terms that it contained  I consider 
that it was her responsibility to read the agreement before signing it and, if the 
agreement didnt reflect her understanding of what shed been told by or agreed with 
Hodgson Newcastle, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her not to have 
signed it;
I sympathise with Mrs C for the issues that shes had with the agreement and for her 
redundancy, though its clear from what she says that the redundancy hasnt caused 
her any financial difficulties, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that the agreement was mis-sold or misrepresented to Mrs C or that Hodgson 
Newcastle acted incorrectly in its dealings with her about the agreement; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Hodgson Newcastle to pay any compensation to Mrs C or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 March 2021.
