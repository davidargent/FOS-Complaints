DRN-3031032
The rules about complaining to the ombudsman set out when we can  and cant  look into 
complaints. In my decision, Ive explained what this means for Mr Ss complaint.      
summary and background to complaint
Mr S said Santander UK Plc mis-sold him payment protection insurance (PPI) with a 
personal loan in 2007.
Santander didnt agree we could look at a complaint about how the PPI was sold - because it 
said Mr S had referred the complaint to us too late. 
  
But Santander has offered to pay back the amount of commission and profit share that was 
above 50% of Mr Ss PPI premium. It did this because it didnt tell Mr S about the high level 
of commission and profit share hed pay  which was unfair.
Our adjudicator looked at all of this  but didnt think we could help with Mr Ss complaint 
about how this policy was sold. And they thought Santanders payment was a fair way to 
resolve the complaint
Mr Ss representative disagreed with the adjudicators opinion  they didnt raise any new or 
additional points but repeated the same complaint points and arguments theyd previously 
made. 
The complaint has been passed to me for a decision. 
my findings
I cant look at all the complaints referred to me. The rules applying to this service say that, 
where a business doesnt agree, I cant look at a complaint made more than six years after 
the event being complained about  or (if later) more than three years after the complainant 
was aware, or ought reasonably to have been aware, of cause for complaint. This is Dispute 
Resolution rule 2.8.2R(2)  which can be found online in the Financial Conduct Authoritys 
handbook. And in this case Santander hasnt agreed.  
Mr Ss complaint was made in November 2018. This is more than six years after Santander 
sold the policy to him  in 2007  which is the event hes complaining about here. So I need 
to think about whether the complaint was made within three years of when Mr S should 
reasonably have been aware he had cause to complain. 
Santander says it sent Mr S a letter in March 2009 which alerted him to the possibility 
something might have gone wrong with his policy sale. Given what Mr S is complaining 
about, I think he should reasonably have been aware he had reason to complain when he 
got this letter. I say this because Mr S has said he didnt know he had PPI, meaning it was 
added without his knowledge or consent. But the letter clearly explained that he had 
previously had a PPI policy. Mr S has also complained that he wasnt told about the full cost 
of the policy or about the non pro-rata cancellation terms, both of which are mentioned as 
possible issues in the 2009 letter.
Three years from the letter is March 2012. This means Mr S needed to make his complaint 
about the policy sale by then. As he didnt complain until 2018 his complaint is out of time 
under the rules I have to apply. 
I can still look into complaints made outside the time limits if Im satisfied the failure to 
comply with them was due to exceptional circumstances. But, other than what Ive looked at 
above, Mr S hasnt given any reasons for the delay.
So Im sorry that were unable to help Mr S with his complaint about how this policy was 
sold.
non-disclosure of commission
But I have considered the issue of non-disclosure of commission, including whether the non-
disclosure resulted in an unfair relationship under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  
and if so, what fair compensation would be to remedy that unfairness.
Having done so Ive decided Santander should have disclosed the commission it received 
and that Santanders offer to refund some of the cost of PPI to compensate for the 
unfairness caused is fair. My reasons are set out below.
was there an unfair relationship?
Santander didnt tell Mr S about the high levels of commission and profit share paid in this 
case. So taking into account: 
- The Supreme Court judgment in Plevin1 and the conclusion in that case that the non-
disclosure of commission could lead to an unfair relationship;
- The FCAs rules and guidance for handling complaints about the non-disclosure of 
commission and profit share - introduced in light of the Supreme Court judgment in 
Plevin - which requires a business to presume that the failure to disclose commission 
gave rise to an unfair relationship where the business expected commission and profit 
share to be more than 50% of the cost of the policy; and 
- the likelihood, in my view, that a court would determine that the relationship between 
Santander and Mr S was unfair under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act because 
Santander didnt tell him about the high levels of commission and profit share in this 
case 
I dont think Santander acted fairly and reasonably in its dealings with Mr S because it failed 
to disclose the high commission and profit share.
redress to remedy that unfair relationship
Im now required to consider what is fair compensation in all the circumstances to remedy 
the unfairness I have identified.
1 Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance Limited [2014] UKSC 61 in which the Supreme Court concluded 
that the non-disclosure of commission could lead to an unfair relationshipMr Ss representative has made a number of representations about this part of the complaint 
including the impact of the Plevin judgment and sections 140A and 140B of the Consumer 
Credit Act on his complaint.
In summary they have said Mr S should get back all the money he paid for the policy 
because: Santander failed to tell Mr S about the high commission and profit-share rates 
paid, the low claims ratio and the restrictions and exclusions on cover. Because they say 
that meant the policy was poor value, I should find that Mr S wouldnt have taken out the 
policy had he known about the level of commission and he should receive a refund of all the 
premiums he paid.
But I dont agree. Im mindful of the following:
- The Supreme Court judgment in Plevin made no specific finding about whether the 
consumer in that case would or would not have bought the PPI policy had the 
commission been disclosed; 
- A court would have a range of powers available under section 140 B to remedy the 
unfairness caused by the non-disclosure of commission  it does not follow that a 
court would automatically order a return of all the premiums paid or conclude that a 
consumer would not have purchased the policy had the commission been disclosed; 
and
- The FCA considered the matter and decided that it wouldnt be appropriate to merge 
the considerations about undisclosed commission in the existing rules and guidance 
about mis-selling (hence the two-step approach for firms handling PPI complaints) 
and that the impact of any undisclosed commission and any remedy caused by it 
should be considered at step 2.
Taking into account relevant law and the FCAs rules and guidance, my role as an 
ombudsman in this case is to determine what redress, if any, would represent fair 
compensation for Mr S in order to remedy the unfairness caused by Santander not 
disclosing the high level of commission to him before he purchased the policy.
So, taking into account: 
- The FCAs guidance usually requires a business to refund the amounts paid by the 
consumer in commission and profit share above 50% of the policys cost, plus interest in 
order to remedy the unfairness caused by the failure to disclose the level of commission;
- refunding some of the money paid for the PPI policy in this way is an order which, in my 
view a court could, in the exercise of its discretion, make under section 140B of the 
Consumer Credit Act in order to remedy any unfairness; and
- I am not, as Mr Ss representative suggests, driven to conclude that he wouldnt have 
purchased the policy but for Santanders failure to disclose the level of commission for 
the reasons Ive given above.
I think it was fair for Santander to calculate compensation in line with the FCAs guidance 
and return some of the money Mr S paid for his PPI policy - I consider this fairly removes the 
source of the unfairness. 
So I consider that Santanders offer of payment of an amount equivalent to the commission 
and profit share paid in excess of 50% of the policy costs (plus associated interest where 
applicable) in line with the FCAs guidance to firms is fair in all the circumstances.my decision
Im unable to consider Mr Ss complaint about how his policy was sold, because it was 
referred to us too late  and Im not persuaded the failure to comply with the time limits was 
because of exceptional circumstances.
But because of the non-disclosure of commission and profit share, Ive decided that 
Santander UK Plc should pay Mr S an amount equivalent to the commission and profit share 
paid in excess of 50% of the policy cost (plus associated interest where applicable) if it 
hasnt already done so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision about the commission aspect of the complaint before 7 January 2022.
