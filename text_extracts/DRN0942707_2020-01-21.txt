K821x#15about the complaint
Mr W complained  to Portafina LLP about  delays in the transfer of his defined benefit  pension 
scheme benefits to an annuity provider. He said delays resulted in the transfer value 
reducing by more than £4,000.
background
Portafina wrote to the administrators of Mr Ws previous  employers pension  scheme (the 
Scheme) in September 2013 requesting information  about his pension.  The Scheme 
responded on 17 September 2013,  providing information including  a cash equivalent  transfer 
value (CETV) of £32,555.70, which was guaranteed until 16 December 2013.
Portafina requested  information from the Scheme  by email on 26 September  2013. The 
scheme replied on 4 October 2013.
Portafina called the Scheme on 15 October  2013 chasing for the information. The Scheme 
replied on 22 October  2013 reiterating the information they sent on 4 October 2013.
On 13 November 2013 a pension transfer  analysis was completed.  This stated to match  the 
occupational pension scheme  benefits  at retirement  a personal pension  required an 
estimated annual investment return (critical yield) of 28.29%.
Portafina called the Scheme on 14 November  2013 requesting an early retirement quotation. 
The Scheme replied  to Portafina on 21 November 2013 and said early retirement was not 
currently available.
On 18 December 2013 Portafina  called  the Scheme chasing for an early retirement 
quotation. On the same  day they wrote to Mr W with details of the options available  to him 
and asking for a call back to discuss them further.
Portafina confirmed  on 7 January 2014  that a financial  review meeting would be held with 
Mr W on 17 January  2014.
Portafina called the Scheme on 20 January 2014 chasing their request of 
14 November 2013 for an early retirement  quotation.
On the same  day Portafina sent Mr W a medical  questionnaire,  which was completed  and 
received back on 24 January 2014. Portafina again  chased the Scheme for the early  
retirement quotation. The following day Portafina requested  enhanced  annuity illustrations 
from a number of providers.
Portafina chased the Scheme on 25 January  and 3 February 2014 for the early  retirement  
quotation. The Scheme  replied on 18 February 2014, including a copy  of their earlier letter,  
reiterating early retirement  was not available.
On 12 March 2014 Portafina wrote  to Mr W explaining  the critical yield for his pension  
transfer was 28.29% and it would be against their recommendation  to transfer it. Mr W would 
need to sign an insistent client declaration if he wanted to proceed.
Ref: DRN09427072An adviser confirmed  on 17 March 2014 that the completed declarations  had been returned  
and issued a recommendation report on 19 March 2014. Mr W completed and returned the 
requested paperwork  which  was then forwarded  to LV on 24 March 2014.
LV sent the transfer request to the Scheme on 28 March 2014. The Scheme replied on 
22 May 2014 saying  they required the original benefit  certificate  / letter of entitlement.  If that 
was no longer available, then they required a lost declaration  certificate and Mr Ws original 
birth certificate.
Portafina sent the completed lost declaration certificate and Mr Ws birth certificate to the 
Scheme on 12 June  2014. The Scheme replied on 24 June 2014  and explained the original 
guaranteed transfer value had expired and the new calculation  resulted in a transfer value of 
£28,420.36.
On 24 June 2014, after receiving all the required documentation, the Scheme provided  an 
updated CETV of £28,420.36. On 4 July 2014, a lump sum payment of £7,105.09 was made 
and a yearly income  started of £1,252 paid monthly.
Mr W complained  to both Portafina  and the Scheme about the delay in transferring his 
pension and the resulting  reduction in the transfer value. Portafina said they had actively 
chased the Scheme for outstanding information.
One of our adjudicators investigated the complaint. He thought it should be upheld.  He said 
there had been  numerous  errors  which caused delays. He thought without those errors the 
transfer request  could  have been sent to the Scheme  by 16 December 2013.  This would 
have meant  Mr W benefitting from the higher CETV.
Portafina disagreed,  they acknowledged that the annuity might have been set up earlier,  but 
did not think the transfer request would  have been  sent to the Scheme by 
16 December 2013.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
adjudicator that the complaint should  be upheld and for the same reasons.
Mr W is not complaining about the advice to transfer  his defined pension  benefits. I am only 
considering the delay  in transferring his benefits  and the loss caused  by the drop in the 
CETV.
Portafina were involved  from the outset  in arranging the transfer of Mr Ws defined  pension 
benefits. They were  aware of the deadline to preserve the quoted  CETV  and what the 
Scheme required for the transfer to be made.
Portafina requested  information from the Scheme  on 26 September  2013 and received a 
reply on 4 October 2013. However, Portafina chased the Scheme for the same information.  
On 14 November 2013, Portafina  requested an early  retirement  illustration from the Scheme. 
This was provided one week later,  but Portafina continued  to chase for the illustration into 
February 2014. In my view, this information should  have been  requested  in September  2013.
Ref: DRN09427073Portafina chased for information they had already received. They  should  have  had all the 
information they required by mid-October. This would have provided two months  for 
Portafina to research annuity options for Mr W, formulate their advice and send his transfer  
request to the new provider. In my view,  this should have been achievable.
I note that when Portafina sent the transfer request to the new provider on 24 March 2014, 
not all of the required paperwork was sent. This caused a substantial delay in finalising the 
transfer and setting up the annuity.
In my view, Portafina should have requested all of the information they required in 
September 2013. This should have included the early  retirement  quotation. If Portafina had 
done that and acted  upon the responses that were received, the paperwork should have 
been with the Scheme  before 16 December 2013. An illustration  issued by the annuity  
provider quoted a four week period to arrange  a new plan.  Mr Ws annuity would have been 
arranged four weeks after the transfer  instruction was sent to the Scheme. This would have 
been funded with the original CETV of £32,555.70.
fair compensation
My aim is to put Mr W in the position  he would now be in, if Portafina had not caused  delays 
to the transfer  of his pension benefits. This means that he would have received the CETV of 
£32,555.70. He would  have received  a higher tax free cash  sum and monthly  income. In my 
view, these should have been  in payment by 13 January 2014.
To calculate the past loss or gain, Portafina  must:
A. work out the total that Mr W has actually received to date, based  on the CETV of 
£28,420.36  this will be a combination of the tax-free lump  sum and the net of tax annuity 
payments.
B. work out the total that the Mr W would  have received to date had the CETV of £32,555.70 
been paid and the benefits including the annuity  purchase been made on 13 January 2014  
again, this will be a combination of the tax free lump sum and the net of tax annuity 
payments.
C. if B is greater than A, Mr W has suffered a past loss. The loss should  be paid to Mr W in 
addition to interest at 8% simple from the date of payment to the date of settlement.
The interest element  may  be subject to income tax. Portafina should provide a certificate to 
Mr W for any tax deducted.
To calculate the future loss or gain, Portafina  must:
D. work out the cost now of replacing the annuity in payment using  Mr Ws current  age.
E. work out the cost now of buying  the annuity  Mr W could  be receiving had it not been  
delayed, again  using Mr Ws current age.
If E is greater than D, Mr W will suffer a future loss.
Ref: DRN09427074F. Portafina should arrange an additional annuity to make good the future at loss. If that is 
not possible the payment should be made to Mr W as a cash sum. But, the annuity  income  
would have been subject to income tax. The payment should be reduced to allow for the tax 
Mr W would  pay in retirement,  which  I will assume  will be basic rate tax at 20% unless  
evidence is produced to the contrary.
The total redress is C + F.
Mr W has also been caused some  distress and inconvenience by the delay in arranging his 
pension and the drop in the CETV. Portafina  should  also make a payment to him of £250.
my decision
I uphold the complaint. My decision is that Portafina LLP should pay the amount calculated  
as set out above.
Portafina LLP should provide details  of its calculation to Mr W in a clear,  simple format.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr W either  to 
accept or reject my decision  before  21 February  2020.
