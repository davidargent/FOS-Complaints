The complaint
Ms M complains that Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax (Halifax) is refusing to refund 
her the amount she lost as the result of a scam. 
Ms M is being represented by a third party. To keep things simple, I will refer to Ms M 
throughout my decision.
What happened
The background of this complaint is well known to all parties, so I wont repeat what 
happened in detail.
Ms M was interested in investing and found an Instagram account of an individual well 
known for his experience in cryptocurrency investment. Unknown to Ms M the account was 
not the well-known individual but instead a fake account impersonating him. I will call this 
person X.
X posted an opportunity on the account for X to invest on behalf of individuals in return for a 
commission on the profits that were made. Ms M was convinced that the Instagram account 
was legitimate by the number of followers it had and the posts that X was putting up, so she 
contacted X. Before long Ms M and X were communicating via WhatsApp.
X persuaded Ms M to set up a trading account on its platform and transfer funds to the 
account via the legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges Blaockchain and Moonpay. Ms M was 
able to see the deposits she was making in her trading account and was happy with the 
returns she was making.
Although after Ms M made her final payment to X, X stopped responding to messages and 
Ms M was unable to contact him. Ms M realised she had fallen victim to a scam and has 
been unable to recover the money she paid X.
Ms M made the following payments to X Via Blackchain and Moonpay using her debit card:
1. 15 June 2022 - £550 - Blockchain
2. 16 June 2022 - £550 - Moonpay
3. 17 June 2022 - £500 - Moonpay
4. 20 June 2022 - £1,000 - Moonpay
5. 20 June 2022 - £500 - Moonpay
6. 20 June 2022 - £1,000 - Moonpay
7. 21 June 2022 - £2,000 - Moonpay
8. 21 June 2022 - £500 - Moonpay
9. 22 June 2022 - £2,000 - Moonpay
10. 22 June 2022 - £2,000 - Moonpay
11. 22 June 2022 - £2,000 - Moonpay
12. 23 June 2022 - £1,000 - Moonpay
13. 23 June 2022 - £2,000 - Moonpay
14. 27 June 2022 - £700 - Moonpay
15. 27 June 2022 - £3,000 - Moonpay
16. 27 June 2022 - £600 - Moonpay
17. 27 June 2022 - £1,000 - Moonpay
18. 29 June 2022 - £4,000 - Moonpay
Our Investigator considered Ms Ms complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. Ms M 
disagreed she said Halifax should have done more to protect her from the scam.
As Ms M disagreed this complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Halifax was unable to process a chargeback for the payments Ms M made in relation to this 
scam to Blockchain and Moonpay.
The chargeback scheme is a voluntary scheme set up to resolve card payment disputes
between merchants and cardholders. The card scheme operator ultimately helps settle 
disputes that cant be resolved between the merchant and the cardholder.
Such arbitration is subject to the rules of the scheme, meaning there are only limited
grounds and limited forms of evidence that will be accepted for a chargeback to be
considered valid, and potentially succeed. Time limits also apply.
Ms M was dealing with X, which was the person that instigated the scam. But Ms M didnt 
make the debit card payments to X directly, she paid separate cryptocurrency exchanges 
(Blockchain and Moonpay). This is important because Halifax was only able to process 
chargeback claims against the merchants she paid (Blockchain and Moonpay), not another 
party (such as X).
The service provided by Blockchain and Moonpay would have been to convert or facilitate 
conversion of Ms Ms payments into cryptocurrency. Therefore, Blockchain and Moonpay 
provided the service that was requested; that being the purchase of the cryptocurrency.
The fact that the cryptocurrency was later transferred elsewhere  to the scammer  doesnt
give rise to a valid chargeback claim against the merchant Ms M paid. As Blockchain and 
Moonpay provided the requested service to Ms M any chargeback attempt would likely fail.
Ms M has accepted she authorised the payments she made to Blockchain and Moonpay, so 
the starting point here is that Ms M is responsible. However, banks and other Payment 
Services Providers (PSPs) do have a duty to protect against the risk of financial loss due to 
fraud and/or to undertake due diligence on large transactions to guard against money 
laundering.
The question here is whether Halifax should have been aware of the scam and stepped in to 
ask Ms M meaningful questions about them, and had Halifax stepped in, would it have 
prevented the scam from taking place.
All the payments Ms M made were for relatively low amounts so although they were to a new 
payee to start off with, I wouldnt necessarily have expected Halifaxs fraud prevention 
systems to have been triggered, giving Halifax reason to speak with Ms M.
However, Halifaxs fraud prevention systems were triggered after Ms M made the first payment to Blockchain on 15 June 2022.Ms M tried to make further payments after this, but 
her account was blocked by Halifax, prompting Ms M to call in.
Halifax has sent us a copy of this call recording. Ms M had called in as she was unable to 
make payments using her card. She confirms it is her first-time using the websites and that 
her friends had used the exchanges before, so they were safe.
Ms M also confirms no ones doing the payments for her and that no one had told her to 
make the payments. 
I dont think the responses Ms M gave to Halifaxs questions were accurate. X had asked Ms 
M to make payments to him via the exchanges so that he could trade on her behalf. Had Ms 
M given a more accurate answer to this question asked by Halifax I think its likely the scam 
could have been uncovered. 
The answers Ms M gave to Halifax led Halifax to believe the payments Ms M was making 
were legitimate and not part of a scam. So, I dont think it would reasonably have been 
aware a scam was taking place or have been able to prevent it.
Halifax is not responsible for Ms Ms loss and does not have to refund any of the payments 
she made.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint,
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 April 2023.
