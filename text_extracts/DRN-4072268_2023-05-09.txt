The complaint
Mr W complains that NewDay Ltd pursued him for a debt taken out fraudulently in his name. 
And that this affected his credit score which impacted his credit facilities with other lenders.
What happened
The background to this complaint is well known to both parties and so Ill only refer to some 
key events here.
In September 2021 NewDay received an application for credit in Mr Ws name that was used 
make a £999 purchase. A further purchase of £1,349 was attempted on 30 September 2021 
but refunded the same day. The credit account was reviewed by NewDays fraud team and 
they wrote a letter to Mr W which said:
We have recently received an application for credit in your name, therefore would 
you please contact us on [telephone number] as soon as possible between the hours 
of 9am and 5pm Monday to Friday, If you confirm you have made the application, it 
may be a little delayed while we confirm your identity...
NewDay didnt receive a response to this letter. NewDay then sent monthly statements to 
Mr W pursuing him for the amount owed, along with a default notice letter on 25 December 
2021. Mr W wrote to NewDay on 11 January 2022 explaining hed received letters saying he 
held an account with them that had been suspended, and which was in arrears. Mr W 
confirmed he hadnt opened an account with NewDay, nor did he know of any such amount 
that he owed to anyone. 
Mr W contacted the Financial Ombudsman in late February 2022 as NewDay hadnt 
responded to his letter and were still pursuing him for the debt. A complaint was raised to 
NewDay about the matter with Mr W explaining that, due to this issue, two credit card 
providers had reduced his borrowing facilities from £10,000 to about £550. Mr W wanted 
NewDay to confirm he had no debt with them and to retract their reporting to his credit 
report. 
NewDay responded to the complaint on 5 April 2022. They didnt uphold it as they said 
theyd followed correct business process. And, under the How I came to my decision 
section, they said:
Thank you for contacting us with your concerns. Please be advised that due to the 
status of the account, I cannot address your concerns.
Please contact our Fraud Team on [telephone number]  
Mr W remained dissatisfied as he considered NewDay had failed to explain the origin of this 
debt, or evidence the amount allegedly owed was valid. And so, his complaint was 
considered by one of our Investigators. NewDay then confirmed, after speaking with Mr W in 
February 2023, that they wouldnt be holding him liable for the account as it was opened 
fraudulently. And that they would be removing all details of the account from Mr Ws credit 
report. 
Our Investigator thought this was reasonable but that NewDay should also pay Mr W £150 
compensation for the distress hed experienced in dealing with the matter. In short, she said:
NewDay accepted the application in good faith and carried out checks before 
approving the account. They also wrote to Mr W in September 2021 asking him to 
contact them about the application. Had Mr W done so, the matter couldve been 
resolved sooner.
She considered Mr W says he doesnt recall receiving NewDays September 2021 
letter but, if he did, he may have thrown it away due to suspecting it as spam mail. 
And she thought this was understandable given the letter didnt say credit hadnt 
been agreed, but rather only a recent application had been received.
She didnt think NewDays response to Mr Ws complaint made the importance of 
calling them  so they could investigate the fraud  clear. She thought NewDay 
couldve done more to highlight they couldnt carry out an investigation unless 
Mr W called them.
Both Mr W and NewDay disagreed with our Investigator and so the matter has been passed 
to me to decide. 
Mr W, in short, has said:
In reference to the Investigators claim the matter couldve been resolved sooner had 
he contacted NewDay, this doesnt explain or excuse the aggressive stance NewDay 
took. 
NewDays lack of response to his complaint also cannot be construed as an 
affirmation. And he was unable to contact NewDay without registering on their 
website or using a telephone number thats associated with fraud warnings. 
When he did get in touch with NewDay, by letter in January 2022, they threatened 
him with a bad credit report. This mustve been due to malice opposed to 
carelessness. 
The £150 compensation would be barely adequate for the time he has wasted with 
this matter. It also doesnt compensate him for the distress hes suffered or the loss 
of close to £10,000 of credit.
He would accept £5,300 of compensation  comprising of £5,000 for the loss of credit 
and £500 for the distress and inconvenience. 
NewDay, in short, has said:
They didnt think compensation was warranted as they wrote to Mr W in September 
2021 asking for him to contact them. Mr W didnt however speak to them until 
February 2023 when their Fraud Team called him. There were prior attempts to 
speak with Mr W but he explained he wasnt comfortable discussing the matter and 
that hed call them back. They had no control over whether Mr W threw away the September 2021 letter they 
sent. But this letter made it clear that if Mr W had made a genuine application, it may 
be delayed while they confirm his identity. As Mr W hadnt made the application, they 
wouldve expected him to have contacted them as requested. 
They issued their letter of September 2021 to inform Mr W about what happened so 
they could resolve it. And so, they acted fairly, reasonably and efficiently after 
identifying the account as fraudulent.
Their final response letter couldnt go into any details due to the accounts status 
since they couldnt speak to Mr W before issuing it. This is why they requested Mr W 
speak to their Fraud Team, and theyre satisfied their request for him to contact them 
within their final response letter suits the circumstances at the time. And Mr W 
wouldve been aware of the required information they needed upon contacting them. 
They appreciate Mr W was given a telephone number for NewDay that wasnt active. 
But, having listened to a call between their agent and Mr W, they believe Mr W may 
have incorrectly recorded another telephone number that he attempted (as two digits 
were in the wrong order their agent provided).
The delay in the fraud being resolved is due to Mr W. They provided the relevant 
contact details to Mr W so he could speak to them  including within their final 
response letter of 5 April 2022. 
Mr W had at least two valid telephone numbers to contact them to speak about the 
fraud. 
They must issue regulatory letters and report accurate information to credit reference 
agencies. And until Mr W contacted them they had to treat the account as genuine  
which meant they reported to the credit references agencies as usual. Once they 
found Mr W wasnt liable, the account was removed from his credit report. 
The first contact to NewDay about the fraudulent account came from the Financial 
Ombudsman in March 2022. They didnt receive any letter from Mr W in January 
2022, which is why they didnt respond. 
Theyre sorry Mr W has had his credit facilities lowered with other lenders. But since 
theyve confirmed he isnt liable and removed the account from Mr Ws credit report, 
they hope these lenders will reinstate any previous limits. 
They accept Mr W will have experienced trouble and upset but this was due to the 
fraudsters actions. They cannot see where theyve made any failings in dealing with 
this fraudulent case. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate Mr W has been impacted by the debt taken out fraudulently in his name with 
NewDay. And I dont underestimate the trouble and upset this may have caused. But, for 
similar reasons as our Investigator, I think £150 is a fair amount of compensation here. Ill 
explain why.
NewDay has accepted the account was opened fraudulently in Mr Ws name. I havent seen 
anything to show NewDay were at fault for this happening  as they accepted the application 
in good faith with the details submitted matching those of Mr W. Nevertheless, NewDay has 
confirmed Mr W isnt liable for the debt and removed the account from his credit report. I 
think this is fair and in line with what Id expect, so I dont intend to consider this aspect of 
the complaint further. Instead, Ill focus on whether NewDays consideration and handling of 
the fraud claim was reasonable. The second attempted purchase of £1,349 prompted NewDay to have concerns the account 
had been applied for fraudulently. So, they wrote to Mr W on 30 September 2021 and 
explained theyd received a recent application for credit in his name and requested he 
contacted them as soon as possible. I think this was reasonable in the circumstances. 
Mr W says he cant recall receiving this letter but, if he did, he likely threw it away due to 
suspecting it was spam (as he hadnt made any such application). I cant be certain whether 
this letter was received or not. But given it was correctly addressed and most mail is 
successfully delivered, and he received future correspondence from NewDay, I think its 
likely Mr W did receive it. And while I appreciate Mr W may have questioned the legitimacy 
of the letter, I dont think I can hold NewDay responsible if Mr W disposed of it. I think they 
acted appropriately by sending the letter and asking Mr W to contact them.
Mr W did however write to NewDay in January 2022, following the letters he received 
regarding the debt, to inform them he hadnt opened an account or owe any such amount. 
NewDay say they didnt receive this letter, which is why they didnt respond. But Mr W has 
provided evidence to show this letter was sent by recorded delivery and that it was signed 
for. While NewDay say otherwise, Im satisfied  given it was correctly addressed and signed 
for  that it was received by them. It follows that I think NewDay failed to respond to Mr Ws 
January 2022 letter. 
NewDay subsequently sent their final response to Mr Ws complaint in April 2022. They said 
they couldnt address Mr Ws concerns due to the status of the account. But asked Mr W to 
contact their Fraud Team by telephone. NewDay has since explained that their final 
response couldnt go into detail due to them not being able to speak to Mr W, to carry out 
their investigation, beforehand.
I accept NewDays final response letter does ask Mr W to contact them. However, I agree 
with our Investigator that it ought to have been clearer as to why this was necessary. In 
short, it wouldve been reasonable for NewDay to have explained that they needed to speak 
with Mr W to consider his fraud claim. Im not persuaded NewDays letter makes this 
sufficiently clear. I also dont think rejecting a complaint because business process had been 
correctly followed, as well as being unable to address Mr Ws concerns due to the status of 
the account, gave an adequate explanation or response to the complaint that wouldve 
allowed Mr W to understand the situation either. Id further add that, if NewDay needed to 
speak to Mr W to consider the fraud claim and appropriately respond to his complaint, it 
wouldve been reasonable for NewDay to have written to Mr W explaining this before 
sending their final response. I cant see that this happened.
I have however taken into consideration that NewDay did attempt to contact Mr W by 
telephone prior to the conversation of February 2023. But, as I understand, Mr W didnt feel 
comfortable talking to them and would call them back. Mr W has however said the telephone 
numbers he attempted didnt work. NewDay has since confirmed that one of the telephone 
numbers was indeed inactive and, while the other was active, it seems from the conversation 
in which their agent provided the telephone number Mr W may have recorded it down 
incorrectly. 
Although Mr W had difficulties trying to contact NewDay by telephone, I dont think I can 
reasonably contribute this solely to NewDay. This is because, although one inactive 
telephone number was provided, Im satisfied NewDay gave Mr W telephone numbers that 
did work  such as within the monthly account statements and the final response letter. So, I 
dont think Mr W had to register on NewDays website to call them. The charges for these 
telephone numbers were also shown to be at, or no more than, standard national rate. So, 
while I appreciate Mr W has raised concerns about the cost of making such calls, these werent premium telephone numbers. And although Mr W found reviews online suggesting 
one of the telephone numbers was associated with fraud, NewDay provided their genuine 
telephone numbers and cannot control online reviews posted on independent websites. 
I therefore consider that both parties contributed to the length of time it took for the fraud to 
be dealt with. This is because, although I consider NewDay couldve communicated more 
clearly and proactively with Mr W, I likewise think Mr W couldve done more to resolve the 
situation himself  specifically by contacting NewDay by telephone as they requested before 
February 2023. 
Im aware Mr W found NewDays correspondence about the debt to be aggressive and 
threatening. Although I understand the concern receiving such letters wouldve caused 
Mr W, NewDay were required to provide such warnings  highlighting the consequences of 
not repaying the amount owed  in line with their regulatory obligations. So, I dont think 
NewDay acted inappropriately in this respect.  
On a final note, I understand Mr Ws credit score was impacted due to the fraudulent 
opening of the account. This, in turn, led to his borrowing limits with other lenders reducing. 
And Mr W feels £5,000 compensation would be a fair amount to recognise the credit facility 
hes lost. Ive considered this but I dont think it would be fair. This is because Mr W hasnt 
suffered a financial loss but rather, his ability to borrow was reduced. Given however that his 
credit report has since been corrected, Mr W is free to contact these lenders  or others  to 
enquire about his credit limits being increased. 
Putting things right
Taking everything into consideration, I think NewDay has taken appropriate steps to correct 
the fraudulent account being opened. But I do think they couldve handled the matter better 
and communicated with Mr W more clearly and proactively. For this reason, I think 
compensation is warranted for the trouble and upset caused. After careful consideration, I 
think £150 is a reasonable amount to recognise this.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I direct NewDay Ltd to pay £150 to Mr W. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 June 2023.
