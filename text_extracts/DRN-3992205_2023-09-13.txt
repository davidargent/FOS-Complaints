The complaint
Mr G complains that National Westminster Bank Plc would not refund money he paid to 
fraudsters.
What happened
In December 2022 Mr G tried to purchase a product online, but he never received it, and he 
realised he had been duped by scammers. Since he had made the purchase in three 
payments using his NatWest debit card, he naturally asked NatWest to refund him.
NatWest accepted that Mr G had been the victim of a scam. But it said it was not obliged to 
refund him, because he had not paid the scammers directly. Instead, he had made his 
payments via a third party money remittance service. The third party had provided him with 
the service he had requested  namely, forwarding his money on to the intended recipient  
and so NatWest declined his claim for a refund.
Mr G brought this complaint to our service, but our investigator did not uphold it. She said 
NatWest had not been negligent in preventing the payments being made in the first place, 
nor did NatWest have to refund Mr G once the fraud had come to light.
Mr G did not accept that answer, and so his complaint was referred for an ombudsmans 
decision. (That was in February; I would like to apologise to both parties for how long it has 
taken for this case to be assigned to an ombudsman.)
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I do not uphold it, for broadly the same reasons as my colleague. I will 
explain why.
I was sorry to read about how Mr G was deceived. That must have been unpleasant for him, 
and he has lost over Â£500. However, my role in this case is to consider whether NatWest 
has done anything wrong, not whether any third party has.
NatWest has systems in place to detect payments which look suspicious and might be 
fraudulent. Unfortunately they did not pick up on Mr Gs payments in this instance, because 
they did not look out of the ordinary, and they were not made directly to the fraudster but to a 
reputable financial institution. I dont think I can fault NatWest here.
Once Mr G had discovered the fraud and reported it to NatWest, the bank looked into it from 
two angles: its fraud team investigated it as a series of fraudulent transactions, and the bank 
also considered whether it could raise a chargeback dispute as well. However, both of these 
potential remedies were frustrated by the fact that Mr G had made his payments via a third 
party. Since that third party did what it was supposed to do, NatWest had no remedy against 
it under the chargeback rules. And the chargeback rules do not allow NatWest to pursue a 
refund from a recipient of the money who is one step further down the line from the first 
recipient, so NatWest could not raise a chargeback claim against the fraudster either.
For a similar reason  Mr G had not paid the fraudster directly, but had only paid a money 
remittance service and told it to forward his money on  NatWests fraud team decided that it 
was not responsible for what had happened. Taking into account my finding that I dont think 
NatWest erred in not stopping these payments at the time, I think that NatWests stance was 
reasonable.
My final decision
So my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 October 2023. But as this decision is final, we will not be able to 
reconsider it.
