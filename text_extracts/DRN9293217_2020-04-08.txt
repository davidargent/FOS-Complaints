K821x#15complaint
Mr A has complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called  Elevate  
Credit International  Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr A says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Mr A took out 10 instalment loans  from Sunny between June 2016 and 
May 2017. Ive enclosed  a summary of Mr As borrowing with Sunny, based  on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan number  5 onwards. Sunny  made an offer to settle the complaint but 
this wasnt agreed to by Mr A. Ive been  asked  to make an ombudsmans  final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice, on our website. Ive followed this approach when  thinking  about Mr As 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr A could 
repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These  checks  ought to have  taken 
into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total repayment  
amounts and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr A could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Ref: DRN92932172Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr A could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr A including assessing his income,  expenditure and creditworthiness. It says that at the 
time all this information showed  that he would be able to make the loan repayments he was 
committing to. Ive thought about this and also looked at the overall pattern of lending  history 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans to Mr A. 
Ive taken account of what  Ive said above,  about the length of the lending relationship, and 
applied it to the circumstances of loans  1  4 in this case. And I dont think its clear  enough  
that what Sunny would have would have seen, from its checks, suggested loans 1  4 were  
either unaffordable for Mr A or that the information from the checks it carried out undermined 
the income or outgoings Mr A had himself declared.  
I accept that Mr A may have already been finding managing his money quite difficult  at this 
point. However, theres no clear  record that the type or depth of credit checks  carried  out at 
that time would have  exposed these issues. So Im afraid I dont  agree  that Sunny knew  its 
lending was unsustainable for loans  1 - 4. I therefore dont uphold this part of the complaint.
However, I think from the point of loan number 5, the situation was different and the types of 
checks Sunny ought to have carried out should  have been much more comprehensive and 
searching. Thats because by that point  hed been  borrowing  quite rapidly and he was 
applying for this loan directly after settling loan 4. But at this point he also still had 
outstanding balances with the previous  Sunny loans  hed taken out (numbers 2 and 3) which 
I think shows there was an obvious financial risk emerging. I recognise that the amounts 
being lent were  relatively moderate sums,  but they were also nevertheless  increasing by the 
time we get to loan 5, which was double  the amount of loan 4.
Also, had Sunny carried out more  diligent financial  checking,  it would  have seen that as well 
as the Sunny loans, Mr A was borrowing  from another short-term lender at the same  time. 
He was therefore significantly indebted. Our experience of short-term lending  tells us that 
consumers who have  difficulty managing their money  in this way are less likely to be able to 
sustainably repay  a loan. With this information, I dont think  Sunny ought  to have lent him the 
money for the loan 5. I dont  think  it was responsible to do so.
In addition to the above,  from the point of loan 6 onwards,  there was an additional and clear 
pattern of repeated lending evident  in my view. And there was an obvious dependency on 
high-interest, short-term  lending evidenced by this, Mr As sixth loan in 7 months.  
So Im also upholding  Mr As complaint in respect of loans 6 -10 as Sunny repeatedly lent to 
Mr A in an unsustainable manner because:
 
Ref: DRN92932173these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use, over an extended time period; 
and
the length of time over which Mr A borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right
In order to put things  right for Mr A, Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr A paid on loans 5 -10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loans 9 and 10 and treat any 
payments Mr A made towards  these  loan as payments towards the capital;
if reworking Mr As loans 9 and 10 accounts  as Ive directed results  in Mr A effectively 
having made payments above  the original capital borrowed, then Sunny should 
refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated  on the overpayments,  
from the date the overpayments would  have arisen, to the date of settlement.  
If reworking Mr As loans 9 and 10 accounts  leaves  an amount of capital still to be 
paid, then Sunny can use the total refund for any other outstanding loans to offset 
this. And if there is still an outstanding  capital balance then I would remind Sunny 
that it should take a sympathetic view when  seeking to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with Mr A for the remaining  capital;
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr As credit file in relation to loan 5
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 - 10 should be completely 
removed from Mr As credit file.
If any of the debts were sold then Sunny  must attempt buy back  the debt or 
otherwise ensure  the above is strictly complied with
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr A a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I partially uphold  Mr As complaint and direct  Elevate  Credit  International Limited  to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 May 2020.
