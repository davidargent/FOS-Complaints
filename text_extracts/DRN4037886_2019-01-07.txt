Miss T complains National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly  registered  a default on her credit  
file. As a result, shes been  declined for a mortgage.  
background 
The background to this complaint, and my initial conclusions, were set out in my provisional 
decision dated 28 November 2018  a copy of which is attached and forms part of this final 
decision. 
In my provisional decision I explained  why I thought this complaint should be upheld  in part 
and what should  happen to resolve  the complaint. I invited both parties to send any 
additional evidence  or comments they wished to make.  
Miss T responded and confirmed she accepted my decision. 
NatWest responded  and reiterated that as a small balance of £0.63 remained outstanding 
until 2018 it doesnt agree  that amending the credit file to reflect the default balance as being 
repaid in November 2015  is accurate. NatWest hasnt accepted the provisional  decision. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  While I appreciate NatWest doesnt 
accept, its not provided any new information or raised any new points in response  to my 
provisional decision. 
I understand NatWests  concerned that it should be reporting accurate information to the 
credit reference agencies. But as Ive explained in my provisional  decision, its not done that 
to date as its still reporting the full outstanding default balance  when only £0.63  has 
remained unpaid since November 2015. And I still think NatWest  shouldve done more  to let 
Miss T know she only had £0.63  outstanding after she cleared the rest of the money  she 
owed. 
Having carefully considered NatWests response, Ive not been persuaded to change my 
provisional decision to uphold Miss Ts complaint  in part. NatWest should arrange  the 
following settlement: 
-Amend Miss Ts credit file to show the default balance  was satisfied in 
November 2015
-Pay Miss T £100 for the trouble and upset  caused by failing to treat her fairly in 
November 2015. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given above,  and in my provisional decision, I uphold this complaint in 
part and direct National Westminster Bank  Plc to settle in line with the above instructions.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 February  2019.

complaint
Miss T complains National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly registered a default  on her credit
file. As a result, shes been  declined for a mortgage.
Background
Miss T had a NatWest current account with an overdraft of £400. She arranged to switch her
account to another bank  in 2014 but didnt  repay the overdraft balance with NatWest.
NatWest wrote to Miss T about the outstanding balance but Miss T says its letters werent
received. NatWest applied a default of £100.64 in October 2014.
Ref: DRN40378863In November 2015 Miss T made  a payment of £100.01 to the outstanding balance. That left
£0.63 outstanding.
Miss T applied  for a mortgage  earlier this year but it was declined. She went  on to look at her
credit file and says this is the first time she was aware  of having a default. She complained
to NatWest and it agreed to waive the £0.63 balance  and mark the default balance as
satisfied.
But Miss T doesnt agree  that reporting the default is fair so she referred  her complaint  to
this service. An investigator looked at whatd happened  but didnt  recommend NatWest take
any further action. As Miss T remains unhappy the complaints been passed to me to make  a
decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
From the information available, there are several issues to deal with here. Miss T says she
didnt know about the outstanding  balance  and didnt receive NatWests  letters about the
default. Miss Ts concerned about the impact  of NatWests default  on her chances of getting
a mortgage.
Ill start by looking at whether NatWest acted  fairly  when it defaulted Miss Ts current
account. I know this will be disappointing to Miss T but Ive not found  any evidence  that the
default was unfairly applied. Ill explain why.
Miss T says she switched bank account in 2014 and its clear she stopped using her
NatWest account.  But the last payment received into the account was £200 in June 2014.
And that left a balance of £100.80 to pay. When NatWest was in the process of defaulting
the account it used £0.16 Miss T had in a savings  account  to bring the outstanding balance
to £100.64 and no more payments were  received. So Im satisfied the account  was
overdrawn when Miss T stopped using  it and that she didnt go on to repay  the outstanding
balance.
I appreciate Miss T says she didnt  receive any letters about the default but Ive seen
systems evidence  that shows NatWest had her correct  address on file. NatWests  also
provided templates of letters  it sent Miss T about its intention to default  the account and
contact records to show when they were posted.  From what Ive seen, Im satisfied the
relevant letters were  sent. So taking everything into account, Im not persuaded  NatWest
treated Miss T unfairly by applying a default  to her credit  file in 2014.
But I am concerned about what happened in November  2015. Looking at NatWests
complaint notes it appears Miss T incorrectly paid £70 into the account and called  to retrieve
it on 16 November 2015. During this call she was told she still had an outstanding  balance.
Over the following  days Miss T spoke with NatWest and on 20 November 2015 made  a
payment of £100.01 to the account, which  only left £0.63 to pay.
Ive carefully thought about  whether it was Miss Ts intention to repay the entire balance after
speaking with NatWest and I think its clear  it was. Its unclear why Miss T didnt pay the full
amount. But its not reasonable to assume that Miss T wouldnt  have been  in a position to
afford the final £0.63 having  made  a much bigger  payment of £100.01 already.
Ref: DRN40378864NatWests collections notes show  that it didnt contact Miss T to let her know  there was a
very small  outstanding  balance to pay - the notes confirm the debt was too small to even be
passed to its agents. So Miss T was never contacted to repay  the final £0.63. Given  the size
of the debt at this point I think it wouldve been fair for NatWest to contact  Miss T and check
why it hadnt been repaid.
Ive also not found the information NatWest has been reporting since November 2015 is
accurate. The information its supplied  shows  NatWest  was reporting a default balance of
£101 from October 2014 onwards. But thats not right because Miss T repaid all but £0.63 in
November 2015. NatWest  has told this service its obliged to report  accurate information
about Miss Ts account  but its not done that here.
As a minimum, Id have  expected  NatWest  to have amended Miss Ts credit file to reflect the
fact she only had an outstanding balance  of £0.63 (or £1 for the purposes of reporting) from
November 2015 onwards. But until Miss T complained earlier this year, her credit file said
the whole £101 default remained outstanding and thats not accurate or correct.
I appreciate NatWest was technically correct in reporting there  was an outstanding default
balance (albeit the wrong balance) until earlier this year. But I think  NatWest should have
contacted Miss T shortly  after she made the November  2015 payment, to ask her about the
remaining £0.63. I have  no doubt that if itd done that, Miss T wouldve  immediately  paid it
off.
Had NatWest  taken that step, Miss Ts outstanding balance wouldve  been marked as
satisfied in November  2015, not August  2018  and her credit  file would reflect that now.
I know this isnt the outcome  Miss T was hoping  for but, as Ive explained, Ive not found
NatWest made  an error  in 2014 when it defaulted her account. As a result,  it wouldnt be fair
to tell them  to remove that information from Miss Ts credit file now.  But I have  found that
NatWests actions meant Miss T missed an opportunity to fully repay  the default balance in
November 2015 and thats impacted her credit file. As a result, Im minded to uphold this
complaint in part and tell NatWest to do the following:
-Amend  Miss Ts credit  file to show the default  balance was satisfied in 
November 2015
-Pay Miss T £100 for trouble and upset caused by failing to treat Miss T fairly in November 
2015
my provisional  decision
My provisional  decision  is that I intend to uphold this complaint in line with the settlement set
out above.
Miss T and NatWest have  until 12 December  2018 to send me anything further theyd like to
me to consider before I make a final decision.
