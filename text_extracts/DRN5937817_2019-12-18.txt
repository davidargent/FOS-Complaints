K820x#14complaint
Mr K complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA has permanently  limited his account.
background
In April 2019 PayPal  reviewed Mr Ks account.  This review identified  instances when it 
considered Mr K had acted outside  PayPals terms of use by engaging in Restricted 
Activities, specifically by abusing PayPals Buyer Protection Programme.  As a result,  PayPal 
decided to limit Mr Ks account.  Mr K complained to PayPal asking for his account to be 
restored with no limitation. PayPal rejected his complaint.
PayPal provides an online money transfer system that allows  PayPal users  to make and 
receive payments  online. In the event of a dispute between a buyer and a seller PayPal 
offers a Buyer Protection Programme. This is meant  to help buyers  recover  their money from 
sellers who either dont deliver the goods that have been paid for or deliver goods which are 
not as described.  The Buyer Protection  Programme  allows PayPal to reach a final decision 
to clear up such issues. In its final response, PayPal said that the buyer complaints raised by 
Mr K do not meet with the aims  of the Buyer Protection Programme.  It also said that it had 
acted correctly and within the terms of the PayPal User Agreement (UA).
Mr K asked us to look into his complaint. Our investigator felt that Mr Ks complaint shouldnt  
be upheld as he didnt  think PayPals decision to limit Mr Ks account was unreasonable. 
Mr K didnt agree. He feels  he has done nothing wrong, that the disputes were genuine and 
opened on PayPals  advice. He asked for his complaint to be passed to an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In considering Mr Ks complaint, I looked at whether PayPal had the authority to limit Mr Ks 
account, whether  it had followed  its own procedures  in doing so and whether its actions were 
fair and reasonable.
I reviewed the PayPal UA and saw that, in Section 10.2 (a), PayPal has the authority to limit 
accounts where it has reason to believe the customer has engaged in Restricted Activities, 
which includes abuse of the Buyer Protection  Programme. I also looked at PayPals  
evidence for deciding whether, or not, it was reasonable  to consider that Mr K had abused  
the Buyer Protection Programme. Mr K used his account to enter into a significant  number of 
transactions over a short period of time.  Mr K says that the value of each transaction was 
very low, so it wasnt reasonable for him to be considered a high risk. But it is the large  
number of transactions undertaken  by Mr K that has led PayPal  to limit his account; the low 
value of each  transaction  doesnt make  a difference. Regardless of the value of the 
individual transactions, I think  its reasonable that PayPal concluded Mr K had abused  the 
Buyer Protection Programme. And I dont think PayPal has acted unfairly or unreasonably in 
arriving at this view.
Ref: DRN59378172I then considered if PayPal had followed  its own procedures in limiting Mr Ks account. 
These procedures are set out in the UA. After  the review of his account, Mr K was told that 
he would  no longer be able to use PayPals  services and he was told the reasons why. 
PayPal also told Mr K that it would take a gradual  approach to limiting his account  so that 
there was enough  time for any claims to be made  against him. I think that PayPal has 
followed its own procedures in limiting  Mr Ks account.
I also looked at whether  PayPals actions were fair and reasonable. PayPal can choose who 
it provides services to and on what terms. These  terms are set out in the UA which Mr K 
would have agreed when he opened his account with PayPal. Mr K has also mentioned that 
the disputes were  opened  following advice from PayPal. This does not, however, prevent 
PayPal from conducting  a review of Mr Ks account and taking the action to limit his account. 
On reviewing Mr Ks account,  PayPal  found  evidence that led it to believe  that Mr K had 
abused their Buyer Protection Programme. It then took action to limit his account  and 
informed Mr K. Both actions are in line with the PayPal  UA.
When Mr K complained, PayPal investigated  the complaint  in a timely manner and informed 
him of the outcome.  I think that PayPal acted fairly and reasonably in its handling of Mr Ks 
account. It believed  that Mr K had abused the Buyer Protection Programme, and the UA 
allows PayPal to limit Mr Ks account  and it gave him sufficient notice  that it would do this.
I dont think PayPal has done anything wrong. And I dont think  it would be fair or reasonable 
to require PayPal  to remove the limitation  from Mr Ks account.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, its my final decision that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 January 2020.
