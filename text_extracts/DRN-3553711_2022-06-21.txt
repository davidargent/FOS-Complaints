The complaint
Mr E is unhappy with how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA handled a claim he made under 
the buyer protection policy.
What happened
On 27 July 2021 Mr E has explained he purchased an item from an online retailer, for £10.99 
 paying by way of his PayPal account. The item was due to be delivered to his home 
address. However, this wasnt received. So, on 31 July 2021 Mr E made a claim under 
PayPals buyer protection policy. He noted the reason for the claim as item not received.
PayPal responded to Mr Es claim and declined it. It said that the seller had been able to 
provide information to show the item was delivered. It had been given the tracking number 
for the scheduled delivery, and using this, the couriers website said the item had been 
delivered on 31 July 2021. Given this, PayPal didnt provide Mr E with the £10.99 refund he 
had expected.
Mr E contacted the courier company that had been due to deliver the item. And it agreed 
there had been a mistake on its part. It noted the driver hadnt been in Mr Es area when the 
delivery had been marked as successful. The driver had incorrectly noted the item of 
delivered, leaving it at a different property instead. Mr E asked the courier to therefore 
change the status of the delivery  to accurately show it hadnt arrived with him.
PayPal has said Mr E contacted it on 10 August 2021 to explain confirm the above 
information he had from Hermes. And at that point it offered Mr E the offer of a credit 
voucher, which he declined. Because Mr E was dissatisfied, PayPal reviewed the situation 
again  and responded to Mr E on 17 August 2021. It noted that despite not having to under 
PayPals buyer protection policy, the seller had provided Mr E with a refund for the full cost 
of his item. So, it was satisfied there wasnt anything further for it to do. 
Mr E has explained he feels PayPal didnt act fairly when considering his buyer protection 
claim. He felt PayPal shouldnt have simply taken the tracking information on the couriers 
website and assumed this meant the item had been delivered to him. Mr E felt PayPal didnt 
carry out a sufficient investigation to establish the correct information. And it shouldnt have 
declined his claim. 
PayPal responded to Mr Es concerns. It said it was satisfied it had acted in line with the user 
agreement between it and Mr E. Including the terms and conditions of the buyer protection 
policy within this. It noted that Mr E had received a refund from the merchant now, and there 
was nothing more to do. Mr E remained dissatisfied. So, he referred his complaint to this 
service, for an independent review.
Our investigator considered this complaint and felt PayPal could have provided a better 
service to Mr E. She said that PayPal didnt take Mr Es evidence that he didnt receive the 
item into account, and it should have. So, she recommended that PayPal provide Mr E with 
an apology  as this was what he wanted to resolve his complaint.
PayPal didnt agree. It maintained its position that it had acted in line with the buyer 
protection policy contained in the user agreement. It also noted the voucher it had offered Mr 
E, and the fact that when it looked into the situation post Mr E providing information from the 
courier, a refund had already been provided by the seller. So, there was nothing else for it to 
do.
Because PayPal didnt agree, this complaint has been referred to me to decide.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. In this I said:
Ive considered all of the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont intend on upholding this complaint. Its clear Mr E feels strongly 
about the matter  so I appreciate he is likely to be disappointed with this. But Ive explained 
the reasons for my intended outcome below.
Mr E feels PayPal acted unfairly in declining the dispute he raised. So, Ive thought carefully 
about this. The starting point being the terms of the user agreement between PayPal and Mr 
E. This being because it is the contract between the two parties.
On looking at the user agreement, I can see that PayPal offers the opportunity to raise a 
dispute in a number of situations, under its buyers protection policy. One of these situations 
is when the item purchased isnt received. Because Mr E noted the item hadnt arrived with 
him, Im satisfied it was reasonable for him to raise a claim under the Item not received 
reason. 
But what I have to consider is whether PayPal dealt with this dispute fairly. And I think it did. 
On receiving Mr Es claim, PayPal gained the tracking number for the intended delivery, as 
well as information showing the address the item was to go to. PayPal used this tracking 
number and saw that the couriers website showed the item as delivered to the address it 
was supposed to. So, it didnt consider the terms of the user agreement had been met  and 
so didnt agree to provide a refund to Mr E.
I can appreciate why Mr E feels this was unfair. The information on the couriers website 
wasnt right. The item hadnt been delivered to him but was wrongly provided to someone 
else. However, I dont think that means PayPal acted unfairly here. It acted upon Mr Es 
claim, and I think it was reasonable for it to rely on the tracking information it received.
The terms and conditions of the user agreement do note the following:
Your claim will not quality for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not 
Received claim, if:
()
The seller has provided proof of delivery.
If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in 
favour of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the 
item.
Proof of delivery is defined by the user agreement. It is defined as:
Online of physical documentation from a shopping company that includes:
An online verifiable tracking numberDate of delivery and delivered status
An address for the recipient that matches the shopping address on the Transaction 
Details page
An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or zip/postal 
code (or international equivalent).
The proof of delivery information provided by the seller included all of the above. And so, Im 
satisfied that by accepting this proof of delivery PayPal acted in line with the terms and the 
user agreement and made a fair and reasonable decision to decline the claim. 
Following this decline, Im aware Mr E was able to provide further information, to evidence 
that the item had been delivered somewhere else. Mr E feels PayPal didnt consider this. But 
Ive seen a copy of the online chat history between Mr R and PayPal, which shows a 
conversation between Mr E and PayPal on 10 August 2021. And within this, Im aware 
PayPal acknowledged Mr Es points, although it wasnt able to do anything more, and 
offered him a voucher for £10.99. 
When Mr E didnt accept this, and PayPal considered the matter further, it saw that the seller 
then provided Mr E with a refund directly. So, it decided that even with the new information 
Mr E had given, there wasnt anything else it needed to do. And I agree with that. Mr E had 
received the funds he was seeking back. And that was the maximum due to him under the 
buyers protection policy.
I appreciate Mr E feels PayPals process of dealing with this was wrong. But as above, it was 
in line with the terms and conditions of the agreement. And Im satisfied it came to a 
reasonable conclusion based on those, along with the evidence from the seller, in the first 
instance. As PayPal did what it was expected to do at this point, I dont think PayPal needed 
to do anything more here. 
Im also satisfied it handled Mr Es further information fairly. It just didnt result in a different 
outcome, given PayPal had acted reasonably in the first place  and the issue had been 
resolved by that point anyway. With this in mind, Im not requiring PayPal to anything more in 
respect of this complaint. 
I should highlight that this service isnt here to regulate the industry or ask a business to 
change its processes. And so, whilst I have taken note and understand Mr Es frustrations 
with the process PayPal relied on when he made his claim, I wont be requiring PayPal to do 
anything in this regard either.
PayPal responded to my provisional decision and didnt add any further comments. It did 
however offer Mr E £10 compensation. Mr E also didnt respond with any comments or 
evidence following my provisional decision, except to accept the £10 PayPal offered him.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither party has provided me with additional evidence or comments to alter the provisional 
decision noted above. So, my decision remains the same in that regard. However, PayPal 
did make an offer of £10 to Mr E following my provisional decision. And Mr E has accepted 
this. Given the findings I made in my provisional decision, and that PayPal has now gone over 
and above this by offering the £10 to Mr E, Im satisfied this offer is fair.
My final decision
Given the above, my final decision is that the offer of £10 provided by PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA is fair. If it hasnt paid this to Mr E already, it should do so now. I dont require it 
do anything more than this. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 July 2022.
