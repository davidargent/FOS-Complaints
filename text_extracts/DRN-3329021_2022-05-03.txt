The complaint
Ms L complains that NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibly when it approved two credit cards and 
increased the credit limit.
 
What happened
In July 2017 Ms L applied for a Marbles branded credit card with NewDay. In the application, 
Ms L said she was employed and earned £18,000 a year. NewDay found Ms L had seven 
defaults totalling £3,900 from around three years before and no other adverse credit. 
NewDay also found Ms L owed around £8,300 in unsecured credit.
NewDay approved the credit card with a limit of £900. The credit limit was increased to 
£1,900 in December 2017, £2,650 in June 2018 and £4,000 in December 2018. 
In October 2019 Ms L applied for an Amazon credit card with NewDay. In this application Ms 
L said she was employed with an income of around £21,500. The application also recorded 
a partners income of £2,797. NewDay didnt find any new defaults or adverse credit but did 
find Ms L now owed around £15,300 in unsecured debt. The application was approved with 
a credit limit of £500. 
Ms Ls credit card payments werent maintained and NewDay stopped charging interest in 
February 2020. 
Last year, Ms L complained that NewDay had lent irresponsibly but it didnt agree. Ms L 
referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They upheld Ms 
Ls complaint and as they didnt feel the checks NewDay completed were proportionate or 
comprehensive enough. NewDay asked to appeal, so Ms Ls complaint has been passed to 
me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say NewDay had to complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure Ms L could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable way. 
These affordability checks needed to be focused on the borrowers circumstances. The 
nature of whats considered reasonable and proportionate will vary depending on various 
factors like: 
- The amount of credit;
- The total sum repayable and the size of regular repayments;
- The duration of the agreement;
- The costs of the credit; and 
- The consumers individual circumstances. 
That means theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. But lenders are required to 
consider the above points when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate. 
In this case, Ive looked at all the lending decisions NewDay made on both cards. I started 
by looking at the Marbles application. In my view, there was a lack of proportionate checks 
completed during the application. 
Whilst I understand NewDay is a second chance lender and does accept applications from 
consumers with some adverse credit, Ms L had a reasonable level of defaults within three 
years of the application, totalling around £3,900. In addition, Ms L owed around £8,300 
against an income of £18,000. NewDay hasnt provided any evidence to show it considered 
Ms Ls regular outgoings or living costs and the application doesnt record whether she paid 
rent or a mortgage. Given the level of Ms Ls existing debt, circumstances in the application 
and previous defaults, I think NewDay shouldve carried out some better checks before 
deciding whether to proceed. 
Had NewDay carried out better checks, I think it wouldve found Ms L was struggling and 
using increasing levels of credit to make ends meet. I think more comprehensive checks 
wouldve led NewDay to decline Ms Ls credit card application. The information Ive seen 
indicates NewDay lent irresponsibly when it approved Ms Ls Marbles credit card application. 
It follows that if I think NewDay lent irresponsibly when it approved Ms Ls application the 
follow up credit limit increases were irresponsible too. Ive looked at whether there was 
anything that indicated Ms Ls circumstances had improved. The risk data provided shows 
Ms Ls unsecured balance increased and that she regularly used her credit card to withdraw 
significant levels of cash. Whilst I understand customers can use a Marbles card to withdraw 
cash, taken with the other supporting information, I think it indicates Ms L was relying on the 
credit card for day to day spending in an unsustainable manner. In my view, the account 
activity shouldve put NewDay on notice Ms L was struggling and unable to support further 
borrowing. I think NewDay shouldve carried out better checks before increasing the credit 
limit.
Had NewDay carried out better checks I think it wouldve found further signs Ms L was using 
credit to make ends meet. Im satisfied the follow up credit limit increases on Ms Ls Marbles 
credit card were irresponsibly approved. 
Ms L applied for an Amazon branded card with New Day in October 2019. I can see Ms L 
gave a higher income figure in this application and NewDay also too details of her partners 
income. So, on the face of it, there was more money to support further borrowing. But by this 
stage, Ms L already owed NewDay around £4,000 via her Marbles card and around £17,000 
in unsecured credit. If NewDay wanted to use Ms Ls partners income into account, I think 
the circumstances of her case shouldve caused it to ask more questions and obtain further 
information. 
I also note Ms L had taken cash from her Marbles card and gone over her credit limit several 
times in the months before the Amazon application was approved. In my view, the 
information NewDay had available shouldve caused it to carry out more comprehensive 
checks before approving the Amazong application. Had it done so, I think NewDay wouldve 
found Ms L was unable to reasonably support further borrowing and sustainably maintain 
higher outgoings. Im satisfied NewDay lent irresponsibly. 
As Im satisfied NewDay lent irresponsibly, Im going to tell it to refund all interest, fees and 
charges to both accounts. In addition, I dont think it would be fair for NewDay to report 
adverse intimation on Ms Ls credit files in relation to debts that were lent irresponsibly. So Im also telling NewDay to remove all adverse information it reports about both accounts 
from Ms Ls credit file.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Ms Ls complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to settle as follows: 
- Refund all interest, fees and charges applied to both the Marbles and Amazon credit 
cards, from inceptions onwards
- Once the above refunds have been made, NewDay should administer any remaining 
balances without applying further interest
- If the above results in a credit balances, NewDay should issue a refund to Ms L along 
with 8% interest
- Amend Mr Ls credit file to remove all adverse information recorded for the Marbles 
and Amazon credit cards from inception onwards
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 May 2022.
