The complaint
Mrs S complains that Motonovo Finance Limited (MotoNovo), failed to take the direct 
debit payments following a payment arrangement that was set-up on her hire purchase 
agreement. Mrs S isnt happy with the impact it had on her credit file.
What happened
In March 2019 Mrs S acquired a used car through a hire purchase agreement with 
MotoNovo. The purchase price of the car was £12,017. Mrs S paid a deposit of £200 which 
meant that the total amount financed on this agreement was £11,817 payable over 60 
months at £237.52 each month.
Mrs S says that in May 2020, she requested and had been accepted for a reduced deferred 
payment arrangement of £100 per month, over the course of three months. Mrs S says she 
requested this because shed been placed on furlough as a result of the impact of the Covid-
19 pandemic. 
MotoNovo confirmed the details of the payment arrangement, as described by Mrs S. They 
advised it was in place for June, July and August 2020, reverting back to the normal amount 
in September 2020.
Mrs S says that in August 2020 she received a missed call from MotoNovo while she was 
abroad, but then responded to a security check email from them on the same day to confirm 
her details. MotoNovo also confirmed this in their final response. Mrs S said she hadnt 
heard from MotoNovo for around six months after that.
Mrs S says that in February 2021 when reviewing her credit file, she noticed missing 
payment information in relation to her hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo. Mrs S says 
she contacted MotoNovo to find that thered been an issue with the direct debit for her 
agreement. 
MotoNovo confirmed that due to a system failure they hadnt called for the direct debit since 
August 2020 until after Mrs S contacted them in February 2021, which meant Mrs S account 
had gone into arrears. Mrs S says MotoNovo initially told her they could protect up to six 
months payments as deferment payments on her agreement, but later advised shed need to 
repay the full arears before her credit file could reflect this.
Mrs S complained to MotoNovo that their mistake had led to the adverse information being 
recorded on her credit file.
On 4 March 2021 MotoNovo provided their final response to Mrs S complaint. They upheld 
her complaint based on a system failure affecting Mrs S direct debit payments. However, 
they said theyd be unable to remove the markers on her credit file as they believed it would 
reflect incorrect information. MotoNovo said they would have expected Mrs S to have 
contacted them sooner about the payments not coming out of her account, however, they 
arranged to credit Mrs S account with £100 for the poor service and distress and 
inconvenience caused as a result of their system failure.
Unhappy with their response to her complaint, Mrs S brought her complaint to us. One of our 
investigators looked into her complaint and felt that it should be upheld. The investigator 
didnt think that MotoNovo had acted fairly. Our investigator agreed with the level of 
compensation offered but asked that MotoNovo remove any adverse information from Mrs S 
credit file in relation to the agreement. 
Mrs S accepted our investigators view but MotoNovo disagreed and asked that the 
complaint be referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In considering what is fair and reasonable, Ive thought about all the evidence and 
information provided afresh and the relevant law and regulations, regulators rules, guidance 
and standards, codes of practice and (where appropriate) what I consider to have been good 
industry practice at the relevant time. 
The agreement in this case is a regulated hire purchase agreement. As such, this service is 
able to consider complaints relating to it. 
My starting point is that Mrs S requested from MotoNovo, a reduced deferred payment 
arrangement over the course of June, July and August 2020. This has been confirmed by 
Mrs S in her complaint to us and by MotoNovo in their final response. Having considered a 
payment arrangement had been agreed and put in place for Mrs S, Ive thought about 
whether it was processed correctly and whether Mrs S had been adversely affected by it. 
MotoNovo advised in their correspondence to Mrs S that her direct debit would be taken by 
them. However, from the information provided its clear to me that the direct debit for Mrs S 
agreement failed to come out of her account from August 2020. This is apparent from what 
Mrs S has told us, and was confirmed by MotoNovo in their final response. MotoNovo also 
confirmed that the issue with the direct debit was as a result of their system failure. So, I 
dont think theres any dispute about how the direct debit had failed.  Having considered the 
direct debit wasnt taken as a result of MotoNovos system failure, Ive considered whether it 
was fair that Mrs S credit file had been affected as a result. 
In February 2021 MotoNovo sent Mrs S an email advising that the direct debit should have 
resumed following the reduced payment in August 2020, however they confirmed that 
Augusts payment hadnt been collected either. 
Section 86B of The Consumer Credit Act 1974 provides guidance in relation to payment 
arrears. In consideration of this, I would have expected MotoNovo to have informed Mrs S of 
her payment arrears sooner than they did. For example, by sending her a notice of sums in 
arrears letter detailing the overdue payments and providing information on how to bring the 
account up to date. Ive seen no evidence that MotoNovo made any attempts to contact Mrs 
S after August 2020 for around six months. MotoNovo confirmed in their final response that 
they had no further correspondence with Mrs S until February 2021. In the circumstances I 
dont think its fair that MotoNovo retrospectively showed the missed payments on the 
account.
Had MotoNovos systems not failed, Ive no reason to think that Mrs S repayments wouldnt 
have continued as planned. I think its likely Mrs S wouldnt have missed any payments on 
her agreement leading to adverse information being recorded on her credit file. In the circumstances I dont think it was fair that Mrs S credit file had been affected as a result of 
MotoNovos error.
MotoNovo said that they would have expected Mrs S to have contacted them sooner after 
the direct debit had failed, considering she would have had additional surplus funds in her 
account. I dont think its reasonable to have expected Mrs S to do this, considering a 
significant benefit of paying by direct debit is to ease any inconvenience of manually 
administering payments through an account. So, I dont think its reasonable to have 
expected Mrs S to have been checking her account each month to ensure the direct debits 
had been taken, nor do I think she would necessarily have noticed that surplus funds were in 
her account if she hadnt been monitoring her balance. So, Im persuaded by what Mrs S has 
said about only noticing when she reviewed her credit file.
I acknowledge that MotoNovo has presented Mrs S with different options to help her repay 
her arrears, and I recognise that Mrs S has made a significant payment towards it. However, 
as MotoNovo were admittedly at fault for the failure of the direct debit, for the reasons 
explained above, I think its fair that MotoNovo should put things right for Mrs S. As Ive 
found that Mrs S payment would have likely continued as normal had the direct debit not 
failed, I be instructing MotoNovo to amend her credit file to reflect no adverse information in 
relation to her agreement. Mrs S may decide to continue liaising with MotoNovo with regard 
to her outstanding balance to ensure a suitable repayment plan is put in place.
In response to our investigators view, Mrs S explained that shes dealing with a number of 
personal challenges, which Im sorry to hear about. However, from the information provided I 
think the £100 compensation already paid to Mrs S by MotoNovo is fair in the circumstances 
to recognise their service failure.

My final decision
To settle the complaint MotoNovo Finance Limited has already made a payment of £100 
compensation. I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
So, my decision is that in addition to the £100 compensation payment, I instruct MotoNovo 
Finance Limited to:
remove any adverse information that may have been recorded with the credit 
reference agencies in respect of the missed payments from August 2020 due under 
the hire purchase agreement Mrs S has with them.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 June 2022.
