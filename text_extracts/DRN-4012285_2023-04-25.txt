The complaint
Mrs A complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to her the money that she and her husband paid for some holiday club 
membership points. Shes being represented in her complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mrs A and her husband had bought a trial membership of a holiday club in March 2009 and 
they entered into an acquisition agreement to upgrade their membership in August 2009 by 
buying some membership points. The purchase price of the points was £15,334 and they 
traded in their trial membership which was given a value of £5,795 so the balance due from 
them was £9,539. Mrs As husband entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance for a loan of £12,775 (which included consolidation of finance that had been 
taken out with another finance provider to fund the purchase of the trial membership). He 
agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £191.15 to Barclays Partner Finance. 
Mrs A and her husband upgraded their membership again in May 2010 when they entered 
into another acquisition to buy some more membership points. The purchase price of those 
points was £7,459 and Mrs A entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance for a loan of that amount. She agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £112.18 
to Barclays Partner Finance.
Mrs As and her husbands representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in 
September 2017 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that 
Mrs A and her husband had relied on misrepresentations made by the holiday company and 
that those misrepresentations and other activities carried on during the sales process meant 
that there was an unfair relationship. Barclays Partner Finance said that Mrs As husbands 
claims were time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980 so it had no obligation to investigate 
his complaint. Mrs A wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this 
service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs As and her husbands complaint should be 
upheld. She thought that Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of their 
misrepresentation claim to turn it down. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest 
that the relationship between Mrs A and her husband and Barclays Partner Finance was 
unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the 
relationship was unfair. 
Mrs As and her husbands representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It says that our investigators recommendations arent 
accepted and it has provided a generic submission from counsel in relation to the holiday 
company.
The August 2009 loan was made to Mrs As husband and he is an eligible complainant to 
make a complaint relating to that loan agreement. The May 2010 loan was made to Mrs A 
and she is an eligible complainant to make a complaint relating to that loan agreement. 
There are two separate complaints and in this decision Im only considering Mrs As 
complaint about Barclays Partner Finance. Mr As husbands complaint about Barclays 
Partner Finance will be considered in a separate decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs As complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs As complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that shed 
made to it and I accept that she referred her complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to her 
claims;
Mrs As claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mrs As claim under section 75 is that the membership points were misrepresented to 
her and her husband and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mrs A could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her and her 
husband into buying the membership points in May 2010 as that was the latest time 
that any misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been 
incurred as that was when she also entered into the loan agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made 
to Barclays Partner Finance until September 2017, more than seven years later so 
was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act and I consider that her 
misrepresentation claim is now time-barred;Mrs As representative says that Mrs As claim is a speciality so she would have 
twelve years to bring her claim but I dont consider that her claim is a speciality and 
Im satisfied that the limitation period is six years as described above;
Mrs As representative says that the misrepresentations and other activities carried 
on during the sales process meant that there was an unfair relationship and section 
140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay 
any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an 
unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided an account statement which show that 
Mrs As loan was repaid in March 2013, less than six years before her section 140A 
claim was made to Barclays Partner Finance so I dont consider that Mrs As section 
140A claim is time-barred;
Mrs As representative has described what it says were the misrepresentations made 
by the holiday company, including that 
Mrs A and her husband easily could divest themselves of the points by selling 
them, or renting out the rights purchased under it;
they could always recoup the cost of purchasing the points by selling them;
they would be able to holiday at any resort they wished in high season with 
accommodation of the same standard as they were enjoying when on holiday 
in August 2009; and
the annual management fees would only increase in line with inflation;
Mrs A and her husband signed the acquisition agreement (which included its terms 
and conditions) and Ive seen nothing in those documents to show that Mrs A and her 
husband were told that they would easily be able to sell their points, they would be 
able to holiday at any resort that they wished in high season or that the annual 
management fees would only increase in line with inflation;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
were misrepresented to Mrs A and her husband by the holiday company in May 2010 
or that they were induced into entering into the acquisition agreement by any 
misrepresentations;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs A and her husband 
were unduly pressurised into buying the membership points in May 2010, that Mrs A 
was unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable sales practices against them  Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mrs A complained to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues until 
September 2017 (more than seven years after the loan had been made to her) and I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have complained to Barclays 
Partner Finance about any such issues before then;
Mrs A and her husband bought a trial membership in March 2009, then upgraded 
their membership in August 2009 when they bought some membership points and 
bought more membership points in May 2010  if they were concerned about the way 
that the membership points had been sold to them by the holiday company in August 
2009 I consider that it would be reasonable to expect that they wouldnt have then 
bought more membership points;Mrs As representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company but Im not persuaded that it shows that Mrs As relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs As relationship 
with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs A and 
Barclays Partner Finance in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance said that Mrs As husbands claims were time-barred under 
the Limitation Act so it had no obligation to investigate his complaint and Ive seen no 
response that it sent to Mrs A so I cant say that its response to her claims was fair 
and reasonable  but if it had properly responded to her claims I consider that it 
would have been fair and reasonable for it not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mrs A for the issues that she and her husband have had with their 
memberships, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mrs A any of the money that 
she paid under the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 May 2023.
