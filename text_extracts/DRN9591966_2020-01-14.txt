K821x#15Mr H says MYJAR Limited (MYJAR)  irresponsibly  lent to him.
background
This complaint is about six high-cost short-term loans MYJAR provided to Mr H between  
January 2016  and April 2017.  Mr Hs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Highest Repayment Made
1 24/01/2016 05/02/2016 1 £100.00 £109.60
2 21/02/2016 06/05/2016 3 £500.00 £265.42
3 29/07/2016 07/02/2017 6 £450.00 £145.06
4 13/03/2017 17/03/2017 6 £1,000.00 £295.37
5 01/04/2017 16/04/2017 3 £100.00 £51.40
6 17/04/2017 21/07/2017 12 £1,000.00 £150.34
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Hs complaint and thought  loan 6 shouldnt have been given as 
the overall pattern of the borrowing suggested  he was becoming  reliant  on the loans.  
MYJAR disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  review. So, the complaint was passed to 
me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
Ref: DRN95919662the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Our adjudicator thought MYJAR  had carried out proportionate checks  for loans  1 to 5.  Mr H 
didnt respond  to the view. As there is no dispute with the adjudicators opinion about  these 
loans, I wont be making  any findings  on these loans. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of MYJARs lending history  with Mr H, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point  at which  MYJAR  should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR  should  have realised that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point MYJAR  ought to have realised Mr H was not managing  to repay  his 
loans sustainably. Mr H had been indebted to MYJAR for nearly  15 months. So 
MYJAR ought to have  realised  it was more likely than not Mr H was having to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr Hs first loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £1000.   At this point MYJAR ought 
to have known  that Mr H was not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed MYJAR.  Loan 6 was 
taken out 14 months after Mr Hs first. And it was for a much  larger  amount and had 
to be repaid over a longer period.  Mr H had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to MYJAR over an extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing at loan 6 because:
Ref: DRN95919663these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Hs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him/her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loan 6 and MYJAR should  put things right.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loan 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
any information recorded about  loan 6 is adverse. So, all entries about this loan 
should be removed  from Mr Hs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. MYJAR Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 February  2020.
