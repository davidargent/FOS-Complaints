The complaint
Mr A complains that NewDay Ltd didnt change the due date for his credit card payments 
after hed requested this several times.
What happened
In July 2019, Mr A asked NewDay to change the due date for his credit card payments. He 
said hed been out of work and had recently found a new job. He was aware hed missed the 
payment that was due the previous week but said he wouldnt be able to pay it until after 
hed been paid. He asked for the due date to be changed from around the beginning of the 
month to the 28th.
NewDay told him to call back after he made Julys payment. It could look at changing the 
due date once his account was up to date. But it wouldnt be changed for August, it would be 
changed for the following month.
Mr A phoned NewDay several times over the next couple of months to discuss the payment 
date. In September 2019, NewDay offered Mr A a one-month payment holiday to give him 
the opportunity to bring his account up to date. Mr A decided to accept the payment holiday 
which meant that he wasnt charged any interest or fees on the account while it was in place.
Mr A remained unhappy. He was frustrated that hed had to call NewDay so many times and 
that hed been told hed needed to pay the balance when hed been unable to do so. This 
had resulted in him being behind on his payments and had impacted his ability to pay other 
bills. He was also concerned about information that had been recorded on his credit file.
NewDay said it wasnt able to change the payment due date while there were arrears on the 
account, and it had explained this to Mr A. But it acknowledged its notes showed that more 
than once the account had been diarised to do the change once the payment had been 
received and this was not done. NewDay offered Mr A £65 compensation for the trouble 
caused and the time taken to respond to his complaint. 
Mr A wasnt satisfied with NewDays offer of compensation. He said hed made it clear in 
July that he wasnt able to make a double payment. As NewDay hadnt amended the billing 
date hed been a month behind on his payments every month. NewDay had blocked him 
from using his card and had reported that he was missing payments to the credit reference 
agencies. 
Our investigator looked into Mr As concerns. She thought NewDay should have recognised 
sooner that Mr A wasnt able to make two monthly payments at once and have offered him 
appropriate support. She recommended that NewDay increase its offer of compensation to 
£100 because of the trouble and upset caused. 
The investigator also considered Mr As comments about his credit file but didnt feel it was 
unreasonable that a late payment marker had been applied to it. NewDay agreed with our investigators recommendation and increased its offer of 
compensation to £100. But Mr A didnt think £100 was enough. He said he accepted our 
investigators reasons and justification, but he was expecting a minimum of £200 
compensation.
As Mr A has disagreed with our investigators recommendation, his complaint has been 
passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay has accepted our investigators findings and agreed to pay the compensation she 
recommended in her view. Mr A says he agrees with most of our investigators conclusions, 
but he doesnt think the amount she recommended NewDay pay him is enough to 
compensate him for the trouble and upset hes experienced. So, Ive needed to consider if 
£100 is a reasonable amount to settle his complaint. Having done so, I think it is. Ill explain 
why.
NewDay had a duty to treat Mr A positively and sympathetically if it was aware, he was 
experiencing financial difficulties. 
I agree with our investigators conclusion that NewDay should have done more to help Mr A 
earlier on. It could have offered Mr A a payment holiday in July 2019, when Mr A first said he 
needed more time to make that months payment and wouldnt be able to make a double 
payment.
Im also mindful that NewDay did offer the payment holiday to Mr A less than three months 
later and this gave him the opportunity to get his account back on track. So, Ive thought 
about the impact the delay in providing this solution had on Mr A.
I appreciate it would have been a worry for Mr A that he continued to be behind on his 
payments after asking NewDay for help. He was frustrated that he had to make several 
phone calls to NewDay, where he felt he wasnt being listened to or treated fairly. And he 
was blocked from using his card for longer than was necessary.
Although NewDay didnt help Mr A as soon as it should have done, I think NewDay did treat 
him positively and sympathetically. And I feel that the £100 NewDay has agreed to pay Mr A 
is fair compensation for the trouble and upset hes experienced as a result of this delay.
Putting things right
NewDay should pay Mr A £100 for the trouble and upset caused.
My final decision
For the reasons I've explained, I uphold Mr As complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to pay him 
£100 for trouble and upset.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 May 2020.
