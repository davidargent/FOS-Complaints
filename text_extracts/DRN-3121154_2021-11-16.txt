The complaint
Mr l complains that he lost his promotional balance offer from Barclays Bank UK PLC trading 
as Barclaycard (Barclaycard).
What happened
On 26 March 2019, Mr L took a balance transfer offer of £1,000 at zero interest until 1 
September 2020. There was a fee of £24. On 4 December 2019, Mr L took a further balance 
transfer of £4,000 at zero interest until 1 December 2021. There was a fee of £116. On Mr 
Ls statement dated 14 February 2020, the balance was £5,924.12. This was made of new 
purchases of £1,582.39, the first promotional balance of £225.73 and the second 
promotional balance of £4,116. On 9 March 2020, Mr L paid in three amounts - £250, 
1,482.39 and £5,500. On 11 March 2020, Mr L transferred £5,500 back out of his account. 
Mr L complained. He made the credit payment of £5,500 by mistake  he had meant to pay it 
into his other Barclaycard account. As a result of this, he lost the benefit of the promotional 
balance transfer offer and was paying interest on the new balance  when he shouldnt have 
to. Hed called Barclaycard on the same day to reverse the payment, so he thought that they 
should reinstate the interest free period. He said shouldve been notified about what had 
happened by Barclaycard  as it was obviously an anomaly. He said this cost him £3,000. 
He was a loyal customer of Barclaycard  for 40 years - and used the service a lot. He said 
hed used it for purchases for more than £57,000 in the previous two years. He was suffering 
from several health conditions and suffered from number dyslexia.
Barclaycard said that payments were allocated in the order of the highest interest rate 
balance, then to the promotional balances that ended first, and then the promotional 
balances ending after that. Mr L had paid in £7,232.39  so all three of the balances of 
£1,582.39, £225.73 and £4,116 had been paid off. They accepted that a mistake had been 
made by Mr L, but theyd acted in line with their terms and conditions and hadnt made an 
error. But  as a gesture of goodwill, they refunded three months interest totalling £347.51, 
and gave Mr L an interest free balance of £4,116 from March 2021 to 1 December 2021.
Mr L brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Barclaycard had acted fairly. The 
mistake was Mr Ls. Hed waited a year before contacting Barclaycard about it  if hed done 
so when it happened, the impact of what happened might have been reduced. Unfortunately, 
there wasnt any evidence of a call between Mr L and Barclaycard  who had shown him 
evidence that theyd searched for the call. Barclaycard had acted within the terms and 
conditions of the card. Mr L couldve seen the interest being charged each month on his 
Barclaycard statements. Barclaycards actions of refunding three months interest and giving 
Mr L an interest free period of £4,116 for nine months was fair and reasonable.
Mr L didnt agree. He didnt dispute the terms and conditions of the card  but asked for a 
fair decision based on his circumstances, and that this was a genuine mistake by him. He 
asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Looking firstly at Barclaycards terms and conditions  they acted correctly here. They say:  If 
a payment you make well use it as follows:.  To reduce your main balance (your 
statement balance less any instalment plan balance). Well start with the balances charged 
at the highest interest rate first and then reduce the lower-rate balances. If you have more 
than one promotional balance at the same interest rate, well use your payment to reduce 
the balance with the promotional rate that ends first.
I can see that information about this was included on Mr Ls statements in the summary 
box.
And I can see thats what happened. Mr Ls statement dated 14 February 2020 had a 
balance of £5,924.12  made up of new purchases of £1,582.12, and the two promotional 
balances of £225.73 and £4,116. And he paid in a total of £7,232.39  so all the debit 
balances were paid off, including the promotional balances. This meant that he lost the 
benefit of the promotional balance amount. 
Mr L says he reversed the mistake immediately by calling Barclaycard the same day as it 
happened. Unfortunately, they cant locate this call  but have shown us evidence that 
theyve searched for it in their records. Mr L did transfer the amount of £5,500 out of his 
account on 11 March 2020  two days after the first credit was made. Mr L says that 
because he reversed the transaction immediately  then the interest free period should be 
reinstated. I can see his argument. It was a genuine mistake on his part - and I believe it 
was. So, he says - why should he be disadvantaged. I can see that he went on to pay debit 
interest of approximately £110 a month after March 2020  through to when he made his 
complaint to Barclaycard in March 2021. 
Mr L doesnt say that Barclaycard agreed to reinstate the interest free balance transfer, or to 
do something else about it. And  if hed raised the matter with Barclaycard much earlier 
than he did (in March 2021), then possibly something couldve been done by either himself, 
or Barclaycard, to reduce the interest payable. But it doesnt look like he did. And what 
happened here is that Mr L paid off the promotional balances. And when he then re-drew an 
amount of £5,500, this was new borrowing at a new rate of interest.
And  I can see that since March 2020, each statement sent to Mr L showed the interest 
payable. Also  prior to that time, statements showed the two promotional balance amounts 
and their expiry dates. These disappeared from then on. I can see that Mr L must have been 
familiar with how those were set out  as he regularly saw how much needed to be paid off 
each month for new purchases  and he then paid that amount - leaving the promotional 
balances in place. So  I think its reasonable to say that Mr L shouldve seen what was 
happening through looking at his statements.
Mr L has said hes a valuable and loyal customer of Barclaycard  and I can see thats the 
case. I think thats why Barclaycard made the offer they did. As a gesture of goodwill, they 
refunded three months interest totalling £347.51, and gave Mr L an interest free period of 
nine months on a balance of £4,116. Ive thought about this offer. And I think its very 
reasonable in the circumstances. Because  Mr L originally signed up for an interest free 
period of 24 months. And - he had the benefit of this for three months (from December 2019 
to March 2020)  and Barclaycard then gave him another nine months  so he did get a 12-
month interest free period on £4,116. And on top of that, Barclaycard refunded three months 
interest on the full statement balance (which was more than £4,116). So  even though I 
dont think Barclaycard were at fault, theyve acted fairly in trying to help Mr L.
I was sorry to learn of Mr Ls illnesses and difficulties, but weve taken these into account 
when considering his complaint. As have Barclaycard.I can see that Mr L feels strongly about what happened, and will therefore be disappointed 
by my decision, but Im not going to ask Barclaycard to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 December 2021.
