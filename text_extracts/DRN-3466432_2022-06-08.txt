The complaint
Mr F is unhappy with the service hes received from National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) surrounding his accounts being passed to NatWests recoveries team and the 
impact that this has had on his credit file.
What happened
Mr F had a loan account with NatWest which was in arrears and for which hed been 
receiving financial assistance, as well as another loan account and a current account. 
On 23 February 2021, while overseas because of a family bereavement, Mr F noticed that 
he couldnt access his NatWest accounts. Mr F contacted NatWest about this and explained 
that he was overseas. NatWest told Mr F that they wouldnt take any further action until he 
returned to the UK, but when Mr F contacted NatWest again after returning to the UK he 
found that his accounts had been passed to NatWests collections and recoveries team and 
that his credit file had been impacted as a result. Mr F wasnt happy about this, so he raised 
a complaint.
NatWest looked at Mr Fs complaint. They noted that theyd confirmed to Mr F during the call 
of 23 February that theyd put a hold on his loan account until 2 March 2021, by which time 
Mr F had explained to them that he would be back in the UK. But Mr F hadnt contacted 
NatWest again until 11 March 2021, by which time the hold on his loan account had expired. 
Because of this, NatWest didnt feel that theyd acted unfairly towards Mr F by passing his 
accounts to their collections department, and they didnt uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Mr F wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also didnt feel that NatWest had 
acted unfairly towards Mr F in how theyd managed the situation. However, while liaising with 
NatWest about this complaint, NatWest identified what they felt were service issues 
surrounding how their staff had handled their interactions with Mr F, and so they offered 
£100 compensation to Mr F because of this. 
Mr F remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When Mr F telephoned NatWest from overseas on 23 March 2021, having noticed that he 
couldnt access his NatWest accounts, it was discovered by NatWest that a prior payment 
holiday hadnt been applied to his loan account correctly, meaning that NatWest were 
considering the payment holiday to have ended before it correctly should have.
Accordingly, at that time, NatWest amended the payment holiday dates and reinstated the 
overdraft on Mr Fs current account, which had been suspended because NatWest had 
believed that Mr Fs loan account was in unauthorised arrears.
These corrective actions still meant that the payment holiday period had ended at the time of 
the telephone call, but that it had only ended a few days previously. Because of this and 
taking into consideration that Mr F was overseas but expected to return to the UK no later 
than 2 March 2022, NatWest agreed to place a temporary hold on any potential collections 
and recoveries activities on his accounts until 2 March 2022.
It seems evident that NatWest confirmed to Mr M on several occasions during the telephone 
call that it was important that he contact them as soon as hed returned to the UK, and that 
the hold that was being placed on potential collections and recoveries action was only 
temporary and would expire on 2 March 2022.
But Mr F didnt contact NatWest on 2 March as hed promised he would, and this meant that 
when the hold on collections and recoveries expired that same day, there was no agreement 
or arrangement in place between Mr F and NatWest in regards to the arrears on his loan 
account. Because of this, I dont feel that I can fairly or reasonably censure NatWest for then 
following the collections and recoveries process that they did.
Mr F has confirmed that he did return to the UK on 2 March 2021, but that because of Covid-
19 lockdown restrictions he had to quarantine in a hotel upon his return. However, given that 
Mr F was in the UK, I feel that it was incumbent on him to have contacted NatWest on the 2 
March 2021 from the hotel  especially as NatWest had previously stressed the importance 
of calling them by this date, regardless of the circumstances, to Mr F.
All of which means that I dont feel that NatWest have acted unfairly or unreasonably 
towards Mr F by considering his accounts as being in unauthorised arrears when Mr F didnt 
contact NatWest by 2 March 2021 as they required. And it follows from this that I also dont 
feel that NatWest acted unfairly by then following the collections and recoveries processes 
that they did, or by making the reports to Mr Ms credit file that these collections and 
recoveries processes entail.
But while I dont feel that NatWests actions here were unfair, NatWest have themselves 
acknowledged that the standard of service that Mr F received when contacting them about 
these issues wasnt to the level that they aspire to, and theyve offered to make a payment of 
£100 compensation to Mr F because of this.
It must be confirmed that NatWest dont feel that theyve made any mistake in regard to their 
actions here, but that they feel they didnt provide Mr F with an appropriate level of service 
while explaining their position and intentions to him.
Matters of compensation can be subjective, with an offer considered as fair and reasonable 
by one person not being considered as being such by someone else. But in consideration of 
the context and circumstances here, the £100 that NatWest have offered does feel fair to 
me, and I can confirm that its inline with what I would have instructed NatWest to pay for the 
service issues theyve identified, had they not already offered to do so.
So, while I will be upholding this complaint in Mr Fs favour, I will only be doing so on the 
limited basis that NatWest must make the £100 payment of compensation to Mr F that 
theyve already offered to pay.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that Mr F was wanting, but I hope that hell 
understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.Putting things right
NatWest must make a payment of £100 to Mr F.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc on 
the basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2022.
