The complaint
Mr H (through a representative) has complained that S.D. Taylor Limited trading as Loans at 
Home (LAH) didnt carry out proper affordability checks before it provided him with lending.  
Had it done proper checks it wouldve realised Mr H was in a debt spiral.
 
What happened
Mr H took 21 home collected loans from LAH between October 2011 and June 2016. A 
summary of his borrowing, based on the information provided to us from LAH can be found

The cost per week column is the individual cost per loan per week. When loans overlapped 
the cost per week will be greater. For example, when loans 2 and 3 were being repaid, 
Mr Hs weekly commitment to LAH was £35. 
Mr H had some problems repaying his final four loans, and LAH has told us that it wrote off 
the balance due for of these loans. 
Following Mr Hs complaint, LAH issued its final response letter (FRL) on 12 May 2021. The 
FRL explained Mr H had made his complaint too late about loans 1-12 so LAH considered 
these loans to be time barred. As a result, LAH didnt investigate whether an error had been 
made when it advanced these loans. 
But LAH did conclude no error was made when loans 13  20 were advanced but it did 
agree something may have gone wrong when loan 21 was granted and it offered to put 
things right for this loan only. 
 
One of our adjudicators looked at Mr Hs complaint. The assessment was split into two 
parts. 
In the first part, the adjudicator concluded that, this Service could investigate loans 1  12 
(as well as loans 13  21 which LAH didnt raise a time objection too). This is because while 
the loans had been complained about more than six years after the event. The adjudicator 
hadnt seen anything to make her think Mr H had complained more than three years since he 
was or ought to have been aware, he had cause to complain.  
In the second part, the adjudicator considered whether LAH had done anything wrong when 
it advanced these loans. She hadnt seen enough to say LAH had made an error when loans 
1-5 were advanced. So, these loans werent upheld. 
But the adjudicator did uphold the complaint about loans 6  21 because in her view, the 
pattern of lending was now harmful for Mr H. 
Mr Hs representative acknowledged the adjudicators findings. 
LAH didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment. In its response to the adjudicator LAH 
didnt focus on whether it was wrong to have provided some of the loans, instead it focused 
on whether this Service had the jurisdiction to consider loans 1 - 12. In summary it said:
It disagreed with the approach this Service had taken with this case.
In this case, LAH told this Service Mr H received arrears letters in 2016 and 2017 
following periods of either no payments being made, or reduced repayments being 
received. 
LAH has failed to establish contact with Mr H in order to ask him when he became 
aware, he had cause to complain. Therefore, there is insufficient information to be 
able to conclude the loans are within this Services jurisdiction. 
No evidence has been provided as to why this case is in this Services jurisdiction 
and as such, LAH hasnt given this Service approval to consider these loans.  
The adjudicator went back to LAH and explained why its comments didnt change her mind. 
She said, copies of the arrears letters LAH says were sent havent been provided and she 
reiterated shed not seen enough to suggest the case was outside of this Services 
jurisdiction.  
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
Why I can look into this complaint
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments provided by Mr H and LAH to 
decide whether we are able to look at loans 1  12 (in addition to already being able to 
consider loans 13  21). Having done so, I have reached the same conclusion as the 
adjudicator  that I have the power to consider all of Mr Hs loans. Ill explain why. 
The rules I must apply say that, where a business doesnt agree, I cant look at a complaint made more than six years after whats been complained about. Or if later, more than three 
years after the complaint in this case, Mr H knew, or ought to really have known they had 
reason to complain. This is set out in Dispute Resolution rule 2.8.2R and can be found online 
in the FCAs Handbook. 
Its clear all of Mr Hs loans 1-12 were complained about more than six years after they were 
taken. However, Ive not seen anything to persuade me Mr H was aware or ought to have 
been reasonably aware more than three years before he raised this complaint, that he had 
reason to complain. 
LAH has said that when Mr H experienced repayment problems this led to arrears letters 
being sent to him in 2016 and 2017.  However, while LAH hasnt said so, I understand these 
letters have been raised because in LAHs view these arrears notices ought to have been 
enough to make Mr H realise he could complain.  But I dont think this is enough in this 
particular case to demonstrate that.
I say this because whilst experiencing repayment problems and therefore struggling to repay 
the lending would no doubt have led Mr H to realise there was a problem (in terms of his 
financial difficulty), Im not persuaded this would have (or ought to have), in itself, made him  
aware that these problems were caused by LAH doing something wrong when it agreed the 
loans. 
In addition, a copy of these arrears letters hasnt been provided, so I cant say what LAH did 
or didnt tell Mr H at the time. 
I appreciate LAH hasnt been able to get hold of Mr H, but in this case, I havent seen 
anything else to persuade me that Mr H was or ought to have become aware he could 
complain more than three years before he did.
So, like our adjudicator, I loans 1 - 12 were raised within the time limits I need to apply and 
that I do have the power to consider all of the loans Mr H was given. Ill now go on and 
consider whether or not I think all the loans complained about were lent responsibly. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice
at the time the loan was provided.
LAH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H could repay 
the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that LAH should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr H. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become or was becoming
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to say that LAH was required to establish whether Mr H 
could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all mean for Mr Hs complaint.
Loans 1 - 5
The adjudicator didnt uphold Mr Hs complaint about these loans. Neither Mr H (nor his 
representatives) disagreed with the adjudicators findings, so I no longer think these loans 
are in dispute. So I dont intend to make a finding about them.  
But I have kept in mind these loans when thinking about Mr Hs overall lending relationship 
with LAH.  
Loans 6 - 21
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 6 - 21 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below.
 
In addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Mr H, LAH also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Mr H.
Having looked at the overall pattern of LAHs lending history with Mr H, LAH should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the 
time it provided loan 6. I say this because:
By loan 6 it was 14 months into the lending relationship and Mr H had been indebted 
to LAH for whole time. In my view, Mr Hs loan history up until this point was a clear 
indication that his underlying financial situation didnt seem to be improving. 
Mr Hs first loan was for £500 with loan 6 being for £200. Although loan 6 is for a 
smaller amount, compared to loan 1, Mr H took loan 5 on the same day, so at this 
point in time Mr H had been advanced £700. So, there were no signs that his 
indebtedness was decreasing at this point. 
From loan 6 onwards Mr Hs pattern of taking new loans shortly after a previous loan 
had been repaid continued and at times he had up to 4 loans running at the same 
time.   
By the point of loan 21, Mr H was making a commitment to make repayments to LAH 
for almost another year, after already being indebted for over four and half years. So, 
Mr H wasnt making any inroads into what he owed LAH. Loan 24 was also slightly smaller than loan 1, but loans 18  20 were still running, so Mr Hs indebtedness was 
significantly higher. The amount of time that Mr H spent indebted to LAH meant that 
he was in effect servicing a debt to LAH over an extended period of time.
Mr H went on to have significant repayment problems when repaying loans 18  21 to the 
point where LAH says it took the decision to write off the balances that were due. This 
further reinforces my view that these loans were not sustainable for Mr H. 
I think that Mr H lost out when LAH provided loans 6 - 21 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the number of loans and time in debt was likely to have had negative implications on 
Mr Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6  21 Ive set out below what LAH 
should do to put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress LAH should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what
might have happened had it not provided lending from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought to
have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mr H may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative 
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Mr H in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Mr H would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce LAHs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
LAH shouldnt have given Mr H loans 6 - 21.
A. LAH should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr H towards interest, 
fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything you have already refunded.
B. LAH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr H 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr H originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. LAH may  if it chooses to  use the total of A plus B to repay any principal which LAH has written-off.
D. LAH should pay any remaining refund to Mr H. If there is no refund left and still a 
balance outstanding made up of written-off principal, it would not be fair for LAH to 
pursue this further.
E. The overall pattern of Mr Hs borrowing for loans 6 - 21 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so LAH should remove these loans entirely from 
Mr Hs credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to take off tax from this interest. LAH must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Mr Hs complaint in part. 
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right for Mr H as directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2022.
