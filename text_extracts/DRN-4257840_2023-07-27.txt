Complaint
Mr P has complained about personal loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) provided to him. He says the loans were unaffordable.
Background
118 118 Money provided Mr P with a loan for £2,000.00 in May 2019. This loan had an APR 
of 39.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total amount to be repaid of 
£2,774.16, including interest, fees and charges of £774.16, was due to be repaid in 24 
monthly instalments of just under £115.59. This loan was settled early in February 2021. 
118 118 Money then provided Mr P with a second loan for £1,300.00 June 2021. This loan 
had an APR of 44.9% and a term of 24 months. This meant that the total amount to be 
repaid of £1,847.28, including interest, fees and charges of £547.28, was due to be repaid in 
24 monthly instalments of £76.97. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mr Ps complaint and he concluded that 118 118 Money 
didnt do anything wrong when providing loan 1 but that it ought to have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided Mr P with loan 2. 
Mr P didnt disagree with our adjudicators assessment but 118 118 Money did. So the case 
was passed to an ombudsman for a final decision.
As neither party has disagreed with the outcome reached on loan 1, this decision is only 
looking at whether 118 118 Money acted fairly and reasonably towards Mr P when providing 
him with loan 2. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr Ps complaint. 
Having carefully considered everything Ive decided to uphold Mr Ps complaint. Ill explain 
why in a little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
is 118 118 Money needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand 
whether Mr P could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
I think that 118 118 Money ought to have realised from the credit checks it carried out that 
Mr P was already significantly indebted and that his number of active credit accounts had 
increased between applications. This coupled with the fact that the payments to this loan 
would result in him paying out a reasonable proportion of his monthly income towards 
repayments to credit meant that 118 118 Money ought to have found out more about more 
about Mr P before determining that this loan was affordable for him. 
I think further checks would have extended into finding out more about Mr Ps expenditure. 
And if 118 118 Money had done this here, Im persuaded that it would have seen that Mr P 
was already in a difficult financial position at the time of this application. Im also satisfied 
that reasonable and proportionate checks would more likely than not have shown 118 118 
Money that Mr Ps existing precarious financial position was because he was struggling 
financially. 
So Im persuaded by what Mr P has said about already being in a difficult financial position 
at the time and the reasons for this. And as reasonable and proportionate checks should 
have extended into finding out more about Mr Ps income and expenditure, Im satisfied that 
they would more like than not have shown 118 118 Money that it shouldnt have provided 
loan 2 to Mr P. As 118 118 Money provided Mr P with loan 2, notwithstanding this, Im 
satisfied it failed to act fairly and reasonably towards him. 
Mr P ended up paying interest, fees and charges on a loan he shouldnt have been provided 
with in the first place. So Im satisfied that Mr P lost out because of what 118 118 Money did 
wrong and that it should put things right.
Fair compensation  what 118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Mr P
Having thought about everything, 118 118 Money should put things right for Mr P by:
refunding all interest fees, and charges Mr P paid as a result of loan 2:
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Mr P to the date of settlement
removing any adverse information it may have recorded about loan 2 from Mr Ps 
credit file; 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Ps complaint. Madison CF UK Limited 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2023.
