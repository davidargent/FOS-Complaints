The complaint
Mr M is unhappy with the payment schedule for an extension to a hire agreement provided 
by LeasePlan UK Limited.
What happened
In March 2018 Mr M took a hire agreement with LeasePlan to acquire a car. Around 
February 2022 Mr M signed an agreement to extend the hire period by a further twelve 
months. 
Mr M says he was expecting the payments for the extension to be taken from April 2022. 
But, a payment wasnt taken from his account when he thought it was due and he queried 
this with LeasePlan. 
LeasePlan got in touch with Mr M and explained that while his original agreement was paid 
in advance, the extension was due to be paid in arrears. So, it explained the first payment for 
the extension would be taken in May 2022.
Mr M remained unhappy and complained. He then made our service aware of the situation. 
He said, in summary, that what had happened was a breach of contract. He said this 
situation meant he would have to make two payments in one month when he leased a 
further car at the end of the agreement. And he said the situation had caused him significant 
distress.
In September 2022 LeasePlan issued a final response to Mr Ms complaint. In summary, this 
said the contract for the extension explained the payment for April 2022 would be taken a 
month after. LeasePlan said it could understand the confusion caused. It also apologised for 
the delay in responding to Mr M. LeasePlan said as a gesture of goodwill it would credit 
Mr Ms account with one months rental - £187.26  in light of stress and inconvenience 
caused.
Mr M remained unhappy. He said, in summary, that the extension agreement explained the 
first payment would be taken in April 2022. He said LeasePlan had been vindictive and 
manipulative. He reiterated how stressful he found the situation and said LeasePlan should 
compensate him for the time spent on the complaint.
Our investigator issued an opinion. She said, in summary, that as LeasePlan had agreed to 
credit Mr Ms account with a months payment he was now better off than previously. She 
said there was no guarantee Mr M would end up making a double payment at the end of 
the agreement. And she said she thought LeasePlans offer was fair.
Mr M remained unhappy. He said LeasePlan had agreed compensation for the delays in 
responding, not for the issue around payment dates. He said this amount hadnt been 
credited to his account. And he said he would definitely be paying for a new lease in April 
2023.
Our investigator explained this didnt change her opinion. But, she did ask LeasePlan if it 
would be willing to credit Mr Ms bank account with the £187.26 rather than crediting his 
account linked to the agreement. LeasePlan agreed to do this.
As Mr M remained unhappy, the case has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I think the offer LeasePlan has made to put things right is fair and 
reasonable. Ill explain why.
Mr M complains about a hire agreement. Entering into regulated agreements such as this is 
a regulated activity, so Im satisfied I can consider Mr Ms complaint about LeasePlan.
Firstly, I want to reassure Mr M that Ive carefully considered everything hes said about this 
complaint and all of the points hes raised. Where I havent commented on a specific point, 
this isnt because I think it unimportant. This just reflects the informal nature of our service 
and the fact Im going to focus on what I think are the key facts here and the crux of Mr Ms 
complaint.
Ive considered the contract extension that Mr M signed in February 2022. In relation to 
payment dates, under a heading Timing of Rental Payments this says:
One of £187.26 (inc VAT) payable on the 27/04/22, followed by 11 rentals each of £187.26 
(inc VAT) the first payable 1 month after the 27/04/22 with subsequent Rentals payable on 
the corresponding day of each subsequent month
Thinking about this, I can see why Mr M was expecting the first payment to be taken in April 
2022  as this is what the agreement appears to state.
LeasePlan have explained payments due under an extension are paid in arrears, so the first 
payment was actually due in May 2022. Considering this, Im satisfied here that LeasePlan 
has done something wrong by giving Mr M the impression a payment would be taken in April 
2022. 
I know Mr M feels very strongly that this issue is a breach of contract and significant 
compensation is due. Hes gone into some detail about this and Ive carefully considered 
everything hes said. But, I need to consider what actually went wrong here. Mr M agreed to 
extend the term of the agreement by twelve months, which was set up. He agreed to make 
twelve payments of £187.26, which was also set up. Hes kept the car, presumably using it 
as was his intention. And LeasePlan told him the correct date the payment would be taken 
before it was due.
So, its important to point out that what Im considering here is what would be reasonable to 
put things right, specifically for the fact LeasePlan gave Mr M the impression a payment 
would be taken on one date, when it was actually due a month later.Mr M explained the situation would make managing his finances more difficult as he would 
have to make a double payment in April 2023 if he decided to lease another car. I 
appreciate his point here, but I dont think this means he is financially worse off. I say this as, 
because of how the payment dates worked out, it appears Mr M didnt make a payment in 
April 2022  to either the original agreement nor the extension. So, he could use these funds 
to cover the final payment due. But, I do recognise there would be some inconvenience 
caused by this.
Im also satisfied Mr M wouldve been caused some distress and inconvenience when he 
realised his payment hadnt been taken as he expected. And I appreciate LeasePlan have 
taken some time to respond to him at points, but it did explain the situation to him in May 
2022 shortly after he queried what was happening.
LeasePlan has offered to pay Mr M £187.26 to put things right. Mr M feels LeasePlan only 
offered this amount in relation to delays in responding to his complaint. Im not sure I agree 
here, but I do think the final response is perhaps a little unclear about exactly what 
LeasePlan was offering this for. 
That being said, I dont need to make a finding on what I think LeasePlans intention was 
with this offer. I say this as, whatever LeasePlans intention was here, I think the amount of 
£187.26 is fair and reasonable to reflect what happened under all of the circumstances of 
this complaint.
My final decision
LeasePlan UK Limited has offered to pay Mr M £187.26 to reflect the distress and 
inconvenience caused.
My final decision is that this offer is fair and reasonable under the circumstances of this 
complaint.
So I instruct LeasePlan UK Limited, if it hasnt already done so, to pay Mr M £187.26.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 February 2023.
