The complaint
Ms M complains that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) was irresponsible 
to lend to her.
What happened
Ms M had one loan from 118 118 Money in August 2020 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly 
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 2 Aug 2020 £1,000 18m £91.89 16 Feb 2022 On time
She also had a credit card with the following credit limits:
August 2020 £1,200
September 2021 £1,700
Ms M says she was experiencing financial difficulties at the time of the lending and 
appropriate checks would have revealed this. She says she wasnt asked to prove her 
income or expenditure and was borrowing regularly from other lenders. Ms M adds that the 
unaffordable lending affected her mental health.
118 118 Money says it asked Ms M about her income and expenditure and also checked her 
credit file. It says it acted correctly in approving Ms Ms credit applications.
Our investigator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. Although she did not 
consider 118 118 Moneys checks went far enough, she found that proportionate checks 
were unlikely to have shown the lending was irresponsible.
Ms M responded, in summary, to say that the whole picture needed to be considered before 
deciding the lending was affordable, including her stress levels and the lack of support from 
118 118 Money.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I need to take into account the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice. 
Bearing this in mind, in coming to a decision on Ms Ms case, Ive considered the following:
Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks when assessing 
Ms Ms loan application to satisfy itself that she would be able to repay the credit in a 
sustainable way? 
oIf not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown? 
Did 118 118 Money make fair lending decisions?
Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Loan and Credit Card applications
When Ms M applied for the lending, Ive seen evidence to show 118 118 Money checked her 
credit file and asked about her income and personal circumstances. These checks showed:
A declared income of £1,240 per month;
Ms M had no dependants;
There were seven defaults registered on the credit file:
oNone were in the previous 12 months, although four were in 2019;
oTwo had been satisfied;
oThe remaining five had a combined balance of just over £1,650;
Ms M had two existing credit cards on which she had a combined balance of £406 
with a total limit of £600;
She was up to date with her utility and motor insurance credit payments which 
totalled just under £200 per month;
The affordability check used a figure of £330 for Ms Ms monthly rent;
118 118 Money had used industry standards to estimate her other regular 
expenditure at £402;
Based on the above Im not satisfied 118 118 Moneys checks went far enough because:
The loan was for 18 months, and 118 118 Money needed to be satisfied that the 
repayments were sustainable for that period;
I cant see that 118 118 Money verified Ms Ms income or rental cost;
Given the adverse information on Ms Ms credit file, I consider it would have been 
proportionate for 118 118 Money to gain a thorough understanding of Ms Ms current 
financial situation.
Ms M has submitted her bank statements from the time, and Ive used these as a reasonable 
proxy for what proportionate checks may have shown 118 118 Money:
Ms Ms income averaged £1,088 in the lead up to the initial lending;
She was paying £550 per month in rent, with council tax and utilities costing £242;
Ms Ms sister contributed £425 per month towards rent and bills;
Insurance cost Ms M £73 per month, with commitments to credit cards and a debt 
management company coming to around £60;
Other regular expenditure totalled just over £170, and Ms M spent around £100 per 
month on food and petrol.This left Ms M with just over £300 of disposable income each month. Given the adverse 
information on her credit file was historical and her active accounts were up to date, I 
consider that 118 118 Money would still have found the lending was affordable to Ms M.
Credit limit increase
In September 2021, over a year after Ms M took out the credit card, 118 118 Money 
increased its credit limit from £1,200 to £1,700. Ive looked at how Ms M managed her credit 
card in the lead up to the limit increase and found:
All payments were made on time and the account was up-to date;
The account balance was within the limit for the six months before September 2021;
Ms M was consistently repaying more than the minimum amount.
Given the above, the fact that Ms M was making all her loan repayments on time, and her 
credit file showed all her other active accounts were up-to-date in September 2021, I cant 
conclude that 118 118 Money was wrong to increase the credit limit when it did.
Finally, Ive considered whether 118 118 Money acted unfairly in any other way. I accept 
Ms M says the lending affected her mental health, but I havent seen any evidence to show 
118 118 Money was made aware of these issues. I can see that both Ms Ms accounts are 
now closed and neither has any adverse information recorded on her credit file. As such, I 
cant conclude that 118 118 Money needs to take any further action regarding this complaint.
Based on all the evidence, I find 118 118 Money made fair lending decisions for the loan and 
the credit card, and I cant see it acted unfairly in any other way.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2023.
