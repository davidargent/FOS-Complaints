The complaint
Mr S complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mr S and his wife entered into a timeshare sales agreement to part-exchange their existing 
timeshare for another timeshare in July 2010. Mr S entered into a credit card agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance in July 2010 and he used it to pay £3,995 to the timeshare 
company on buy now - pay later terms for the timeshare. Barclays Partner Finance says 
that the credit was settled in November 2010 when a payment of £3,995 was made to the 
account which reduced the balance to zero. 
A claim was made to Barclays Partner Finance in October 2016 under section 140A of the 
Consumer Credit Act that the timeshare company: didnt conduct a proper assessment of 
Mr Ss financial position and ability to repay the loan; applied considerable pressure to Mr S 
and his wife to procure their agreement to the loan; and breached EU law. 
Barclays Partner Finance said that the purchase and subsequent events were made over six 
years ago so the complaint was time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980 and it had no 
obligation to investigate the complaint. Mr S wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint 
was made to this service which said that the complaint wasnt time-barred because Barclays 
Partner Finance had paid a commission to the timeshare company and that under section 32 
of the Limitation Act the limitation period doesnt begin to run until such time as it and the 
timeshare company had acknowledged that such a commission was paid. Mr Ss 
representative then made a complaint to Barclays Partner Finance that it had paid a 
commission to the timeshare company which hadnt been disclosed to Mr S and which 
rendered the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld. He said that this 
service couldnt consider the complaint about any commission payments as that point wasnt 
raised in the section 140A claim letter to Barclays Partner Finance. He said that he hadnt 
seen anything that would suggest that the lending was unaffordable or enough evidence to 
conclude that Mr S felt that he had no option but to say yes to the purchase.
Mr Ss representative, on his behalf, says that it doesnt agree with our investigators 
recommendation and has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
the claim that was made to Barclays Partner Finance by Mr Ss representative in 
October 2017 was that the timeshare company: didnt conduct a proper assessment 
of Mr Ss financial position and ability to repay the loan; applied considerable 
pressure to Mr S and his wife to procure their agreement to the loan; and breached 
EU law;
that claim didnt include a claim that Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to 
the timeshare company which hadnt been disclosed to Mr S and which rendered the 
agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A  so that issue hadnt been considered by 
Barclays Partner Finance when it sent its final response letter to Mr Ss 
representative in November 2016 and our investigator said that this service couldnt 
consider the complaint about any commission payments;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Mr Ss representative made a claim that Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission 
to the timeshare company which hadnt been disclosed to Mr S and which rendered 
the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A in December 2016;
Mr S used the Barclays Partner Finance credit card to pay £3,995 to the timeshare 
company and its provided evidence to show that the credit was settled in November 
2010 when a payment of £3,995 was made to the account which reduced the 
balance to zero  so Mr S would have had six years from then to make a claim to 
Barclays Partner Finance and any such claim would have had to have been made by 
November 2016  but the claim wasnt made until December 2016 so, even if this 
service was able to consider a claim about the commission payments, I consider that 
it would be time-barred under the Limitation Act;
Mr Ss representative says that the commission was concealed from Mr S so the 
limitation period doesnt begin to run until the time that Mr S became aware of it in 
accordance with section 32 of the Limitation Act;
section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors 
right of action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation 
doesnt begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with 
reasonable diligence have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that 
deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some 
time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid 
by Barclays Partner Finance to the timeshare company and from what this service 
has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of 
less than 10% and I consider it be unlikely that Barclays Partner Finance breached 
any duty in making any such payment or was under any regulatory duty to disclose 
the amount of commission paid in these circumstances;
I dont consider that the level of commission that was normally paid in this type of 
situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays Partner Finance should have 
appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr S risked the relationship being 
unfair under section 140A and Im not persuaded that the commission was 
deliberately concealed from Mr S - so even if I was able to consider Mr Ss claim 
about the commission payments, I wouldnt be persuaded that there was enough evidence to show that any commission payments caused the relationship between 
Mr S and Barclays Partner Finance to be unfair or that it would be likely that a court 
would conclude that the relationship was unfair;
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ss complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down his section 140A 
claim under the Limitation and I consider that he referred his complaint to this service 
within six years of the event that hes complained about  which is the turning down 
of his claim - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to his claim - 
Im not determining the outcome of his claim under section 140A as only a court 
would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner 
Finances response to his claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr Ss representatives claim letter to Barclays Partner Finance was sent in October 
2016 and, for the reason set out above, I consider that he had until November 2016 
to make a claim under section 140A  so I dont consider that his claim about the 
issues set out in that letter is time-barred under the Limitation Act;
Mr S has provided information about the sale of the timeshare to him and his wife but 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they were unduly 
pressurised into buying the timeshare, that Mr S was unduly pressurised into entering 
into the credit card agreement, or that the timeshare company used unacceptable 
commercial practices against them  Mr S didnt complain to Barclays Partner 
Finance about the way that the timeshare had been sold to them until October 2016 
(which was more than six years after theyd bought the timeshare in July 2010) and I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have complained to Barclays 
Partner Finance about any issues with the way that the timeshare was sold to them 
before then;
Mr Ss representative says that the timeshare company didnt conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr Ss financial position and ability to repay the loan - Mr S used the 
Barclays Partner Finance credit card to pay £3,995 to the timeshare company and 
the credit was settled in November 2010 when a payment of £3,995 was made to the 
account which reduced the balance to zero;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr S contacted Barclays Partner Finance about 
any financial difficulties or that he complained about the affordable checks until 
October 2016, which was more than six years after he used the credit card to pay for 
the timeshare, and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
credit wasnt affordable for him at the time that it was provided to him;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the timeshare 
company has failed to comply with any legal requirements for which Barclays 
Partner Finance would be liable;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the relationship 
between Mr S and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair in these circumstances 
and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that the 
relationship was unfair;
I dont consider that Barclays Partner Finance properly considered the reasons that it 
wasnt progressing with Mr Ss claim so I cant say that it acted fairly and reasonably in response to his claim  but I consider that it wouldnt have upheld the claim if it had 
properly considered it; and 
I sympathise with Mr S and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their 
timeshare and the difficulties that Mr S has described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair 
or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to 
refund to him any of the money that he paid for the timeshare, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 July 2022.
