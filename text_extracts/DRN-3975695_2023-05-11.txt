The complaint
Mrs M complains about the advice Pension Works Limited (PWL) gave to her to transfer the 
benefits from her two defined-benefit (DB) occupational pension schemes to a self-invested 
personal pension (SIPP). She says the advice was unsuitable for her and believes this has 
caused a financial loss.
Professional representatives have helped Mrs M to bring this complaint. But, for ease of 
reading, I will refer to the representatives comments as being Mrs Ms.
What happened
A firm of financial advisers, which Ill call Firm G, which didnt have the necessary regulatory 
permissions to arrange pension transfers, had previously introduced Mrs Ms husband to 
another pension advising firm to arrange the transfer of his DB scheme to a personal 
pension. In 2021 Firm G introduced Mrs M to PWL to discuss her pension and retirement 
needs. 
PWL completed a fact-find to gather information about Mrs Ms circumstances and 
objectives. It also asked her to complete a defined benefit transfer questionnaire. Amongst 
other things PWL recorded that:
Mrs M was 58 years old married with one adult, non-dependent, daughter.
Mrs M had finished work the previous year and considered herself retired.
Her husband, Mr M, was 53, still working and earning around £82,000 a year. He had 
a net income of £3,700 a month which, after paying for bills and outgoings left £1,000 
a month disposable income.
They owned their own home (save for a nominal mortgage of £1).
They had cash savings worth around £90,000.
Mr M had a personal pension valued at around £630,000. He was also paying into 
his employers pension scheme which had a value of around £65,000.
They estimated that, once Mr M had retired, which he anticipated being once hed 
turned 57, they would require an income of £3,000 a month.
Mrs M had a personal pension with a fund value of around £10,000. 
She also had two DB scheme pensions from former employers. One, from an 
employer Ill call G, had a cash equivalent transfer value (CETV) of around £59,250. 
That would pay Mrs M a pension of £1,778 at age 65. PWL said the critical yield (the 
growth rate require to match the benefits from the DB scheme by investing 
elsewhere) was 6.66%. It had calculated that should Mrs M wish to buy an annuity to 
match the DB scheme then this could cost her around £70,800 which was roughly 
£11,500 more than her CETV.
Mrs M was also a deferred member of a DB scheme with a former employer Ill call T. 
That had A CETV of around £33,000 and would pay her a pension of around £1,320 
a year. The critical yield to match the benefits from that scheme was 10.84% at age 
65. PWL had calculated that an equivalent annuity could cost Mrs M around £52,100, 
which was around £19,000 more than Ts DB fund CETV.
Mrs M completed an online attitude to risk assessment. PWL also discussed her risk 
appetite with her. She confirmed that she believed her risk appetite was six out of ten (with 
one being cautious risk and ten being high).
In line with the regulators guidance, PWL initially completed abridged advice. Having done 
so, Mrs M confirmed that she wanted PWL to provide full advice and would pay PWLs fee of 
£2,559 in order to do so.
PWL then produced its suitability report setting out its analysis and recommendations. It 
recommended that Mrs M should transfer the funds from both her DB schemes into a named 
SIPP. It noted that Mr M had suitable income to cover both their income needs in retirement. 
And that Mrs M had 100% capacity for loss. It said that by transferring Mrs M could access 
her pension funds flexibly and in a tax efficient manner, reducing her income once her state 
pension became payable. It added that Mrs M would pay Firm G 0.5% of her fund value 
each year for ongoing financial advice.
Mrs M went ahead and transferred both DB scheme funds to the named SIPP.
In May 2022 Mrs M complained to PWL that the advice to transfer wasnt suitable for her. 
PWL didnt uphold her complaint. Mrs M then brought it to us. One of our investigators 
looked into it. He didnt think PWL had dealt with Mrs M fairly so he said it should 
compensate her for any loss shed suffered as a result of its unsuitable advice. He also 
recommended that it should pay her £300 to address her distress and inconvenience arising 
from that advice.
PWL didnt agree with our investigators assessment of the complaint. Amongst other things 
it said its advice was suitable, in line with Mrs Ms attitude to risk and met her objectives. It 
added that its cash-flow models demonstrated that Mrs M would be better off by transferring. 
Our investigator wasnt persuaded to change his view of the complaint so its been passed to 
me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In bringing this complaint and responding to it both Mrs M and PWL have made a number of 
detailed points. I've considered everything on file and listened to the call recordings that 
PWL helpfully provided. But in this decision I don't intend to address each and every issue 
raised. Instead I will focus on what I see as being the key matters at the heart of Mrs Ms 
complaint and the reasons for my decision. 
Ive taken into account relevant law and regulations, regulators rules, guidance and 
standards and codes of practice, and what I consider to have been good industry practice at 
the time. This includes the Principles for Business (PRIN) and the Conduct of Business 
Sourcebook (COBS). And where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, 
I reach my conclusions on the balance of probabilities  that is, what I think is more likely 
than not to have happened based on the available evidence and the wider surrounding 
circumstances.
The applicable rules, regulations and requirements
The below is not a comprehensive list of the rules and regulations which applied at the time 
of the advice, but provides useful context for my assessment of PWL's actions here.PRIN 6: A firm must pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.
PRIN 7: A firm must pay due regard to the information needs of its clients, and communicate 
information to them in a way which is clear, fair and not misleading.
COBS 2.1.1R: A firm must act honestly, fairly and professionally in accordance with the best 
interests of its client (the client's best interests rule).
The provisions in COBS 9 which deal with the obligations when giving a personal 
recommendation and assessing suitability. And the provisions in COBS 19 which specifically 
relate to a DB pension transfer.
Having considered all of this and the evidence in this case, Ive decided to uphold the 
complaint for broadly similar reasons to those our investigator gave.
The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), states in COBS 19.1.6G that the 
starting assumption for a transfer from a DB scheme is that it is unsuitable. So, PWL should 
have only considered transfers if it could clearly demonstrate that those were in Mrs Ms best 
interests. And having looked at all the evidence available, Im not satisfied they were in her 
best interests.
Financial viability 
PWL carried out an appropriate pension transfer analysis report (as required by the 
regulator). That showed how much Mrs Ms pension fund would need to grow by each year 
in order to provide the same benefits as her DB scheme (the critical yield). It also provided a 
transfer value comparator (TVC), which showed what it could cost Mrs M to buy an annuity 
which matched the DB scheme benefits. 
The advice was given after the regulator gave instructions in Final Guidance FG17/9 as to 
how businesses could calculate future 'discount rates' in loss assessments where a 
complaint about a past pension transfer was being upheld. Prior to October 2017 similar 
rates were published by the Financial Ombudsman Service on our website. Whilst 
businesses weren't required to refer to these rates when giving advice on pension transfers, 
they provide a useful indication of what growth rates would have been considered 
reasonably achievable for a typical investor.
Mrs M was 58 at the time of the advice. She had no intention of working again and 
considered herself to be retired. But she wasnt taking any retirement income at that point 
and its clear that Mr Ms salary was supporting both of them. Mrs Ms DB schemes both had 
a normal retirement age of 65. The critical yields required to match Mrs Ms benefits at age 
65 was 6.66% for a full pension from G and 10.84% for a full pension from T. While PWL has 
commented in its suitability report that Mrs M wanted to maximise her tax free sum, it's not 
documented on file that Mrs M had any desire to take a tax-free lump sum from her DB 
funds immediately, or what she needed this money for.
The relevant discount rate closest to when the advice was given which I can refer to was 
published by the Financial Ombudsman Service for the period before 1 October 2017, and 
was 3.3% per year for 6 full years to retirement. Ive kept in mind that the regulator's 
projection rates had also remained unchanged since 2014: the regulator's upper projection 
rate at the time was 8%, the middle projection rate 5%, and the lower projection rate 2%. 
I've taken this into account, along with the composition of assets in the discount rate, 
Mrs Ms high medium attitude to risk and also the term to retirement. There would be little 
point in Mrs M giving up the guarantees available to her through her DB scheme only to achieve, at best, the same level of benefits outside the scheme. But here, the lowest critical 
yield was 6.66% so her reinvested funds would have to perform particularly well in order to 
match the benefits from the DB schemes. Similarly, PWLs TVCs show that, in order to 
achieve equivalent benefits from an annuity, Mrs M would have to spend around £30,000 
more than her CETVs were worth together. So I think Mrs M was likely to receive benefits of 
a substantially lower overall value than the DB scheme at retirement, as a result of investing 
in line with that attitude to risk. 
I should say here that Im not convinced Mrs Ms attitude to risk was in fact six out of ten, 
which Id consider to be high-medium. It doesnt seem to me that she had the knowledge or 
experience to understand or accept the risks that such an investment strategy would pose, 
even if she did have some capacity for loss. However, for the purpose of this decision I dont 
think it makes a difference. Thats because even if Mrs M did have a high-medium attitude to 
risk, as Ive said above, I think its unlikely she would be able to match, let alone exceed the 
relevant critical yields and so would likely be worse off even if PWL had assessed her risk 
appetite as lower than six out of ten.
PWL has provided cashflow models which it says show Mrs M wouldve been able to meet 
her needs despite the high critical yields. It says that these showed, at Mrs Ms life 
expectancy of 87, she and Mr M could expect to have accrued savings of £1,015,313 
compared to a lower sum of £947,407 if she took her pensions from the DB schemes. In 
other words it says its models show that Mr and Mrs M would be better off if Mrs M 
transferred her DB funds to a SIPP. However, the models PWL refers to assume that Mr and 
Mrs Ms pensions investments will all grow at 5.99% each and every year. 
Furthermore, PWLs models also include a stress test scenario where the transfer value 
and pensions investments fell by 20% in the first couple of years and then grew at variable 
return rates after that. That model shows that Mr and Mrs M would have considerably 
reduced saving of £507,727 when Mrs M was age 87, which is only around 54% of the 
model where Mrs M took her DB funds directly from the schemes. So PWLs models show 
that if there were periods of poor performance and the investments suffered losses, Mrs Ms 
financial assets would be lower in the long-term than if she kept her DB pensions.
Also, as PWL will know, past performance is no guarantee for future performance and so a 
consistent year on year return of 5.99% seems unlikely. So I consider the discount rates and 
the regulators standard projections to be more realistic in this regard in the long term rather 
than projecting historic returns forward. Also it's notable that while PWL said that matching 
the income from Gs DB scheme was potentially achievable it said that matching the income 
from Ts DB scheme was not. So I think PWL recognised that Mrs M was likely to be worse 
off by transferring. PWL said it recommended transferring anyway as Mrs M wasnt looking 
to copy the DB scheme benefits and was prepared to give those up in order to access her 
benefits tax efficiently. But just because an individual is prepared to give up benefits doesn't 
mean that its in their best interests to do so. 
In summary, Mrs M was likely to be worse off by transferring. So I don't think a transfer out 
of the DB schemes was in her best interests. Of course financial viability isnt the only 
consideration when giving transfer advice, as PWL has argued in this case. There might be 
other considerations which mean a transfer is suitable, despite providing overall lower 
benefits. Ive considered this below. When doing so I've been mindful that PWLs role was to 
find out what Mrs Ms wants and needs were and why. Its role wasnt simply to do what she 
wanted without appropriate analysis and challenge of her motives for doing so, in order to 
ensure its recommendation was in her best interests.Flexibility and income needs
PWLs said that transferring her DB schemes funds allowed Mrs M to access those flexibly. 
And I've noted that Mrs M rated control over how she could access her funds as being her 
number one priority in retirement. But, while that might have been something that was nice 
to have, I dont think Mrs M required flexibility in retirement. This is because based on the 
evidence Ive seen, I dont think she had a genuine need to access her DB scheme funds 
earlier than the schemes normal retirement age. I say this because Mrs M had already 
retired, she had no intention of going back to work again and, as a result, she had no income 
of her own. But its apparent that Mr Ms salary was supporting both of them. So she had no 
need to access her DB funds at all at the time that PWL gave its advice. 
In response to our investigators assessment of the complaint PWL said that the question 
shouldnt be why should Mrs M have accessed her funds when she did but why shouldnt 
she have taken those then. I think the answer to that question is a simple one. In transferring 
she was putting her otherwise safeguarded benefits at risk. She had no desire to take those 
benefits at that time, so she had no reason to take the risks of losing or reducing those. In 
my view, it simply wasnt in her best interests to do so just to have flexibility she had no need 
for. 
PWL has now argued that by transferring when she did Mrs M was able to benefit from the 
high CETV rates that were available at the time. And its pointed out that, owing to market 
conditions, CETV rates have now fallen and that this was predictable. It is the case that 
CETV rates have since fallen, and PWL might well have been anticipating that. However, I 
dont think that is something it couldve been certain about and as far as I can see this is not 
something that PWL referred to at any point during the advice process. It doesn't refer to this 
in its suitability report as being a reason to transfer at that point in time. And it didnt discuss 
this with Mrs M when it asked her in its phone calls why she should transfer then. So I dont 
think this was genuinely a reason it recommended transferring as, if it was I would have 
expected PWL to refer to it. But it didnt do so. And in any event, securing the value of the 
CETV is only relevant if transferring out of the scheme was suitable for Mrs M and in her 
best interests. As Ive set out above and will continue to explain below, I dont think it was.
Further I cant see evidence that Mrs M had a strong need for variable income throughout 
her retirement. This is because its apparent that the majority of her income in retirement 
would come from Mr Ms pension. So Mrs M had no need to access her benefits flexibly, 
either immediately or at her normal retirement age of 65. But by transferring when she did 
she was putting those funds at risk. Its evident that Mr Ms private pensions were all 
exposed to investment risk, whereas Mrs Ms DB income was guaranteed. In light of this, I 
dont think giving up their only guaranteed source of private pension income was in Mrs Ms 
best interests.
I've noted PWLs point that, given that Mr M had a healthy pension fund, Mrs M didnt need 
her pension at all and Mr Ms pension investments provided a large capacity for loss. So she 
could afford to take investment risks as her DB schemes income would only represent a 
small fraction of their joint retirement income. I agree thats the case. But, apart from a small 
personal pension worth a total of around £10,000 and her state pension, Mrs M had no other 
pension provision of her own. So should circumstances have changed and Mr M was no 
longer in a position to support her then her DB funds could have increased her income by 
over 38% a year above her state pension level. And while that scenario might have seemed 
less likely to happen, given that she had no reason to put any of her pension at risk, I think 
its a point PWL should have raised with her.
Further PWLs commented that the regulator says that one reason a DB transfer might be 
suitable is where the consumer concerned has no need for the funds. And it would seem to be the case that Mr Ms retirement income alone would be enough to support both Mr and 
Mrs M. So I can understand why its raised this point. But, I think that overlooks the point I've 
made above that, if for some unforeseen reason Mrs M could no longer rely on Mr Ms 
pension income, for example if those were eroded by market crashes or some other 
unexpected events, then the DB scheme income could have been very important to her. But 
it doesnt appear PWL considered that possibility when making its recommendation.
Indeed I've noted that PWL spoke with Mr and Mrs M about why they were considering 
transferring her DB funds at that time. And Mr M answered that it would allow them to know 
what they would have access to once they reached retirement age. But in fact the opposite 
was true in terms of Mrs Ms DB schemes income. The precise amounts the DB schemes 
would pay Mrs M would depend on inflation and how the indexation levels her DB schemes 
guaranteed increased her pension entitlement each year. But Mrs M could be certain that 
she would receive a guaranteed income, thought to be over £3,000 a year from both 
schemes. But, by transferring those funds to a SIPP her income levels would depend on the 
investment performance of the SIPP and that could be subject to losses. So transferring 
wouldnt allow Mr and Mrs M to know what income theyd have in retirement, instead it would 
only enable them to try and benefit from any investment growth. So I don't think transferring 
really helped them to understand what their income would be in retirement. 
Also, I've noted that PWL commented in its suitability report that transferring would allow 
Mr and Mrs M to buy a campervan to indulge in their shared hobby. But Mr and Mrs M had 
considerable savings which they could have used for such a purpose if they wanted to. 
There was certainly no need for Mrs M to give up the guaranteed benefits of her DB scheme 
in order to be able to do that. 
That said, its true to say that Mrs M couldnt have had the same level of flexible access to 
her DB funds as she could from a SIPP. For example if shed wanted to take a tax free lump 
sum, then she would have had to take that at the same time as drawing a regular income 
from her pension. Whereas the SIPP would allow her to draw down funds as she saw fit. Its 
also the case that Mrs M could have taken 25% of her entire SIPP fund as a tax free lump 
sum. But the DB schemes has stricter rules about how much she could take as a lump sum. 
But, as far as I can see, Mrs M didnt express any desire to take a tax free lump sum. So 
I don't think that was something she needed to have. I can understand that greater choice 
over how much to take and when might have been an attractive prospect for Mrs M. But, as 
I've said above if she did need flexible access to funds, she could have arranged to take 
those from her cash savings in the first instance while still having a guaranteed income from 
her DB scheme once she reached 65. And I think PWL should have made the advantages of 
that clear to Mrs M. 
As I've said above I understand that the option of drawing all her pension income flexibly 
might seem like something that would be nice to have. But, I can't see that Mrs M had any 
genuine need for that flexibility that would be worth giving up guaranteed benefits for. So 
I dont think it was in her best interests to transfer her DB funds to achieve that.
Death benefits
Death benefits are an emotive subject and of course when asked, most people would like 
their loved ones to be taken care of when they die. In this case Mrs M has provided some 
contradictory information about the importance of death benefits to her. For example when 
telling PWL what her priorities for retirement were she didnt rate death benefits highly. 
Similarly when discussing her needs on the phone she said that she was more concerned 
about what she wanted to do in her own lifetime rather than provide death benefits. But 
when completing the defined benefit transfer questionnaire, she strongly agree(d) that she 
would want any residual money from her DB fund passed to her dependents in the event of her death, rather than Mr M receiving the guaranteed income that he would otherwise be 
entitled to from the DB schemes. So I can understand why PWL believed that this was an 
important factor for Mrs M. 
The lump sum death benefits on offer through a personal pension or a SIPP is often an 
attractive feature to people considering a DB transfer. Thats because whatever was left 
within a personal pension or SIPP at the date of death would be passed on to family. And, if 
that happened in Mrs Ms case before shed accessed her funds then the amount to pass on 
as a legacy would be a significant sum. In contrast the DB scheme would pay Mr M two 
thirds of her yearly DB pension entitlement after she died. And that pension would die with 
him so Mrs M couldnt leave it as a legacy for her adult daughter. But, whilst I appreciate 
death benefits are important to consumers, and this might have been a factor that came into 
play when Mrs M was considering a transfer, the priority here for PWL was to advise Mrs M 
about what was best for her retirement provision. A pension is primarily designed to provide 
income in retirement  not a lump sum to family after death. But in transferring out of the DB 
scheme Mrs M was essentially giving up a guaranteed, index linked, increasing income in 
retirement, for the potential for a lump sum for her family that they may not need for many 
years to come.
Overall, I dont think different death benefits available through a transfer to a SIPP justified 
the likely decrease of retirement benefits for Mrs M. 
Summary
I dont doubt that the flexibility and control on offer through a SIPP would have sounded like 
attractive features to Mrs M. But, as I've said above, PWL wasnt there to just transact what 
Mrs M might have thought she wanted. The advisers role was to really understand what 
Mrs M needed and recommend what was in her best interests.
I've noted that PWL did take time to explain some of the risks that Mrs M was taking by 
transferring. And, theres certainly no suggestion that PWL tried to cajole Mrs M into a 
transfer against her will. Also from the answers she gave to PWL during its fact-find and risk 
assessment process, I can understand why PWL gained the impression Mrs M didnt object 
to taking risks with her DB scheme funds. But the fact that Mrs M gave PWL the impression 
that she was happy to take on the risk of being worse off in retirement, doesn't mean it was 
in her best interests for her to expose her safeguarded funds to those risks. 
As I've said above, the regulators starting position, which PWL referred to while going 
through the advice process, is that transfers aren't suitable for the majority of people. And 
advising firms like PWL should only make a recommendation to transfer where they can 
clearly demonstrate on contemporaneous evidence that a transfer is in a consumers best 
interests. And thats not the same as saying that a transfer is something that the consumer is 
prepared to take a chance with. And I think that was the situation here. 
Ultimately, I dont think the advice PWL gave to Mrs M was suitable. She was giving up a 
guaranteed, risk-free and increasing income. By transferring, Mrs M was very likely to obtain 
lower retirement benefits and in my view, there were no other particular reasons which would 
justify a transfer and outweigh this. So PWL shouldnt have advised her to transfer out of her 
DB schemes in order to gain flexible access to her funds that she didnt need. That wasnt 
worth giving up the guarantees associated with her DB schemes for.
So, I think PWL should have advised Mrs M to remain in her DB schemes.
Of course, I have to consider whether Mrs M would've gone ahead anyway, against PWL's 
advice. PWL argues that this is the case, and I've thought about it very carefully. I've noted that Mr M had previously transferred his DB benefits to a personal pension. So its likely that 
another advising firm had told him doing so was in his best interests and he assumed the 
same would be the case for Mrs M. So he and Mrs M might have had a preconceived notion 
about what they wanted to do at the beginning of the advice process. But Im not persuaded 
that Mrs M wouldve insisted on transferring out of the DB scheme, against PWLs advice. I 
say this because she was an inexperienced investor and this pension accounted for a 
significant part of her own retirement provision. So, if PWL had provided her with clear 
advice against transferring out of the DB schemes, explaining why it wasnt in her best 
interests, I think she would have accepted that advice.
In light of the above, I think PWL should compensate Mrs M for the unsuitable advice, using 
the regulator's defined benefits pension transfer redress methodology. And, as learning that 
PWL had given her unsuitable advice was a source of distress and inconvenience for her I 
think it should pay her £300 to address that.
For completeness Ill add that Mrs M has now transferred her funds from the SIPP into 
another personal pension. PWL asked us to confirm who had advised her to do that. While 
it's not for me to pass on details of Mrs Ms current advising firm. As far as I'm aware it was a 
new advising firm and not Firm G who initially introduced Mrs M to PWL. 
Putting things right
A fair and reasonable outcome would be for PWL to put Mrs M, as far as possible, into the 
position she would now be in but for the unsuitable advice. I consider Mrs M would have 
most likely remained in the occupational pension schemes if PWL had given suitable advice. 
PWL must therefore undertake a redress calculation in line with the rules for calculating 
redress for non-compliant pension transfer advice, as detailed in policy statement PS22/13 
and set out in the regulators handbook in DISP App 4: 
https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/DISP/App/4/?view=chapter. 
For clarity, although Mrs M is retired, she has not taken any of her benefits and she has no 
plans to do so at present. So, compensation should be based on the schemes normal 
retirement age, as per the usual assumptions in the FCA's guidance.
This calculation should be carried using the most recent financial assumptions in line with 
PS22/13 and DISP App 4. In accordance with the regulators expectations, this should be 
undertaken or submitted to an appropriate provider promptly following receipt of notification 
of Mrs Ms acceptance of the decision.
If the redress calculation demonstrates a loss, as explained in policy statement PS22/13 and 
set out in DISP App 4, PWL should:
always calculate and offer Mrs M redress as a cash lump sum payment,
explain to Mrs M before starting the redress calculation that:
- her redress will be calculated on the basis that it will be invested prudently (in 
line with the cautious investment return assumption used in the calculation), 
and
- a straightforward way to invest her redress prudently is to use it to augment 
her defined contribution pension
offer to calculate how much of any redress Mrs M receives could be augmented 
rather than receiving it all as a cash lump sum,
if Mrs M accepts PWLs offer to calculate how much of the redress could be 
augmented, request the necessary information and not charge Mrs M for the calculation, even if she ultimately decides not to have any of the redress augmented, 
and
take a prudent approach when calculating how much redress could be augmented, 
given the inherent uncertainty around Mrs Ms end of year tax position.
Redress paid to Mrs M as a cash lump sum will be treated as income for tax purposes. So, 
in line with DISP App 4, PWL may make a notional deduction to cash lump sum payments to 
take account of tax that Mrs Ms would otherwise pay on income from her pension. Typically, 
25% of the loss could have been taken as tax-free cash and 75% would have been taxed 
according to Mrs Ms likely income tax rate in retirement  presumed to be 20%. So making 
a notional deduction of 15% overall from the loss adequately reflects this.
My final decision
Determination and money award: I uphold this complaint and require Pension Works Limited 
to pay Mrs M the compensation amount as set out in the steps above.
If Mrs M accepts this decision, the money award becomes binding on Pension Works 
Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 June 2023.
