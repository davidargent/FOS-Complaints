The complaint
Mr J complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called MYJAR 
Limited. Mr J says he was lent to irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
What happened
We now know that Mr J took out 10 loans from MYJAR between March 2015 and July 2019. 
Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Js borrowing with MYJAR:

One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint and said they thought it should be upheld 
from the point of loan 8 onwards. MYJAR agreed with this but Mr J didnt, so the complaint 
has come to me for an ombudsmans final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this 
approach when thinking about Mr Js complaint.
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr J could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. However, certain factors might point to the fact that 
MYJAR should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr J could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
MYJAR told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr J. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked at the overall pattern of lending history to 
him with a view to seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at 
some point, MYJAR should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
For most of the loan applications, Mr J self-declared a net income (after tax) of around 
£3,000 per month. With this information - and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the 
length of the lending relationship - I think the checks which MYJAR most likely carried out for 
the first 4 loans would have been at the less detailed end of the spectrum. However, I think 
this was appropriate for these early loans. And I think these levels of checks, together with 
the income and expenditure details provided by Mr J, would have made those particular 
loans appear affordable for him. 
We can then see that there was a break in the lending at this point, with loan number 5 not 
being taken out for almost 10 months. In accordance with our practice, Ive considered loan 
5 onwards as being part of a new lending chain and as such, I revert to the types of checks 
that were appropriate given the length of that new lending chain.
Again, given his self-declared income and expenditure, I think the lending for loans 5, 6 and 
7 would have looked sustainable from MYJARs perspective. The amounts being borrowed 
seemed affordable and I note he was not borrowing whilst a previous loan was still 
outstanding. The evidence was also that, at this point, Mr J had been paying back his loans 
as agreed.
I think its only at the point of loan number 8 that an emerging and repeated lending pattern 
emerged in this case which would have looked different and therefore required a more 
thorough approach. The overall pattern of MYJARs lending to Mr J at this point should have 
caused it to see, in my view, that it shouldnt have provided any further loans from this point 
onwards. This is because this was his fourth short-term instalment loan application (in the second 
chain) with MYJAR, over 20 or so months. So MYJAR ought to have realised that Mr J was 
by now probably borrowing to meet regular shortfalls in his income and to meet an ongoing 
need. He was having to consistently take out high interest, short-term lending and his 
indebtedness had become unsustainable. MYJAR should have seen this and ought to have 
realised Mr J was at risk of not managing to repay his loans sustainably. 
So, Im partially upholding this complaint in respect of loans 8, 9 and 10. MYJAR repeatedly 
lent to Mr J in an unsustainable manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr J borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost loans.
Putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 8, 9 and 10;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement; 
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loan 10 and treat any payments 
Mr J made towards this loan as payments towards the capital;
if reworking Mr Js loan 10 account as Ive directed results in him effectively having 
made payments above the original capital borrowed, then MYJAR should refund 
these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from 
the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of settlement; 
if reworking Mr Js loan 10 account leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, then 
MYJAR can use the total refund to offset this. And if there is still an outstanding 
capital balance then I would remind it that it should take a sympathetic view when 
seeking to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr J for the remaining capital;
the number of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 8, 9 and 10 should be completely 
removed from Mr Js credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must give Mr J a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given, I partly uphold Mr Js complaint, in respect of loans 8, 9 and 10. 
MYJAR Limited should put things right for Mr J as set out above.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 December 2020.
