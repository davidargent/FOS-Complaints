The complaint
Mrs M complains that Santander UK plc wont refund to her the money that she paid to a 
claims manager in connection with a dispute about a timeshare. Shes being represented in 
her complaint by a professional representative.
What happened
Mrs M and her husband entered into a client services contract with a supplier, which they 
signed in May 2017, to appoint it as a claims manager in connection with a dispute about a 
timeshare that they had previously bought. They agreed to pay £5,932 to the supplier and 
Mrs M used her Santander credit card in May 2017 to make two payments to it  a deposit of 
£480 and then the balance of £5,452.  
Mrs Ms representative claimed a refund of the money that Mrs M had paid to the supplier 
from Santander under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that it couldnt 
conclude that a breach of contract had occurred so Mrs M didnt have a valid claim under 
section 75. Mrs M wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He said that he 
couldnt reasonably conclude that there had been a breach of contract or misrepresentation 
that would entitle Mrs M to a refund under section 75. He also said that Mrs M had first 
raised this matter with Santander in June 2019 which was too late for it to attempt a 
chargeback.
Mrs Ms representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. Mrs M says that the supplier refused to speak with her in December 2019 
because shed instructed a professional representative to take action against it and that all 
correspondence should be from her representative.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Ms complaint about Santander, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that 
Santanders response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but 
Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Ms claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
Mrs M and her husband entered into a contract with the supplier in May 2017 to 
appoint it as a claims manager in connection with a dispute about their timeshare;
the supplier wrote to the timeshare provider in September 2018 and said that its 
complete file had been sent to its lawyers for the purposes of pursuing a 
compensation claim for mis-selling and breach of contract and that it had advised 
Mrs M and her husband not to pay any further maintenance fees;
Santander says that the claim is with the suppliers solicitors and has explained that 
these cases can be time consuming but the supplier says that Mrs M hasnt 
contacted it to raise any complaints or to make a subject access request;
Santander has provided the suppliers contact details and says that the supplier has 
asked Mrs M to contact it and it will respond to any concerns that she may have 
regarding any claim for compensation;
I sympathise with Mrs M for the issues that shes experienced, including the time that 
its taken for her claim to be progressed, but the contract that she and her husband 
signed didnt include time limits in which the claim was to be progressed;
Mrs M says that she tried to phone to supplier but the line was dead but she also 
says that she phoned the supplier in December 2019 but it refused to speak with her 
because shed instructed a professional representative to take action against it and 
that all correspondence should be from her representative;
if Mrs M wasnt satisfied with the service provided by the supplier, I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect her to have done more to contact the supplier but she 
hasnt provided evidence to show the actions that she took (other than her 
descriptions of the two attempts to phone the supplier);
as Mrs Ms representative had contacted the supplier and sent it a letter of 
authorisation from Mrs M and her husband for it to represent them in their claim 
against it, I dont consider that it was incorrect that the supplier said that all 
correspondence should be from her representative;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier or that Santanders response to 
Mrs Ms section 75 claim has been unfair or unreasonable in these circumstances;
Mrs M made the payments to the supplier in May 2017 and she first contacted 
Santander about her issues with the supplier in June 2019 (more than two years 
later) and, at that time, I consider that it was too late under the applicable scheme 
rules for Santander to have been able to make a chargeback claim for those 
payments; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Santander to refund to Mrs M any of the money that shes paid to the supplier, to pay 
her any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 March 2022.
