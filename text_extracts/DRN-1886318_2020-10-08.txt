DRN-1886318
The complaint
Mr N complains that Tesco Personal Finance plc, trading as Tesco Bank, wont provide him 
with a replacement television and reimburse him for all of the costs that hes claimed.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr N used his Tesco Bank credit card in October 2017 to pay £664.95 for a 
television;
the television failed about two years later and an inspection report provided by Mr N 
said that it was due to a manufacturing failure;
Mr N made a claim to Tesco Bank and it offered to pay him £545.87 (which it said 
was a pro-rata refund as hed had the television for two years and the life expectancy 
of a television was twelve years) and to reimburse him for the £40 that hed paid for 
the inspection report;
Mr N didnt accept that offer and says that hes entitled to a replacement television;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ns complaint about Tesco Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that Tesco 
Banks response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not 
determining the outcome of Mr Ns claim under section 75 as only a court would be 
able to do that;
I consider that Tesco Banks offer to credit a total of £585.87 to Mr Ns account is fair 
and reasonable in these circumstances  Mr N has had two years use of the 
television and I consider that its fair and reasonable for Tesco Bank to reduce the 
refund to take account of that use;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances - although we do take account of applicable law and 
regulations we also consider the overall situation so its possible that a court would 
reach a different outcome to the decision that Ive made;
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Tesco Bank to 
reimburse Mr N for the cost of a replacement television, or all of the other costs that 
hes claimed; and
I find that Tesco Bank should credit to Mr Ns account the £585.87 that its offered to 
him, if it hasnt already done so, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me 
to require it to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that Tesco Personal Finance plc, trading as Tesco Bank, should credit to 
Mr Ns account the £585.87 that its offered to him (if it hasnt already done so).
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 November 2020.
