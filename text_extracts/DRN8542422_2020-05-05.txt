K821x#15complaint
Mr A complains about issues hes experienced with a car supplied with finance from Close  
Brothers Limited.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy  of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision. In my provisional decision I explained why I proposed to uphold  the 
complaint in part and to require Close Brothers  to pay compensation of £150 to Mr A. 
I invited Mr A and Close Brothers to let me have any further evidence or arguments  they 
wanted to make before I finally determined the matter.
Mr A replied  and said hed sold the car for £13,500.  This service asked Mr A to provide 
details of any repair costs  hed incurred to get the car into a condition  for sale. He didnt 
provide any details and explained that hed moved  house since then. Close Brothers  didnt 
reply to my provisional decision. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr A hasnt provided any evidence that he incurred repair costs or suffered a loss on the 
sale of the car due to the faults with the exhaust system.  Close Brothers  hasnt said 
anything. So I see no reason to reach  a different  conclusion from that set out in my 
provisional decision. 
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is to uphold  the complaint in part.  Close Brothers  Limited must pay 
compensation of £150 to Mr A.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 June 2020.
