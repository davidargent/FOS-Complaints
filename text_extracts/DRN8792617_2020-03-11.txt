K821x#15complaint
Mrs T makes a number of complains  about  National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) 
following an ISA account being opened.
background
Mrs T says she arranged  to transfer her ISA to NatWest but the transfer  was not set up 
correctly and the wrong ISA product was opened.  She says NatWest  then incorrectly paid 
compensation of £60 into the ISA before deducting  a greater amount. Mrs T says she wrote  
to NatWest by recorded delivery but didnt  receive  a response to a number of her letters.  In 
summary she says she would like about £500 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience she was caused as well as the interest she lost backdated.  Mrs T also says 
she was offered further compensation  by NatWest after it made an offer of £270 
compensation.
NatWest has sent Mrs T a number of final response  letters. It accepts making mistakes and 
has apologised.  It says the ISA that Mrs T opened paid the same interest rate as the one 
she thought she was opening. It also accepts  making a mistake  by paying the £60 
compensation into the wrong account and says it will backdate the interest.  NatWest  has 
paid a total of £270  compensation.
Mrs T brought her complaint to us and our investigator upheld  the complaint. The 
investigator thought  the overall  compensation paid by NatWest was fair and reasonable and 
recommended it pay Mrs T the interest that she lost. The investigator agreed  that Mrs T 
hadnt been treated fairly by NatWest and that it had made a number of mistakes.
Mrs T doesnt accept that view and says the compensation  award isnt enough  for whats  
happened. She says NatWest agreed to pay more and that shes now received a letter  
telling her the ISA is still open. Mrs T is concerned about the implications  of that and says 
NatWest had no authority  to open  the account.
NatWest says it will close the account and pay the lost interest  which it calculates at £32.72
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to a similar 
overall view as the investigator. I realise Mrs T will be disappointed by my decision and I 
appreciate how strongly she feels about whats happened.
There is no question here that NatWest  made  a number of mistakes which  I have no doubt 
caused Mrs T distress and inconvenience. I accept that NatWest didnt reply to a number of 
Mrs Ts letters that she took the trouble  to send by recorded delivery.  So I also accept Mrs 
Ts frustration in those circumstances and that this ought to have been  a relatively straight  
forward matter in opening a new ISA.
I appreciate that Mrs T says that NatWest  had no authority to open the ISA. I think that is a 
new complaint that NatWest hasnt fairly  had the opportunity to comment on. But I think Mrs 
Ts intention was that the ISA was opened  and so I cant  see that NatWest made a mistake. I 
also dont think it matters  which ISA was opened.  As I can see that the ISA Mrs T thought  
she was opening  and the one that was opened, both pay identical  interest  rates. I appreciate  
Ref: DRN87926172that is not the main part of Mrs Ts complaint and I hope that NatWest will close  or cancel the 
account as soon as possible.
I can see that NatWest has paid £270 compensation. Im satisfied  overall that award is fair 
and reasonable and fairly takes  into account  the impact  its mistakes have had upon Mrs T. I 
also think that award fairly includes the costs of writing  to NatWest. I appreciate that Mrs T 
says that award  isnt enough but whilst  Im sorry to disagree with Mrs T Im satisfied its 
appropriate. I can also see that NatWest has fairly apologised for what took place and fairly 
agreed to pay Mrs T the lost interest.  
I appreciate Mrs T says NatWest  told her that it would increase that compensation offer. I 
cant see such an offer on NatWests records or that its mentioned in the call I have listened 
to. I think  NatWest did agree to pay for the costs in sending the letters again during that call 
and included  that amount in its total compensation offer. But in any event I dont think that 
matters as Im satisfied, for the reasons, I have explained that the overall  compensation 
award is fair and reasonable.
Overall I accept that NatWest didnt  deal with the account opening or the complaint 
appropriately. But Im satisfied its acted as I would  expect to put matters  right and in 
apologising.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and order  National Westminster  Bank  Plc to 
pay Mrs T £32.72 which is the interest  she lost.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 April 2020..
