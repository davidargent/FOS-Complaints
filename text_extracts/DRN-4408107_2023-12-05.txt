The complaint
Mr C is unhappy with National Westminster Bank Plcs decision to close his accounts.
What happened
Mr C held accounts with NatWest and in early 2021 he was informed two of his accounts  a 
savings and a current account - would be closed due to dormancy. Mr C contacted NatWest 
regarding the closures and said his accounts had been closed in violation of the Dormant 
Bank and Building Society Account Act 2008. 
NatWest reviewed Mr Cs concerns and explained that due to inactivity on both accounts for 
over 5 years it closed them. NatWest explained Mr C was notified of the pending closures 
and it acted in line with the terms and conditions of the accounts. 
Mr C was unhappy with NatWests response and referred his complaint to our service for 
review. An investigator looked at Mr Cs concerns. But they didnt think NatWest had done 
anything wrong and didnt uphold the complaint. 
Mr C remained dissatisfied, so his complaint has been passed to me, an ombudsman, for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr C has made several detailed points about his complaint which I have only summarised 
above. But Id like to reassure him that I have considered his submissions in full. And I hope 
the fact that I do not respond in a similar detail here will not be taken as a discourtesy. As an 
informal dispute resolution service, we are tasked with reaching a fair and reasonable 
conclusion with the minimum of formality. In doing so, it is not necessary for me to respond 
to every point made, but to consider the circumstances as a whole.
Having done so, while I appreciate Mr Cs strength of feeling about his complaint, Im 
satisfied NatWest has acted reasonably. Ill explain why. 
It is common for banks such as NatWest to have their own dormancy process. There is no 
set time a bank or building society must use to determine that an account is dormant  there 
is only industry guidance and good practice. I have considered good industry practice which 
includes guidance for banks dealing with dormant accounts. This encourages banks to follow 
ten core pledges, which aims to ensure customers are provided with sufficient notice and 
they are treated fairly. Looking at the available evidence, I am satisfied NatWest has 
adhered to its own dormancy process and this process is in keeping with good industry 
practice. 
In Mr Cs specific case its not in dispute that NatWest informed Mr C of the impending 
closure of his accounts. Rather, Mr C believes NatWest is acting contrary to the legal 
requirements of the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Act 2008. The Act relates 
to accounts that have been inactive for 15 years or more to be distributed for community 
benefit, while allowing customers to reclaim their money. Under this scheme, they may 
transfer balances of dormant accounts to a not for profit reclaim fund which is authorised and 
regulated by the FCA. Mr Cs accounts have been closed due to inactivity for 5 years and 
NatWest has confirmed there was a nil balance in both accounts. Having reviewed Mr Cs 
comments, and the circumstances of the account closures Im not persuaded NatWest has 
acted contrary to the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Act 2008.
I can see Mr C says he was advised by NatWest during his complaint that on the opening of 
the account he would have signed a document waiving his rights to the full 15-year 
dormancy period required by law. NatWest hasnt been able to provide a copy of this 
document and it says it hasnt been its policy for these rights to be waived and that it does 
adhere to the provisions set out in the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Act 
2008. NatWest has provided what seems to be a reasonable response, and without any 
further evidence I cant say it acted unfairly to Mr C in following its standard dormancy 
process. 
I understand Mr C has made requests for information from NatWest and he believes these 
have not been fulfilled. Mr C is concerned about the violation of GDPR regulations by 
NatWest in his case and on a more general level within NatWest. Our role is to provide an 
informal dispute resolution service and while I understand Mr Cs strength of feeling, it 
means there are limits to what we can do. We arent regulators and we dont have the 
powers of a regulator to, for example, fine or punish a business. In addition, I cant say 
whether theres been a breach of GDPR  thats a matter for a court or the Information 
Commissioners Office (ICO). What I can do here is consider whether NatWest treated Mr C 
fairly. Looking at Mr Cs complaint, I think NatWest has acted reasonably in its dealings with 
Mr C.  
I know this will not be the outcome Mr C was hoping for and they will be disappointed with 
the decision Ive reached. But I hope my decision provides some clarity around why I wont 
be asking NatWest to take any further action. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 January 2024.
