The complaint
Mrs D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc lent irresponsibly when it approved two 
loans on the same day. Mrs D also complains about problems she experienced setting up 
direct debits and arranging payment holidays for the loans. 
What happened
At the end of December 2019 Mrs D applied online for a NatWest personal loan of £6,000. 
Mrs D has told us she thought there was a technical problem with the application so she 
started another one using NatWests website. Mrs D applied for another loan, this time for 
£5,000. 
Both loans were approved and a total of £11,000 was paid into Mrs Ds current account. The 
current account statements show some of the funds Mrs D received were transferred to 
other accounts and the rest was used either on spending, bills or to make payments to 
business that provides online exchange services. The funds NatWest paid into Mrs Ds 
current account were fully utilised within around three days. 
Mrs D has told us she had difficulty arranging a direct debit instruction and was incorrectly 
sent to her banks branch. Mrs D has explained that despite making various calls to NatWest 
no direct debit instruction was put in place for the loans. 
Mrs D also says she had problems when applying for a payment holiday using NatWests 
mobile app and that she wasnt called back as promised. 
Mrs D complained and has pointed out her credit file was impacted by the problems 
experienced setting up a direct debit mandate. Mrs D also said NatWest shouldnt have 
approved both loans on the same day. NatWest upheld Mrs Ds complaint in part. NatWest 
didnt agree an error had been made on the basis it had approved two loans on the same 
day for Mrs D. 
NatWest said the information it had met its lending criteria so both loans were approved. But 
NatWest agreed there had been problems setting up the direct debit instructions and 
arranging a payment holiday. NatWest also agreed Mrs D had been given incorrect and 
confusing information. NatWest refunded default interest and charges to Mrs Ds loans, 
amended her credit file so no adverse information was reported and paid her £260 to 
apologise. 
The loans were repaid in July 2020. 
Mrs D referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
thought NatWest had dealt with Mrs Ds complaint fairly and didnt ask it to do anything else. 
Mrs D asked to appeal, so her complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs D has made a number of complaints about NatWest so Ill look at each in turn. The 
situation started when Mrs D says a technical glitch meant she applied for two loans in one 
day. Mrs D has told us she feels NatWest shouldnt have approved both applications on the 
same day. I agree it was unusual for a business to receive two loan applications within such 
a short space of time. But Im not persuaded that the timing of the applications meant 
NatWest was wrong to approve both loans. 
Before a business agrees to lend, it has to complete proportionate checks to ensure the 
proposed borrowing is sustainable and affordable. Theres no set list of checks a lender has 
to complete, but it should take information like the loan amount, term and reason for 
borrowing into account before deciding how to proceed. NatWest has explained the 
application process Mrs D completed is automated. NatWests loan system looks at the 
information provided by the applicant as well as their credit file. 
I can see Mrs D gave NatWest information about her income and outgoings in the 
application. NatWest also completed a credit search but didnt find any evidence of other 
credit in Mrs Ds name. In response to the investigator Mrs D said she had other lending in 
place. But the credit file Mrs D provided, and credit search NatWest completed as part of the 
application dont show other credit in place at the time. 
NatWest says it applied its lending criteria to both applications and they were approved. 
Whilst I understand Mrs Ds concerns, I think NatWest makes a reasonable point when it 
says Mrs D accepted two loan agreements and applied for two loans of different amounts. 
The information Ive seen doesnt indicate NatWest made a mistake or lent irresponsibly in 
this case. 
I also think its reasonable to note that NatWests loans had a 14 day cooling off period 
during which Mrs D couldve retuned the funds of either. Mrs D has told us she tried to 
contact NatWest to arrange that, but the account statements Ive seen shows the funds were 
either transferred to other accounts or used to pay bills and make payments to a business 
that provides online exchange services within three days of the loans being approved. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mrs D but I havent been persuaded NatWest made a mistake or 
treated her unfairly by approving both loans in this case. 
Mrs D has made several complaints about problems she experienced setting up a direct 
debit instruction. NatWest has upheld Mrs Ds complaints and apologised for the 
inconvenience caused. I can see that NatWest also upheld Mrs Ds complaint about the 
problems she experienced arranging payment holidays for the loans. NatWest has refunded 
all default interest and charges applied and also taken steps to remove any missed payment 
from Mrs Ds credit file. That means Mrs Ds credit file wont be impacted by the payment 
issues she highlighted. 
I can see there were problems setting up a direct debit and that NatWest accepts Mrs D was 
incorrectly told to visit her current account providers branch. NatWest has also apologised 
that Mrs D experienced problems setting up a payment holiday and that she wasnt always 
called back as agreed. I agree the service provided by NatWest did fall short. 
In addition to refunds of default of interest or charges, NatWest paid Mrs D £260 to 
apologise for the service provided. Whilst I understand my decision will likely disappoint 
Mrs D, Im satisfied £260 fairly reflects the impact of the issues shes raised so Im not telling 
NatWest to increase the award. As Im satisfied NatWest dealt with Mrs Ds complaint fairly, 
Im not telling it to take any further action. My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint because National Westminster Bank Plc has 
already paid a settlement that is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 July 2021.
