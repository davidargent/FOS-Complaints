The complaint
Miss B and Mr L complain about the way National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) handled 
a loan application. 
What happened
Miss B and Mr L tried to apply for a loan over the phone but have said they were told to 
apply online instead. Miss B and Mr L have said that due to NatWests failure to update his 
address and incorrect date of birth, they had to visit their branch to provide identification. 
Miss B and Mr L have told us that NatWests advisor said they would forward the loan 
paperwork to the relevant department. 
Miss B contacted NatWest on 10 January 2020 and was told the loan couldnt progress as 
the date of birth error hadnt been corrected and that he would need to bring identification 
into branch. 
Miss B and Mr L complained and NatWest responded on 5 February 2020. NatWest upheld 
the complaint and apologised for the way the application had been handled. NatWest 
confirmed the application hadnt been successful because of errors on its systems relating to 
Mr Ls date of birth and address. NatWest apologised and took steps to remove the credit 
search from Miss B and Mr Ls credit files. NatWest explained that a new loan application 
would be required if they still wanted to proceed and paid £100 to apologise. 
Miss B and Mr L referred their complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. 
Miss B and Mr L asked for the interest they paid on their overdraft to be taken into account 
as they had intended to repay the outstanding balance with the funds from the personal loan. 
Our investigator thought NatWests offer should be increased from £100 to £200. NatWest 
accepted, but Miss B and Mr L asked to appeal. So, their complaint has been passed to me 
to make a decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
All parties broadly agree that NatWest held incorrect information in relation to Mr Ls 
personal details. And its clear those issues meant the original loan application they 
completed in December 2019 didnt proceed. NatWest appears to have missed an 
opportunity to resolve the situation after Mr Ls took identification into branch and I can 
understand why a complaint has been made. I agree that NatWest should have the correct 
customer details on file and that the service provided has, at times, been poor. After our 
investigator looked at this case, NatWest agreed to pay £200 compensation in total. 
The issue appears to now come down to whether NatWest will refund interest and charges 
Miss B and Mr L say they wouldnt have incurred if the loan application had been successful. 
I understand Miss Bs point that they would have used some of the funds borrowed to repay 
their overdraft which would have saved money. 
The issue I have, is that NatWest has told us the reason for the loan was confirmed as 
Home Improvements when Miss B and Mr L applied, not debt consolidation. I accept that it 
may not have been possible within the online application to give more than one reason. But I 
think its relevant to note that the reason Miss B and Mr L say they wanted to borrow funds 
from NatWest doesnt match the application completed.
Ive also considered what Miss B and Mr L did after their complaint was looked at. On 5 
February 2020 NatWest responded to their complaint and explained a new application would 
need to be completed to proceed with a loan. Ive seen Miss B and Mr Ls bank statements 
for the following months and can see that the overdraft balance remained. Miss B and Mr L 
dont appear to have borrowed any money to repay their overdraft in the period after their 
loan with NatWest didnt proceed. As Miss B and Mr L havent subsequently applied for 
borrowing to consolidate their overdraft debt, Im not persuaded it would be fair to tell 
NatWest to cover the cost of interest and charges they incurred. 
Our investigator asked NatWest to increase the compensation for the service provided from 
£100 to £200. Ive considered how the application was handled as well as NatWests failure 
to quickly resolve the situation when Mr L brought his identification to the branch. Having 
considered everything that Miss B and Mr L have told us about the impact of the issues 
raised, Im satisfied that a total of £200 is fair in all the circumstances. I dont doubt that the 
situation has been stressful, but I can see NatWests position was explained in its final 
response dated 5 February 2020 and at that stage Miss B and Mr L were aware a new loan 
application was required. Im satisfied that the increase from £100 to £200 fairly reflects 
whats happened so Im going to endorse the investigators recommendation. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
Miss B and Mr L a total of £200 (less any compensation already paid). 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B and Mr L to 
accept or reject my decision before 24 December 2020.
