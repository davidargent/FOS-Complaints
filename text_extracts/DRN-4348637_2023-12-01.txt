The complaint
Miss P complains about mistakes in relation to her USD account with Citibank UK Limited. 
What happened
On 10 May 2023 Miss P contacted Citibank to dispute a payment of $150 that was pending 
on her account. Miss P has explained she believes the payment to be related to a 
transaction of $159 that shouldve been completed in October 2022. 
Citibank issued a final response on 23 May 2023 but said there was no trace of a payment 
for $159 on 10 May 2023. Citibank said Miss P had previously instructed a payment for $159 
on 4 October 2022 which had gone through on 6 October 2022. Citibank didnt uphold Miss 
Ps complaint.
An investigator at this service looked at Miss Ps complaint. They couldnt find any trace of a 
payment for $159 on 10 May 2022 from Miss Ps Citibank account. The investigator checked 
with Citibank and it confirmed a payment for $150 showed as pending on Miss Ps account 
on 10 May 2023 but it wasnt subsequently claimed by the merchant. As a result, Miss Ps 
balance wouldve been temporarily reduced by $150 whilst the pending payment timed out. 
The investigator didnt uphold Miss Ps complaint. 
Miss P asked to appeal and said the funds had been withdrawn from her account in October 
2022 but not paid for around five months. Miss P also provided a screen shot showing a 
pending transaction of $150 on 10 May 2023. As Miss P asked to appeal, her complaint has 
been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Citibank has explained there are two separate payments involved in Miss Ps complaint. The 
first was a payment for $159 which Citibank says was made as directed in October 2022. 
The second was a pending payment for $150 that was provisionally claimed by the merchant 
on 10 May 2023 but not subsequently debited from Miss Ps account. 
Ive looked at Miss Ps statements and the information provided by Citibank for May 2023 
and theres no evidence that a payment of $159 being claimed or made. Miss Ps statements 
dont show a debit for $159 and Citibank confirms there were no payments at that level. I can 
see Miss P has forwarded a US bank statement but that shows $159 was deposited into her 
account on 4 October 2022. So it appears to me that the payment Miss P instructed in 
October 2022 was made as directed. 
Miss Ps screen shot shows a pending transaction for $150 on 10 May 2023. Citibank 
confirms this was correct as a merchant had made a provisional claim for $150 from Miss 
Ps Citibank account. But if a pending payment isnt ultimately claimed, the earmarked funds 
($150 in this case) are then released and move back to the available balance. Citibanks 
explained thats why Miss Ps available balance changed once the pending payment wasnt 
claimed. 
Im sorry to disappoint Miss P but I havent seen any evidence that shows Citibank made a 
mistake with how the payments in question have been processed. Overall, Im satisfied 
Citibank has dealt with Miss Ps complaint fairly and hasnt made mistakes with her 
payments. As a result, Im not telling Citibank to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Ps complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 January 2024.
