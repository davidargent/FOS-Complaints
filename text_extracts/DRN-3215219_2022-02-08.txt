The complaint
Mrs P has complained that TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED gave her credit 
file data to another individual.
What happened
Mrs P was told by a third-party individual that when theyd looked up their credit file with 
TransUnion, theyd found Mrs Ps information on their own file.
TransUnion apologised, but didnt offer any compensation. They focused only on whether 
there was incorrect information on Mrs Ps own file, and not the information they gave to the 
third party. They told Mrs P to let them know if there was any incorrect information on her 
own credit file, but Mrs P explained she didnt have access to her own file.
Our investigator looked into things independently. They helped Mrs P to access her credit 
file and remove some incorrect addresses. They thought TransUnion should pay Mrs P £300 
compensation. 
TransUnion didnt agree, so the complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It looks like TransUnion made a very serious error by giving Mrs Ps financial information to 
another individual.
This has caused Mrs P substantial embarrassment and upset. She is understandably 
uncomfortable that someone else was able to look at her financial data. I understand shes 
felt stressed and worried by the whole thing. Its only right that TransUnion compensate 
Mrs P for all that.
I also think TransUnion handled things poorly more generally. Mrs Ps complaint was clear 
that she was mainly unhappy about her information being on someone elses credit file, but 
for some reason TransUnion set this aside and instead focused on whether anyone elses 
information was on Mrs Ps credit file. So it came across like they werent actually listening or 
dealing with the matter. Even when Mrs P came to our service and we explained things 
again, TransUnion continued to misinterpret the issue at hand.
Indeed, it wasnt until Mrs P came to our service that she was given access to her 
TransUnion credit file, or that her credit file was properly amended. TransUnion claim they 
offered Mrs P a copy of her file and didnt get a reply, but I cant see that happened in the 
correspondence that either side have sent. All I can see is that Mrs P told TransUnion she 
couldnt access her file and that TransUnion gave her no real assistance.
Taking into account TransUnions errors, the impact they had, and our guidelines around 
compensation, I agree with our investigator that £300 compensation is fair.
Putting things right
I direct TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED to:
remove Mrs Ps credit file data from any third-party individuals credit file, if any 
remains; and
pay Mrs P £300 compensation in total.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mrs Ps complaint, and direct TRANSUNION 
INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED to put things right in the way I set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2022.
