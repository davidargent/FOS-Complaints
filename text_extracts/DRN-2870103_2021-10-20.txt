The complaint
Mr and Mrs K complain that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays 
Partner Finance, has rejected the claims that theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. Their complaint is being dealt with by their representative.
What happened
Mr and Mrs K entered into a purchase agreement for a timeshare in March 2010 and Mr K 
entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for Â£6,200 at the 
same time to pay for the timeshare. A claim was made to Barclays Partner Finance in 
September 2019 under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act that the timeshare had been 
misrepresented to them.
Barclays Partner Finance hadnt issued a substantive response to that claim by March 2020 
so Mr and Mrs K complained to this service. Barclays Partner Finance says that their claim 
was time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980. Our investigator didnt recommend that their 
complaint should be upheld. He said that their claims were more than likely time barred 
under the Limitation Act so he thought that Barclays Partner Finances decision not to look 
into their claims was fair.
Mr and Mrs Ks representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It said that a full substantive response to our investigators 
recommendations would be provided when it had received instructions from Mr and Mrs K 
but I cant see that it has provided any further information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with most of the conclusions reached by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr and Mrs Ks complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down their section 
75 claim and they referred their complaint to this service within six years of that event 
- but I need to consider whether Barclays Partner Finance should have fully 
considered their claim or whether it was reasonable for it say that their claim was 
time barred under the Limitation Act;
Mr and Mrs Ks section 75 claim to Barclays Partner Finance is that the timeshare 
was misrepresented to them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
in this decision Im not determining the outcome of that claim as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to their claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr and Mrs K could have made a claim to the timeshare company or 
Barclays Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that they say induced them 
into buying the timeshare when they entered into the purchase agreement for the 
timeshare  which was in March 2010  as that was when they entered into an 
agreement based on the alleged misrepresentations of the timeshare company and 
suffered a loss as Mr K entered into the loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance to pay for the timeshare;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance  but they didnt make a claim to Barclays Partner Finance until 
September 2019, more than nine years later, which was outside of the time limits set 
out in the Limitation Act;
Barclays Partner Finance says that it considered Mr and Mrs Ks claim under section 
75 but concluded that it hadnt been brought within the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act - I consider that to have been a fair and reasonable response to Mr 
and Mrs Ks claim under section 75 and I dont consider that it was required to do 
more in response to that claim;
Mr and Mrs Ks representatives letter of claim to Barclays Partner Finance in 
September 2019 was headed Re: S.75 and/or S.140A Consumer Credit Act 1974 
but it said Our Clients wish to make a claim pursuant to s.75 of the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974, there was no other reference in that letter to a claim under section 140A 
and the form filled out to bring a complaint to this service only refers to section 75, so 
I consider that their claim to Barclays Partner Finance was clearly only made under 
section 75;
our investigator considered any claim that Mr and Mrs K might have under section 
140A of the Consumer Credit Act and concluded that such a claim wouldnt have 
been made within the time limits set out in the Limitation Act - but I make no finding 
on that as I consider that their claim to Barclays Partner Finance was only made 
under section 75 (and didnt include a claim under section 140A) so Im unable to 
consider a complaint about section 140A in this decision - if Mr and Mrs K want 
Barclays Partner Finance to consider their claim under section 140A, they should 
make a claim to it under that section and then, if theyre not satisfied with its 
response, they may be able to make a separate complaint to this service; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs K for the issues that theyve had with their timeshare 
and the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr K any of the money that he paid under the loan agreement, to pay them 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ks complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K and Mrs K to 
accept or reject my decision before 17 November 2021.
