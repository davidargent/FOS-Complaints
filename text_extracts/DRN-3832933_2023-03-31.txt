The complaint
Mr E complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA closed his account and withheld the 
balance for too long.
What happened
Mr E had an account with PayPal. In August 2020, a limitation was placed on the account 
and PayPal carried out a review. Following the review, PayPal placed a permanent limitation 
on Mr Es account and said it would hold onto the funds for 180 days. Dissatisfied, Mr E 
complained to PayPal and referred the complaint to us.
Mr E continued to have difficulties withdrawing the funds. Although he regained access to 
the account, he says he wasnt able to add bank details to allow him to make withdrawals. 
Mr E says it wasnt until August 2021 that he was finally able to do this. He also says he 
wasnt able to withdraw his funds in US dollars  and so incurred currency exchange fees.
I issued my provisional findings on this complaint on 22 February 2023. I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Like all financial businesses, PayPal is subject to a number of legal and regulatory 
requirements. These mean it needs to monitor its customers accounts and may need 
to review them at any time. While it is doing this it may need to block the relevant 
account.
In this case, PayPal reviewed Mr Es account in August 2020 and decided to place a 
permanent limitation on the account. Based on what Ive seen, Im satisfied PayPal 
was acting in line with its legal and regulatory requirements, and the terms and 
conditions that applied to Mr Es account.
That said, PayPal says it intended to hold onto Mr Es funds for 180 days. I see this 
is something the terms and conditions allowed PayPal to do. But in Mr Es case, 
shortly after the expiry of 180 days, PayPal limited the account again. This meant a 
new 180 day period started. It was only in July 2021 that PayPal says it realised what 
had happened and allowed Mr E to withdraw his funds.
PayPal accepts that this was a mistake: PayPal has told us the funds should have 
been released by March 2021  but it didnt lift the restrictions until 21 July. Based on 
what PayPal has said, I think this was avoidable  and that Mr E was deprived of 
money because of what PayPal did wrong.
As such, and in line with our long-established approach to cases where customers 
are deprived of money, PayPal should pay interest to compensate Mr E for the time 
hes been out of pocket. The usual rate is 8% simple per year, and I have no reason 
to depart from that in this case. PayPal should pay this from 25 February 2021, when 
the initial 180 day period expired, until the Mr E got the money back.
Mr E says he also lost out because he was required to pay currency exchange fees 
in order to withdraw his funds. He says that previously hed been able to withdraw the 
funds to a US dollar account, but PayPal required him to withdraw these funds in 
pounds sterling  which meant that in addition to incurring these currency exchange 
fees he then incurred these again when he converted the funds back to US dollars 
through his bank.
Weve asked PayPal about this. It says that although Mr Es account was set to US 
dollars, the bank account he withdrew to is a GB pounds account. Mr E has 
confirmed this. As such, the funds were converted to pounds. The terms and 
conditions that applied to Mr Es account state that if Mr E transfers funds to a 
funding source denominated in a currency other than the original opening currency of 
his account, the conversion would be performed using PayPals transaction 
exchange rate.
Thinking about everything, though, I cant safely conclude that Mr E would have kept 
these funds in dollars had things happened as they should have. In particular, Mr E 
also told our investigator that if hed had access to the funds sooner he could have 
converted the balance to GB pounds, to avoid currency risk. Weve also asked him 
what he planned to do with the funds  he says that the transactions on the account 
were between people he gambled with, although he also planned to invest the 
savings in the PayPal account in his business, a separate limited company. Finally, I 
understand that withdrawals in US dollars to US bank account would also have 
incurred a 3% fee.
While I accept that Mr E has been kept out of money, it would be speculative to say 
that he would definitely have avoided currency exchange fees had things happened 
as they should have done. And to work out the actual position Mr E would have 
ended up in would involve an in-depth examination of his finances, including whether 
he could have mitigated any losses by finding dollar funding from elsewhere and 
whether and if he had a requirement for pounds or dollars which may not have 
resulted in definitive answers. With all this in mind, I conclude that the simple interest 
will most fairly compensate Mr E for being deprived of these funds.
I note Mr Es comments about the impact this all had on his business. But his 
business is a separate legal entity, and so I cannot award him compensation for this.
I concluded that the complaint should be upheld in part and that PayPal should pay Mr E 
simple interest to compensate him for the time hes been out of pocket.
PayPal didnt send me anything further to consider. Mr E agreed that he should get 
compensation for the time he was deprived of funds. But he thinks he should get back the 
currency exchange fees he incurred. In particular:
Although he withdrew his US dollars to an account denominated in pounds sterling, 
this was because PayPal required him to, whereas before hed been able to withdraw 
funds to a US dollar account
Had he been allowed to use his US dollar account, he could have converted the 
funds to pounds a lot cheaper, and although PayPal did introduce a fee to transfer 
funds in US dollars this was after it decided to block his account.
To put things right, Mr E asks if PayPal can refund the currency conversion fee they forced 
him to pay, reimburse the fee he paid to convert the funds back to US dollars, and to pay the 
difference between the currency exchange rate in August 2020 and August 2021 when he was finally able withdrew the funds. He also thinks he should get compensation for the time 
hes spent trying to resolve matters with PayPal.
Ive therefore considered the complaint afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im satisfied that PayPal was acting in line with its legal and regulatory obligations  and its 
terms and conditions  when it initially decided to restrict Mr Es account. Im also satisfied 
that PayPal was acting in line with its terms and conditions when it decided to permanently 
restrict Mr Es account. The terms and conditions allowed PayPal to hold onto these funds 
for 180 days. So the earliest Mr E should have regained access to these funds was 25 
February 2021, when that initial block expired. Instead Mr E didnt gain access to those 
funds until August 2021.
Ive considered the further points Mr E has raised about PayPal not allowing him to withdraw 
his money in US dollars. He says he was forced to withdraw his funds to an account 
denominated in pounds sterling, and had PayPal not done so hed have been able to convert 
his funds into pounds at a better rate.
Weve asked PayPal about this. It said that as Mr E withdrew the funds to a UK bank 
account, the funds were converted to pounds in line with its terms and conditions. And it 
says its unable to support US dollar bank accounts that arent located on US soil. Its 
unwilling to refund the currency exchange fees.
Ive carefully what Mr E has said, alongside the applicable terms and conditions. I note that 
the terms and conditions say that PayPal may limit the availability of funding sources. The 
terms and conditions also state that 
You may only withdraw PayPal balance in the opening currency of your account, 
unless we agree otherwise. In order to withdraw PayPal balance held in another 
currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your 
account, or it will be converted for you at the time of withdrawal. Our transaction 
exchange rate will be used.
This means that if you withdraw:
a PayPal balance held in a currency other than the original opening currency 
of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into your original 
opening currency; and
to a funding source (for example, bank account or card) denominated in a 
currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be 
charged a fee for the conversion into the currency in which the funding source 
is denominated. 
The terms and conditions go on to explain that if the customer is registered as resident in the 
United Kingdom, the opening currency of the account would be pounds sterling.
Mr E was withdrawing his funds to a UK bank account. It follows that he would be charged 
PayPals transaction exchange rate. And given the terms and conditions Ive cited above, I 
cant say that PayPal was wrong to have required Mr E to do so. I accept that PayPal may have previously allowed Mr E to use a US dollar bank account. But that was before theyd 
restricted his account  which Ive found they had grounds to do.
Ive also considered what Mr E has said about the currency exchange fluctuations between 
August 2020 and August 2021. As Ive said, I find that PayPal was entitled to block Mr Es 
account until February 2021  and it appears that much of the change in value of dollars and 
sterling had already taken place by that point. Indeed, it appears that the value of US dollars 
was slightly greater in August than it had been in February.
With all this in mind, I dont change my conclusions. I accept that Mr E was kept out of funds 
he would have had earlier. But given the above, Im satisfied simple interest (the rate is 8%) 
on the withheld balance from 25 February 2021 until the date he got the funds back will fairly 
compensate him for being kept out of the funds. Im not persuaded Mr E should get the 
currency exchange fees back, given it appears the terms and conditions meant he would 
have incurred them in any event.
Finally, Ive considered what Mr E has said about the inconvenience this caused. He says he 
needed to contact PayPal more than 20 times to resolve this issue  and says his time is 
worth £500 an hour. Looking at everything that happened, though, Im not persuaded to 
award anything extra for distress and inconvenience. Im satisfied the real impact here was 
being denied access to the funds  Mr E has mentioned he wanted to pay the funds to his 
business and that the transactions from the account were with people he was gambling with. 
I accept Mr E may have called PayPal a number of times but thats something Mr E chose to 
do. In all the circumstances, I conclude that 8% simple interest will fairly compensate Mr E 
for what happened. Im not persuaded to award more.
Putting things right
PayPal should pay simple interest (the rate is 8%) on the funds it withheld from 25 February 
2021 (when the initial 180 day block expired) until the date Mr E got those funds back.
If PayPal is required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct tax from that interest, it should 
tell Mr E how much it has taken off. It should also give Mr E a certificate setting out how it 
has worked this out if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint. PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA should put 
things right by doing what Ive said above/
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2023.
