The complaint
Mr M's complaint is about his bank accounts being suspended without warning or 
justification.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
A bank can decide who it wants to deal with as a customer. And when it makes the 
commercial decision to close an account it does not have to give a reason. But it 
must follow the process set out in the accounts terms and conditions.
Here the terms and conditions set out when Barclays can close an account, 
sometimes immediately. And it appears Barclays has followed them in Mr Ms case. 
We can not require Barclays to re-open an account. And its checks of payments into 
and out of the account were reasonable. 
Barclays has accepted it did not handle the closure as well as it could have by not 
closing the account immediately and accepting some payments into it. But it has 
allowed this money to be withdrawn once its checks were completed. That is fair.
Barclays has also offered Mr M Â£200 compensation for this. Thats fair and 
reasonable. Overall I dont think I can require Barclays to reopen the account or to do 
or pay anything more as Mr M would like.
For these reasons, although I recognise Mr Ms frustration, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about Barclays Bank UK PLC. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2020.
