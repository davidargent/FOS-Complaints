The complaint
Mrs D complains that the loans she had from Harvey & Thompson Limited were unaffordable 
to her.
What happened
Mrs D had five loans from Harvey & Thompson between April 2017 and August 2018 as 
follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Max Monthly
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 22 Apr 2017 £400 5m £106.88 10 Sep 2017 26 Apr 2017
2 8 May 2017 £500 15m £61.75 9 Aug 2018 26 Oct 2017
3 26 Oct 2017 £852.15 21m £84.57 10 Jul 2019 16 Mar 2018
4 16 Mar 2018 £1,393.17 33m £95.90 10 Dec 2020 11 Jan 2019
5 10 Aug 2018 £1,868.35 36m £126.50 10 Aug 2021 Outstanding
Mrs D says she should never have been given the loans as she had multiple financial 
obligations at the time and was already struggling financially. She says that if Harvey & 
Thompson had carried out a thorough review it would have seen the repayments were 
unsustainable.
Harvey & Thompson says it verified Mrs Ds income and employment details and reviewed 
her credit file and bank statements. It says the information provided, and Mrs Ds credit 
score, both met its lending criteria. However, it offered to calculate redress for loans 4 and 
5, leaving an outstanding balance of £498.57 to pay.
Mrs D did not accept this offer.
Our adjudicator didnt recommend the complaint about loans 1 to 3 should be upheld. He
didnt consider Harvey & Thompsons checks went far enough for all loans, but he said there
was nothing in the information that should have indicated repayments were unsustainable for
those loans. He found the settlement offer was fair and in line with our standard approach.
Mrs D responded to say, in summary, that she was already in difficulty with priority bills and 
could not afford to pay the adjusted balance.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mrs D and to Harvey & Thompson on 23 June 2022. Ive 
summarised my findings:
For loans 1 and 2, I was satisfied that Harvey & Thompson carried out proportionate 
checks, but that those checks showed significant spend on gambling and so it was 
irresponsible to have approved the lending;
I didnt consider Harvey & Thompsons checks went far enough for loan 3, but I found 
the information it did have indicated that further lending was irresponsible, and the 
repayments were likely to be unsustainable.
Harvey & Thompson agreed to uphold loans 4 and 5, so I didnt consider them 
further.
In summary, I found Harvey & Thompson was irresponsible to have approved loans 1 to 3, 
and should offer redress for those, as well as loans 4 & 5 for which it had already made an 
offer.
Both Mrs D and Harvey & Thompson responded to accept my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both parties accepted my provisional decision, I see no reason to depart from the 
conclusion I reached.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. Harvey & Thompson Limited should:
A. Refund all the interest and charges Mrs D paid on loans 1 to 4;
B. Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
C. Remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loan 5 and treat all 
the payments Mrs D made towards this loan as payments towards the 
capital;
D. If reworking Mrs Ds loan 5 account as Ive directed results in Mrs D effectively 
having made payments above the original capital borrowed, then Harvey & 
Thompson should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on 
the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date 
of settlement* along with the refund calculated (A+B) for loans 1 to 4;
E. If reworking Mrs Ds loan 5 account leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, 
then Harvey & Thompson can use the total refund for loans 1 to 4 (after the 
deduction of tax) to offset this. Any surplus then needs to be refunded to Mrs D. 
But if there is still an outstanding capital balance then I remind Harvey & 
Thompson that it should take a sympathetic view when seeking to agree an 
affordable repayment plan with Mrs D;
F. Remove adverse information about the loans up to the date the complaint is settled.*HM Revenue & Customs requires Harvey & Thompson to deduct tax from interest. Harvey
& Thompson must give Mrs D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 August 2022.
