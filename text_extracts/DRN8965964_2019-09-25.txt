K820x#14complaint
Mr A says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr A had four loans  with QuickQuid:
a £300 loan in March  2016
a £300 loan in August 2016
a £200 loan in October  2016
a £50 loan in December 2016
Our adjudicator thought that QuickQuid had taken proportionate steps to assess the 
affordability of the loans  before lending  and so didnt recommend the complaint be upheld.
Mr A didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mr As case.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr A 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr As income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
Mr A reported net income of around £1,100 per month and said he had expenses of £325  to 
£526 per month when  he took out the loans. He also told QuickQuid he was employed and 
living in rented accommodation. Ive seen no reason QuickQuid shouldve doubted what 
Mr A said about his income  and expenditure. On the basis of the information  he provided, 
I think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid to believe the loans were affordable for Mr A.
Ref: DRN89659642Ive seen that QuickQuid carried  out credit history checks  in addition to asking Mr A 
questions about  his income and expenditure. Mr A says that between May 2015 and 
July 2016 he had a large number of payday  loans and that QuickQuid ought to have been 
aware of this from its credit checks.  But I havent  seen the full details of QuickQuids  credit  
checks and so I cant say that these  would have revealed information  which  would (or 
should) have caused it not to lend to Mr A. The information a lender would see from a credit  
check isnt necessarily the same as a borrower  would see if they looked  at their whole credit  
history.
Ive also considered the pattern of borrowing but do not think  this shouldve concerned 
QuickQuid. The amounts Mr A was borrowing decreased significantly over time, he didnt 
demonstrate difficulty repaying the loans and only the last three  loans can be said to have 
been taken in quick succession.
I appreciate that Mr A may have  been  struggling  at the time but I dont think  QuickQuid acted 
irresponsibly when it lent to him.
my final decision
For the reasons  give above I do not uphold  Mr As complaint against CashEuroNet UK LLC.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 October  2019.
