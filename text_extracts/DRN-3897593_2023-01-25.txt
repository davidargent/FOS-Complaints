The complaint
Mr A, complaining as the director of Company I, is unhappy National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) declined a commercial mortgage application. 
What happened
Mr A has explained that after instructing a mortgage broker to help Company I obtain a 
commercial mortgage, he was able to secure an agreement in principle from NatWest on 13 
October 2020. Hes pointed out this wasnt Company Is only option but given hed been 
dealing with NatWest the longest, he chose to press ahead with its offer. 
In order to move the mortgage deal forward and comply with NatWests requirements, 
Company I had to instruct a solicitor and obtain a property valuation. Company I proceeded 
to do this and pay the associated costs. 
Then, in late November 2020, Mr A was notified by his broker that NatWest had pulled out of 
the mortgage deal and now wouldnt agree to provide Company I with the commercial 
mortgage. NatWest said it wouldnt give any more information or discuss the reason why. 
Mr A says his broker advised him to do a Subject Access Request to try and find out more 
information about why NatWest had pulled out of the mortgage deal. However, he was 
worried when the response to this was received as it said no information could be located. 
He therefore complained to NatWest wanting to know why it had taken the decision not to 
continue with the mortgage deal. He let it know he wanted Company I to be reimbursed for 
the cost of the solicitors searches and valuation. NatWest responded saying it had taken the 
commercial decision not to continue with the application and wouldnt disclose the reasons 
as to why. But it was satisfied it hadnt made an error. 
Mr A has pointed out that following NatWest pulling out of the mortgage deal, he found it 
very hard to source a new deal for Company I. By that point lenders were either not offering 
deals or were charging more interest or needing bigger deposits. He has since found a deal 
but Company I is paying more interest than it would have been on the NatWest mortgage. 
Mr A referred Company Is complaint to this service. Our investigator didnt uphold the 
complaint or recommend NatWest cover Company Is costs. She was happy NatWest was 
able to make the commercial decision not to proceed with the mortgage. She pointed out 
that Company I had received an offer in principle and the letter stated that the agreement is 
subject to certain preconditions being complied with, to the banks satisfaction. The letter 
also stated that it was not a formal offer, and NatWest was under no obligation to provide 
Company I with the facilities described in the letter. She also pointed out that NatWest is 
under no obligation to share its reasons for not proceeding with the mortgage. 
Mr A, on behalf of Company I, disagreed with the investigators conclusions. He 
acknowledged that a bank has the right to decline any service but said it should not force its 
customers to pay valuation fees and solicitor fees and wait such a long time before backing 
out of the deal. He says NatWest had already done its initial checks and verified Company I 
financially, so he has no idea why it would treat Company I in this way. Especially as it has 
now been able to successfully obtain a mortgage elsewhere. 
Because Mr A, on behalf of Company I, disagreed, the complaint has been passed to me to 
decide.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Company I had secured an agreement in principle from NatWest in October 2020. However, 
as stated in the letter, this wasnt a formal contract and placed no obligation on NatWest to 
offer Company I the facilities. I think the letter makes NatWests position clear and therefore 
it was a risk that Mr A should reasonably have been aware of.  
As it was, NatWest took the commercial decision to not continue with the application and 
formally offer Company I the mortgage.  Having considered its reasons for doing this Im 
satisfied it acted fairly. I appreciate it doesnt feel this way to Mr A and he would like to know 
the reason. But whilst I fully accept his frustration in not knowing, NatWest has no obligation 
to share this. And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to do so either. 
Ive looked at whether NatWest could have told Company I any sooner than it did about its 
decision not proceed, to avoid him paying the solicitor and surveyor costs. But based on my 
review of the reasons for the decision, Im satisfied it couldnt have. 
So, whilst I appreciate this will come as a disappointment to Mr A, I dont believe NatWest 
made any errors in not proceeding with Company Is mortgage application. It follows that I 
dont direct it to compensate Company I for the solicitor or surveyor costs.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Company Is complaint against National Westminster 
Bank Plc. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Company I to 
accept or reject my decision before 22 February 2023.
