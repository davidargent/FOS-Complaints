K820x#14Complaint
The estate  of Mrs E complains that National Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest) requested a 
copy of the will in order to provide information about  her holdings. 
Background
In April 2018 Mr K (the executor  of Mrs Es estate) contacted NatWest and asked for 
information about her holdings.  NatWest  responded on 27 April 2018 and said it couldnt  
provide any information to Mr K unless he supplied a copy  of Mrs Es will. On 21 May 2018 
Mr K emailed NatWest back and said the will had no legal authority and asked for the 
information again but it wasnt provided. 
In September  2018 NatWest reiterated  its request  for the late Mrs Es will. Mr K complained  
in October 2018  and later referred  the complaint to our service. The case was passed to an 
investigator to look at. 
The investigator didnt  uphold the complaint and didnt find that NatWest had made a 
mistake by requesting  a copy of the will. Mr K asked to appeal  on behalf  of the estate so his 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
A copy of the Grant of Probate confirming Mr Ks position as executor of Mrs Es estate  was 
sent to NatWest in September  2019  and funds totalling Â£4,054.01 were released. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr K says that hes known to NatWest because hes acted in relation to other  estates. But 
that doesnt mean NatWest is obliged to provide information about a different estate to him 
without first ensuring hes authorised to receive it. In this case, Im satisfied NatWest  was 
within its rights to request  a copy of Mrs Es will before releasing any information to Mr K. 
Mr K says that the will has no legal authority until its confirmed by the court.  Hes also said 
that theres no risk to NatWest in providing information about  a deceased customers 
account. But its up to NatWest to decide  what level of risk to accept and when to provide 
private information about a customers account.  NatWest says it asks for a copy of the will to 
ensure information  is released to the right person and Im satisfied thats  a decision its 
entitled to take.  
In response to the investigator Mr K said that, legally as the executor, he stepped  into the 
shoes of Mrs E. Mr K isnt the consumer, Mrs Es estate  remains  the consumer. Mr K is 
acting as executor  of the estate which means  he has the authority to act on its behalf. But I 
dont agree he is the complainant. 
Mr K also asked why NatWest didnt follow its instructions  to pay the funds directly to HMRC  
directly and says its obliged to under the Banking  Code. Ive looked at the current  
regulations but havent seen anything to indicate  NatWest should pay the proceeds  of an 
estate directly to HRMC on the executors behalf. But even  if I had, Id have to think  about  
the impact of the issue on the estate. Directing  the funds to the executor to settle  the estate 
Ref: DRN93335802hasnt caused  a loss. I dont  think that forwarding funds to the executor on settlement of the 
estate was unreasonably inconvenient.
Mr K says that his business is not a firm of solicitors and he feels  its being discriminated 
against because  of the requests NatWest  has made.  But, as Ive said above, this complaint 
relates to the estate  of Mrs E. We can only look at the impact  of the issues raised on the 
estate, not on Mr K or his business.  
For the reasons  Ive given above,  I havent  found anything to show NatWest made a 
mistake. As a result,  Im not telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K on behalf  of 
the estate of Mrs E to accept or reject my decision before  24 February 2020.
