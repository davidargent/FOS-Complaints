The complaint
Mr A complains New Day Ltd trading as Marbles (NewDay) lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr A applied for a credit card with NewDay and it agreed a relatively small credit limit. Over 
a short space of time NewDay increased Mr As credit limit to close to five times the original 
amount. NewDay then agreed a second card for Mr A.
Mr A complained to NewDay. He was gambling at the time of the application and up until 
fairly recently, but he doesnt think NewDay would have seen this. But Mr A feels NewDay 
lent to him when it should have been clear he was struggling with his finances.
NewDay responded to say its a second chance lender, one specialising in credit for people 
with poor lending history. NewDay said it offered Mr A a low credit limit when he first applied 
and because Mr A used his card responsibly it increased his limit several times.
Mr A still felt NewDay hadnt been fair when it agreed his second card, so he brought his 
complaint to this service. An investigator looked into things and felt Mr As complaint should 
be upheld in part.
The investigator thought the initial credit card and the next two increases had been fair. But 
they felt the last increase, and the second card, had been lent irresponsibly. The investigator 
thought NewDay should have done more checks, including asking for bank statements.
If NewDay had done this, the investigator thought it wouldnt have increased Mr As credit 
limit the last time or offered him a new card. 
The investigator thought NewDay should refund some specific charges and interest and 
remove any adverse data.
Mr A accepted this assessment. NewDay said it didnt believe it had made any mistakes 
when it lent to Mr A. NewDay said Mr A ran his first card well, and paid more than the 
minimum payment each month.
NewDay also said it didnt ask Mr A for his bank statements as it never does this. NewDay 
felt the checks it had carried out were sufficient to show Mr A could afford the credit. 
NewDay asked for an ombudsman to decide things.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When a business agrees to lend it should take steps to ensure its lending in a responsible 
way. NewDay was lending to Mr A under an open ended agreement, so it also needed to 
ensure Mr A was able to make repayments to pay off the lending in a reasonable period.
NewDay opened Mr As credit card in August 2015 with a limit of £450. This limit was 
increased to £850 in November 2015, £1,100 in April 2016 and £1,900 in September 2016. 
A second card, with a limit of £300 was opened in March 2018.
At the time NewDay originally lent to Mr A I think it took steps to ensure the lending was 
responsible. Mr A was a new customer, but had declared an income sufficient to service the 
initial limit and his credit file didnt show any defaulted accounts or accounts in arrears.
NewDay increased Mr As limit by comparatively small amounts until it reached £1,100. Mr A 
hadnt exceeded the limit and was generally managing his credit card well. I dont think there 
was anything in the way Mr A ran his account that would mean NewDay should have taken 
further information from Mr A to see what his financial situation was.
But the last credit limit increase was large, almost doubling his limit from £1,100 to £1,900 
and was very soon after the last increase. And Mr A hadnt managed the most recent limit 
increase well.
Mr A had immediately used almost all the new credit he was given and then exceeded his  
new, £1,100, credit limit. Mr A had also made cash advances throughout the time hed held 
the card. And Mr A hadnt paid much more than the minimum payment for the duration of the 
agreement and his debt to NewDay had steadily increased.
The UK Card Association released guidance in 2011 and this lists risk indicators for 
unsolicited credit limit increases. These risk indicators include:
a significant increase in overall outstanding balances over time
instances of exceeding credit limits
making frequent use of cash advances
The guidance says, in isolation, these indicators may not be a sign of risk. But I think 
NewDay was aware of all the indicators above, yet it still increased Mr As credit limit.
I think NewDay should have carried out more checks around Mr As ability to repay his debt 
in a reasonable time. And, although the checks expected of NewDay arent prescriptive, I 
think it would have been reasonable for NewDay to ask Mr A for his bank statements.
NewDay says its never requested bank statements from its borrowers. This doesnt mean 
NewDay cant ask for statements. NewDay has to ensure Mr A was able to repay his debt in 
a reasonable period and asking for bank statements is a fair way of doing this.
Had NewDay asked for Mr As bank statements it would have seen an account being used 
up to its overdraft limit every month. NewDay would also have seen outgoings that werent 
on Mr As credit file as well as several short-term lending credits and repayments.
Looking at Mr As statements around the time of the last credit limit increase its clear he was 
under financial pressure.
I think NewDay had reason to carry out further checks before the last credit increase and 
failed to do so. I think those reasonable checks would have shown that Mr A had a 
worsening financial position and shouldnt be offered further credit limit increases.
And since I dont think NewDay should have increased Mr As limit in September 2016 I dont 
think it should have agreed a new card in March 2018.Putting things right
Mr A shouldnt have to pay interest and charges on the amount I think NewDay irresponsibly 
lent. This isnt the whole amount of Mr As first credit card limit, just the last increase of £800. 
Its fair Mr A repays the amount he borrowed, hes had benefit of the money.
Because I think NewDay should have left Mr As credit limit at £1,100 any balance above this 
amount should be free of interest and charges.
For the second card, I dont believe Mr A should pay any of the interest or charges NewDay 
applied. Mr A should only have to repay what he borrowed on the card.
And because I think NewDay lent irresponsibly I dont think its fair to report adverse 
information to credit reference agencies after it made the wrong decision to lend.
My final decision
My final decision is I uphold Mr As complaint and NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles must:
refund any interest on balances over £1,100 on Mr As first credit card
if this refund creates a credit balance, pay 8% simple interest from the date the credit 
balance arose to the date of settlement
remove any adverse credit file entries for Mr As first credit card from September 
2016, the date of the last credit limit increase
refund all interest and charges applied to Mr As second credit card
if this refund creates a credit balance, pay 8% simple interest from the date the credit 
balance arose to the date of settlement
remove any adverse credit file entries for Mr As second card 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 October 2021.
