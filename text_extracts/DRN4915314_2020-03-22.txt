K821x#15complaint
Mr H has complained PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA blocked his account and wouldnt 
allow him access to his funds.
background
Mr H found his PayPal  account was blocked. He asked PayPal why this had happened as he 
had some money remaining in his account.
He was told his account was linked  to another account which was in deficit.  Hed be 
expected to pay that. As he wasnt given any further  information, Mr H brought his complaint 
to the ombudsman service.
PayPal refused to provide any information to our investigator about what  had happened 
here. If there  had been a case of ID fraud, they felt data protection rules meant they couldnt 
share any information. They also expected law enforcement to investigate  any ID fraud.
Our investigator felt  based on PayPals unwillingness to share  information   on balance he 
couldnt tell that PayPal  had acted correctly in blocking Mr Hs account.  He asked them to 
release the money in Mr Hs account. If, however, PayPal wished to close  Mr Hs account he 
accepted they could  do that.
PayPal asked an ombudsman to make a decision on this complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as our investigator. Ill explain why.
The main  issue to address is that PayPal has provided us with no evidence  at all. We dont 
have evidence of:
Mr Hs use of his own account;  
what account may have been linked to him; or
what factors PayPal took into account  when they made their decision to block Mr Hs 
account.
PayPal has said theyd  expect law enforcement to be involved if this was identity theft. The 
problem is I cant tell whether it is identity  theft or not as they refuse to share  even basic  
information. I respect PayPal must have internal policies and processes to follow but they 
are also aware of our rules. These  say under DISP 3.5.9 I am able to:
(3) reach a decision on the basis of what has been  supplied and take account  of the failure  
by a party to provide information requested
So Ive considered PayPals refusal to provide further information.  Ive also considered the 
fact that Mr Hs account only has £110  currently in it. I dont see there  being  any harm in 
asking PayPal to pay this money  to him.
Ref: DRN49153142If however PayPal wish to close Mr Hs account, I dont think it would be wrong  for them  to 
do so. They  are able to decide  who they wish to have as a customer.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is to instruct  PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA to 
return money to Mr H that has been  blocked on his account. I believe this to be £110.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 April 2020.
