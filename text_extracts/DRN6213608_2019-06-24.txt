K822xcomplaint
Mr and Mrs R complain about  Phoenix  Life Limited  not having  administered their whole of 
life plan properly  because it failed to deduct the right charges for around  six years and then 
deducted all the missed charges in 2017.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint a copy of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision. In short I found  that:
There was no dispute Phoenix had got things wrong and it had been right in 2017 to 
put the policy back in the position it shouldve been in if it had deducted the charges it 
shouldve done from 2012.
There was no basis for thinking  that Mr and Mrs R wouldve cancelled  the policy 
sooner if the deductions had been made  when they shouldve  been simply because 
they wouldve  seen  the plan value  go down  given the value of the plan in 2011 
before Phoenix  got things wrong  was only £69.
But the plan wouldve  failed the review  in 2017 if the deductions  had been  made  as 
they shouldve  been. And it is more likely than not that they wouldve cancelled the 
plan if that had happened.
I gave both parties the opportunity of responding. Phoenix said it agreed with my provisional  
decision. Mr and Mrs R didnt provide any further  information.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given Phoenix has agreed with my provisional decision and no further information has been 
provided my findings remain the same as in my provisional decision. 
What Phoenix should  do to put things right. 
Phoenix has calculated  that if they had cancelled the plan in 2017 the surrender value of the 
plan wouldve been £454.23. In addition the premiums they have  paid between  July 2017 
and their last payment  in May 2018  amounts to £1,093.18.
Phoenix should pay Mr and Mrs R the surrender value together  with simple interest at 8% 
from 1 July 2017 to date of settlement and repay  the premiums of £1,093.18 together with 
simple interest at 8% on each premium payment from date of payment to date of settlement.
Phoenix has offered  Mr and Mrs R £150 for the distress and inconvenience  of not having 
deducted the incremental debt over a period of nearly six years. But that was on the basis 
that there  were no other consequences  of this and Mr and Mrs R had been put back in the 
position they would have  been. Given my decision they were  not put back  in the position 
they wouldve  been in but for the mistake and I think a total of £300  should be paid for the 
distress and inconvenience caused.
my final decision
Ref: DRN62136082I uphold this complaint  for the reasons explained  above and in provisional decision.  Phoenix 
Life Limited has to pay the redress I have  set out above 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs R to 
accept or reject my decision  before  24 July 2019.

complaint
Mr and Mrs R complain about Phoenix Life Limited not having administered their whole  of life plan 
properly because it failed  to deduct the right charges for around six years  and then deducted all the 
missed charges in 2017.
background
Mr and Mrs R took out the plan in 1991 to provide life cover and critical illness cover of £48,000 at a 
premium of £25 a month. The plan was indexed  so the amount of cover and premium  went  up each 
year. It was a unit-linked  plan, so the premium purchased units with the charges  then being  paid by 
deduction of sufficient units to cover the charges.
In 2017 Phoenix noticed the plan charges  werent right and that it hadnt been deducting  enough  from 
the plan for several years. Phoenix put tings right by deducting the units  it had previously  failed to 
deduct to cover the charges  between 2012 and 2017 which  meant the fund value of the plan reduced 
from £731  to £113. 
When Mr and Mrs R complained Phoenix acknowledged it had got things wrong but said the plan was 
now in the position  it should be in and offered £150 for the distress and inconvenience caused  by its 
mistake. Mr and Mrs R stopped  paying  into the plan in June  2018 as they decided not to keep it 
going.
Mr and Mrs R referred  their complaint to us and wanted us to take account  of the fact that if the 
correct charges had been applied originally they wouldve considered ending the plan because  the 
fund value wouldve been much lower. They  said they wanted Phoenix to refund the premiums paid 
since 2012 and any charges  and also provide  a proper  and full apology.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.  
There is no dispute that Phoenix got things wrong by not deducting the right amount of charges for a 
period of around six years. The plan was index linked  so that the amount of cover and premium 
increased each year. Up until the end of 2011 the charges had included an amount that became  
payable as a result of the indexation. Phoenix refers to this as an incremental debt and has explained 
it shouldve been added to the plan and then paid back by deduction of units  from the plan over the 
months after indexation.
Phoenix has explained that due to a system change  this stopped at the beginning of 2012 so that the 
incremental debt wasnt being applied.  This meant the right number of units werent being deducted 
as they shouldve  been so the plan had more  units, and so a greater value, than it shouldve  done.
By deducting the units that shouldve been deducted  between 2012 and the end of 2017 Phoenix has 
put the plan back in the position it wouldve been in if no mistake had been made. I dont think  
Phoenix were wrong  to put the plan back in the position  it should be in.
That is not the end of the matter though because it is possible Mr and Mrs R may have chosen to do 
something different  with their plan, such as cancel it, if the incremental  debt had been applied as it 
shouldve been done from 2012.
From the information Phoenix  has provided  the plan had a value  of only around £69 in 2011. If the 
incremental debt had been applied in 2012 this wouldve reduced the value  to just over £61 and then 
around £45 in 2013. As Mr and Mrs R the reduced the sum assured  in 2014 the plan value actually  
Ref: DRN62136084wouldve gone  up each  year from then by a small  amount until 2017 when the value was £113.  
Instead what  Mr and Mrs R saw was a steadily increasing value up to 2017 when it was just short  of 
£752.
But I can see no basis for thinking that Mr and Mrs R wouldve decided to cancel the plan earlier if the 
incremental debt had been applied simply  because this wouldve reduced the plan value. 
The value was only £69 in 2011 and they were happy to keep  it going with that value. And I think  it is 
clear that the value of the plan wasnt something that was a significant issue for them. If Phoenix had 
not made mistake the value of the plan would have fallen slightly  and then increased  a bit each year 
until it reached £113 in 2017. The difference in value  each year wouldve  been so small  it is 
questionable whether Mr and Mrs R wouldve taken  any notice  of them  at all.
But there is another issue with regard to the failure  to apply the incremental debt. The plan was 
reviewed each year to see if the current premium (including the effect  of indexation  for that year) was 
enough to provide the current  sum assured going  forwards. Not applying the incremental debt means  
these reviews may not have been  right.
I asked Phoenix to reconstruct the previous  reviews  on the basis that the incremental  debt had been 
applied. Having done this Phoenix has established that all of the previous reviews wouldve resulted  
in the same outcome,  apart from the 2017 review.
Phoenix has confirmed that the plan wouldve failed the 2017 review. This wouldve meant Mr and 
Mrs R shouldve  been  given  the option of either increasing their premium from just above £99 to just 
short of £132 to keep  the sum assured at £64,225,  or keep the premium the same but reduce the sum 
assured to £47,600.
They could also have chosen to simply  stop paying into the plan if they didnt think either  option  was 
attractive. So I have considered what I think they are likely to have done  if they had received  the 
correct review in 2017. 
I think  it is very unlikely they wouldve decided to increase  the premium.  Im mindful that they had 
chosen in September 2013 to reduce  the premium  to £80, and the sum assured from £88,580 to 
£51,700.
Mr and Mrs R again asked Phoenix to reduce the premium  back to £80 in June 2015  after it had gone 
up because of indexation. But it said it was unable  to do this and kept the premium at £86 with a sum 
assured of £55,577.  The sum assured was £59,745 (after indexation)  in 2016 with a premium  of 
around £92. In 2017 the sum assured was £64,225 (after indexation) with a premium around £99.
Although Mr and Mrs R had accepted the indexed increases in 2016  and 2017, given  they had 
requested a reduction to the premium in 2013  and 2015  I think  its very unlikely they wouldve  been 
willing to pay £135 to stop the sum assured being reduced each month if the review  in 2016 had gone 
ahead as it should. So would they instead  have  decided  to reduce the sum assured to £47,600 whilst  
paying a premium  of just over £99? 
This was a very significant reduction to the sum assured when you consider that the previous year 
they had nearly £60,000  of cover for a premium around £92. Im not persuaded that they wouldve 
thought that it wouldve been worth continuing  the plan, paying a premium just short of £100 given  
such a significant reduction to their cover. I think its more likely  than not they wouldve cancelled the 
plan in 2017  rather than in 2018 if the incremental debt had been applied  as it shouldve  been so the 
plan had failed the review.
Ref: DRN62136085What Phoenix should  do to put things right. 
Phoenix has calculated that if they had cancelled  the plan in 2017 the surrender value of the plan 
wouldve been  £454.23.  In addition the premiums  they have paid between  July 2017 and their last 
payment in May 2018 amounts to £1,093.18.
Phoenix should pay Mr and Mrs R the surrender value together with simple interest at 8% from 1 July 
2017 to date of settlement and repay the premiums of £1,093.18 together with simple interest at 8% 
on each premium  payment from date of payment  to date of settlement.
Phoenix has offered Mr and Mrs R £150 for the distress and inconvenience of not having deducted 
the incremental debt over a period of nearly six years. But that was on the basis that there were  no 
other consequences  of this and Mr and Mrs R had been put back  in the position  they would have 
been. Given my decision they were not put back in the position  they wouldve  been in but for the 
mistake and I think a total of £300 should be paid for the distress and inconvenience caused.
my provisional  decision
I uphold this complaint for the reasons  I have  explained above. Phoenix Life Limited has to pay Mr 
and Mrs R the redress I have set out above.
