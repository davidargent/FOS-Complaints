K820x#14complaint
Mr O and Miss H complain that they didnt receive  the homebuyers report that they paid for 
when they applied to National Westminster Bank Plc for a mortgage.  They  ask that the cost 
of the report is refunded.
background
Mr O and Miss H applied  to NatWest for a mortgage  in mid 2018. They say they paid for a 
homebuyers report in September 2018 but only received  a basic valuation.  Despite chasing 
NatWest and the surveyor they still hadnt  received the homebuyers  report by the end of 
October 2018 when  they were ready to exchange contracts. They  had to proceed  without the 
homebuyers report.  Their purchase completed at the end of November 2018.
NatWest contacted the surveyor about  Mr O and Miss Hs complaint. The surveyor  told 
NatWest it had sent terms and conditions to Mr O and Miss H by post and email and hadnt 
received a response. Mr O and Miss H say they didnt receive the terms and conditions from 
the surveyor until 29 October 2018, when it was too late. 
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that the complaint  should  be upheld.  He said while 
NatWest instructed the surveyor  on behalf  of Mr O and Miss H it wasnt  responsible  for the 
problems they met with. NatWests responsibility was to instruct a suitably qualified  surveyor 
to carry out the valuation.  NatWest didnt require Mr O and Miss H to get a homebuyers  
report. It wasnt responsible for any errors made  by the surveyor.
Mr O and Miss H didnt  agree. Mr O said just because NatWest  chose  to instruct a third 
party, this didnt absolve them of their duties  and responsibilities under the contract  it had 
with them.  He said NatWest had a duty to supply the service  theyd paid for. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
what happened?
NatWests notes say that Mr O and Miss H paid for a homebuyers  report on 
20 September 2018 and it gave instructions for a homebuyers report on 21 September  2018. 
The valuation was carried  out on 22 September 2018.
Mr O and Miss H received a mortgage offer and a copy of the basic valuation on 
26 September 2018. 
Mr O and Miss Hs broker contacted NatWest on 8 October 2018  to chase the homebuyers 
report. NatWests notes say it contacted the surveyor and asked it to resend its terms and 
conditions to Mr O and Miss H by email. Mr O and Miss H also contacted  the surveyor. The 
surveyor told them it needed  them to return a signed  copy  of the terms and conditions. 
Ref: DRN44842802Mr O and Miss Hs broker complained to NatWest  at the end of October  2018 as they still 
hadnt received  the homebuyers report. Mr O and Miss H asked  for a refund of the fee theyd 
paid for this as it was now too late for them to review the report before exchanging contracts.
did NatWest make an error?
NatWest doesnt  itself carry out surveys and valuations. It instructed a member of the 
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) to carry  out a valuation  on its behalf  to help 
it assess whether the property was suitable security  for the loan. 
NatWest offered an option for customers to pay for the same surveyor  to provide a more  
detailed survey. Mr O and Miss H paid for a homebuyers report. Ive asked NatWest what  
Mr O and Miss H were  told about  the process. NatWest said it doesnt tell customers  that the 
surveyor will contact  them directly, only that they would be sent a copy  of the report. 
So I think Mr O and Miss H expected to receive the homebuyers report  in due course. I think 
it would  have been helpful if NatWest  had told them the surveyor would contact them  before 
it sent the report. Mr O and Miss H would have been  able to chase matters sooner.
I think NatWest  responded appropriately  when the broker contacted  it in early October 2018 
about the homebuyers report. It contacted  the surveyor to check  what  was happening and 
asked it to re-send  the terms and conditions  by email. Mr O and Miss H were  also in direct  
contact with the surveyor at this point.
I also think NatWest responded appropriately when Mr O and Miss Hs broker  made a 
complaint. NatWest contacted the surveyor to find out what had happened.  The surveyor 
said it sent terms and conditions to Mr O and Miss H by post on 24 September  2018 and by 
email in early October 2018 and at the end of October. The surveyor  said its unable to 
provide the homebuyers report to Mr O and Miss H until they sign and return  the terms and 
conditions.
what should happen now?
I think NatWest  could  have given Mr O and Miss H clearer information  about what  would 
happen after they paid for the homebuyers report. But I dont  think  NatWest is responsible 
for Mr O and Miss H not receiving the homebuyers  report in time to consider it before 
exchanging contracts. 
Mr O and Miss H were  in contact with the surveyor in early October 2018. They say they 
were ready to exchange contracts at the end of October 2018. I think this was enough time 
for the surveyor and Mr O and Miss H to sort out what  needed to happen  so that the 
homebuyers report could  be sent to them. 
It follows that, in the circumstances, I dont think its fair and reasonable to require NatWest 
to refund the cost of the report.
Ref: DRN44842803my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O and Miss H 
to accept or reject my decision before 28 April 2019.
