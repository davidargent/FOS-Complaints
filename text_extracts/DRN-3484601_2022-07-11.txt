The complaint
Mrs G is unhappy that ReAssure Limited provided her with incorrect pension values.
What happened
Mrs G received a pension statement in 2017. It showed the current value as £226.33.
It also showed assumed current values at different ages which ranged from £236 at age 55 
to £313 at age 75. 
It also showed the current value of units as £1,249.47. The value of units for future ages was 
the same as the corresponding current value (i.e. £236 - £313). Underneath it explained that:
Your current value of £226.33 is how much your policy is worth today. Your policy includes 
some units which are used to pay for the costs of setting up your policy including advice 
costs or commission paid to advisers. Youll only receive the value of these units if you die 
before taking your policy benefits and they will cease to have any value at the originally 
selected retirement date of your policy.
Mr G called ReAssure and queried what policy this referred to as she thought she had 
transferred it to a different provider. She was told she had two policies under the same 
reference. Only one had been transferred. Mrs G says she was told in the same call the 
policy had exit penalties and she could get the higher value of £1,249 if she waited until age 
55.
In 2018 the statement showed a value of £234.98 with a value of units of £1,297.19.
In 2019 the statement showed a value of £251.74 with a value of units of £1,389.73.
In January 2020 Mrs G received a letter showing her retirement options as she was 
approaching 55. The current value was £636.16. The letter said:
Why is this different from the value in the enclosed Your Pension pot summary (which 
showed as £1,413,70)
This could be because there are features of your policy that mean you wont receive its full 
value under certain circumstances, or that your policy contains units which are only paid if 
you die before your originally selected retirement date. From your 55th birthday the most that 
any reduction of this type could be is 1% of the total policy value and after your originally 
selected retirement date there will be no reduction at all.
A statement sent two days later showed a value of £633.81 with a value of units of 
£1,408.46. It showed an assumed current value for age 55 of £1,630 and a value of units as 
£1,650.
Mrs G called ReAssure in July 2020 after she had turned 55 as she wanted to take a lump 
sum payment. She was provided with a fund value of £1,345.61 and a transfer value of 
£1,332.15 over the phone. Similar figures were confirmed to her in a follow up letter to that 
call and Mrs G returned her application to take a lump sum in early August 2020.
ReAssure called Mrs G later that month to tell her that the last quoted values were wrong 
due a system error. The real value of her policy was £240.18.
Unhappy with this, Mrs G complained. She wants ReAssure to honour the higher value that 
was quoted to her. 
ReAssure admitted they had made an error and apologised to Mrs G. They paid her £250 
compensation acknowledging they had given her a false expectation of how much she would 
receive from the policy.
Mrs G remained unhappy and complained to this service. Our investigator thought the offer 
made by ReAssure was fair.
As no agreement could be reached, Mrs Gs complaint was passed to me a for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs G says when she spoke to ReAssure in 2017 she was told the different values on the 
statement were due to exit penalties and if she waited until 55 she would receive the higher 
figure. So she had no reason to doubt the similar figures quoted to her in 2020.
She provided the handwritten notes she took on the 2017 statement which showed the date 
she called and the name of the call handler she spoke to and in brief terms what was 
discussed. Her notes said: 
This policy value £1,249.41 has huge ext clause. Wait till 2020 get full amount (Age) 55.
ReAssure doesnt have the call recording, but the date and name of the call handler matches 
and the part of the conversation where ReAssure confirmed that Mrs G had two policies and 
one had been transferred to a different provider matches Mrs Gs notes. 
Of course I dont know what was exactly discussed, but I think Mrs Gs contemporaneous 
notes reflect what she took away from the conversation and support her testimony here that 
she had thought since 2017 she would receive the higher figure quoted on the statements 
when she turned 55.
There is no dispute that Mrs G was given wrong information by ReAssure over the phone 
and in letters in 2020. And there was no reason in my view for her to doubt the figures she 
was given. When she was informed that these values were incorrect and a lot lower than 
expected she understandably was disappointed and upset.
When considering complaints this services aim is to put customers as much as possible into 
the position they would likely be in if errors had not happened. The information provided by 
ReAssure to Mrs G was misleading and unclear, but she would never have been entitled to 
the higher value of the policy. So I dont think its fair to ask ReAssure to pay her the 
difference.
She also couldnt have taken her benefits before 55 in any event, so the misinformation she 
likely received in 2017 didnt prevent her in my view from accessing her benefits earlier than 
she did.I have sympathy for Mrs Gs situation and I appreciate she has suffered a loss of expectation 
and that she was disappointed and upset when she was told at the last minute the values 
were a lot lower than previously confirmed.
However, in the particular circumstances of the complaint I consider the amount of £250 paid 
by ReAssure fair and reasonable.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint and wont require ReAssure Limited to make any further award.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 August 2022.
