K822xcomplaint
Mr R has complained through a third party about  the loans CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as 
QuickQuid) lent to him. Mr R says he couldnt  afford the loans.
background 
QuickQuid gave Mr R a total of 11 loans between  July 2011 and May 2014.  From  the 
information QuickQuid  has provided, the loans were as follows:
loan 
numberdate taken amount date repaid
1 14/07/11 £250 28/07/11
2 02/08/11 £100 18/08/11
3 02/09/11 £150 12/09/11
4 01/10/11 £100 12/10/11
5 02/12/11 £100 14/12/11
6 31/12/11 £150 11/01/12
7 05/02/12 £100 15/02/12
8 29/02/12 £300 12/04/12
9 05/05/12 £100 08/06/12
10 08/08/12 £50 11/09/12
11 28/05/14 £600 19/11/14
Loans 1 to 10 were  payday loans while loan 11 was a flex credit account  where  Mr R could 
draw down up to his credit limit of £600  and repay  it typically  over 10 monthly instalments.
When Mr R complained to QuickQuid but it didnt uphold his complaint.  It said it carried out 
proportionate checks before agreeing  to lend any of the loans and it didnt think  Mr R was 
dependent on the loans  as there were gaps in his lending history.
Unhappy with QuickQuids response, Mr R referred  his complaint to this service where it was 
looked at by one of our adjudicators. When QuickQuid  responded to this service  about 
Mr Rs complaint, QuickQuid acknowledged that it didnt  responsibly lend loans 2 to 4, 6 and 
8. QuickQuid made an offer to refund the fees and charges Mr R paid towards those loans 
plus interest. Our adjudicator looked  at the complaint  and didnt recommend that any further  
loans should be upheld and put QuickQuids offer to Mr R through his third party 
representative.
Mr R didnt accept the offer and provided further  information. Our adjudicator then 
reconsidered the complaint and thought in addition to the offer QuickQuid  already  made,  it 
was wrong to give Mr R loan 1 as well. QuickQuid agreed  with the adjudicators  
recommendation but Mr R didnt  and asked for an ombudsman to review  his complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
QuickQuid was required to lend responsibly. It needed to make checks  to see whether Mr R 
could afford  to pay back each loan before it lent to him. The guidance in place  at the time of 
Ref: DRN61459182loans 1 and 10 wasnt prescriptive about  what checks  a lender needed to carry out. But it 
was clear about the responsibility of the lender to take reasonable steps to ensure that a 
borrower can sustainably  repay their loans. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT)  Irresponsible  
Lending Guidance  states Assessing  affordability is a borrower-focussed test which  involves 
a creditor assessing  a borrowers  ability to undertake a specific credit commitment,  or 
specific additional credit  commitment, in a sustainable manner, without the borrower 
incurring (further) financial difficulties. 
The guidance goes  on say that repaying credit in a sustainable manner means being able to 
repay credit out of income  and/or available savings and without undue difficulty. And it 
defines undue difficulty  as being  able to repay  credit while also meeting other  debt 
repayments and normal/reasonable  outgoings  and without having to borrow  further to meet 
these repayments
By the time of loan 11, the Financial  Conduct Authority (FCA)  was now the regulator of 
businesses such as QuickQuid and its guidance echoed that of the OFT in that QuickQuid 
needed to carry  out borrower  focussed checks to satisfy itself the Mr R could sustainably 
repay the loan before  agreeing to lend.
As QuickQuid has agreed that it shouldnt have lent Mr R loans 2 to 4, 6 and 8, 
I havent reconsidered those loans in this decision as the offer QuickQuid has made  is in line 
with what Id have  directed  it to do had I upheld Mr Rs complaint about those loans. In 
relation to loan 1, Ive looked  at Mr Rs circumstances at the time and I agree with our 
adjudicator that he couldnt afford  the loan repayment and so QucikQuids offer on this loan 
is also in line with this services approach.
Ive focussed  this decision on the loans  that are still in dispute, loans 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11.
what checks did QuickQuid carry out and were they proportionate?
QuickQuid has said before it lent Mr R each loan, it checked his income,  employment  status  
and also searched  his credit file. And before it lent Mr R loan 11, it checked his expenses as 
well.
At the time of loans  1 to 10, Mr Rs declared  income  was £800 and by the time Mr R applied 
for loan 11, his declared income had increased  to £3,485 per month  and his declared 
monthly living costs were £550. 
By the time Mr R was taking out loan 5, he had been  continuously  borrowing from QuickQuid 
for about five months. I think this may have suggested that he was dependent on these 
loans and QuickQuid  shouldve wanted  to build a clear picture of Mr Rs financial 
circumstances including  independently verifying  some of the information Mr R provided. 
Mr Rs pattern of borrowing continued from loan 5 to 10 and QuickQuids checks  before 
lending each  of those loans should  have gone further.
There was a gap of over two years from the time Mr R repaid loan 10 and when he borrowed 
loan 11. I think  this gap was sufficient  to break the lending chain and QuickQuid couldve 
reasonably believed that Mr R wasnt dependent on these loans. Mr R declared  an income 
that was more than four times what hed previously declared, however, his job details  
remained the same. Although QuickQuid checked his outgoings, I think  the rise income  
based on the same job should have prompted QuickQuid to ask further questions  to 
understand this change. So I think QuickQuids checks shouldve  gone further here.
Ref: DRN61459183if QuickQuid carried out sufficient/proportionate checks, what  is it likely  to have found?
Mr R has provided copies  of his bank statements from the time these loans were given and 
Ive used these  statements  to attempt to reconstruct  his circumstances at the time the loans 
were lent. Im not suggesting  here that QuickQuid  had to request Mr Ds bank statements as 
there are number of ways  it couldve verified  the information provided  such  as payslips  and 
utility bills. 
Of course,  I accept different checks might show different things. And just because something  
shows up in the information Mr R has provided now, doesnt  mean  it wouldve shown up in 
any checks QuickQuid mightve  carried out. But in the absence of anything  else from 
QuickQuid showing what this information would have shown, I think its perfectly fair and 
reasonable to place  considerable weight on it as an indication of what  Mr Rs financial 
circumstances were  likely to have  been at the time.
By the time Mr R was taking loan 5, QuickQuid is likely to have found that his income had 
increased to around  £1,355 per month and his outgoings  were around £790  this included  
his rent, food, transport,  phone and regular credit  commitments.  This suggests that Mr R 
was in a position to afford the loan repayment  of around £119.29.
For loans 7 and 9, Mr Rs monthly income  was around £1,210 and has also receiving what  
seemed like a monthly student loan payment of over £400 and his normal living costs were  
around £800. And although he was now borrowing from another short  term lender, his 
circumstances still suggest that he could afford the loan repayments of £105.68 and £118.75 
respectively.
When Mr R took out loan 10, his income  was around £1,367 and he was still receiving his 
student loan payment. Mr Rs normal living costs were around £944 and I can also see that 
he had over £300 outstanding to another short term lender. Given his income I think Mr R 
was likely in a position to sustainably afford the loan repayment of around  £61.25.
And had QuickQuid taken  steps to understand Mr Rs employment situation  and his new 
declared income before agreeing to lend loan 11, it would have found  that Mr R was in a 
position to make the maximum  repayment on this flex credit  of around £192. Ive also 
considered how this flex credit account  was operated.  I can see that Mr R didnt draw down 
funds to the limit but borrowed £400 which he repaid within six months.  I can also see that 
he didnt take any further borrowing. Overall, I dont  think QuickQuid did anything wrong with 
the operation  of the flex credit.
Altogether, I consider that had QuickQuid  carried out proportionate  checks,  its likely  to have 
found that Mr R could sustainably repay loans 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11. As QuickQuid 
acknowledges that it shouldnt have given Mr R loans 1 to 4, 6 and 8, it needs to put things 
right as Mr R has lost out as a result of being  lent these loans.
putting things right
QuickQuid needs  to put Mr R back in the position he wouldve been  had he not been lent 
loans 1 to 4 and loans  6 and 8. So QuickQuid needs to:
refund  any interest and charges  Mr R paid towards  these loans.
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement*.  
Ref: DRN61459184remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Rs credit file in relation to the loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. 
QuickQuid must give Mr R a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Rs complaint  in part and require CashEuroNet  UK LLC to put things right as 
stated above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 April 2019.
