The complaint
Mrs S complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their decision to decline the 
dispute she made through their Buyer Protection Policy (BPP).
What happened
On 14 April 2021, Mrs S used her PayPal account to pay for work to her property. Mrs S paid 
a total of Â£5,816.96 to a third-party company, who Ill refer to as X, with her credit card 
used as the funding source.
But Mrs S was unhappy with the service X provided and the work they completed. So, Mrs S 
opened a dispute through PayPals BPP, stating the goods she received from X were 
Significantly Not as Described (SNAD) on 25 July.
PayPal reviewed the claim on 17 August and closed it in the Xs favour as they didnt think it 
met the criteria needed to be classed as a valid SNAD claim. Mrs S appealed this decision, 
but PayPals decision remained the same. Mrs S was unhappy about this, so she raised a 
complaint.
Mrs S didnt think PayPal acted fairly when declining her claim. She thought her claim should 
meet the criteria of an SNAD claim, as the goods shed purchased hadnt been waterproof 
as shed been told they would be. And she thought X had failed to provide her with the 
service theyd described they would, so she thought this should be covered and the money 
returned to her. Mrs S was also unhappy that PayPal didnt make it clear processing the 
transaction through them may affect her Section 75 rights.
PayPal responded to the complaint and didnt uphold it. They explained their BPP is a 
voluntary service and isnt intended to act as a warranty or insurance product. So, any 
quality and expectation issues surrounding a service thats been provided arent covered 
under this. Because of this, they thought their decision to decline the claim was fair and they 
didnt think they needed to do anything more. Mrs S remained unhappy with this response, 
so she referred her complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. They didnt think Mrs S 
dispute met the criteria of a SNAD claim. So, they didnt think PayPal acted unfairly when 
declining it. 
And they explained PayPals decision on what to advertise on their website falls under the 
remit of their business process. And they explained our service is unable to comment on, or 
ask PayPal to change, their business processes. So, they didnt think they could say PayPal 
acted unfairly when not explaining how a Section 75 claim may be impacted if their services 
were used. Because of this, they didnt think PayPal needed to do anything more.
Mrs S didnt agree. She maintained her belief that the goods X provided were SNAD and so, 
she thought her claim shouldve been upheld by PayPal. And she provided photos of the 
damage the work caused to support this. Mrs S also maintained her belief that PayPal 
shouldve made her aware of the risks of using their service and how it may impact her 
Section 75 rights.
Our investigator considered these points, but this didnt change their view. They explained 
they felt it was reasonable to assume the damage caused to Mrs S property was more likely 
due to the workmanship, rather than the quality of the goods. So, they didnt think the claim 
met the criteria for a SNAD claim and they didnt think PayPal needed to do anything more. 
Mrs S didnt agree, so the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mrs S. I think its clear from 
the photos shes provided that the work X completed has led to damage to her property. 
And I recognise this will be both upsetting and financially impactful on Mrs S. So, I can 
understand why Mrs S would turn to PayPals BPP to see if she could recoup the money she 
paid to cover some of the costs of the rectification work. And when PayPal declined the 
claim she made, I can understand why Mrs S would be unhappy about this and question 
whether it was fair for PayPal to do so.
But for me to say PayPal have done something wrong, Id need to be satisfied that they 
failed to act in line with their BPP when declining the claim. Or, if I think they did act within 
this, that it was unfair of them to do so. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
Before I explain how Ive reached my decision, I think it would be useful for me to explain 
exactly what Ive been able to consider. Its clear Mrs S is unhappy with the work X 
completed. But my decision wont focus on the damage that her property has incurred. 
Instead, my decision focuses solely on the service PayPal provided and, their decision to 
decline the claim Mrs S made through their BPP. 
While Im aware Mrs S is unhappy that PayPal dont advertise the impact their involvement 
may have on a potential Section 75 claim, this would fall under PayPals business processes 
as a business decision. And this isnt something our service is able to comment on or direct 
PayPal to change. So, I havent considered this further. But what I can say is PayPal have 
confirmed to our service that their involvement should not impact on any Section 75 claim 
Mrs S wished to make to her credit card provider. So, Mrs S should be free to pursue this 
action and any difficulties she faces will be something to raise with the credit card provider 
directly.
So, Ive thought carefully about PayPals decision to decline Mrs S claim. To do this, Ive 
first thought about the BPP and, the definition of a SNAD claim. Having done so, I think its 
reasonably clear a SNAD claim is designed for an item, not a service. 
And I think its reasonably clear Mrs S unhappiness surround the service X provided, not 
any particular item they provided. While I recognise Mrs S has stated an item X fitted was 
meant to be waterproof, and the photos show it wasnt, I dont think this is because of the 
item itself. In Mrs S comments to us and PayPal, she has stated that X failed to complete all 
of the work they were paid to do. So, on the balance of probability I think its most likely that 
it was the workmanship of X, and their failure to complete all of the work needed, that led to the work not being waterproof. Not the item Mrs S refers to itself. And as PayPals BPP 
doesnt cover SNAD claims about service that is provided, I think theyve acted within the 
BPP when declining Mrs S claim.
But as Ive explained above, Ive also thought about whether PayPal were fair to rely on the 
terms of the BPP in this instance. And having done so, I think they were. The BPP states 
clearly that it is not intended to be a replacement for a warranty or insurance product. In 
particular, under the heading No Warranty the BPP states PayPal does not have any 
control over the products or services provided by sellers who accept PayPal as a payment 
method, and PayPal cannot ensure that a buyer or a seller who are dealing with will actually 
complete the transaction or is authorised to do so.
I think this makes it reasonably clear that PayPal will not be responsible for the service 
provided buy sellers, in this case X, who accept payment by PayPal. And I also think its 
important to note that the BPP is a voluntary product and its existence doesnt guarantee a 
customer the right to a refund.
In this case, I think Mrs S main dispute centres around the service X provided. And the 
service of X isnt something PayPal are responsible for. Nor do disputes about this fall under 
their BPP. So, I cant say that PayPal have acted unfairly when declining Mrs S claim and 
because of this, I dont think they need to do anything more.
I understand this isnt the outcome Mrs S was hoping for. But as Ive explained above, this 
decision focuses solely on the service PayPal have provided and I think its been reasonable 
on this occasion. Mrs S is still free to pursue her complaint about the service X provided with 
X directly. Alternatively, she can contact her credit card provider to discus her Section 75 
rights or seek legal advice.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Mrs S complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 April 2022.
