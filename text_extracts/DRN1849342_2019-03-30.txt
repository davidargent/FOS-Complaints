Mr S complains that Gain Credit  LLC (trading  as Lending Stream) was irresponsible  to lend 
to him.
background
Mr S had eight loans from Lending  Stream between  July 2016 and February  2018:
Loan Date Amount Term Due *Max Payment Repaid
1 14 Jul 2016 £300 170d 30 Dec 2016 £139.20 19 Nov 2016
2 11 Aug 2016 £560 174d 31 Jan 2017 £364.00 26 Nov 2016
3 13 Nov 2016 £200 168d 28 Apr 2017 £328.10 1 Dec 2016

7 30 Nov 2017 £700 183d 31 May 2018 £324.80 1 Dec 2017
8 1 Feb 2018 £800 181d 31 Jul 2018 £345.60 Outstanding
* Maximum  repayment over the term of the loan, including overlapping loans
Mr S says Lending Stream was irresponsible to lend to him as he had a very low disposable  
income and was borrowing from multiple short-term lenders. He says that Lending  Stream 
continued to approve loans  without  carrying out proper affordability  checks  meaning he was 
stuck in a cycle of borrowing. Mr S added that his worsening financial position  and Lending  
Streams aggressive collection practices  caused  him stress.
Lending Stream says it asked for information about  his income  and expenditure and verified 
the income figure. It also revised his stated expenditure upwards and checked his credit  file. 
It said that, based on the information it had, it was satisfied proportionate checks had been 
carried out. But it offered  to set up a repayment  plan for Mr S to repay the outstanding  loan.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. Although she wasnt 
satisfied Lending  Stream had done  enough checks for all the loans, she said she didnt have 
enough information to show what proportionate  checks would have shown.
Mr S responded to say he couldnt  provide further information but wanted his case  reviewed.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr S 
and to Lending Stream on 26 February  2019.  I summarise my findings:
I was satisfied that Lending Stream carried out enough checks before it approved the 
first three loans;
I considered Lending  Stream should have asked Mr S about other short-term loans 
before approving loan 4 but that, had it done  so, its likely to have found  the loan was 
still affordable to him.
For loan 5 onwards,  I found proportionate  checks should  have  included  a full financial 
review. As I couldnt see that Lending Stream had done  that, I looked at the available 
information to assess what  such a review would have found.
I found Mr Ss available income after all his financial commitments  was less than 
£100 for each  of loans 5, 6 and 7.
Ref: DRN18493422So I concluded it was likely Lending  Stream would have found loans 5, 6 and 7 to be 
unaffordable had it carried out proportionate  checks.
Mr S wasnt able to provide any information  about his financial circumstances at 
around the time of loan 8, so I couldnt  safely conclude that Lending Stream  was 
wrong to approve  it.
Subject to any further representations by Mr S or Lending Stream, my provisional  decision 
was that Lending Stream should  refund  interest  and charges  on loans 5, 6 and 7 (plus 
statutory interest) and remove any associated negative information from his credit file.
Lending Stream responded  to say it accepted the provisional decision.
Mr S did not respond to the provisional  decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party provided any additional  information,  and Lending  Stream accepted  my 
provisional decision, I see no reason to depart from it.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending 
Stream) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr S paid on loans 5, 6 and 7;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loans 5, 6 and 7 from Mr Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2019.
