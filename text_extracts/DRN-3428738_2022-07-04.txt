The complaint
Mr L complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he paid for some holiday club points. Mr L is 
being represented in this complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mr L and his wife had a timeshare that I understand had been granted to them in perpetuity. 
They entered into a purchase agreement with a holiday company in February 2015 to buy 
40,000 holiday club points and they traded in their timeshare for  another 14,000 holiday club 
points. They agreed to pay Â£6,950 to the holiday company and Mr L entered into a fixed sum 
loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance that he signed in February 2015 for a loan of 
that amount. The holiday company confirmed that they could surrender those points from the 
fifth year of membership at no further cost. The loan was repaid in January 2016.
Mr Ls representative claimed a refund of the cost of the holiday club points from Barclays 
Partner Finance under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in June 2017. It said 
that the holiday company: didnt conduct a proper assessment of Mr Ls financial position 
and ability to repay the loan; applied considerable pressure to procure his agreement to the 
loan; breached its contract with Mr L; was paid a commission by Barclays Partner Finance 
which wasnt disclosed to Mr L; and breached EU Law. Its letter also described 
misrepresentations that it said had been made by the holiday company.
Barclays Partner Finance said that:
Mr L was fully aware that he would be liable for annual management fees;
hed signed a compliance statement to confirm that hed access to more than one 
lender;
hed received a statutory fourteen day cooling off period in which time he could have 
cancelled the finance and sought another means of payment;
the holiday company isnt Mr Ls agent;
it refutes that there was an unfair relationship between it and Mr L;
Mr L would have provided his income at the loan application stage and it was a 
relatively small loan with minimal monthly repayments that had been settled;
Mr L had taken two holidays in 2016 using his holiday club points; and
it was satisfied that the sale was carried out in a fair and compliant manner and that 
Mr L wasnt mis-sold the points or the finance used to secure them.
Mr L wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. Mr Ls 
complaint form says that the holiday company: failed to conduct a proper assessment of 
Mr Ls ability to repay the loan; was paid a commission by Barclays Partner Finance which 
wasnt declared to Mr L; and unduly pressured Mr L into entering into the purchase 
agreement and loan agreement; all rendering the agreement unfair pursuant to section 
140A.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He didnt consider 
that the management fees or Mr Ls and his wifes ability to surrender their membership after 
five years had been misrepresented to them. He didnt consider that the relationship 
between Mr L and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair. He said that as far as he was aware 
there wasnt an arrangement for commission to be paid and that he hadnt seen anything 
that would suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr L.
Mr Ls representative says that it doesnt agree with our investigators recommendations 
and, on Mr Ls behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr Ls representative has said that the claim is made under section 140A  that 
section gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay 
any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an 
unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
his representative says that the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr Ls ability to repay the loan - but the loan was repaid in January 
2016 and Ive seen no other evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for 
Mr L at the time that the loan was made to him or that he was experiencing financial 
difficulties;
Mr Ls representative also says that Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission 
to the holiday company for arranging the loan that wasnt disclosed to Mr L  but 
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was 
paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid 
it tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor 
was it under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in 
these circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to 
Mr L risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr Ls representative says that the holiday company unduly pressured Mr L and his 
wife into entering into the purchase agreement and Mr L into entering into the loan 
agreement - but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
holiday company unduly pressured them into entering into those agreements or that 
it used unacceptable commercial practices against them;
I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that there was an unfair 
relationship between Barclays Partner Finance and Mr L in these circumstances and 
I consider it to be unlikely that a court would find the relationship to have been unfair;
Mr Ls representative has also referred to misrepresentations and breaches of 
contract by the holiday company so Ill also consider any claim that Mr L would have 
under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act;in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ls complaint about Barclays Partner Finance, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday 
company and that Barclays Partner Finances response to his claim under section 75 
wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ls claim under 
section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr L and his wife bought 40,000 holiday club points under the purchase agreement 
and they traded in their existing timeshare for another 14,000 holiday club points;
I understand that the timeshare had been granted to them in perpetuity but the 
holiday company provided them with a letter which said that, upon completion of the 
purchase agreement, it agreed that they would:  be able to surrender [their holiday 
club points] from [their] fifth year of membership, provided that all annual fees are 
paid up to date, and at no further cost;
Mr L and his wife received a total of 54,000 holiday club points under the agreement 
and were able to surrender the points so had, in effect, been released from the 
timeshare that had been granted in perpetuity and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that Mr L and his wife were induced into entering into the 
purchase agreement by misrepresentations made by the holiday company about the 
basis on which they could surrender their points or that theres been a breach of 
contract by the holiday company;
Mr L and his wife had agreed to pay maintenance fees to the holiday company and, 
although those fees increased, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that the maintenance fees were misrepresented to them by the holiday 
company or that the holiday company has breached their contract in connection with 
the maintenance fees;
Mr L and his wife were able to take holidays using their holiday club points in March 
and July 2016 and their representative then complained to Barclays Partner Finance 
in June 2017  but, if they considered that there were issues with the way that the 
purchase agreement had been sold to them, I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect them to have complained about those issues earlier than they did  and they 
say that they were aware that they could withdraw from the purchase agreement 
within the first 14 days but didnt do so;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the timeshare company 
has breached any legal requirements for which Barclays Partner Finance would be 
liable to Mr L under section 75;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt respond to all of the issues about which Mr Ls 
representative had claimed but I consider that it was fair and reasonable for it to not 
uphold his claims; and
I sympathise with Mr L and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their holiday 
club membership and the difficulties that Mr L has described, but I find that it wouldnt 
be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner 
Finance to refund to him any of the money that he paid under the loan agreement, to 
pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 August 2022.
