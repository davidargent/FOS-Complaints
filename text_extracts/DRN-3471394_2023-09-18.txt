The complaint
Mr O complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made to it for a refund of the money that he paid 
for a holiday ownership product. His wife is also involved in his complaint and hes being 
represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr O and his wife entered into a purchase agreement to buy a holiday ownership product in 
September 2012. The purchase price was £6,807 and Mr O also entered into a fixed sum 
loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that amount. He agreed to make 
120 monthly payments of £84.84 to Barclays Partner Finance. Barclays Partner Finance 
says that Mr Os loan account was closed in January 2015. 
Mr Os representative, on behalf of Mr O, made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in 
February 2021 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Barclays 
Partner Finance said that Mr O was out of time to bring a misrepresentation claim under 
section 75 or a claim under section 140A. It also said that customers were able to book 
holidays and were able to list their property for resale subject to and in accordance with their 
agreement so it didnt agree that a breach of contract had occurred. 
Mr O wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. Mr Os 
complaint form says that: Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the holiday 
company which wasnt declared to Mr O; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr Os ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured him into entering the 
contracts and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure him; the product was 
misrepresented to him; and the holiday company was in liquidation so was in breach of 
contract as it cant provide the goods or service sold to Mr O; all rendering the agreement 
unfair pursuant to section 140A. It said that the claim should also be considered under 
section 75.
Mr O provided a client statement in support of his claims in which he also described other 
purchases of holiday products  but I consider it to be clear from his representatives 
February 2021 letter and his complaint form that his complaint is about the purchase that he 
and his wife made in September 2012 (and the only documents from the time of the 
purchases that have been provided are the purchase agreement that they signed in 
September 2012 and the loan agreement that Mr O signed at about the same time).
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Os complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of Mr Os misrepresentation claim 
under section 75 to turn it down. He said that the resorts at which Mr O had his holiday 
ownership product were continuing to offer their services regardless of the holiday 
companys liquidation so he didnt think that there had been a breach of contract. He thought 
that Mr Os section 140A claim was raised too late and he said that he hadnt seen any 
persuasive evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for Mr O.
Mr Os representative, on behalf of Mr O, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. It said that it had instructed counsel to provide detailed submissions about 
the time bar, but no further information or submissions have been received.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Os complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Os complaint is about Barclays Partner Finances response to the claims that had 
been made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six 
years of the date of his representatives February 2021 letter to Barclays Partner 
Finance - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to his 
claims;
Mr Os claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Os claim under section 75 is that the holiday company has gone into liquidation 
so is in breach of contract and that the holiday product was misrepresented to him 
and that he wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to him - if the 
criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would be 
expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr O could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into buying the holiday ownership product in September 2012 as that was the latest 
time that any misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have 
been incurred as that was when he also entered into the loan agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made under section 75 
until February 2021, more than eight years later which was outside of the time limits 
set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a 
defence to the claim and I find that it was reasonable for it to have rejected that claim;
the time limit for a breach of contract claim is also six years from the date on which 
the cause of action accrued  I understand that the holiday company went into 
liquidation in January 2020 and Mr Os representative made a breach of contract 
claim to Barclays Partner Finance in February 2021 so I consider that Mr Os breach 
of contract claim was made in time;
our investigator said that the resorts at which Mr O had his holiday ownership product 
were continuing to offer their services regardless of the holiday companys liquidation 
so he didnt think that there had been a breach of contract  neither Mr O nor his 
representative has provided any further evidence in response to that finding to show 
that Mr Os use of his holiday ownership product has been adversely impacted by the 
liquidation of the holiday company;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Os use of his 
holiday ownership product has been adversely impacted by the liquidation of the 
holiday company so I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
require Barclays Partner Finance to take any action under section 75 in response to 
the liquidation of the holiday company;
Mr Os representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr O and 
Barclays Partner Finance because Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to 
the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mr O and the holiday company unduly 
pressured him into entering the contracts and used aggressive commercial practices 
to pressure him;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that Mr Os loan account was closed in January 2015 
and Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that the loan agreement 
continued after that time so Im satisfied that the loan agreement ended in January 
2015;
Mr O would have had six years from then to bring a claim under section 140A against 
Barclays Partner Finance but a claim wasnt made until February 2021, more than six 
years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I 
consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a defence to the claim and I find that it 
was reasonable for it to have rejected that claim;
Mr Os representative also says that the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr Os ability to afford the loan and Mr O says that he and his wife 
have had a lot of stress and have to watch their money but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr O in September 2012 when it was made 
to him or that hes experienced any financial difficulties since then;
Ive also seen no evidence to show that Mr O asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its assessment of his ability to afford the loan before his 
representatives February 2021 letter  as the loan was made to him in September 
2012 and his loan account was closed in January 2015, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him to have raised any concerns about that assessment or the 
affordability of the loan before then;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that a loan with a monthly 
repayment of £84.84 wasnt affordable for Mr O in September 2012 when it was 
made to him;
I sympathise with Mr O for the issues that he and his wife have had with their holiday 
ownership product but I consider that Barclays Partner Finances response to the 
claims that had been made to it was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr O any of the money that he paid under the 
loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Os complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 October 2023.
