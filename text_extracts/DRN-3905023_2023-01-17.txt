The complaint
Mr H complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their decision to decline claims 
he made under their Buyer Protection Policy (BPP). Mr H also complains about PayPals 
decision to limit his eligibility for this protection on future purchases.
What happened
Mr H held an account with PayPal, that he used to buy items on a regular basis. In April and 
May 2022, Mr H purchased items that arrived damaged or faulty. So, he made claims under 
PayPals BPP. But both of these claims were declined. Mr H was unhappy about this, so he 
raised a complaint.
Mr H didnt think PayPal acted fairly when declining the claims. And he was unhappy PayPal 
had told him he no longer qualified for this protection, when hed called PayPal to confirm 
hed still be covered before making the purchases. So, Mr H wanted PayPal to refund him 
the purchase amounts in full. And he wanted to be compensated for the inconvenience hed 
been caused.
PayPal responded and didnt agree. They thought theyd made it clear a warning limitation 
had been placed on his account on 1 December 2021. And they thought the advice Mr H 
was given on the 26 April 2022 was general advice regarding their BPP, rather than specific 
advice to Mr Hs individual situation. So, they thought theyd declined Mr Hs claims fairly, 
and that their decision to limit Mr Hs access to the BPP was reasonable. Mr H remained 
unhappy with this response, so he referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. They thought PayPals user 
agreement allowed them to suspend Mr Hs eligibility for the BPP where they believed Mr H 
had engaged in restricted activities. And our investigator felt PayPal had provided evidence 
that satisfied them PayPal were fair to deem Mr H had done so. So, our investigator thought 
PayPals decision to decline the claims were fair. And our investigator thought the advice Mr 
H was provided in the call was general, rather than specific. So, our investigator didnt think 
PayPal needed to do anything more regarding this.
Mr H didnt agree. He was unhappy our investigator only referred to two declined claims,
rather than three. Mr H also explained his belief that PayPal had removed his eligibility to the
BPP without any prior notification or warning, which left his future transactions open to
financial risk. And Mr H explained his purchases were mainly for vinyl records, which often
arrived damaged, resulting in a high number of claims being made. And he didnt think it was
made clear anywhere that he was only able to raise a certain number of claims under
PayPals BPP. For these reasons, he maintained his belief that PayPal had acted unfairly
and so, he wanted to be compensated for this. As Mr H didnt agree, the complaint was
passed to me for a decision.
I issued a provisional decision on 19 December 2022, where I explained my intention to 
uphold the complaint. In that decision I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, its my intention to uphold the complaint. Ive focused my comments on
what I think is relevant. If I havent commented on any specific point, its because I dont
believe its affected what I think is the right outcome.
Before I explained why I intend to make this decision, I think it would be useful for me to
explain exactly what Ive been able to consider. Im only able to consider events that have
been complained about to PayPal, where theyve then been given up to eight weeks to issue
their response. In this situation, Mr H raised a complaint about the two declined claims in
April and May 2022, and PayPal issued their response in July. Im aware Mr H made a
further claim under PayPals BPP, which was rejected in August. But as this claim was
rejected after PayPal had issued their response, and after our service had received Mr Hs
complaint, Ive not been able to consider this claim, or any complaint about it, within this
decision.
So, Ive thought about PayPals decision to decline Mr Hs two claims made in April and May
2022, and whether I think theyve acted fairly, in line with the terms of the BPP and their user
agreement.
PayPal have explained the two claims were declined as Mr Hs eligibility to protection under
the BPP had been limited. And PayPal have explained they were able to limit this eligibility
under the terms of the user agreement.
Ive seen the user agreement. And it explains that PayPal are able to suspend your
eligibility for PayPals Buyer Protection programme where they believe a customer has
engaged in any Restricted Activities.
The user agreement also lists a variety of reasons they believe constitute as a restricted
activity. This includes Abuse of our online dispute resolution process and/or PayPals Buyer
Protection programme. This doesnt stipulate exactly what would be considered abuse of
this process and so, I think it was within PayPals power to determine what this abuse would
look like, dependent on any individual situation.
PayPal have provided me with their reasoning, including evidence of their internal system,
explaining why they believe Mr H engaged in what they deemed to be restricted activities.
And having considered this information, I dont think Im able to say PayPal were unfair to
take this decision. So, as I think PayPal acted fairly when deciding that Mr H had undertaken
restricted activities based on their own internal processes, I think they acted in line with the
user agreement when they limited Mr Hs eligibility to the BPP for future claims. And 
because of this, I cant say theyve done anything wrong when declining the claims.
The user agreement also explained that when a limitation or suspension is applied to an
account, PayPal would usually look to notify a customer of their actions. But crucially, the
user agreement also explains that but we may, if its reasonable to do so (for example if you
are in breach of this user agreement or we consider it advisable for security reasons), take
any of these actions without prior notice to you. So, as I think PayPal were reasonable to
say Mr H engaged in restricted activity, I think its reasonable for PayPal to deem Mr H to be
in breach of the user agreement and so, I dont think PayPal needed to notify Mr H of the
limit in his eligibility.
But crucially, PayPal say they did notify Mr H in the correspondence with him on 1 and 8
December 2021. So, Ive considered this correspondence at length. And while I do think this
correspondence gave Mr H guidance on how to avoid making excessive claims, and talked
to actions PayPal may take, I dont think this correspondence made it clear to Mr H that hewas no longer eligible for the BPP at all. In the message sent by PayPal on 8 December, it
states specifically you can open a dispute up to 180 days after the transaction date as well
as stating we offer Buyer protection for cases of unauthorised account use, non-receipt of
goods and items that are significantly not as described. Mr H has confirmed that both claims
were opened as the items he received were faulty and so, I feel its fair to class these as
significantly not as described. Based on this, I dont think the correspondence sent to Mr H
made it clear to Mr H that he could no longer make a claim in this sort of situation.
And further to this, in the call between Mr H and PayPal on 26 April, the call hander confirms
BPP is available when purchases are made through PayPal. While I do agree this advice
seemed to be general, and not specific to Mr Hs situation, I also must recognise that at
the beginning of the call the handler took personal information from Mr H to access his
account file. So, as PayPal are saying a limitation was in place, I wouldve expected this to
be made clear to Mr H. And it wasnt.
So, while I cant say PayPal were wrong to decline the claims, I dont think their
communication with Mr H regarding this was reasonable. I appreciate PayPal didnt need to
notify Mr H, under the terms of the user agreement. But PayPal say they did, and so, Id 
expect this notification to be clear. And I dont think it was.
Putting things right
As I dont think PayPal acted fairly regarding their communication with Mr H, Ive then
thought about what I think they should do to put things right.
I think the lack of clarity in PayPals correspondence, both in writing and in Mr Hs call with
them, led Mr H to believe he still qualified for the BPP. And so, I think this is likely to have
influenced his decision to make his purchases through PayPal, rather than through another
means of payment. So, I think Mr H lost the opportunity to decide which method of payment
would offer him the best level of protection, for example, the ability to make a section 75
claim if he used a credit card.
While I cant say for certain what Mr H would, or wouldnt have done, I think Mr H lost the
opportunity to consider all options he had available to him. And I think PayPal should
compensate Mr H for the upset this caused. But I dont think this compensation should place
Mr H in a position of betterment, nor do I think it should be based on the actual declinature of
the claims as I think PayPal acted within the terms of Mr Hs user agreement when declining
them. So, considering all of the above, I intend to direct PayPal to make a payment of £50, 
which I think is a fair compensatory amount in this situation.
Responses
Mr H didnt agree. He was unhappy the third claim wasnt considered, as he felt he was 
directed by our service to introduce it as part of this complaint. And Mr H didnt agree with 
the compensation that I provisionally directed as he didnt think the payment of £50 placed 
him back in the position he wouldve been in, had PayPals communication been reasonable. 
So, he wanted PayPal to pay him the total value of all three claims he raised, totalling 
£156.88. PayPal didnt respond to the provisional decision and so, Ive assumed they have 
no additional comments to provide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Ive noted Mr Hs comments regarding the third claim he wishes to be considered. But I 
explained in my provisional decision why Im unable to consider this third claim, as it was 
made after PayPal had issued their final response. This means that any events that occurred 
after this final response would need to be raised as a separate complaint with PayPal, who 
would then be afforded up to eight weeks to issue another response. Mr H would then be 
able to raise this issue with our service should he remain unhappy. This decision focuses 
solely on the events that took place before PayPals final response letter in July 2022. And 
so it follows that the value of this third claim is unable to be considered as part of the 
resolution to this complaint.
Ive then turned to Mr Hs other dispute, which centres around what PayPal should do to put 
things right regarding their unclear communication that I discussed in my provision decision.
Putting things right
I note that Mr H has also expressed his unhappiness about the compensatory payment I 
recommended. And he believes he should be refunded the total value of the two claims he 
made that I have been able to consider. But as Ive explained in my decision, I think PayPal 
were able to decline these claims, without prior notification, as per the terms of their user 
agreement. So, I dont think PayPal are liable for the actual claim values.
Instead, I think PayPal should compensate Mr H for the lack of clarity in their 
communication. While I appreciate Mr H may have decided to make the purchases through 
other means, such as a credit card where he wouldve been able to make a section 75 claim, 
I cant say for certain that he wouldve done. And even if I could, Im unable to say for certain 
that any claim he made wouldve been upheld.
So, I dont think I can say that, had PayPal communicated with Mr H reasonably, that Mr H 
would definitively been able to secure refunds for the purchases he made. So, I dont think 
Im able to say PayPal should pay Mr H the value of these claims, as I cant say for definite 
this wouldve been the position he wouldve found himself in.
Instead, I think PayPal should compensate Mr H for the upset he wouldve felt when he 
realised he was unable to make use of the BPP, when hed been led to believe he could. 
And I think the £50 payment Ive recommended is a fair one, as I think it also takes into 
consideration the fact PayPal were able to decline these claims under the terms of the 
agreement Mr H held due to the activity theyve provided evidence of. So, I think PayPal 
should pay Mr H this £50.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I uphold Mr Hs complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA and direct them to take the following action:
Pay Mr H £50 to recognise the upset hes been caused due to their unclear 
communication surrounding his BPP eligibility.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 February 2023.
