K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains that NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibly when it gave him a credit  card account.
background
Mr H said NewDay  accepted his application  for a credit card. But he couldnt afford it. He 
had a lot of debt and was using payday  loans.  His account was always at the limit and he 
was only paying  off interest each month. Mr H thinks NewDay  lent irresponsibly to him. And 
he wants a refund of the interest  and charges applied  to his account.
NewDay said itd considered the information Mr H supplied with his application. Itd looked at 
the information held by the credit reference  agencies. And it had provided Mr H with a card 
with an appropriate  credit limit. 
NewDay explained its account is aimed  at customers who are new to credit or trying  to 
rebuild their credit rating. So it wasnt unusual  for its customers to have a poor credit history. 
And it was confident itd lent responsibly when  opening  Mr Hs account. 
Mr H wasnt satisfied with NewDays response. So he contacted our service  and our 
investigator looked into the matter. He looked at Mr Hs financial circumstances when he 
applied for the account. And he couldnt say NewDay had acted irresponsibly based on the 
information hed seen. NewDay offers the account to customers who mightve  struggled in 
the past. And Mr H was within  its lending criteria.
Mr H didnt agree. So hes asked for an ombudsmans  final decision. He felt his payday 
loans shouldve suggested any further  lending was irresponsible. And hes provided further 
information about his previous financial difficulties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry  to hear of the difficulties Mr H has experienced. And Ive looked very carefully at 
everything hes said to see if NewDay shouldve given him the credit card account.
Mr H opened his account in July 2016. He stated his income  was £16400. And NewDay said 
there was no balance on payday loans  at the time. Mr H had a total balance of £1500  on 
other credit cards. Although Mr H had got into difficulty in the past thered been  no defaults 
within the past 17 months. So NewDay offered him a credit limit of £250.
Mr H has provided further information  about  his previous financial difficulties. Hed had to 
borrow £100 or more  each month  from payday lenders. Hed had problems making  
repayments to previous  loans, which led to defaults  being applied. So he feels NewDay  
shouldve turned down his application.
Ive looked at the additional information Mr H provided to our investigator. And there was a 
default registered on his credit file for £115  from about a year before he applied  for the loan. 
The credit file suggests there were arrears in the previous year but previous defaults had 
been before  2015.
Ref: DRN40597602Its clear Mr H has experienced financial difficulty in the past. But I dont think  NewDay was 
wrong to believe  his more recent credit history  supported offering a credit  card account with 
a relatively small limit of £250. 
Its not unusual  for credit  companies to offer increases in a customers  limit if it feels  the 
account is being well-managed.  But NewDay took note of Mr Hs situation and the limit 
remained at £250.
Mr H feels NewDay  shouldve carried out more  extensive checks. And it shouldve  noted his 
previous problems and not offered him the account. I do appreciate Mr H has experienced a 
great deal of stress due to his financial difficulties.  But, as NewDay  has explained,  its credit  
card is intended for customers whove  had problems in the past and want  to rebuild their 
credit rating. Thats why the credit limits are relatively low. 
Based on what Ive seen  I think the checks it carried out, along  with the information Mr H 
provided, were sufficient for the business  to offer the account  with what it considered an 
appropriate credit  limit.
When NewDay wrote  to Mr H I can see it included contact details in case he was finding  it 
difficult to meet his repayments. But I cant see Mr H asked for help other than in October 
2016 when he was struggling  after bereavement.  So Ive not seen anything  to suggest 
NewDay has treated Mr H unfairly  or unsympathetically. 
I realise Mr H will be disappointed with this outcome.  But Ive not seen enough evidence to 
suggest NewDay lent irresponsibly or didnt follow its procedures properly when it gave Mr H 
the credit  card account.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 July 2019.
