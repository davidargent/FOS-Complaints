K821x#15complaint
Mrs G complains that O&M Pensions  Solutions, as representative of TenetConnect Limited, 
caused delays  when advising her in relation to the transfer of her defined  benefit 
occupational pension scheme  benefits  from Company A, to a pension scheme with 
Company B. 
As a result, she says the deadline of 5 October 2017, was missed for her guaranteed  cash  
equivalent transfer value (CETV). She said she ended up receiving a transfer value that was 
£11,367 less and TenetConnect Limited  should compensate her for her loss arising from 
this.
background
Mrs G wanted to transfer the benefits she had in an occupational pension  scheme into a 
pension scheme  provided by Company  B. To do so, legally, she had to obtain advice about 
the suitability of the transfer. She was put in contact with O&M in February 2017, to obtain 
that advice.
Mrs G doesnt complain  about the suitability of the advice  she received from O&M, but about 
the delays caused by its handling of her transfer  application. 
On 18 July 2017, O&M received Mrs Gs CETV  from Company A, with a guaranteed  transfer  
value of £132,928. This amount was guaranteed until 5 October 2017. As Mrs Gs transfer 
wasnt completed by this date, on 25 October 2017,  a new guaranteed  CETV was issued by 
Company A. This new CETV had a guaranteed  transfer value of £121,561. 
Having raised her concerns about  the transfer delays with Company A and O&M in the 
interim, Mrs G went ahead with the transfer and £121,561 was transferred across  to her 
pension scheme  with Company B on 21 December  2017.
In response to her complaint about  the delay and her financial  loss arising from this, 
Company A said it wasnt responsible for the delay  and that it had acted within its service 
level targets when dealing with her transfer request. O&M didnt accept responsibility for the 
financial loss Mrs G said shed suffered either. But, it did reduce the fees it was charging her 
for advice  by £300. This was in recognition of the fact that there were delays producing the 
regulated advice pack. 
Our adjudicator looked into Mrs Gs complaint.  He carefully considered the timeline  of 
events. Having analysed  that, overall,  he concluded that O&M was responsible for Mrs Gs 
financial loss because  of delays in its handling  of her transfer application.  He set out a 
methodology for calculating Mrs Gs financial loss arising from this. He took the view that as 
Mrs G had already had her fees reduced by £300,  a further  payment  for her non financial 
loss (for trouble and upset) was not warranted.   
Mrs G accepted our adjudicators view. TenentConnect didnt. It produced  its own timeline of 
events and said, in summary, it wasnt responsible for Mrs Gs financial loss and that the 
deadline couldve been met if Company A had sent on the extra discharge paperwork on 
5 October 2017. It said Company As transfer process was complex when compared to other 
schemes and Company  A hadnt acted fairly towards Mrs G, a member of its scheme.
As agreement couldnt be reached Mrs Gs complaint comes  to me to decide.
Ref: DRN06790092my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
To decide this complaint and assess whether TenetConnects  handling of Mrs Gs transfer 
application caused, or contributed, to the deadline  of 5 October 2017 being  missed, this 
involves a careful analysis of the timeline  of events. I should make  it clear, I am not deciding 
Company As responsibility for any delays here.  Nor am I considering whether Company As 
transfer process was overly complex when compared to other schemes. I say this because 
Mrs G brings this complaint only against  TenetConnect. Also,  it would be usual for matters 
like this, involving an occupational  pension scheme,  to be referred to the Pension 
Ombudsman Service, rather  than this service.
To decide this complaint against TenetConnect, I have seen Mrs Gs, TenetConnects and 
Company As representations on timings. Ive also looked at our adjudicators overview.  I 
have set out below a fairly detailed timeline  of relevant events and dates as I see them.  
These are set out in table format.  For ease of reference, Ive referred  to Company A, as Co 
A in the table. All of these events happened  in 2017. 
Overall, theres little dispute  between the parties  about what  occurred and when. Also, I 
consider that the paper  trail that exists documenting this can reasonably  be relied on, as the 
information was recorded at the time.

Ref: DRN06790094Total 317 Start to Finish
When Mrs G first contacted O&M in February  2017, it gave her approximate timeframes  for 
the work  involved.  It said that Stage 1, the Initial Review phase,  would  take approximately 8 
to 10 weeks to complete  (56-70 days),  with Stage 2, the Full Regulated Advice  phase, then 
taking approximately  6 to 8 weeks (42-56 days).
Stage 1
As this complaint  is about the financial loss Mrs Gs suffered because of missing  the 
guaranteed CETV deadline  of 5 October  2017, overall I cant  see that the extra time 
taken at stage  1 contributed to this loss. 
TenetConnect had completed stage 1 by the end of May 2017. The guaranteed CETV 
was not issued by Company A until 5 July 2017, with a deadline date of 5 October 
2017, so any delays earlier in the process  didnt contribute towards  Mrs Gs transfer 
not being completed within the three month  window beginning 5 July 2017  and ending 
5 October 2017.
In reaching this conclusion, Ive also noted  that her earlier CETV (guaranteed until 29 
September 2016) was for a lower amount and that had expired by the time she 
instructed O&M.
Stage 2
I can see O&M asked Company A for a new CETV  on 21 June 2017.The CETV was 
date stamped as received by O&M on 18 July 2017.  Its not for me to comment  on 
how long it took Company  A to produce the CETV.  The CETV  was dated 5 July 
2017. As mentioned, the three month window for accepting  the guaranteed  amount 
ran from then. I dont know what happened  to the correspondence informing O&M of 
the new CETV between  5 July 2017, when  it was dated, and 18 July 2017, when 
O&M marked it as received. But, based on what Ive seen, I cant reasonably  lay this 
delay at O&Ms door. 
After receiving the CETV,  it was around  36 days before O&M asked for the 
illustration from Company B. It took O&M a month, out of three month  guarantee 
period, to begin clarifying things.
In total, as noted in the timeline  summary  above, O&M was in control  of the process for
62 days between receiving the CETV and the guarantee deadline. Thats two months 
of the three  months  guarantee  period (or around  60 days).The O&M timeframes 
document estimated 6-8 weeks  (42-56 days)  for Stage 2 from receipt of the CAC form 
to post advice discussion. In Mrs Gs case that was from 31 May 2017 to 2 October 
2017; 124 days. Even if I take off the period whilst O&M were waiting for the 
requested CETV, this stage took considerably  longer  than estimated. 
O&M acknowledged by its fee reduction  that there had been a delay  in getting the 
regulated advice pack out to Mrs G. By the time this was sent out, there were only 
six days of the guarantee period left. Only three days remained after the post advice 
discussion. It took two days to send the application  pack out and receive the 
originals back. And then the problem with the additional discharge form materialised.
Ref: DRN06790095Ive noted that in the correspondence sent with the CETV dated 5 July 2017, 
Company A did flag up that if Mrs G wanted  to proceed with the transfer, both Mrs G 
and the receiving scheme would need  to sign a set of discharge  forms, which  were 
available upon request. This correspondence said You will be asked to complete  a 
short questionnaire and your adviser/new pension provider will be asked to provide 
some information about the receiving arrangement before we can issue  the 
discharge forms.
So, I think O&M ought to have built in time in to obtain these  discharge  forms, get 
them completed and returned to Company A, all by 5 October 2017. I understand 
they were not returned to Company A until 25 October 2017,  some 20 days after the 
CETV deadline. Admittedly, it took Company A six days  to send the additional 
discharge forms to O&M after the request, but Company A said its service  target  for 
sending these out was 10 days.  O&M considers this to be an unacceptable  delay, 
especially given that this extra time needed  was not highlighted in its original 
correspondence of 5 July 2017.  It also thinks Company As transfer process  is 
unnecessarily complex compared to other schemes  and was unfair  to the member  
here. 
As I said at the outset,  its not for me to assess these things as this complaint is not 
about Company  As actions. That said, it is noteworthy here, that O&M didnt ask for 
the discharge forms in the ten days before the guaranteed date, but on deadline  day 
itself. So, I cant see that this ten day service  target  was the reason why the deadline  
was missed. Rather, I think, asking for the discharge form so late in the day, in my 
view put Mrs Gs guaranteed CETV at risk, a risk which then materialised.
The question for me to answer is whether O&Ms reduction in fees to resolve this is a 
fair response, in the circumstances.  I dont think it goes far enough. I think had O&M 
not lost around a month at the outset  and had it obtained the upon  request  
discharge paperwork earlier on, this transfer  couldve gone ahead within the 
guaranteed period. I cant see that Mrs G was responsible for matters not being 
brought to a conclusion in a timely way. From  what I can see, she did what  was 
expected of her in a timely  fashion.  I think Mrs Gs lost out because of O&Ms actions 
or omissions.
financial loss 
If Mrs G had retained her deferred  benefits  in Company As scheme, she wouldve 
suffered no loss. But, its clear from what Ive seen, that Mrs G intended all along to 
transfer. So I think she has lost out financially. If she wanted  to go ahead still with the 
transfer, she had no option but to accept the lower guarantee. By October 2017, 
when the new CETV  was issued, Company As pension schemes actuaries had 
reviewed the schemes funding factors.  This impacted on CETVs issued after 12 July 
2017, they were  less than before. Because of O&Ms  delays in the handling of 
Mrs Gs transfer  request, I think Mrs G ended up receiving £11,367  less than she 
should have   and later than she should  have. 
putting things right
My aim is to put Mrs G back in the position she wouldve been in now  if the transfer 
deadline had been met.
Ref: DRN06790096If that had happened,  £132,928  wouldve been  paid into Company B on 5 October 2017  
instead of only £121,561 on 21 December 2017.  So, to put things right,  I think 
TenetConnect should:
 Obtain  the current notional  fund value the Company  B plan wouldve 
had if £132,928 had been transferred  on 5 October 2017 and invested 
in the same funds;
 Deduct  the current actual fund value of the Company B plan;
 If there is a loss, pay an amount into the Company B plan to raise  the 
current actual fund value to the current notional fund value, taking into 
account any charges  and available  tax relief;
 If payment into the Company B plan would conflict with any income 
tax protection or allowances, payment should be made  directly  to 
Mrs G instead;
 But if payment into the Company B plan had been possible it wouldve 
generated tax- free cash and a taxable  income  in retirement, so a 
notional deduction  of 15% should  be made for income tax - assuming 
Mrs G is likely to be a basic rate taxpayer in retirement;
As £300 has already been  deducted  from the fees for the delays, I 
think that is a sufficient amount for the trouble and upset Mrs G has 
been caused, so I dont think a further award  is warranted; and
Provide  the details  of the calculation to Mrs G in a clear, simple 
format.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out, I uphold Mrs Gs complaint and order TenetConnect Ltd to put 
things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 June 2020.
