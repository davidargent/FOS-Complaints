DRN-1738727
The complaint
Mrs C complains about the way that Shop Direct Finance Company Limited has dealt with 
her account.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Shop Direct accepts that there have been some issues with the way that it has dealt 
with Mrs Cs account so it said that it would remove four searches from her credit file 
and it would pay her £20 compensation for the distress and inconvenience that she 
was caused  and it explained the way that a specified payment arrangement 
worked;
Shop Direct then offered to pay Mrs C an additional £30 compensation (so the total 
compensation would be £50) and the investigator thought that that would be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
Mrs C hasnt accepted that offer and has asked for her complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman;
Shop Direct shouldnt have made four of the searches which were then recorded on 
Mrs Cs credit file and it said that it would remove those searches from her credit file 
which would correctly leave one search showing on her credit file;
it accepts that Mrs C has been caused distress and inconvenience so it said that it 
would pay her £20 compensation and then offered to pay her an additional £30 
compensation; 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Shop Direct has applied 
the specified payment arrangement incorrectly  so I dont consider that it would be 
fair or reasonable for me to require it to take any action regarding that payment 
arrangement;
I consider that its fair and reasonable for Shop Direct to remove four credit searches 
from Mrs Cs credit file  leaving one credit search correctly showing on her credit 
file;
these issues will have caused Mrs C some distress and inconvenience but I consider 
that compensation totalling £50 is fair and reasonable compensation for that distress 
and inconvenience; and
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Shop Direct to 
pay to Mrs C the additional £30 compensation that its offered her for the distress and 
inconvenience that shes been caused  so that she will have received £50 
compensation in total. 
Putting things right
Shop Direct has said that it would remove four credit searches from Mrs C s credit file and 
that it would pay her £20 compensation. Its offered to pay her an additional £30 
compensation and I consider that compensation totalling £50 is fair and reasonable for the 
distress and inconvenience that Mrs C has been caused. So I find that it would be fair and 
reasonable for Shop Direct to pay Mrs C the additional £30 compensation that its offered to 
pay her  but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to take 
any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Cs complaint in part and I order Shop Direct Finance 
Company Limited to pay her the additional £30 compensation that its offered to pay her.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 September 2020.
