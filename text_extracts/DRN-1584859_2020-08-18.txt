DRN-1584859
The complaint
Ms D complains that Home Retail Group Card Services Limited, trading as Argos Financial 
Services, wont compensate her for the issues that she experienced in claiming a £50 
cashback offer when she bought a phone.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Ms Ds complaint about Argos Financial Services, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
of the phone and that Argos Financial Services response to her claim under section 
75 wasnt fair or reasonable - Im not determining the outcome of Ms Ds claim under 
section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Ms D clearly feels very strongly that the terms of the cashback offer were 
misrepresented to her and that Argos Financial Services should pay her 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience that shes been caused;
she paid for the phone in August 2019 using her Argos Financial Services credit card 
and she says that shes received the £50 cashback but shes described the 
difficulties that she experienced in claiming the cashback and the delay in the 
payment being received  and she say that shes been caused distress and 
inconvenience;
Ms D received the phone and the £50 cashback and Im not persuaded that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier or that the terms of 
the chargeback offer were misrepresented to her; and
I consider that Argos Financial Services response to her claim under section 75 has 
been fair and reasonable so I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require it to pay her any compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience that shes been caused  or to take any other action in response to 
her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 September 2020.
