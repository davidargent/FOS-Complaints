The complaint
F complains about problems and delays when trying to update the signatories approved to 
use its National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) account. F has told us that identification 
and paperwork were lost by NatWest. F also complains that direct debits were cancelled by 
NatWest in error and that is has received poor service from branch staff. 
What happened
In May 2019 Fs representative contacted NatWest to arrange an update to the approved 
signatories on its account. Some signatories wished to be removed and replacements 
needed to be added. The relevant people completed the paperwork NatWest required and 
provided their identification to the local branch. But several weeks later, the changes hadnt 
been put in place and Fs representative was told to contact NatWests telephone banking 
team.
F later received notification from a supplier that a direct debit payment hadnt been made. 
NatWest says it took action to correct its error and reimbursed the costs F incurred as a 
result. 
Fs representative has told us NatWests branch staff advised them to move their banking 
arrangements to a different business. F says the branch staff explained NatWest no longer 
wanted to operate accounts like theirs. 
Fs representatives experienced further delays and problems while trying to update the 
signatories and account mandates. It later came to light identification and the documents 
submitted in May 2019 had been lost and Fs members had to visit the branch again to 
resupply them. 
A complaint was raised and NatWest agreed it had made a number of errors and lost 
important documents. NatWest apologised and ultimately offered F £750 for the 
inconvenience caused by its actions. Fs president referred its case to this service and it was 
passed to an investigator. The investigator agreed NatWest had made several errors but 
thought it had dealt with Fs complaint fairly. Fs representative disagreed and said they 
didnt feel the £750 was reasonable. As Fs representative asked to appeal, its complaint has 
been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My background is intentionally brief because all parties broadly agree about what happened 
and the timeline for the issues raised. I can see that NatWest has made several significant 
errors with Fs account and I dont doubt there has been a considerable level of 
inconvenience caused. Updating the account mandates should be a routine task so I can 
understand why Fs members found the process longwinded and poorly handled. Clearly, 
losing important documents made the situation worse and I agree that Fs members had a 
reasonable expectation that their information would be used for the purposes it was 
submitted, not lost. 
Im pleased that the mandates were ultimately updated so the right people were applied to 
the account. Its clear the process took a lot longer than it should have and Ive taken that 
into account when considering how to fairly resolve this complaint.  
F has told us about the impact of a number of direct debits being paid, including important 
payments that should have been made to its governing body. I understand one of Fs 
members stepped in to help avoid serious problems or a financial loss. But its clear that 
without this intervention F could have faced some serious problems. 
Ive looked at the available information and its clear Fs president spent a considerable 
amount of time chasing NatWest for answers about the mandate problems, along with the 
direct debit issues. Its also clear that other members of F had to take action to resolve the 
problems it experienced. I agree NatWests errors caused inconvenience to F and its 
members.
Fs president has told us that branch staff told its members that NatWest doesnt want its 
account to remain open and would prefer it to be switched to another provider. NatWest has 
explained that isnt the case but I can understand why being given information of that nature 
was frustrating for Fs members. 
Ive carefully considered how to fairly resolve this complaint and whether NatWests existing 
offer is reasonable. NatWest initially offered F £400 to resolve the complaint but has 
subsequently increased the settlement to £750. NatWest has also apologised for the 
problems caused. Ive considered everything F has told us about how the issues raised 
impacted it, along with the actions its members took to help resolve matters. Whilst I 
understand my decision may come as a disappointment to Fs members, I think £750 fairly 
reflects the impact of NatWests errors and the inconvenience caused. As Im satisfied 
NatWests apology and offer of £750 is a fair way to resolve Fs complaint, Im not telling it to 
increase the award or take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint as NatWest has already made an offer that 
is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask F to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 March 2021.
