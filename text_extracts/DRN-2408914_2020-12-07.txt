The complaint
Mrs K complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA refuses to refund her for an item she 
had sold which was returned damaged by the buyer.
What happened
In 2019 Mrs K sold two items to a buyer for Â£700; he paid for them via PayPal. He was 
dissatisfied with one of the items and raised a dispute with PayPal on the ground that it was 
significantly not as described. He asked for a partial refund. Mrs K denied this allegation, 
but PayPal asked the buyer to return both items for a full refund. When the buyer reported 
that he had returned the items, PayPal issued him the refund. However, Mrs K says the 
buyer only returned one item, and when the other one arrived it had been dismantled and 
damaged. She therefore asked PayPal to return her money.
PayPal asked Mrs K to report the matter to Action Fraud and then to provide PayPal with a 
copy of her report in the form of a letter or email from Action Fraud. It initially gave her six 
days to do this, but that deadline was then extended by another eight days. After 16 days, 
when PayPal had not received what it had asked for, it closed her case. Mrs K complained 
about that, but PayPal said it had correctly followed its own procedures and that it had 
closed her case because she had failed to provide the requested report  only her case 
number with Action Fraud.
Mrs K brought this complaint to our Service. (She is represented in this complaint by her 
husband, but for convenience I will refer to his submissions as if she had made them 
herself.) She said Action Fraud had told her it could not provide her with a copy of her report 
in less than 35 days, so instead she had provided PayPal with an acknowledgement letter 
from Action Fraud which included her case number, as that was the best she could do within 
PayPals deadline. (She had also reported it to her local police and provided PayPal with the 
crime number for that report too.) She provided copies of her correspondence with the buyer 
to prove that the item sold had been just as she had described it.
One of our investigators thought that as Mrs K had had no control over what she was 
provided by Action Fraud, it would be fair to uphold her complaint. He recommended that 
PayPal issue her a full refund for both items.
PayPal did not accept that opinion. It said that Mrs K had not provided the report either by its 
deadline or within the 35 days she said Action Fraud had told her it would take. It also said 
that the report should have been available to download immediately after being made (if it 
was made online). It said it couldnt have just contacted Action Fraud itself, to obtain the 
report by providing Mrs Ks reference number, because data protection laws would have 
prevented Action Fraud from sharing her report. PayPal asked for an ombudsman to review 
this case.
I wrote a provisional decision which read as follows.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In PayPals response to this complaint it referred to its Seller Protection Policy. So I read the 
policy, and it appears that the policy does not actually apply to disputes that are brought on 
the ground that the item bought is significantly not as described  the ground relied on by 
Mrs Ks buyer. So I asked PayPal about this.
PayPal confirmed that the Seller Protection Policy did not apply to Mrs Ks dispute, but 
because PayPal had not wanted her to end up with neither the goods nor the money, it had 
still asked the buyer to return her goods to her. This was done as a voluntary exception to 
the Seller Protection Policy, rather than in strict conformity with it. But it had treated her case 
as if the policy applied, and so that was where its request for an Action Fraud report and the 
deadline had come from.
PayPal didnt have to do that. It could have just told Mrs K that she wasnt eligible to the 
benefit of its Seller Protection Policy, and left it at that. Instead, it treated the dispute as if the 
policy applied to it. So I dont think it would be fair of me to decide that PayPal should be in a 
worse position than it would have been in if it had decided to do nothing. For that reason, 
I wont decide that PayPal should have treated Mrs K more leniently than the terms of its 
policy, strictly applied, required it to.
Its not in dispute that Mrs K did not provide what PayPal asked her to within the extended 
deadline. That may not be her fault, but it isnt PayPals fault either, since I accept PayPals 
explanation for why it didnt approach Action Fraud itself, with Mrs Ks reference number, 
and ask for her report directly. Its unlikely that Action Fraud would have been in a position to 
help. So PayPal closed the dispute in line with its normal procedures (leaving aside the fact 
that those procedures wouldnt normally have applied at all).
It appears from Action Frauds website that if a report is made online by someone who has 
registered with the website, then their submitted report is still available to them online.1 There 
will only be a delay if a report is submitted by other means. So it is not impossible to meet 
PayPals deadline.
For the reasons set out above, I am currently not minded to uphold this complaint.
Responses to my provisional decision
Mrs K did not accept my provisional findings. She re-iterated that she had no control over 
Action Frauds timescales, and that anyone could see that the buyer had been in the wrong.
PayPal had nothing to add.
My opinion remains the same as set out in my provisional findings, and I adopt them here.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
1 https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/how-to-report-fraudUnder the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2021. Mr K may reply on her behalf. If we do not hear 
from them then we will presume that she rejects my decision.
