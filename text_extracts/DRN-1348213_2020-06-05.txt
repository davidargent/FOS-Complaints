The complaint
Mr F complains about the amount that he's been charged by Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services Limited for damage to a van that he returned at the end of his hire agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties - so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr F signed the hire agreement - which included Mercedes-Benz Finance's vehicle 
return standards for commercial vehicles - in April 2016 to hire a new van and he 
agreed that he would: "... maintain the vehicle in a condition which is consistent with 
the attached Vehicle Return Standards which form part of this agreement";
he returned the van when the agreement ended in April 2019 and it was inspected by 
a third party on behalf of Mercedes-Benz Finance when it's mileage was recorded as 
being 108,293;
the inspection report identified ten areas of damage to the van which were shown in 
the photos included in the report and the cost of the damage was estimated as 
£1,463.99;
Mercedes-Benz Finance charged Mr F £2,320.07 for the damage and excess 
mileage but, when he complained to it about the charges, it offered to reduce them 
by £250 as a gesture of goodwill;
Mr F says that he accepts liability for some of the damage but disagrees with the 
amount that he's been charged - and he also complained to Mercedes-Benz Finance 
that he'd paid for an alarm to be fitted to the van;
it was Mr F's choice to add the alarm to the van and he has had the benefit of it when 
he used the van - it was also his choice not to remove the alarm before he returned 
the van - Im not persuaded that it would now be fair or reasonable for me to require 
Mercedes-Benz Finance to compensate him in any way because the van was 
returned with an alarm fitted;
I consider that the descriptions of the damage and the photos of the damage 
included in the report are enough to show that the van was damaged when it was 
returned by Mr F - and I don't consider that he returned the van in a condition that 
was consistent with the vehicle return standards or that the damage would 
reasonably be considered to be fair wear and tear;
I consider that it's fair and reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Finance to charge Mr F for 
the damage (and the excess mileage) and I'm not persuaded that there's enough 
evidence to show that the charges are unfair or unreasonable - but it has offered to 
reduce the amount that it's charged Mr F by £250 - he says that it would be 
reasonable for it to reduce the nett invoice amount by £500; andI consider that Mercedes-Benz Finance's offer to reduce the charges by £250 is fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances - I'm not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require it to offer Mr F a larger reduction and I don't consider 
that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to reduce the charges by £500.
 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I don't uphold Mr F's complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 July 2020.
