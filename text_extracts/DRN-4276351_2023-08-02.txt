The complaint
Mr M complains that TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED (TransUnion) had been
reporting an incorrect prefix for him on one of his credit accounts.
What happened
I previously issued a provisional decision on this case because it was my intention to come 
to a different outcome to the Investigator. Because of this I wanted to give both parties the 
chance to respond with anything else they wanted me to consider. 
I have copied my provisional decision below, which also forms part of this final decision.
Mr M noticed that TransUnion were reporting an incorrect prefix for him on some of his
accounts. However, the complaint he has brought to this service is about one specific
account, who Ill refer to as A. He says this caused difficulty with him being able to obtain
credit.
TransUnion say that the information being reported had been provided by the lender and so
it hadnt done anything wrong by reporting it. However, it confirmed that where Mr M had
contacted A to make the correction, this would take four to six weeks to reflect on his credit
report.
The Investigator thought TransUnion should have done more to help Mr M when he reported
the incorrect information  for example, it should have disputed this with the lender. Because
of this, the Investigator said TransUnion should apologise to Mr M for the inconvenience
caused.
Mr M accepted the Investigators view, but TransUnion didnt.
TransUnion responded to say it didnt agree with the Investigators assessment. It said that it
wouldnt normally dispute personal information such as name and date of birth  this is
because this information is normally provided to the third-party by the customer at account
opening stage. And the information would need changing by the customer and the lender
due to security reasons  which would then be passed onto TransUnion to update.
The Investigator still felt that TransUnion could have done more to check what it was
reporting was accurate. And because an agreement couldnt be reached, the case has been
passed to me to make a decision on the matter.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered all of the information available to me, I dont intend to uphold Mr Ms
complaint.
When Mr M first raised the issue with the reporting to TransUnion, this was in relation to
different accounts. And TransUnion confirmed these accounts had been updated and the
correct information was being reported on his credit file.
It was in communication between Mr M and TransUnion after the final response letter that
the issue with information being reported in relation to Mr Ms account with A was noted. At
this point, Mr M provided TransUnion with copies of the conversation he had with A. Looking
at the screenshots provided, this showed that A had the incorrect prefix recorded for Mr M,
and A explained that it would get this updated. It seems that after this, Mr M had a
conversation with A where it confirmed the prefix had been updated.
I agree with the Investigator that normally I would expect TransUnion to raise a dispute with
the firm reporting inaccurate information. But in this case, it appears Mr M had already
contacted A to make the changes  so I dont think it was unfair that TransUnion didnt raise
a dispute with A at this stage. Instead, it was just taking time for this information to be
updated on Mr Ms credit report. TransUnion explained that a change like this can normally
take between four to six weeks to show on a credit report  which isnt unreasonable. And I
havent seen anything that makes me think the correction was made outside of this
timeframe. When questioned by our Investigator, Mr M also confirmed the information being
reported for his account with A is now correct. So, taking everything into account, I cant
fairly say that TransUnion have done anything wrong, and I wont be asking it to do anything
more for Mr M.
TransUnion didnt respond to the provisional decision.
Mr M responded to say he didnt agree with the provisional decision. He said he agreed with 
the Investigators view. And that TransUnion had been a nightmare to deal with so should be 
held accountable. 
The Investigator asked Mr M to be more specific about why he didnt agree with my 
provisional decision, and he responded to say that TransUnion were a nightmare.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As TransUnion didnt respond to the provisional decision, Ive assumed it had nothing further 
to add. 
I have taken on board Mr Ms comments in response to the provisional decision, however he 
hasnt given me much information as to why he felt that TransUnion were a nightmare to 
deal with  only that he agreed with what the Investigator had said. So, its difficult for me to 
know exactly why Mr M didnt agree with the provisional decision.
I do however accept that it might have been inconvenient for Mr M to have had to make the 
changes to his prefix. But for the reasons Ive already stated in my provisional decision, I 
dont think there was more TransUnion needed to do  Mr M had already made the change 
with A, and so TransUnion were just waiting for this information to be updated with it. I 
havent seen any persuasive evidence to say this took too long. 
So, my decision remains the same in that I dont find that TransUnion needs to do anything 
to put things right for Mr M.My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 August 2023.
