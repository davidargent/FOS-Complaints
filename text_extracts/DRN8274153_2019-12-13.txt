K820x#14complaint
Mr J complains that Bank of Scotland  plc wrongly put arrears markers on his credit file 
relating to his mortgage.
background
Mr J says whilst he was previously in arrears,  those were caught up so he thinks  the arrears 
recorded on his credit file are wrong. The mortgage  was repaid in March 2019 when Mr J 
sold the property.
The investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. He said Mr J was a month behind and so the 
information was correctly reported.  Mr J didnt agree and so the matter has been passed to 
me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I trust Mr J wont take it as a discourtesy 
that Ive condensed his complaint  in the way that I have. Ours is an informal  dispute 
resolution service, and Ive concentrated on what I consider to be the crux of the complaint.
Although Ive read and considered the whole file Ill keep my comments to what I think  is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive not considered it but 
because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach  the right outcome.
Mr J was £102.39 in advance on his mortgage  in January 2017 (so at that time hed paid 
£102.39 more  than hed needed  to). He then went into arrears  in February 2017 when he 
stopped paying his mortgage. Payments didnt resume until September 2017 so seven 
payments were missed.  Each payment due was £1,693.65 which  left Mr J £11,753.16  in 
arrears when he restarted  his payments in September 2017 (which  is the £11,855.55  missed 
payments minus the £102.39 hed been in advance). Mr J underpaid by 2p in September  
2017 which took the arrears to £11,753.18.
Between September 2017 and January 2018  Mr J just paid his normal  contractual monthly  
payments (minus that 2p in September 2017) so the account  remained in arrears of 
£11,753.18. However, in January 2018 Bank of Scotland  amended Mr Js account to remove  
a buy-to-let interest rate loading, and backdated  that amendment  to the point Mr J had 
stopped renting out the property. That led to £9,215.26 being credited to the account, which 
reduced the arrears  in January 2018 to £2,537.92.
Between February 2018 and May 2018 (so for four monthly payments) Mr J paid an extra 
£276.34 a month.  This meant his arrears reduced  to:
February 2018 £2,261.58  arrears
March  2018 £1,985.24  arrears
April 2018 £1,708.90  arrears
May 2018 £1,432.56  arrears
Whilst Mr J initially  missed his payment due in June 2018 that was immediately made up and 
from the June 2018  payment onwards Mr J just paid his contractual  monthly  payment,  
Ref: DRN82741532without anything extra towards the arrears.  Its clear from the maths  that Mr J remained 
£1,432.56 in arrears  as:
He missed £11,855.57 in payments (the £11,855.55  plus the September  2017  2p)
But only £10,423.01 was made up;
o£102.39 the account was in advance before he started missing payments,
o£9,215.26 by Bank  of Scotland due to backdating  the interest rate change, and
o£1,105.36 by Mr J overpaying between February  2018  and May 2018.
I understand Mr J has been  confused by his online  banking and a redemption  statement that 
was issued. The online banking  figure is only intended to be indicative; it doesnt  have a link 
to the live mortgage account. Thats not illegal as Mr J has said,  and is fairly normal  in the 
industry. It seems a lot of the confusion  is because Mr J is looking at the balance  (both 
online and on the redemption statement mid-month.  What matters to Bank of Scotland (and 
indicates whether  an account is in arrears or not) is the figures on the live mortgage  account 
at close of business on the last day of the month.
Once Mr J received his redemption statement  he correctly identified  that the amount 
required to repay the mortgage on 13 March 2019 was £318,781.51, and that £544.06  of 
that figure related to interest for March. This meant the account balance on 28 February was 
£318,237.45 which shows the account  was in arrears as the opening balance was £316,999.
This was also shown in the annual mortgage statement that was issued in July 2018. That 
showed the balance on 30 June 2018  was £318,276.38, so again  at month end the account 
was clearly in arrears (as it was over the opening balance of £316,999). For clarity, the 
month end balance would be different every month as it depends on how many days  there  
are in the month for interest purposes, whereas the monthly payment is simply averaged 
over a twelve month term (rather  than varying every  month based on the number of days  in 
the month as that would get confusing).
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  My final decision concludes  this services consideration of the 
complaint, which  means well not be engaging  in any further consideration or discussion of 
the merits of it. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask 
Mr J to accept  or reject  my decision before  13 January 2020.
