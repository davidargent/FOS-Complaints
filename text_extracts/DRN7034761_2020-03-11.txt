Ms E says MYJAR Limited   trading as MYJAR  - irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about seven loans MYJAR  provided to Ms E between March  2017 and 
September 2018. Ms Es borrowing history  is as follows:
Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Repayment
1 13/03/2017 12/06/2017 3 £300.00 £147.58
2 14/06/2017 12/09/2017 3 £200.00 £98.68
3 02/10/2017 28/10/2017 3 £100.00 £49.33
4 28/10/2017 20/04/2018 6 £275.00 £82.05
5 27/04/2018 05/07/2018 3 £275.00 £136.21
6 09/07/2018 25/09/2018 3 £400.00 £200.51
7 25/09/2018 26/11/2018 3 £300.00 £153.08
Our adjudicator partially upheld Ms Es complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the overall  pattern  of Ms Es borrowing indicated she 
was reliant on these loans and the borrowing was becoming unsustainable. MYJAR 
disagreed and said it had done robust  checks on Ms Es financial circumstances  including  
reviewing reports from credit  reference agencies  and these checks  did not raise  any 
concerns. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms E 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN70347612the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Ms E could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Ms Es complaint. Having done so, I am partially  upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Ms Es complaint about loans 1 to 3. Ms E hasnt provided  any 
further evidence  or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further findings 
on these loans because  they no longer appear  to be in dispute. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of MYJARs lending history  with Ms E, with a view to seeing  
if there was a point  at which  MYJAR  should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR  should  have realised that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Ms Es case, I think that this point was reached by loan 4. I say 
this because:
At this point MYJAR  ought to have realised Ms E was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Ms E had taken out four loans  within seven months  and had been 
indebted to MYJAR for nearly all of that period. So, it should have realised it was 
more likely than not Ms E was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her 
previous loan was leaving  in her finances  and that Ms Es indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
From  loan 4 onwards  Ms E was provided with a new loan within  days  of repaying  her 
previous one. 
Ref: DRN70347613Ms E wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed MYJAR. Loan 7 was 
taken out 18 months after Ms Es first. Ms E had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect; service a debt to MYJAR over an extended period.
I think that Ms E lost out because MYJAR continued  to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Es indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Ms E borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Ms Es ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms E paid on loans 4 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 4 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 4 to 7 should be removed from    
Ms Es credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must give Ms E 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Es complaint.  MYJAR Limited  
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 April 2020.
