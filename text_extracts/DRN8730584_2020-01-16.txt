K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny was 
irresponsible when  it provided him with seven high-cost short-term instalment  loans  between  
July 2015 and April 2016.
background
Mr S took seven loans  with Sunny  between  8 July 2015 and 8 April 2016. All the loans were 
to be repaid through six monthly instalments. The amounts of the loans varied between £50 
and £400. I've prepared  a table showing some of the information Sunny has provided about 
Mr Ss loans.

Loan 7 wasnt  paid in line with the credit agreement and was sold on to a third party. Sunny 
has said that the third party has confirmed that the debt was settled.
One of our adjudicators looked  into Mr Ss complaint and recommended  that it be partially 
upheld. He didnt  think that Sunny acted responsibly when it provided Loans  6 and 7. 
Sunny says that it recognises that the way in which Mr S was using its products  at the 
point he took Loan 7  means that it may not have been sustainable  for him. It offered to 
write-off the outstanding balance. However,  since then Sunny has confirmed that there is no 
balance due to it as the debt had been sold to the third party  and had been settled.
Sunny doesnt  accept  our adjudicators view about  Loan 6. So, the complaint  has come to 
me  an ombudsman  for a final decision. If Mr S accepts my decision it will be binding on 
the parties.
 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
Ref: DRN87305842repay his loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ss 
income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I 
think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr S. These factors  include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time 
during which a customer  has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. Whilst 
that might  be an indication a borrower  could sustainably make their repayments, it doesnt 
automatically follow. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as 
meaning that a borrower could repay the loans over the term of the agreement  without 
undue difficulties, on time, whilst meeting other  reasonable commitments and without having 
to borrow to meet those  repayments. And the regulations said that an assessment should 
take into account more than simply  assessing the customer's ability to repay the credit.
With this in mind Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information 
provided and what  this all means for Mr Ss complaint.  I note that Sunny has accepted our 
adjudicators view about Loan  7. 
Mr S began borrowing  from Sunny in July 2015   a loan of £400.  From  what I can see Mr S 
applied for £500  but the loan provided  was for less than this. As I've mentioned all his loans 
were due to be repaid  over six months. And Loan 1 went to its full term  being repaid on 18 
December 2015.  
In August  Mr S took Loans 2 and 3. In the broader circumstances at the point he took Loans  
1 and 2 - including  how much  was being  borrowed and the length of the borrowing 
relationship - I dont  think I can safely conclude  that Sunny failed to do enough to check the 
affordability of those loans.
But at the point Mr S took Loan  3 (within a few weeks of Loan 2) - although again a relatively 
low loan amount  - it meant that Mr Ss monthly repayments to Sunny  were increasing and 
now due to be in excess of £160 per month. 
Additionally, I think Sunny  shouldve considered more  closely  the information Mr S had 
provided to it when he applied for Loan 3. For example, between  Loans 2 and 3 his housing 
(rent or mortgage)  costs reduced from £250  to £150 and his income increased by over £100 
Ref: DRN87305843per month. In other  words, he was saying  that he had over £200 per month more of 
disposable income on 29 August than hed had on 7 August. 
Similarly, I dont  think Sunny did enough  when Mr S applied for Loan 4. I accept that Sunny 
may have  carried out some credit reference  agency  checks when granting loans to Mr S, but 
I dont think it went far enough. 
At the point he took his fourth loan, Loan  1 was still outstanding even though the two smaller 
loans - Loans 2 and 3 - had been  repaid two days earlier (with repayments  in the region of 
£90). And the amount  of Loan 4 was significantly higher than Loans 2 and 3 (£200) and yet 
his declared monthly  disposable income had now increased to over £1,000. I think  Sunny 
shouldve been  verifying the information  Mr S had provided from this point. But, as I dont 
have any evidence about Mr Ss financial circumstances at that time, Im not able to say that, 
had Sunny done proportionate checks, it wouldve seen that Loans 3, 4 and 5 were 
unaffordable for him. So, Im not upholding  his complaint about those.
But so far as Loans 6 and 7 are concerned,  a pattern was emerging. And, as I mentioned 
above, Sunny had to ensure that loans were  not only affordable   they had to be sustainably  
affordable for Mr S. This means that it had to do more than simply assessing whether  the 
loan was affordable  on a pounds and pence  basis. And it follows  that a lender should realise 
that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be 
able to make  their repayments without borrowing further. 
Loan 6 was Mr Ss sixth loan in around  five months.  It was for £100.   On the same day he 
took it, he repaid  Loan 1 with a repayment amount of £94.77. This suggests that he used the 
advance for Loan  6 to repay  his earlier credit.  Not only that but Loans 4 and 5 were still 
outstanding which meant that the total monthly  repayments after he took Loan  6 were still 
over £140.  
I think this overall pattern  of Mr Ss lending  history with Sunny means that it shouldve  
realised that further  lending  was unsustainable  and potentially harmful for him from Loan 6. 
This is because there was an emerging pattern  of loans  being taken shortly after taking  out 
or repaying  the previous  ones and they were  consistently overlapping with one another.  So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr S was having to borrow further 
to cover the hole which was left from repaying earlier  loans. This resulted  in Mr Ss 
indebtedness increasing unsustainably   and he wasnt making any real inroads into the 
amount he owed Sunny. This pattern  continued  when, on 8 April 2016  Mr S repaid Loans 4, 
5 and 6 (a total of £200) out of the advance  of £400 for Loan 7  the same amount hed 
borrowed with Loan 1. 
In these circumstances Im satisfied that Loans 6 and 7 shouldnt  have been provided to 
Mr S and I uphold his complaint about them.
putting things right
I understand that overall, Mr S didnt repay  all the capital  for Loan 7. So, there are no 
charges or interest to be refunded to him in respect of Loan  7 (because he didnt pay any: 
his repayments  went towards the capital).  And, although he may not have repaid all the 
capital on Loan  7, Sunny has confirmed that there  is no outstanding  balance with it. In these 
circumstances Im satisfied that a fair and reasonable outcome, so far as Loan 7 is 
concerned, is to make no direction as regards any refund to Mr S or allowing Sunny to offset  
any refund  against  any outstanding capital balance. 
Ref: DRN87305844But I do require Sunny to do the following to put things right so far as Loan 6 is concerned:
A.Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr S towards interest,  fees and 
charges on Loan 6, 
B.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr S which were 
considered as part of A, calculated  from the date he originally made the payments, 
to the date the complaint is settled
C.Pay Mr S the total of A plus B.
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny  to deduct tax from this interest.  It should give Mr S a certificate  
showing how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
I also require Sunny to remove  all information from Mr Ss credit file about  Loans 6 and 7. 
This is because the overall pattern of his borrowing for those two loans means any 
information recorded about them is adverse 
my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  I uphold Mr Ss complaint in part and require Elevate Credit  
International Limited to put things  right in the way Ive explained.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 February  2020.
