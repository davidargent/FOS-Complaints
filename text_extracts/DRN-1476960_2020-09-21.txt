The complaint
Mr O complains about the service that hes received from Harvey & Thompson Limited, 
trading as H&T Pawnbrokers.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
its clear that Mr O is unhappy with the service that hes received from H&T 
Pawnbrokers - but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that its 
acted incorrectly in its dealings with him;
Mr O left his driving licence at its branch by mistake and he complains about the 
delay in it being returned to him - but he now has his driving licence and Im not 
persuaded that any delay in it being returned to him justifies an award of 
compensation in these circumstances;
the branch wasnt open when Mr O wanted to visit it but H&T Pawnbrokers says that 
the branch had an issue with its keys so another set had to be collected which meant 
that it opened later than normal that day  I dont consider that that is enough to 
show that it has acted incorrectly;
Mr O has complained that he was charged for nine days of interest in June 2019 
when he should only have been charged interest for eight days  but H&T 
Pawnbrokers charges interest on an inclusive basis and Mr O was charged for the 
first and last days  so a total of nine days  and I consider that H&T Pawnbrokers 
has calculated the interest charge correctly;
Mr O says that he was told that hes been blacklisted by the branch  but H&T 
Pawnbrokers says that he withdrew early from contracts on multiple occasions and it 
was concerned that the contracts may not be the best product for him so further 
explanation of its pawnbroking services would be given to him  it says that hes not 
been blacklisted but it does have the right to refuse a transaction;
Mr O says that the CCTV footage would reveal a lengthy and heated conversation 
about this matter  but Im not persuaded that its likely that the footage would show 
what was being discussed and I dont consider that I need to review the footage to be 
able to make a decision on this complaint;
I sympathise with Mr O for the upset that he clearly feels about the way that hes 
been treated, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that H&T 
Pawnbrokers has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr O or that it has treated him 
unfairly or unreasonably; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
H&T Pawnbrokers to pay any compensation to Mr O or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Os complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 October 2020.
