The complaint
Mr C complains that two loans given to him by Everyday Lending Limited trading as 
GeorgeBanco.com we unaffordable for him. Hes represented by a friend, but for ease, Ill 
refer to Mr C throughout.
What happened
Mr C took the following guarantor loans from GeorgeBanco:
Date Amount Term Monthly 
RepaymentPurpose as shown on 
application form
Loan 1 2 March 2017 £5,000 5 years £187.93 Used car
Loan 2 6 December 2017 £6,500 5 years £244.43 Used car
Mr C says the loans were unaffordable for him. He says if GeorgeBanco had carried out 
enough checks, it would have seen he had other loans and should have refused to lend to 
him. He says the GeorgeBanco loans left him with little money each month and he had to 
borrow from family to get by.
GeorgeBanco says it carried out reasonable and proportionate checks in line with its usual 
process based on the information Mr C provided, and it had no concerns about his ability to 
afford the loans. Mr C disagreed and referred his complaint to us. 
One of our investigators looked into the complaint. He said that given the amounts, duration 
and monthly repayments, he thought GeorgeBanco should have carried out more thorough 
checks. He felt if it had done so, it would have refused to lend to Mr C. Our investigator 
asked GeorgeBanco to put matters right.
Mr C accepted our investigators opinion, but GeorgeBanco didnt. It said it didnt think it had 
been wrong to lend to Mr C because (in summary):
he had made all repayments to Loan 1 until it was repaid from Loan 2. 
loan 2 had been taken to repay other debts including Loan 1 and for Christmas 
expenses  not for a used car. 
he has successfully repaid the loans.
As there was no agreement, Mr Cs complaint has been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to complaints about high cost credit on our website  
including the key relevant rules, guidance good industry practice and law. Ive considered 
this approach when deciding this complaint.
GeorgeBanco needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend to Mr C 
irresponsibly by carrying out reasonable and proportionate checks. I think there are key 
questions I need to consider in order to decide what is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint:
Did GeorgeBanco carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that Mr C was in a position to sustainably repay the loan?
If not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown at the time 
and did GeorgeBanco make a fair lending decision?
Did GeorgeBanco act unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr C in some other way?
GeorgeBanco was required to carry out a borrower focussed assessment. This assessment 
is sometimes referred to as an affordability check or affordability assessment. The purpose 
of the assessment is for GeorgeBanco to think about whether repaying the loan would cause 
difficulties for Mr C. In other words, it wasnt about GeorgeBanco assessing the likelihood of 
it being repaid, but it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr C. The fact 
that the loans were guaranteed by a third party and the potential of GeorgeBanco to pursue 
the guarantor instead of Mr C doesnt alter the obligation.
GeorgeBanco had to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr C would be able to repay the loan sustainably. Theres no set list of checks it had to do, 
but it could take into account several different things such as the amount and length of the 
loan, the amount of the monthly repayments and the overall circumstances of the borrower.
Taking all that into account, I think a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to 
have been more thorough where:
a customer as a low income (because it may make it more difficult to make loan 
payments of a set amount from a low level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (because it may be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment for a particular level of income);
the longer the term of the loan (because the total cost of the credit is likely to be 
higher, and the customer is obliged to make payments for a longer period); and
the greater the number and frequency of loans and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (because of the risk of repeated 
refinancing may sign the borrowing has become or was becoming unsustainable).
Did GeorgeBanco carry out reasonable and proportionate checks?
When it received Mr Cs applications, GeorgeBanco asked for details of his income, what he 
wanted the money for and obtained his consent to review his credit file. Mr C told them he 
earned £1,350 per month, lived with his parents and had three dependants. GeorgeBanco 
says after assessing his credit file, it confirmed his financial commitments applied a 
percentage of his income for general living expenses. 
For Loan 1, it says this process led it to allow £236 for credit commitments, £100 for rent, 
£715 for living costs and £188 for this loan. This left Mr C with a monthly disposable income 
of £111 and on this basis, GeorgeBanco felt the loan was affordable.
In March 2017 at the time of the application for Loan 1, Mr Cs credit file at the time showed 
he had two loans outstanding totalling approximately £4,100  both of which had been taken 
in the last three months. At least one of these loans appears to have been taken to repay 
another which had been open for less than a year.The amount allowed for living expenses in Mr Cs budget - £715  isnt broken down so its 
not clear what items of expenditure GeorgeBanco has allowed for in it. From what 
GeorgeBanco has said, it simply represents a percentage of his income which doesnt 
appear to necessarily reflect Mr Cs actual expenditure. Given that Mr C had three 
dependants, its likely he had very little  if any  flexibility in that. 
Mr C had applied for Loan 1 to buy a car, which will have necessitated further costs, such as 
insurance, servicing and fuel which may or may not be included in the figures GeorgeBanco 
has provided. 
By GeorgeBancos calculations, Mr C was left with £111 monthly disposable income once 
this loan was agreed. This doesnt leave a great deal of flexibility for a family of four should 
anything unexpected happen. His credit commitments rose from £236 per month to £424  
over 31% of his net monthly income. 
Mr Cs credit file showed hed only recently taken two loans and consolidated one  and was 
seeking to borrow further funds. I think, taking into account what it knew already, 
GeorgeBanco should have asked further questions of Mr C to ensure Loan 1 would be 
sustainable for him. It follows that I dont think its checks were reasonable and proportionate 
for Loan 1. 
Around nine months after taking Loan 1, Mr C returned to GeorgeBanco to consolidate the 
loan and borrow a further £1,500. The new loan would increase his payments to 
GeorgeBanco from £118 per month to £244. His credit file showed that in that time, hed 
taken three further loans from other providers - one for £200 which had been settled, and 
two totalling over £4,750. 
I acknowledge GeorgeBancos comment that Mr C had made all the repayments to Loan 1 
on time, but I think it should have noticed the further loans that had been taken and may well 
have facilitated making these payments. Ignoring Loan 1, Mr C had borrowed further funds 
as well as repaying existing debt. This suggests to me that Mr C was relying on rolling over 
credit to cover his day to day expenses and ought to have prompted GeorgeBanco to again, 
take a closer look at Mr Cs financial situation to ensure Loan 2 would be sustainable for him. 
It follows that I dont think its checks were reasonable and proportionate for Loan 2.
What would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown at the time and did 
GeorgeBanco make a fair lending decision?
Ive outlined above some of the circumstances which I think ought to have led GeorgeBanco 
to carry out further checks on Mr Cs finances. I think it would have been reasonable for 
GeorgeBanco to get a detailed understanding of Mr Cs circumstances, for example by 
asking to see several months of his bank statements in light of what appears to be a fairly 
tight budget and a reliance on credit.
Mr C has provided us with copies of his bank statements for a few months before each loan
was taken. A careful review of the statements brings in to question some of the information
provided to GeorgeBanco. 
In December 2016 and February 2017  just before Loan 1 was agreed in March 2017  
Mr C received significantly less than the £1,350 quoted as his monthly income. He received 
£1,075 and £1,171 respectively. This leads me to think that his income wasnt steady and 
therefore the figure of £1,350 couldnt be relied upon. GeorgeBancos calculation of Mr Cs 
disposable income of £111 relied upon him receiving £1,350 a month. He actually received 
between £180 and £300 per month less in two of the three months prior to the loan being 
agreed. I dont think I can reasonably conclude the loan was sustainable for him. GeorgeBanco has said he kept up the repayments to Loan 1 until he repaid it with Loan 2 in 
December 2017. But as Ive already said, in that period hed taken a further three loans 
(albeit repaying a small one). I dont think the fact that he stayed up to date with payments to 
GeorgeBanco can be taken as evidence of the loan being sustainable for him.
The application for Loan 2 records again that he wanted to borrow for a car. GeorgeBanco 
has said that isnt accurate and it was for debt consolidation and Christmas expenses. The 
loan was a significant increase in his repayments  around £60 per month, and his income 
was quoted at the same level. Weve seen that Mr C had continued to take loans to roll over 
other credit without making any significant reduction in his overall indebtedness. I think if 
GeorgeBanco had looked more closely at Mr Cs financial circumstances, it ought to have 
concluded it was unlikely that lending further funds would be sustainable for him.
For the reasons Ive set out, I dont think GeorgeBanco made a fair lending decision when it 
agreed to lend to him in either occasion.
Did GeorgeBanco act unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr C in some other way?
Ive carefully read, listened to and thought about all the evidence provided by each party to 
this complaint. Having done so, I dont think GeorgeBanco has acted unfairly or 
unreasonably towards Mr C in some other way. 
But I do think GeorgeBanco should have refused to lend to Mr C, so I am upholding his 
complaint about the loan.
Putting things right
When I find that a business has done something wrong, Id normally direct that business to 
put the complainant in the position they would be in now if the mistake it made hadnt 
happened, as far as is reasonably practical. 
In this case, that would mean putting Mr C in the position he would be in now if he hadnt 
been given the loans. But Mr C was given the loans, used the money. So, I think 
GeorgeBanco should:
Calculate the total amount Mr C received from GeorgeBanco and deduct from that 
figure the repayments hes made to each loan. 
oIf this results in Mr C having repaid more than he received, any overpayments 
should be refunded to him. Interest at a rate of 8% simple per year should be 
added to any overpayments from the date they were made until the date of 
settlement*.
oIf the calculation means theres still a balance for Mr C to pay, GeorgeBanco 
should let Mr C know how much is outstanding and reach a suitable, 
affordable payment plan with him. I remind GeorgeBanco of its obligation to 
treat customers fairly. 
Remove any negative information recorded on Mr Bs credit file regarding each loan. 
*If GeorgeBanco considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct income 
tax from that interest, it should tell Mr C how much its taken off. It should also give Mr C a 
tax deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
  My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. Everyday Lending Limited trading as 
GeorgeBanco.com should put things right as Ive described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 November 2021.
