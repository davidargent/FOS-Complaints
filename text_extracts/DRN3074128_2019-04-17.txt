Mr M says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr M had five loans with QuickQuid. Ive set out some of the information QuickQuid provided 
about the loans in the table below. Some of Mr Ms loans were topped-up, meaning  he 
borrowed further funds  during the course of the loan agreement. Mr M also refinanced  some  
of his loans, meaning  he borrowed  further funds and also extended the term of the 
agreement by rolling the funds into a new loan.

An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld  in part. He thought 
that QuickQuid hadnt  always carried out proportionate checks before lending  and had it 
done so, it wouldnt  have approved loans 4a-5.  QuickQuid  didnt agree, so the complaint was 
passed to me to decide. As theres  been  no further dispute about them, Ive not considered 
loans 1-4 in my final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
Relevant regulations and guidance include the Financial Conduct Authoritys (FCA) 
Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC). CONC contains rules and guidance for lenders about 
responsible lending. Among other things, CONC says lenders should carry out affordability 
checks which are proportionate in the circumstances of the loan. The regulations also say 
repayments should be sustainable (i.e. repayable from the borrowers income or savings) 
and that lenders shouldnt  allow a borrower to enter  into consecutive  credit agreements 
where it would  be unsustainable  to do so.
Ref: DRN30741282did QuickQuid carry out proportionate checks?
Before lending to Mr M, QuickQuid asked him about  his income  and recorded  it as £1,800 
net a month for both loans  4 and 5. It also asked him about his monthly  living expenses  
and these totalled £530 for both loans.  The total expenditure  figure  included  £75 a month for 
other credit commitments.  QuickQuid increased  the figure from £75 for loan 5 to £904, 
following a credit check. So for loan 4, it estimated Mr Ms disposable monthly  income as 
£1,270 and for loan 5 it estimated it to be £667.
QuickQuid hasnt provided any data to support what it says about its credit checks. And in 
any event, I dont think the checks QuickQuid carried  out were  proportionate in the 
circumstances of loans  4 and 5. Ill explain why.
Although Mr M had only had three loans before loan 4, hed had problems repaying them to 
their original terms. Loan 1 was originally due to end in December  2016  but was extended 
into February 2017. Loan 2 was topped-up and extended (the extension was repaid  
according to schedule).  Loan 3 was scheduled  to end in July 2017 but was extended into 
September 2017. This means  Mr M had already been indebted to QuickQuid for about  a 
year when he applied  for loan 4. There was a two month gap between loans 3 and 4, but I 
dont think thats  particularly significant  given  the history of lending and Mr Ms problems 
settling his loans.
So when Mr M borrowed further  funds again (4a/4b)  and increased the largest  payment for 
loan 4 to £306 and then £428, I think QuickQuids checks ought to have gone  further.  I think  
QuickQuid shouldve realised its estimate of disposable income of £1,270 a month was open 
to doubt in the light of Mr Ms borrowing and repaying history.  In my view proportionate 
checks ought to have included QuickQuid asking  Mr M to provide more information  to help it 
verify what he was telling it about  his income and expenditure.  
I think the same applies for loan 5, for essentially  the same reasons. There was only a five 
day gap between loan 5 and the preceding  loan and Mr M borrowed much more than he had 
previously. Hed now been borrowing without a substantial break for about 18 months  and 
the largest repayment of £1,102 was over 60% of his monthly income.  It was also more  than 
QuickQuids own estimate  of Mr Ms monthly  disposable income of £667.  So its arguable 
QuickQuid already had enough information to suggest the loan was likely to be unaffordable 
for Mr M.
As QuickQuid didnt carry out proportionate checks,  Ive used Mr Ms bank statements to 
help me decide  what further evidence of his income  and expenditure wouldve likely  shown  
it.
what would  proportionate checks have shown?
From what  Ive seen, I think Mr M had income of around £1,350   rather  than the £1,800  he 
declared. Some of his expenditure was notably higher too  hed declared £100  a month for 
housing expenses but actually appears  to have been paying £540  in rent, plus council tax 
and other  regular normal living costs. In total, Mr Ms regular monthly living costs appear to 
be around £1,150.
Ref: DRN30741283So before looking  at any other short-term commitments Mr M had, the repayments for loans 
4a-5 do not look to be affordable. And at the time of loan 4, Mr M had short-term 
commitments of around £300. This increased  at the time of loan 5 to over £1,200 (much of 
which seems to have appeared on QuickQuids credit check for loan 5). Based on this, 
I think proportionate checks wouldve suggested the lending from loan 4a onwards was not 
affordable.
I also think QuickQuid ought to have realised this was this the case  from the information  it 
actually obtained  at the time of loan 5. It knew that Mr Ms credit  commitments were much  
higher than hed declared. Its own estimate  of his disposable income was £667 against a 
repayment of £1,102.  I assume QuickQuid considers loan 5 was affordable  as the £1,102 
was due after two months, in June 2018   so QuickQuid expected Mr M to save income in 
April and May. I dont think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to think  Mr M was in a position  
to save in this way. His lending and repayment  history doesnt suggest he was likely to be 
able to do this; its not likely hed have been borrowing so frequently if he was able to save 
money each month.
other matters
Ive noted that loan 5 was approved after Mr M had complained about irresponsible lending 
and on the same day QuickQuid sent its final response letter. Ive looked  at whether Mr M 
said anything in his complaint which might  mean  it was clearly irresponsible  for QuickQuid to 
lend to Mr M again. If it was actually  aware Mr M was in financial difficulty  when it lent, for 
example, it might be fair that it write of the principal for loan 5.
But Mr Ms complaint isnt particularly detailed and QuickQuid  had rejected  it when  it lent 
again. Although  I think the lending wasnt responsible, I dont think QuickQuid was actually 
aware of any significant financial difficulty or other  problems which meant  it shouldnt  have 
lent to Mr M again. So its fair he repays  the principal he borrowed (if he hasnt).
Finally, QuickQuid provided a document which sets out some general information  about its 
lending processes from March 2015 onwards. This Service has responded to QuickQuid 
about this document directly and through earlier  final decisions. So I havent referred to it in 
my findings,  although  I did consider it alongside everything else in making my decision. 
putting things right
QuickQuid should:
refund  the interest and charges Mr M paid for loan 4a and all subsequent  loans**
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when he paid them until the 
date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  these loans from Mr Ms credit history**
**when QuickQuid  provided  its file, Mr M hadnt yet repaid the principal  amount of £900 for 
loan 5. If this is still the case, QuickQuid should remove any interest and charges  from the loan 
and treat any payments made as if they were payments towards  the principal. If there is still an 
outstanding principal  balance, QuickQuid  can offset this against the redress  but only if it still 
owns the debt.
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mr M a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN30741284my final decision
I uphold Mr Ms complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking  the steps 
set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 May 2019.
