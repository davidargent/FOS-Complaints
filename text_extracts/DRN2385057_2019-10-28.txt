Miss F says that the repayments  on the loans meant she didnt have enough income  left 
over to pay her bills and so had to borrow again. She says her credit  file at the time showed  
that she was struggling to manage her money  and that lending  to her was irresponsible.
Sunny says that before the loans were  provided  it conducted creditworthiness  checks  and 
assessed the affordability of the repayments.  Based on these checks  it says it was 
reasonable to lend to Miss F.
Our adjudicator partially upheld this complaint. He said he didnt have enough  evidence  to 
say that the first five loans shouldnt have  been  provided but thought that loans six to 13 
shouldnt have been lent.
Sunny accepted our adjudicators view and provided a calculation  of the refund due to 
Miss F. Miss F said Sunnys calculation was incorrect and that she wanted  her complaint 
considered again. She said that the last two loans  were  sold to collections companies  as she 
couldnt repay them at the time,  however since then the loans had been repaid in full.
my provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision n this complaint. I concluded in summary:
there wasnt enough evidence to say that the first five loans shouldnt have been 
provided:
Ref: DRN23850572by the time loan six was provided, Sunny should have been concerned that Miss F 
had become persistently dependent on short term loans and that at this point lending 
to Miss F was not sustainably affordable;
Sunny agreed  to refund the interest and charges on Miss Fs loans from loan six to 13. The 
outstanding issue  was what the refund amount should be. I found  that:
the schedule  of interest paid on loans six to 11 provided by Miss F correlated with the 
information in Sunnys  calculation  in regard to these  loans;
loans 12 and 13 had been sold to a third party and Miss F had said that since then 
she had repaid the loans. These  repayments hadnt  been  taken  included  in Sunnys 
calculation and I found that they should  be. I said that Sunny should  contact  the 
company that the loans were transferred to and establish what payments Miss F has 
made so these could  be taken into account. 
In response to my provisional decision Miss F provided evidence of payments she had made 
to the company she says her loans were  sold to. She reiterated that the loans had been 
repaid in full.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Miss F 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  In this case it was agreed that loans six to 13 
shouldnt have been provided and that refunds relating to these loans would be made. As set 
out in my provisional  decision, any payments Miss F made  after the debts were transferred 
should also be taken  into account. Miss F has sent through  evidence  of payments which she 
says were to the company that took over her loans. 
Given the evidence  provided by Miss F I find that Sunny should contact the company loans 
12 and 13 were transferred to and establish the repayments she made so these can be 
included in the refund calculation.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans  six to 13. Elevate Credit 
International Limited (trading as Sunny) should:
refund  all interest and charges that Miss F paid on loans six to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan six means  any information recorded about  them  
is adverse. So all entries about  loans six to 13 should be removed from Miss Fs 
credit file.
Ref: DRN23850573Loans 12 and 13 were sold to a third party. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as 
Sunny) should  contact the third party and confirm if the debts have  been  repaid. If they have, 
any charges or interest Miss F paid on these (including charges and interest  added  by the 
third party) should be included in Miss Fs refund. If there is an amount still outstanding, 
Sunny should  take back the loans  and the outstanding capital amount can be offset against 
the refund.  If there is an outstanding balance and Sunny is unable, or unwilling, to take back  
the loans it must ensure that its interest  and charges  referred to above,  and any other 
interest and charges added by the debt collection company in regard  to the relevant lending, 
are refunded  to Miss F so she can choose  whether to use the compensation to settle  her 
debt directly.
*HMRC requires  Elevate  Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) to take off tax from 
this interest. If Miss F asks you for a certificate showing how much  tax youve taken off, it 
should provide  this.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 November  2019.
