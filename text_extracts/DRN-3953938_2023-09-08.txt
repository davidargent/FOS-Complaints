The complaint
Mr B complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) restricted his personal account 
and withheld the money in it whilst carrying out a review. 
Mr B says this caused him financial loss, loss of reputation, and distress and inconvenience 
for which PayPal should compensate him.  
What happened
In May 2022, PayPal reviewed Mr Bs account. On 15 May 2022, PayPal restricted Mr Bs 
personal account and asked him to provide it with proof of his identity and address. Mr B 
says he had been sent money recently by a donor for a charity he runs and needed access 
to it to urgently to fund its activities.
Mr B sent proof of identity and his address to PayPal, but it found his proof of address was 
not valid as the address was different to that registered with it. On 24 May 2022, PayPal 
removed the restrictions from Mr Bs account, and he was able to access the funds held in it. 
Unhappy with PayPals actions Mr B complained. PayPal did not uphold Mr Bs complaint. In 
short it said it has a responsibility to all its members to maintain a safe and secure online 
payment service. And to meet this, it must be able to verify or authenticate all information 
associated with his account and perform additional checks where necessary. 
Mr B then referred his complaint to this service. One of our Investigators looked into his 
complaint, and they found: 
- The proof of address Mr B provided to PayPal wasnt valid as it had the incorrect 
address 
- Its not clear why PayPal removed the block on 24 May 2022 given it hadnt received 
valid proof of address from Mr B. But this benefitted Mr B
- PayPal hasnt given them satisfactory information to explain why the account was 
blocked on 15 May 2022  so it wasnt entitled to do this. But it was entitled to restrict 
the account after Mr B sent invalid proof of address information on 16 May 2022. 
Asking for this information was in line with its terms of account 
- The one day the account was blocked before PayPal was entitled to so would not 
have caused impact enough to warrant PayPal doing anything differently. So PayPal 
doesnt need to do anything further 
Mr B did not agree with what our Investigator said. He makes a number of points, some of 
the key ones are: 
- A manager at PayPal had called him at the time of the restrictions and told him that it 
had made an error with restricting his account and they were sorry about this 
- There was no valid reason for PayPal to block the account 
- PayPals actions were malicious and designed to antagonise and cause him 
detriment 
As Mr B didnt agree, his complaint has now been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Bs complaint. I know this will disappoint him, 
so Ill explain why. 
Im very aware that Ive summarised the events in this complaint in far less detail than the 
parties and Ive done so using my own words. No discourtesy is intended by me in taking 
this approach. Instead, Ive focussed on what I think are the key issues here. Our rules allow 
me to do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as a free alternative to 
the courts. 
If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive ignored it. Im satisfied I dont 
need to comment on every individual argument to be able to reach what I think is the right 
outcome. I do stress however that Ive considered everything Mr B and PayPal has said 
before reaching my decision. Its important to note, my decision focuses on PayPals actions 
regarding Mr Bs account.  
I would add too that our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may treat 
evidence from regulated businesses as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if 
it contains security information, or commercially sensitive information. Some of the 
information PayPal has provided is information we consider should be kept confidential.
Financial businesses, like PayPal, are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in 
order to meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out 
ongoing monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need 
to restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
Its also worth noting the extensive legal and regulatory obligations PayPal must meet 
generally cover the entire period of its customer relationship  from application to eventually 
the end of the relationship. This includes Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. 
PayPal have sent me information it says shows why it decided to restrict Mr Bs account on 
15 May 2022. Having carefully considered all of this, Im persuaded PayPal have done 
nothing wrong by restricting the account and asking Mr B to satisfy requirements under the 
terms of the account relating to his identity and address. 
I know Mr B would like a detailed and specific explanation of PayPals reasons. But for the 
reasons I alluded to above, and as PayPal is under no obligation to do so, no further 
explanation needs to be given. 
Im also satisfied PayPal acted correctly by continuing to restrict the account given Mr B 
provided it with proof of address for a different address to that which hed told PayPal he 
resides at. 
Its unclear why PayPal removed the restriction on 24 May 2022 without the valid proof of 
address it had wanted. But as our Investigator said, this was to Mr Bs benefit. So though I 
think PayPal were wrong to remove the restriction when it did, this hasnt caused Mr B any detriment. 
Mr B says he was told by one of PayPals employees the restriction was altogether applied 
in error and that they apologised to him for this. Mr B hasnt been able to send any evidence 
which supports this. PayPal also havent given me any evidence about this instead saying its 
submissions to this service constitute its position on the complaint. So without any evidence, 
I cant make a finding on this point. 
Mr B has also said PayPal maliciously set out to antagonise him with the actions it took. 
From the information Ive been provided, which includes screenshot of PayPals internal 
notes, I havent seen anything which supports this.    
Mr B says this matter has caused him financial loss. He also says it has caused him trouble 
and upset. I do appreciate this matter wouldve caused him some difficulty. But having 
looked at whats happened in this particular case, I can see no basis on which I might make 
an award against PayPal given that I dont think it failed to properly follow its own procedures 
when restricting the account. 
So Im not going to ask PayPal to compensate Mr B for any trouble and upset this may have 
caused. I also note, and for the sake of completeness, the funds were for Mr Bs charity, so 
in any event it would not be him in his personal capacity that suffered any financial loss. This 
complaint after all is about an account he held personally. 
My final decision
For the reasons above, I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 October 2023.
