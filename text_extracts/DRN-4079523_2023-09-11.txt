The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as D, is unhappy with several aspects of the service it 
received from National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) surrounding its Bounce Back Loan 
(BBL)
Ds complaint is brought to this service by its director, whom Ill refer to as Mr E.
What happened
To briefly summarise: In December 2020, D received an £18,000 BBL from NatWest. As per 
the BBL agreement, D became liable to begin monthly payments to the BBL from January 
2022 onwards. Towards the end of 2021, D received notice from NatWest that payments 
towards the BBL were due to commence. But Mr E didnt know exactly when the payments 
were due to start and so wrote to NatWest asking for clarification on this point. However, he 
received no response. 
Because of this, Mr E couldnt make Ds BBL payments, and unbeknownst to Mr E, the loan 
fell into arrears. This led to NatWest issuing a formal demand for full repayment of the BBL 
in May 2022, at which time Mr E contacted NatWest and raised a complaint on Ds behalf. 
NatWest apologised to Mr E that they hadnt responded to the letter hed sent requesting 
information about when Ds BBL payments were due to commence and paid £75 to D 
because of this. But NatWest didnt feel that their failure to reply to Mr Es letter invalidated 
the arrears that had accrued on Ds BBL, which they maintained were correct. 
Shortly afterwards, on 31 May 2022, D received an email from NatWest which invited him to 
make monthly payments towards the BBL and which didnt mention any arrears on the 
account. Mr E believed that this email meant that Ds BBL wasnt in fact in arrears, and so he 
began making monthly payments towards the BBL in line with the email hed received. 
However, shortly after this, NatWest defaulted Ds BBL for non-payment. Mr E wasnt happy 
about this, or that NatWest later withdrew money from Ds NatWest business current 
account (BCA) to repay the BBL, and so raised a complaint. 
NatWest responded to Mr E and said they didnt feel theyd acted unfairly by defaulting the 
BBL or paying the BBL debt using money from Ds BCA. But NatWest did apologise for the 
email that had been sent to D on 31 May 2022 which hadnt include accurate information 
about the state of Ds BBL at that time, and they made a payment of £150 to D as 
compensation for any trouble or inconvenience this may have caused. Mr E wasnt satisfied 
with NatWests response, so he referred Ds complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They noted that Mr E hadnt referred Ds 
complaint about NatWests failure to respond to his letters requesting information about 
when Ds BBL payments were due to start within six months of NatWest providing their 
response to that complaint. And our advisor explained to Mr E that this meant hed referred 
this aspect of Ds complaint outside of the timeframe given for him to do so, which meant 
that this wasnt an aspect of Ds complaint this service could consider. 
Additionally, our investigator didnt feel that NatWest had acted unfairly in how theyd 
considered arrears to have accrued on Ds BBL or in how theyd defaulted the BBL because 
of those arrears. And they also felt that the apology and payment of compensation that 
NatWest had issued to D regarding the email that had been sent incorrectly on 31 May 2022 
already represented a fair resolution to that aspect of Ds complaint. Mr E remained 
dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Id like to begin by confirming that this service isnt a regulatory body or a 
Court of Law and doesnt operate as such. Instead, this service is an informal, impartial 
dispute resolution service. And while we do take relevant law and regulation into account 
when arriving at our decisions, our remit is focussed on determining whether we feel a fair or 
unfair outcome has occurred  from an impartial perspective, after taking all the factors and 
circumstances of a complaint into consideration.
In December 2020, when Mr E applied for the BBL and accepted the BBL agreement on Ds 
behalf, he was informed at that time that D would become liable to begin making payments 
towards the BBL from January 2022 onwards. This is as per Ds BBL agreement, specifically 
section 4: Repayment of the loan and interest, which states:
4.2: The Customer will be granted a Repayment Holiday for a period of 12 months 
from the date on which the Loan is drawn
4.3: Unless an alternative date is agreed, the first instalment is due 1 month after 
the date on which the Repayment Holiday ends
It was Mr Es responsibility, as Ds director and the signatory to the BBL agreement, to have 
understood the terms of the BBL to which he was agreeing on Ds behalf. And given that D 
received the loan funds in December 2020, Im satisfied that Mr E should have understood, 
from the terms of the BBL quoted above, that a twelve-month repayment holiday would 
commence from December 2020, ending in December 2021, and that D would be liable to 
begin making payments towards the BBL from January 2022 onwards. 
I therefore dont accept that Mr E bore no responsibility for D not making BBL payments from 
January 2022 onwards  because Mr E had been provided with all the information necessary 
for him to understand this point in Ds BBL agreement. 
Additionally, Mr E has explained that when he received notice from NatWest in late 2021 that 
Ds BBL payments were due to commence, he wrote to NatWest and asked them when D 
needed to begin making BBL payments. And Mr E has also explained that because he 
received no response from NatWest to his letters, he couldnt make Ds BBL payments 
because he didnt know when they were due.
However, notwithstanding the fact that Mr E should have known that the BBL payments were 
due from January 2022, as explained above, the obvious response to Mr Es position here is 
that if no responses to his letters were received then he should have contacted NatWest via 
other means, most obviously by telephone. And it clearly isnt the case that D was absolved 
from meeting its BBL commitments because its director had either forgotten those 
commitments (as per the BBL agreement) or didnt act proactively or with the requisite 
degree of responsibility to contact NatWest and confirm them.NatWest have also confirmed that D did have online banking, meaning that Mr E could have 
accessed information about Ds BBL via that channel. Or Mr E could have engaged in an 
online chat with a NatWest agent or conducted an internet search as to when BBL account 
holders were liable to commence making payments towards their loan. 
In short, there were several avenues and opportunities for Mr E to have refreshed his 
understanding of the fact that Ds BBL payments were due to begin in January 2022. And Im 
therefore satisfied that it is Mr E himself, by failing to take any of these many opportunities, 
who is responsible for the fact that D didnt meet its repayment obligations and so fell into 
arrears on the loan. 
This isnt to say that NatWest didnt make any mistakes here. Indeed, NatWest 
acknowledged that they sent an email to D on 31 May 2022 that didnt contain an up-to-date 
explanation of the position of Ds BBL account at that time. And Im aware that Mr E is also 
unhappy that NatWest didnt respond to his letters asking them to confirm when Ds BBL 
payments were scheduled to commence, as discussed above.
On 16 May 2022, NatWest responded to Ds complaint about their not replying to the letters 
sent by Mr E requesting information about Ds BBL payments. And this complaint response 
letter gave Mr E six months to refer Ds complaint about that matter to this service if he 
wanted to do so. 
But Mr E didnt contact this service until January 2023, which was after his right to refer this 
aspect of Ds complaint had expired. As such, I wont be commenting on the failure of 
NatWest to respond to the letters sent by Mr E further, and any reference Ive made to this 
point previously in this letter should be taken as my providing context for the wider scope of 
Ds overall complaint. 
Mr E also contends that the email he received from NatWest dated 31 May 2022  at which 
time D hadnt made any payments towards the BBL and so was five months in arrears  
reasonably led him to believe that there were no arrears on Ds BBL. And Mr E explains that 
he reasonably believed this because the email included no reference to any loan arrears and 
invited D to begin making monthly payments.
But Mr E had contacted NatWest himself on 12 May 2022  a few weeks before he received 
the email on 31 May 2022  to complain to NatWest about the receipt of the formal demand 
that NatWest had issued because of the non-payment of the BBL payments by D since 
January 2022. So, Im satisfied that Mr D was aware that Ds BBL account was in a position 
of multiple arrears when he received the email on 31 May 2022. 
Additionally, the 31 May email that Mr E received, while it didnt specifically reference any 
account arrears, also didnt provide any confirmation to Mr E that the several months of 
arrears which he was aware at that time had been waived or written off. 
As such, I feel that it should have been reasonably apparent to Mr E  given the formal 
demand that hed received and responded to  that this later email from NatWest might have 
been produced in error, such that he reasonably should have contacted NatWest to query it. 
And it isnt the case that this email received from NatWest in any way absolved D of its 
contractual obligations to repay the BBL which it was already in arrears of, or of the potential 
consequences of continued non-payment of those arrears, which NatWest had already 
appraised Mr E of via the earlier formal demand. 
But NatWest shouldnt have sent that email to Mr E. And while Im satisfied that it wasnt 
reasonable for Mr E to have discounted the position of arrears that hed previously been 
advised of  as it appears Mr E may have done  I can appreciate how the receipt of that email may have been confusing to Mr E. 
NatWest have acknowledged this in their response to Mr Es complaint about this matter, in 
which they apologised to Mr E and made a payment of £150 compensation. This response 
and compensation payment feels fair to me. This is because the apology and compensation 
was solely for the inconvenience that Mr E, as director of D, may have incurred in having to 
clarify the position of Ds BBL at that time  which as explained I feel Mr E should reasonably 
have done. And so, I wont be asking NatWest to take any further action in this regard.
Mr E has explained to this service that D didnt receive any of the letters that NatWest has 
claimed it sent to D regarding the arrears that were developing on Ds BBL from January 
2022 onwards. And Mr E has also said that he never received a telephone call that NatWest 
also claim to have made to him.
But Im satisfied from the information that NatWest have provided to this service that they did 
send the arrears letters and did make the telephone call to D as theyve explained. And Im 
also satisfied that NatWest sent the letters to Ds correct address, as its presently listed on 
Companies House and as Mr E has confirmed it to this service. 
While it doesnt necessarily follow that D received the letters that NatWest sent, this service 
wouldnt hold a business accountable for the non-delivery of correctly addressed letters. And 
it also remains the case that Mr E should have been aware that Ds BBL was in arrears 
regardless of the receipt of the arrears letters that NatWest sent, as previously explained. 
Finally, Mr E is unhappy that after NatWest defaulted the BBL, they took money from Ds 
BCA to repay the BBL debt. But this right to set-off is a common feature of lending and is 
permitted within the terms of the BBL agreement. And so, Im satisfied that NatWest havent 
done anything wrong by exercising their right to set-off Ds BBL debt as they did. 
All of which means that I dont feel that NatWest have acted unfairly here as Mr E contends. 
And Im also satisfied that NatWest have already provided a fair resolution to D in regard to 
the email Mr E received on 31 May 2022. Accordingly, it follows that I wont upholding this 
complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 October 2023.
