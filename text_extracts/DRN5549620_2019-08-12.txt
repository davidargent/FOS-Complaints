K820x#14complaint
Mr S says Capital One (Europe) plc mis-sold him a payment protection  insurance  (PPI)  
policy. 
background
Mr S bought the policy over the phone  in 2004 sometime after he took out a credit  card.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr S disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Ss case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Ss complaint because:
 I think Capital One made Mr S aware  that he had a choice about buying the PPI, and 
that he chose  to take it. 
 Capital One didnt recommend the PPI to Mr S so it didnt have to check  if it was right 
for him. 
 Its possible the information Capital One gave Mr S about  the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Mr S doesnt  appear  to have been affected by any of the main  
things the policy  didnt cover  and based on what I know about  his circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been  useful to him. So I dont think  better  information  
wouldve stopped  him buying it. 
Ive taken into account Mr Ss comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 September  2019.
