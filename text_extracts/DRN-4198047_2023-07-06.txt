The complaint
Mr C complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
In June 2021 Mr C applied for a Aqua credit card. NewDay approved the application and 
gave Mr C a card with an initial credit limit of £600. The credit limit was increased to £1200 in 
September 2022.
In July 2021 Mr C applied for a Aqua credit card. NewDay approved the application and 
gave Mr C a card with an initial credit limit of £700. The credit limit was increased to £1450 in 
September 2022.
Mr C complained that NewDay had lent to him irresponsibly.
NewDay didnt uphold the complaint. It said it had carried out proportionate checks before 
lending to Mr C.
Mr C remained unhappy and complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. They said that in respect of both cards, 
NewDay had completed reasonable and proportionate checks and that the lending decision 
was fair.
Mr C didnt agree so Ive been asked to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to complaints about irresponsible and unaffordable lending on 
our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering Mr Cs complaint.
Before agreeing to lend, NewDay needed to complete reasonable and proportionate checks 
to ensure that Mr C could sustainably repay what was being lent to him. Theres no set list of 
checks that a lender has to complete. But lenders are required to have regard to things like 
the amount being lent, the total amount repayable, the monthly repayment and the 
consumers individual circumstances when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate.
Ive looked at the checks carried out by NewDay in relation to both accounts.
Aqua account  account opening
Mr C declared annual income of £23,599 when he applied for the account. NewDay verified 
this income using an industry tool. It obtained expenditure data and carried out an 
affordability assessment. This showed that Mr C had sufficient monthly disposable income to 
afford the repayments on the credit card.
NewDay carried out a credit check. This showed that Mr C had around £8200 unsecured 
debt. There was no adverse information recorded on Mr Cs credit file in the last 3 years.
Based on what Ive seen, I think the checks carried out by NewDay were reasonable and 
proportionate. I havent seen anything in the information gathered form the checks which 
wouldve given NewDay cause for concern, or which wouldve necessitated further checks.
Ive gone on to consider whether the lending decision was fair. Theres nothing in the 
information gathered by NewDay to suggest that Mr C was struggling to repay his debts or 
that he wasnt likely to be able to sustainably repay the loan. In the circumstances I think the 
lending decision was fair.
Aqua account  credit limit increase to £1200
Mr Cs complaint about this lending decision has already been upheld by NewDay so I wont 
comment on it.
NewPay account  account opening
Mr C declared annual income of £23,599 when he applied for the account. NewDay verified 
this income using an industry tool. It obtained expenditure data and carried out an 
affordability assessment. This showed that Mr C had sufficient monthly disposable income to 
afford the repayments on the credit card.
NewDay carried out a credit check. This showed that Mr C had around £7800 unsecured 
debt. There was no adverse information recorded on Mr Cs credit file in the last 3 years.
Based on what Ive seen, I think the checks carried out by NewDay were reasonable and 
proportionate. I havent seen anything in the information gathered form the checks which 
wouldve given NewDay cause for concern, or which wouldve necessitated further checks.

NewPay account  credit limit increase to £1450
In March 2022 the credit limit was increased. The credit checks carried out showed that Mr C 
had unsecured debt of around £21,000. The majority of this  around £16,000  was non 
revolving debt.
NewDay looked at how Mr C had managed the account so far. All payments were up to date 
and Mr C regularly paid more than the minimum monthly payment. There was one late fee 
applied but this had been refunded. Mr C had remained within the credit limit and hadnt 
made any cash withdrawals.
Based on what Ive seen, I think the checks carried out by NewDay were reasonable and 
proportionate. I havent seen anything in the information gathered form the checks which 
wouldve given NewDay cause for concern, or which wouldve necessitated further checks.
Looking at the information obtained from the checks, I think the lending decision was fair. 
Theres nothing in the information gathered to suggest that Mr C wasnt likely to be able to 
sustainably repay the lending.For the reasons Ive given I dont think NewDay lent irresponsibly.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 August 2023.
