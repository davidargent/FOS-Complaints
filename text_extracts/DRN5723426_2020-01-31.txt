Miss B has said MYJAR failed to carry out affordability assessments  before  lending to her. 
She has said had it done  so, it would have seen that she was dependant  on pay day loans  
and lending  further to her was not helping to satisfy her long-term financial needs. 
MYJAR has said it conducted the appropriate  affordability checks before approving the 
loans. When the complaint  was brought to the service, MYJAR  made  an offer to uphold 
loans 5 and 8. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Bs complaint  in part and thought loans 1 to 4 and 6 to 8 should 
not have been given.  
MYJAR disagreed with our adjudicators assessment on loans 1 to 4 and 6 to 8 but it did 
agree to make offers on loans 4, 5 and 8. Miss B rejected the offer so the complaint has now 
been passed to me to decide.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN57234262But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Miss B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Bs complaint.
Lending is unaffordable  if its clear the customers disposable  income  wasnt enough to make 
the payments  for the borrowing at the time it was taken out. And I can see from what  we 
know about Miss Bs finances that she had little disposable income. 
As Ive said above,  in order for Miss Bs loan to be sustainably  affordable  for her, she 
needed to be able to make  the repayments on time, while  meeting  other  reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  again.  I can see from the information  MYJAR 
obtained before lending  that Miss B had little income left over after meeting her usual 
monthly living costs and credit commitments.
Miss B declared monthly expenses of between £756  and 820 against a monthly  income of 
£900 when taking out loans 1 to 4. I thought MYJAR  had enough information  to see that 
Miss B was likely to have  little to no disposable income left to afford the repayments on loans 
1 to 4. Or at the very least the results shouldve prompted MYJAR  to carry out further  
checks. 
Ref: DRN57234263For example from what I can see of loan 1, Miss B had £144 left after paying  her usual 
monthly commitments and had to make a repayment of £126  to MYJAR. That would leave 
her with just £18 for any unexpected expenses  and leaves almost no margin for error in 
terms of her declared expenditure.
MYJAR had to make sure the loan was sustainably affordable. So I think  it ought to have 
realised that leaving  Miss B with little or no disposable income (after the loan repayment) 
was most likely to cause her difficulties.  So it was wrong to give loan 1 to 4.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MYJARs  lending history with Miss B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR  should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Bs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point MYJAR  ought to have realised Miss B was not managing to repay their 
loans sustainably. Miss B had taken out six loans  within  two years and whilst the
amounts fluctuated, they didnt significantly decrease over this period and for the rest
of the borrowing relationship with MYJAR.   So MYJAR ought to have realised  it was 
more likely than not Miss B was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying 
her previous  loan was leaving  in her finances  and that Miss Bs indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed MYJAR. Loan 8 was 
taken out 28 months after Miss Bs first and it was for a larger amount  than loan 1. 
Miss B had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to MYJAR over 
an extended period.
I think that Miss B lost out because  MYJAR continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Bs ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 1 to 4 and loans 6 to 8 and MYJAR should  put 
things right.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss B paid on loans 1 to 4 and loans 6 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 1 to 4 from Miss Bs credit file;
Ref: DRN57234264the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 8 should be removed from 
Miss Bs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Miss B a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Bs complaint.  MYJAR Limited  
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 March  2020.
