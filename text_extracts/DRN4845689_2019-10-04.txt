K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains about how NewDay Ltd dealt with a disputed  credit card transaction.
background
Mr R says he told NewDay  about a disputed transaction of about  £55 that was later 
refunded to him. He says NewDay asked him to complete a form which he did and sent it 
back to NewDay. Mr R says he then received a letter from NewDay  asking him again  for the 
form and so he contacted NewDay by telephone. Mr R says NewDays advisor refused to 
pay his costs in sending the form again by recorded  delivery and offered no alternatives as 
he wasnt prepared to pay for the form to be sent again. Mr R also says the advisor was rude 
and put the telephone down on him.
NewDay says it didnt  receive the form and its advisor asked Mr R if he would like a new 
form but he refused  and said it should have sent a pre-paid envelope. It says it told Mr R that 
it would  not cover the costs of sending the form by recorded delivery but suggested  Mr R 
resend the form.  NewDay says Mr R said he didnt want another form and it didnt end the 
call in the way Mr R says it did. It says it did credit Mr Rs account with the disputed  amount 
without receiving the form and has paid £5 for Mr Rs call costs.
Mr R brought his complaint to us but our investigator  didnt  uphold  it. The investigator  didnt 
think NewDay was responsible for the safe delivery  of mail and thought  Mr R could have 
resent the form by second class mail. The investigator didnt think  Mr R had lost out in any 
event as NewDay honoured the chargeback and refunded him his money. The investigator  
listened to the call and didnt think the advisor  was rude or put the telephone down on Mr R 
to end the call.
Mr R doesnt accept  that view and maintains the advisor was rude and that it was 
NewDayss responsibility to provide a means  of posting the documents.  He would like an 
ombudsmans review  of the investigators view.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall view as the investigator for the same reasons.
I appreciate Mr R says he sent the form to NewDay in the first place. But as the investigator 
has explained there is no evidence to suggest  it lost the form and I cant fairly hold NewDay  
responsible for mail that was lost before  it reached  it. I accept Mr R would have been 
frustrated in those  circumstances but I dont think NewDay  was under any responsibility to 
provide Mr R with a pre-paid envelope  or to pay for any costs in sending the form again by 
recorded delivery.
Ive listened to the call between the parties  and whilst I appreciate  Mr R says NewDays 
advisor was rude and ended the call between them, Im satisfied that was not the case. Im 
satisfied NewDays advisor explained that she could resend the form to Mr R but he said he 
didnt want another  form and would not resend it. Im also satisfied that the advisor was 
polite throughout  the call and didnt end the call in the way Mr R says by putting the 
telephone down. I think the call ended as I would have expected it to. 
Ref: DRN48456892Im satisfied overall NewDay hasnt made a mistake  here or acted unfairly. I think  Mr R could 
reasonably have resent the form by second  class mail if he was concerned  about  the cost of 
resenting it. I think NewDay was trying to help Mr R with a fraudulent  transaction but in any 
event it appears it refunded Mr R the £55 without the form. So I dont think Mr R has lost out 
financially as a result  of what took place.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 November 2019.
