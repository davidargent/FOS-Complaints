DRN-4407753
The complaint
Mrs M complains (via her representative) that Zurich Assurance Ltd asked about nationality 
on a direct debit mandate.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mrs Ms representative questioned why Zurich asked about nationality on the direct 
debit mandate, as he thought this was unnecessarily intrusive. Zurich explained this 
was for anti-money laundering reasons (as well as international tax compliance laws 
regarding tax avoidance). 
Zurich has confirmed this question is asked as part of its standard process. That 
decision was up to Zurich. Im not able to require a business to change its processes, 
though I can consider whether a process has been followed appropriately. 
Zurich has confirmed that whilst it asks about nationality, it doesnt insist upon this 
information being provided. Im satisfied that Zurich followed its process here, as my 
understanding is that Mrs Ms representative chose not to provide this information to 
Zurich, and it didnt insist upon knowing it.
Although Mrs Ms representative thinks Zurich should amend its procedures and 
make it clear on the form that the information isnt compulsory, I cant require Zurich 
to change its process and do this. 
I therefore dont uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 November 2023.
