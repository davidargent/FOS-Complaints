K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA made it difficult  for him to pay what  he 
owed on his credit account.  He says PayPals actions increased the balance and affected his 
credit file.
background
Mr M had a credit account with PayPal. In 2017 he was experiencing financial difficulty and 
the business agreed he could make reduced monthly payments. Mr Ms debit card expired 
and he had difficulty adding a new card. This meant he couldnt make  the agreed  payments 
to PayPal. 
Mr M incurred additional  charges  and he says his credit file has been affected. He considers  
PayPal should  take responsibility for some  of what he owes.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend the complaint should be upheld.  He concluded PayPal 
had treated Mr M fairly  when hed told it about the financial difficulty he was experiencing, 
and that it wasnt  responsible for Mr M failing to make the agreed payments. So he didnt 
consider the information PayPal had recorded on Mr Ms credit file was wrong.
Mr M didnt  agree with the adjudicators conclusions so the complaint has been  passed to 
me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory (as some of it is here),  I reach my conclusions on the balance  
of probabilities  that is, what I think is most  likely to have happened in light of the available 
evidence and the wider surrounding circumstances.
Mr M has mentioned that PayPals systems  allowed him to make a payment and use the 
available credit before the payment cleared. Some of Mr Ms payments failed, which meant  
his balance increased. 
But I havent seen  enough evidence to safely  say that Mr M had the available  funds to clear 
the payments  he made. So it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to find that PayPal is 
responsible for the increased balance  on his account.
When Mr M was experiencing  financial difficulty PayPal agreed that he could pay reduced 
monthly payments.  Mr M made the required payments until the debit card he was using 
expired. 
Mr Ms account was restricted because of the reduced payments he was making, so he had 
difficulty applying a new card. He called  PayPal and the notes of the conversation say, in 
summary:
member has difficulty  adding  card, modified limitation to allow  member [to] add card,  
member will call back if issues
Ref: DRN74475792PayPals records indicate Mr M tried to add another card, but this failed because it was 
picked up by PayPals  systems as a risk.
But I cant see that there was any further  contact from Mr M to PayPal when that card 
couldnt be added to the account. Mr M remained responsible for making the required 
payments and it seems  PayPal had advised  him to contact it if he had any issues adding  the 
second card.  So from what Ive seen, I dont think it would be fair or reasonable for me to say 
that PayPal was responsible for Mr M not making  the required payments  to the account.
That means Im not persuaded that PayPal has done anything  wrong  in connection  with the 
credit file information it has recorded for Mr M.
Overall, I dont  consider  there are any reasonable grounds on which  I can uphold Mr Ms 
complaint.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 December  2019.
