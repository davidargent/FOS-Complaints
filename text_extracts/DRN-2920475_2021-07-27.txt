The complaint
Mr F is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, processed a transaction from his 
PayPal credit account without his knowledge.  
What happened
Mr F had a PayPal account within which were stored a number of bank debit cards as well 
as a PayPal credit account. A yearly subscription payment became due, and PayPal 
processed the due payment from Mr Fs PayPal credit account without Mr Fs knowledge. 
Because of this, a payment became due on Mr Fs credit account which ultimately wasnt 
paid, resulting in PayPal reporting adverse information to Mr Fs credit file. 
Mr F wasnt happy about this, especially as all previous annual subscription payments had 
been made using one of the bank debit cards stored on his PayPal account. So, he raised a 
complaint.
PayPal looked at Mr Fs complaint, but they noted that no preferred funding source was set 
up on Mr Fs account and so felt that their processing the payment via the PayPal credit 
account was legitimate. So, they didnt uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Mr F wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that PayPal hadnt acted fairly 
towards Mr F by processing the payment from Mr Fs PayPal credit account without his 
consent. So, they recommended that the complaint be upheld in Mr Fs favour and that 
PayPal should remove the adverse information from Mr Fs credit file and pay him £50 as 
compensation for any inconvenience incurred.
PayPal didnt agree with the recommendations made by our investigator, so the matter was 
escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr F had a number of bank debit cards stored on his PayPal account, so its difficult to 
understand why PayPal elected to process this particular transaction through Mr Fs PayPal 
credit account - and this is especially the case given that Mr F didnt regularly use his PayPal 
credit account.  
PayPal have stated that Mr F hadnt set a preferred funding source on his account and that 
as such their system selected a funding source for the transaction. But considering that 
previous similar payments had been made by Mr F from one of the debit cards stored on his 
PayPal account, and again considering the infrequency with which Mr F used his PayPal 
credit account, it seems clear to me that if a funding source were to be selected without Mr 
Fs express consent  and Im not convinced that should have been the case at all - then 
that funding source should have been the debit card from which previous similar payments 
had been made.
Furthermore, by electing to use Mr Fs PayPal credit account, PayPal exposed Mr F to the 
risk of adverse reporting to his credit file - if Mr F didnt become aware that an unexpected 
balance had been accrued on his credit account. And this is what ultimately happened.
This doesnt feel fair to me, and while I can appreciate that PayPal sent Mr F notifications 
that a payment was required on his credit account, which Mr F didnt respond to, I can only 
conclude that Mr F should never have been put in the position to have missed a due 
payment on his credit account in this first instance. 
It follows then that I will be upholding this complaint in Mr Fs favour and instructing PayPal 
to remove all adverse information resulting from this incident from Mr Fs credit file, and also 
to make a payment of £50 to Mr F to compensate him for the trouble and upset this matter 
has caused.
Putting things right
PayPal must remove all adverse reporting from Mr Fs credit file resulting from their 
processing the transaction in question using Mr Fs PayPal credit account.
PayPal must also make a payment of £50 to Mr F to compensate him for the trouble this 
matter has caused. This payment must not take the form of a credit to Mr Fs PayPal credit 
account.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, on 
the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2021.
