The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA approved him for a credit account
which he feels was unaffordable for him at that time. Mr S is also unhappy that PayPal later
increased the credit limit on that account on two occasions, both of which he feels were
unaffordable for him at those times.  
What happened
Mr S is represented on this complaint by his sister, an authorised representative. For ease of
reference, I will refer in this letter to Mr S as being the complainant.
In 2016, Mr S applied for a PayPal credit account. Mr Ss application was approved, and he
was issued with a PayPal credit account with an initial credit limit of £400. PayPal later
increased the credit limit on Mr Ss account - first to £650 in October 2017, and then to
£1,150 in August 2019.
In 2020, Mr S fell into arrears on the account and the account was subsequently defaulted
by PayPal for non-payment. Mr S later raised a complaint with PayPal on the basis that the
credit account and subsequent credit limit increases should never have been offered to him
as they were unaffordable for him at those times.
PayPal looked at Mr Ss complaint. But they felt that they had undertaken checks into Mr Ss
financial position at the time of the account application and later credit limit increases, and
that there had been nothing resulting from these checks that should have made them
consider that the credit being offered to Mr S was unaffordable for him. Because of this,
PayPal didnt uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Mr S wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also felt that PayPal had
conducted checks into Mr Ss financial position before offering the credit to him, and that
these checks hadnt highlighted anything that should have made PayPal suspect that Mr S
wouldnt be able to afford the credit. So, they also didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr S remained dissatisfied, especially given that he suffered from mental health issues
which he didnt feel had been taken into account, and also because hed been unemployed
at the time of the credit account application which meant that he hadnt met one of PayPals
stated criteria for being approved for a PayPal credit account  that the applicant must be
employed. So, the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 19 October 2021 as follows:
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how 
much and on what terms. What this service would expect would be that  before 
approving a customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of 
credit available to a customer on an existing line of credit  the business would 
undertake reasonable and proportionate checks to ensure that any credit being 
offered to a customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
PayPal say that they did that here. At the time of the account application they took 
details of Mr Ss monthly income and employment status from Mr S to confirm that  
Mr S would likely be able to afford any monthly payments that might arise on the 
account. PayPal also obtained information from a credit reference agency to get a 
better understand of Mr Ss wider financial position at that time.
PayPal have confirmed that there was nothing resulting from the checks that they 
undertook into Mr Ss financial position that they feel should have given them cause 
to suspect that the credit account, with the initial credit limit of £400 for which Mr S 
was ultimately approved, would be unaffordable for Mr S at that time.
Having reviewed the information that PayPal would have used to assess Mr Ss 
account application, I find it difficult to conclude that PayPal have acted unfairly 
towards Mr S by approving him for a credit account with a £400 credit limit because 
of that information. And I say this because Mr S confirmed on his application that he 
had monthly income of over £1,500 and because Mr Ss credit file doesnt show any 
indications that Mr S might be in financial difficulty at that time.
Im aware that Mr S feels that his application should never have been approved 
because he didnt meet one of PayPals stated application approval criteria  that the 
account applicant be employed.
PayPal have demonstrated that Mr S stated at the time of his account application that 
he was a homemaker with an income of at least £1,500 per month. PayPal have 
also stated that they dont equate homemaker to being unemployed and note that   
Mr S had the option to select unemployed at the point of application, at which time 
his application would have been automatically declined. As a counter to this point,  
Mr S has stated his belief that a homemaker, by definition, isnt employed.
Ive considered this point at length and I feel that the significance of this point has 
been misunderstood  at least when considered from the perspective from which this 
service approaches this matter.
The reason I say this is because this service seeks to assess whether an unfair 
outcome has occurred, which in this specific instance would be whether PayPal 
offered credit to Mr S unfairly. This outcome isnt dependent on whether Mr S met 
PayPals stated criteria that successful account applicants must be employed  a 
criteria which PayPal have the right to change at their discretion  but rather is 
dependent on whether PayPal conducted reasonable and proportionate checks into 
the affordability of the credit account for Mr S, given their understanding of Mr Ss 
financial position at that time.
As such, while it could be argued that a homemaker, by definition, is unemployed, 
and that this means that Mr S didnt meet PayPals stated criteria of being employed 
at the point of application, it doesnt follow from this that this service would consider 
that PayPal acted unfairly by approving Mr S for the credit account. And this is 
because the criteria that this service uses to assess whether a credit account has been offered to a customer fairly doesnt include  as a critical factor  whether that 
customer is employed or not.
Indeed, it can be the case that this service would consider that its fair and 
reasonable for a business to offer credit to an unemployed applicant, if the 
circumstances of that application and the amount of credit being offered to the 
customer warrant the offer of credit. And I think that thats the case in this instance.
One reason I say this is because the £400 amount of credit for which Mr S was first
approved by PayPal was relatively low. This means that had Mr S used the full 
amount of credit available to him on the account, the level of minimum monthly 
payment required on the account would also be relatively low.
And I feel that the picture that PayPal obtained of Mr Ss financial circumstances at 
the time of the credit application  including that he had a monthly income of at least 
£1,500 and that Mr Ss credit file appears to demonstrate that he wasnt struggling to 
meet his existing credit commitments at that time or that he was in financial difficulty 
 means that it was reasonable for PayPal to have approved Mr Ss credit account 
application and to have issued him with a credit account with a £400 credit limit.
At the time of the first credit limit increase on the account  from £400 to £650 in 
October 2017  PayPal have confirmed that they assessed Mr Ss historical 
management of the credit account to that point and also obtained updated 
information from a credit reference agency to refresh their understanding of Mr Ss 
wider financial position.
Having reviewed the statements of Mr Ss PayPal credit account for the months 
leading up to the first credit limit increase, its evident that that balance of the account 
was being maintained significantly below the credit limit of £400 and that payments 
were made to the account on a monthly basis that were significantly higher than the 
minimum payments that were due on the account. Furthermore, it appears from Mr 
Ss credit file that Mr S wasnt struggling to manage his other existing credit 
commitments at that time, and there appears to be no indicators of potential financial 
difficulty.
Considering these points, it seems reasonable to me that PayPal would have 
assessed that Mr S wasnt likely to have been in any financial difficulty at that time 
such that the credit limit increase to £650 would be unaffordable for him. As such, Im 
satisfied that PayPal didnt act unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr S by offering and 
then implementing the credit limit increase to £650.
However, at the time of the second credit limit increase on the account  from £650 
to £1,150  which took place in August 2019, Im not convinced that the information 
that PayPal assessed when considering the credit limit increase reasonably 
supported PayPals decision to offer that credit limit increase.
One reason I say this is because of the figure of £1,150 to which the credit limit was
increased was significantly higher than the initial credit limit of £400 for which Mr S 
was originally approved. And it doesnt appear that PayPal contacted Mr S to refresh 
their understanding of his monthly income  information which had been gathered 
approximately three years previously  before offering this credit limit increase.
Additionally, having reviewed the statements on the account in the months leading up 
to the second credit limit increase, its evident that it was no longer the case that Mr S 
was maintaining the account balance significantly below the credit limit, but rather that the balance of the account was consistently close to the credit limit and that Mr S 
had incurred an over-limit fee in one of the months prior to the credit limit increase. 
Finally, Mr Ss credit file also demonstrates a missed payment on one of this other 
external credit accounts around that time.
As such, I do feel that, at the time of the second credit limit increase, the information 
that PayPal had available to them about Mr Ss account management and his wider 
financial position, as well as the length of time that had passed since PayPal had 
confirmed Mr Ss monthly income, meant that PayPal should have undertaken further 
checks into Mr Ss financial position before offering the credit limit increase to £1,150.
Furthermore, had PayPal conduced further checks  which most likely should have 
included contacting Mr S directly  I feel that certain aspects of Mr Ss personal and 
financial circumstances about which PayPal were at that time unaware, including that 
Mr S struggled with mental health issues and struggled to manage his finances at 
that time  would have become apparent to PayPal such that they should reasonably 
have considered that the credit limit increase to £1,150 might not be affordable for  
Mr S.
Im aware that Mr S feels that his mental health issues mean that PayPal shouldnt 
have offered any of the instances of credit that they did to him. I can appreciate      
Mr Ss position here, but this service wouldnt hold a business accountable for not 
acting on information that it hadnt been made aware of, and I cant see that Mr S 
made PayPal aware of his mental health issues prior to the initial credit account 
approval or later credit limit increases.
However, as explained, I do feel that the second credit limit increase shouldnt have 
been offered by PayPal, and it follows from this that I will be provisionally upholding 
this complaint in Mr Ss favour on that basis only.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr S and PayPal the opportunity to provide any 
comments or further information they might wish me to consider before I moved to a final 
decision. Mr Ss representative confirmed that they were happy to accept my provisional 
decision, while PayPal did not respond.
As such, I see no reason not to issue a final decision in line with my provisional decision 
described above, and I can confirm that my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in         
Mr Ss favour on the basis explained in my provisional decision.
  
Putting things right
PayPal must reimburse to Mr Ss account all interest, fees, and charges accrued or incurred 
on the account for the balance above £650 from the point of the second credit limit increase 
in August 2019 onwards.
If these reimbursements result in the account having a credit balance in Mr Ss favour, this 
balance must be paid to Mr S along with 8% simple interest calculated to the date of 
repayment.
If the reimbursements result in Mr Ss account having a balance outstanding for repayment 
to PayPal by Mr S, PayPal must contact Mr S and arrange a suitable interest free repayment 
plan based on Mr Ss income and expenditure information at that time.
PayPal must remove all adverse reporting from Mr Ss credit file regarding this account from 
the point of the second credit limit increase in August 2019 onwards.Finally, PayPal must make a payment of £100 to Mr S to compensate him for the trouble and 
upset this matter has caused. This payment may not take the form of a credit to Mr Ss  
PayPal credit account unless Mr S gives his permission for it to do so.
  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA on 
the basis outlined above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 December 2021.
