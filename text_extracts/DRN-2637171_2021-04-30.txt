The complaint
Mr E is unhappy with National Westminster Bank Plcs handling of his credit card account 
and the subsequent service he received.  
What happened
Mr E had a credit card with NatWest, which he paid off in full in May 2020, a few days after 
receiving his May statement. He then asked for the credit card account to be closed in early 
June 2020. 
Mr Es June statement was generated a few days after he had requested the account to be 
closed. Interest was applied to this statement and the account had an outstanding balance of 
£4.42. As Mr E had cancelled his direct debit, NatWest werent able to collect this balance, 
and a SMS message was sent to Mr E in early July. This confirmed there was a balance to 
pay. 
Mr E wasnt sure the message was genuine, so he called NatWest to discuss it. He was told 
there wasnt an outstanding balance and to ignore the message. 
A month later, Mr E received a letter from NatWest explaining that hed missed a payment 
and that a late payment fee had been added to his account. Mr E called NatWest to 
complain at this point. 
Following this complaint, Mr E had several more reasons to continue to complain to NatWest 
about the service he was receiving. The issues were:
Mr E received two cheques for £50 with no explanation what they were for;
Mr E had spent a long time on the telephone to NatWest trying to sort the problems 
out;
He wanted the compensation offers to be transferred to his NatWest account, rather 
than by cheque;
He had been passed from person to person at NatWest without any explanation;
His Subject Access Request (DSAR) hadnt been provided on time.
NatWest responded to Mr E and accepted they had made errors when dealing with him, 
starting from the initial telephone call Mr E had with their call handler to discuss the message 
hed received about the outstanding balance. NatWest apologised and offered Mr E 
compensation of £250, along with £33.50 to cover his telephone call costs. They also waived 
the outstanding balance, added a notice to his account to prevent this happening again and 
removed the late payment marker from Mr Es credit file. 
While the complaint was being looked at by NatWest, Mr E received information hed asked 
for in response to his DSAR. Within this, NatWest provided information pertaining to another 
customer of theirs. Mr E complained again, and NatWest used the same complaint reference 
as before. They apologised again to Mr E and paid him compensation of £250. This brought 
his total compensation to £500, along with the £33.50 for his telephone call costs. 
Mr E wasnt satisfied with this and brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator 
didnt uphold it. He said it was clear that NatWest had accepted their errors, but it wasnt 
clear that Mr E had suffered any financial detriment as a result. So, he said he thought the 
compensation already paid was reasonable. 
Mr E didnt agree. He thought he should be entitled to more compensation.
As Mr E hasnt agreed, its been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear from NatWests response to Mr Es numerous complaints that they accept they 
should have communicated things much better to Mr E. And its clear they accept he was 
given incorrect information throughout the complaints that he brought. So, all I need to 
decide is whether their total compensation of £500, along with the additional call costs of 
£33.50 is fair. And in this case, I think it is. 
There is no dispute that Mr E should have been given the correct information as soon as he 
called NatWest in July 2020 to query the SMS message he had received. Whilst the call 
wasnt handled by NatWests credit card team, I expect their call handler to have noticed it 
was a credit card account being discussed, and to make sure the query was dealt with by 
the correct department. That could have avoided many of the subsequent issues Mr E 
experienced. 
But Im not aware of any financial detriment caused to Mr E as a result of NatWests errors 
and poor communication. He has confirmed to our investigator that he hasnt checked his 
credit report as he expects NatWest to make the required amendments. This suggests Mr E 
hasnt lost out financially as a result of the late payment marker being added. 
Mr E has had to make more telephone calls than expected to try and sort out the many 
errors made by NatWest, and Im sure that has caused him inconvenience. But Im satisfied 
the compensation paid to him along with the costs incurred for his telephone calls is 
reasonable.
I wont be asking NatWest to do anything more. My final decision
For the reasons above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 May 2021.
