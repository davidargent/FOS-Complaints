The complaint
Mr A complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) is asking for proof of identity
and residence from him and refuse to close his account without it.
What happened
In January 2020, PayPal reviewed Mr As account and subsequently placed a limitation on it. 
PayPal asked Mr A to provide it with proof of his identity and address.
Mr A refused to provide this information. Mr A says hes had the account since 2008 and 
wasnt required to provide this information during that time  so questions why its being 
asked for now. Mr A adds that hes not comfortable sharing his personal information with 
PayPal, and simply wants it to close the account which he rarely uses.
Mr A also says PayPal mentioned suspicious payment activity which its not given much 
more information about.
Unhappy Mr A complained. PayPal did not uphold Mr As complaint. In summary it said, as a 
regulated financial business its required to collect and verify certain information about its 
customers. Which includes getting information to meet its customer identification and due 
diligence obligations.
PayPal added that it could not remove the account limitation, and thereby close the account, 
until this information was provided by Mr A.
Mr A referred his complaint to this service. One of our Investigators looked into it. In short, 
they said PayPal may ask for identity validation documents, but it faced little risk by closing 
Mr As account without them. So PayPal should close the account without Mr A giving it the 
documents it asked for. 
As PayPal didnt agree, Mr As complaint was passed to me to decide. I then sent both 
parties my provisional decision and set a deadline for responses. For ease of reference, this 
is what I said: 
Provisional decision  what I said I was planning to decide 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im planning on not upholding this complaint. I know this will disappoint 
Mr A, so Ill explain why.
Our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may treat evidence from regulated 
businesses, like PayPal, as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if it contains 
security information, or commercially sensitive information. Some of the information PayPal 
has provided is information that we consider should be kept confidential.
Regulated businesses in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order 
to meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need to 
restrict customers accounts.
Ive seen PayPals reasons for reviewing and subsequently placing a restriction on Mr As 
account. Having done so, Im satisfied its acted both in line with the terms of its account, and 
in line with obligations placed on it.
That means Im satisfied it hasnt done anything wrong in reviewing and restricting Mr As 
account.
This brings me onto the crux of Mr As complaint. That is, he shouldnt have to provide 
PayPal with his proof of identity and address given hes had the account since 2008 without 
the need to do so previously. And that PayPal should close his account upon his instruction, 
and not leave it open.
Id like to assure Mr A that Ive very carefully considered everything he has said about this, 
even if I havent explicitly set it out here. But based on the information Ive been given by 
PayPal, Im persuaded it is acting in line with the terms of the account, and in line with the 
legal and regulatory obligations it must adhere to.
Im also satisfied its acting fairly and reasonably by asking Mr A to provide proof of his 
identity and address before removing the account limitation, and then closing the account.
I can understand if my decision may seem impractical and unpragmatic given Mr A doesnt 
use the account much, wants to close it, and hasnt been required to provide this information 
before. But in weighing up what I think is proper in the circumstances of this complaint, Im 
satisfied PayPal has a legitimate basis to request the information it has, and that its actions 
here are proportionate.
Mr A will undoubtedly want to know what information PayPal has given to me that Im relying 
on to reach my decision. But neither PayPal, nor I, are under any obligation, that Im aware 
of, to do so.
So, it follows that if Mr A wants his account closed, he should provide the information PayPal 
is asking for. PayPal has said it would like to reassure Mr A it has appropriate systems to 
ensure his information is protected. And that, any information provided is only disclosed 
internally to teammates with the necessary authority/reason to access such information. It is 
not disclosed to unauthorised third parties.
Lastly, and for the sake of completeness, Im satisfied the ancillary complaint point about 
PayPal sending Mr A an email was a phishing attempt likely carried out by fraudsters. 
PayPal have confirmed the email wasnt sent by it
The deadline for responses to my provisional decision have now passed. PayPal hasnt 
responded. Mr A does not agree, some of the key points he makes are: 
- He questions how two people at this service can have differing opinions
- By not explaining the reasons for PayPals actions, the Ombudsman is not being 
impartial 
- The volume of emails received amounted to bullying, not merely phishing attempts. 
And they stopped once this service was involved with the complaint - Mr A has no intention of giving PayPal his personal photographic evidence. But 
surely, this service can get PayPal to agree that his account will not be accessible to 
anyone but him  should he provide the information requested
As both parties have had an opportunity to submit their responses, and the deadline has 
passed, I will now decide this complaint.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mr As complaint. Ive done so based on the 
reasons Id given in my provisional decision  as above. But Ive also considered what Mr A 
has said in his most recent response. 
Firstly, when a complaint is passed for decision to an Ombudsman, a fresh review of the 
complaint is undertaken. As this stage of our process is a fresh review, and the Ombudsman 
does so independently, its not uncommon for them to reach a different outcome to one that 
may have gone before it. Thats what has happened here  I do not agree with what our 
Investigator said.  
I already explained why we choose to keep some information confidential, for ease here is 
what I said: 
Our rules allow us to receive evidence in confidence. We may treat evidence from regulated 
businesses, like PayPal, as confidential for a number of reasons  for example, if it contains 
security information, or commercially sensitive information. Some of the information PayPal 
has provided is information that we consider should be kept confidential
Given PayPal, nor I, are under no obligation, I still think its reasonable to not explain why 
PayPal took the actions it did. Im sorry Mr A finds this position inflammatory and biased. Id 
like to assure him that is not the case here. 
As I said in my provisional decision, I am satisfied the emails Mr A complains about were not 
sent from PayPal  but were most likely phishing attempts by fraudsters to acquire 
information illegally and through deception. As such, given what Ive seen, PayPal cannot be 
held responsible for them. 
Mr A is concerned PayPal may divulge his account details to third parties. PayPal are 
required to adhere to rules and regulations. This will include any data protection legislation 
applicable to it. In short, these rules set-out what PayPal must do to protect its customers 
personal data. 
My final decision
For the reasons above, and those contained in my provisional decision, I have decided not 
to uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2023.
