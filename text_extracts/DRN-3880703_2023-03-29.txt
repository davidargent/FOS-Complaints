DRN-3880703
The complaint
Mr H complains that Nationwide Building Society made inappropriate comments in a final 
response letter it sent to him.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. 
Instead, I will focus on the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In a final response letter to a complaint raised by Mr H, Nationwide commented that he had 
made five other complaints over the previous seven months. Mr H feels this was not relevant 
to the complaint he was making.
Nationwide has said it commented on Mr Hs previous complaints as it was concerned that 
he had been unhappy on so many occasions with the service it had provided. Im satisfied 
that this is a reasonable explanation for why Nationwide said what it did. And overall, Im 
satisfied that Nationwides comments were made out of genuine concern that Mr H was so 
unhappy with its service. It follows that I do not consider Nationwide has treated Mr H 
unfairly by commenting on his previous complaints. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2023.
