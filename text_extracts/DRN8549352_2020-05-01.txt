K820x#14Complaint
Mr Ls unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt fund his account with £32,985  he 
expected to receive. Hed like National Westminster Bank  Plc to pay him the remaining  
amount. 
Background
In April 2018 Mr L was due to receive a payment of £32,985 from a business in Tanzania, 
which didnt arrive. Instead this payment was credited to another customers  account  and 
after arrival a large amount of the funds were  withdrawn, before NatWest  restricted the 
account. The bank  managed to recover £17,332 which  was returned to the sending  bank.
Mr L complained to NatWest and said that he didnt receive his £32,985 and they should  
have ensured he received  all of his funds, and not credited it to the wrong account.
NatWest didnt uphold  Mr Ls complaint.  They explained that Mr L had unfortunately been 
the victim of the scam  and the account  number where the money was sent wasnt Mr Ls. 
NatWest identified this the transfer  as suspicious and managed to recover  just over £17,000 
of the funds, but said for Mr L to recover the remaining funds hell need  to speak to the 
sending bank. 
One of our investigators  looked into Mr Ls complaint and didnt think NatWest needed to do 
anything further.  Mr L responded to say hed spoken to NatWest  in June 2018 and theyd 
informed him at this point  the money was in a safe account. Our investigator responded to 
say they can see the money credited the fraudsters account on the 24 April 2018  and 
NatWest had no record of any conversations  that took place in June 2018.  
Mr L didnt accept our investigators  opinion. In summary he said:
-The money wasnt received by NatWest until the 24 June 2018.
-If it was received in April 2018 why did NatWest let him believe the money was still 
available in June  2018.
-NatWest have failed  with their duty of care and caused him damage to his personal 
reputation, inconvenience and distress.
As Mr L didnt agree  its been passed  to me for a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And in doing so Ive reached the same 
conclusion as our investigator  for broadly the same  reasons. 
Mr Ls unhappy that NatWest didnt recover £32,985 which was sent to him. When  looking at 
the £32,985 I have to consider whether the funds were actually Mr Ls  or in fact belonged 
to the sender. And then what  that means  for NatWests responsibilities to Mr L.
Ive seen evidence  from NatWest for the account details of where the £32,985 was sent on 
the 24 April 2018   and on reviewing this Im satisfied that these werent Mr Ls details. And 
Ive seen evidence  to show the funds  were credited to the account listed.  NatWest  were 
Ref: DRN85493522under an obligation to fund another payees  account, and Im satisfied they fulfilled that 
obligation.  
As our investigator explained as NatWest credited the money to the correct account, and 
Mr L isnt the intended  beneficiary according  to the payment instruction or the remitter of the 
funds Im satisfied NatWest fulfilled their obligations. I appreciate Mr L says he was the 
intended beneficiary of the funds, but unfortunately Mr L isnt eligible to complain about  
NatWests actions in recovering  the senders funds as he wasnt   when looking strictly at 
what was recorded  on the payment instruction note  the recorded beneficiary of the funds. 
Mr L argued that he spoke with NatWest in June 2018  and they advised him that the 
payment hadnt  been received by the bank  at this point. NatWest  havent been able to find 
any record of this call  but even if this did take place as Ive already explained I wouldnt be 
able to hold NatWest responsible for Mr Ls loss of funds, as Im satisfied NatWest carried 
out whats expected of them in crediting  the funds to the account identified  on the payment 
instruction. 
I realise Mr Ls very frustrated by what happened, and I understand why that would be the 
case but this isnt something I can hold NatWest responsible for. Id recommend if Mr L 
believes hes still owed the remaining  funds  then he may want to consider contacting  the 
sending business  to explore reissuing of the payment. 
My final decision
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 June 2019.
