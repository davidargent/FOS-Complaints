The complaint
Mr S complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money unfairly terminated 
his loan and recorded a default on his credit file. 
What happened
Mr S had a loan with 118 118 Money and has explained that his income was impacted due 
to the pandemic. As a result, Mr S loan fell into arrears. 
Mr S spoke with 118 118 Money and discussed the option of a payment holiday. But the 
request was turned down as Mr S wasnt employed at the time and didnt meet the criteria. 
In May 2021 118 118 Money sent Mr S a Notice of Default that asked him to make a 
payment towards the arrears by the middle of June 2021. But no payment was received so 
118 118 Money took the step of terminating the loan agreement and recording a default on 
Mr S credit file. 
Mr S later agreed to make payments towards the outstanding debt. But Mr S raised a 
complaint after finding the loan had been defaulted. 118 118 Money didnt agree it had acted 
unfairly by closing the loan and recording a default. 
An investigator at this service looked at Mr S complaint. They thought 118 118  Money had 
dealt with Mr S complaint fairly and didnt ask it to amend his credit file. Mr S asked to 
appeal, so his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see Mr S told 118 118 Money he was unemployed and without any income between 
January and July 2021. Mr S and 118 118 Money did speak during this period. And, as Ive 
noted above, Mr S asked if it was possible to take a payment holiday. 118 118 Money didnt 
approve the payment holiday as Mr S circumstances meant he didnt meet the criteria. But it 
did agree to place his account on hold. Im satisfied thats fair in the circumstances. 
Collections activity was placed on hold in January and March 2021 but arrears continued to 
accrue. When the collections hold ended in May 2021 118 118 Money reviewed the account 
history and took the decision to send a default notice to Mr S. Im satisfied that 118 118 
Money offered positive and sympathetic support to Mr S. However, Im also satisfied the 
arrears position in May 2021 was sufficient for 118 118 Money to take the decision to give 
warning of its intention to close the loan and apply a default in May 2021. The default notice 
confirmed Mr S needed to make a substantial payment to avoid closure but none was 
received. That meant the loan was closed and default recorded. Im sorry to disappoint Mr S 
but I havent been persuaded it was unfair for 118 118 Money to default his loan account. 
When Mr S spoke with 118 118 Money after he returned to work his loan had already closed. 
I agree that 118 118 Money couldve made the situation clearer. But I havent found that 
impacted the overall situation or decision to close Mr S loan and record a default. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr S but as Im satisfied 118 118 Money dealt with his complaint 
fairly Im not telling it to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr S complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 October 2022.
