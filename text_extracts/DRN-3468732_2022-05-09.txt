The complaint
Mr D is unhappy that NewDay Ltd didnt set up payment holidays on his accounts when he
first requested them and that NewDay then reported missed payments on his account to the
credit reference agencies. Mr D is also unhappy that NewDay later defaulted his accounts
for non-payment whilst he was disputing the amount outstanding on the accounts.
What happened
Mr D had two credit accounts and one loan account with NewDay. In March 2020, Mr D sent
an email to NewDay advising that he was temporarily unable to work because of the impact
of the Covid-19 pandemic and requesting three-month payment holidays on his accounts.
NewDay responded to Mr D and advised that the identity verification (IDV) information that
Mr D had provided in the email wasnt sufficient for the email request to have passed
security and be actioned, and NewDay requested further IDV information because of this.
Mr D wasnt happy that NewDay hadnt accepted his IDV information, especially as the April
2020 payment due date on his accounts had now passed, meaning that NewDay were now
reporting those payments as being missed. So, he raised a complaint.
NewDay looked at Mr Ds complaint and acknowledged that had they looked at the
information they held on all of Mr Ds accounts, rather than just one, that there had been
enough IDV information in the initial email that Mr D had sent for him to have passed
security such that the payment holiday requests should have been actioned.
NewDay apologised to Mr D for this, and they agreed to set up payment holidays on all three
of his accounts  starting 8 April, 1 May, and 11 May 2020 respectively. NewDay also
agreed to remove the adverse credit reporting from Mr Ds credit file for April 2020, and
reimbursed some interest and charges to Mr Ds account, as well as made a payment of £50
to Mr W to compensate him for the trouble and upset hed incurred.
Mr D wasnt satisfied with NewDays response and didnt feel that all his concerns had been
addressed. Mr D also felt that the balances of his accounts remained incorrect and
continued to dispute these with NewDay.
The three-month payment holidays came into effect on all three accounts, and as the end of
these payment holidays approached, NewDay sent letters to Mr D advising him of this and
confirming when the payments on his accounts would resume.
When the three-month payment holidays ended, NewDay didnt hear from Mr D to arrange
the resumption of his payments. And because NewDay considered the accounts to have
been in a state of arrears when the payment holidays had started, NewDay sent default
notices to Mr D in August 2020 which stated the arrears on each account and also when
these arrears needed to be cleared by in order for the account to avoid being defaulted.
Mr D didnt make the payments necessary to clear the arrears within the time given by the
default notices, and so NewDay defaulted Mr Ds accounts for non-payment in September
2020. The defaulted accounts were later sold by NewDay to third-party companies.
Around the time that the time that the accounts were defaulted, NewDay wrote to Mr D
again, having reopened his complaint, and confirmed that further credit file amendments had
been made for his accounts to remove any adverse information that had been reported by
NewDay for the months of May, June, and July. NewDay also acknowledged that their
communication with Mr D about his accounts could have been clearer, and so they
apologised to Mr D for this and made an additional compensation payment of £65 to him.
Mr D wasnt happy with how NewDay had managed and defaulted his accounts, so he
referred his complaint to this service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But
while they acknowledged that NewDay had made errors in how it had handled Mr Ds
accounts, they felt that the corrective action that NewDay had undertaken, as well as the
compensation NewDay had paid, already represented a fair and reasonable resolution to
what had taken place.
Additionally, because Mr D hadnt made any payments towards his accounts following the
end of the payment holidays, our investigator felt that it was fair and reasonable that
NewDay defaulted the accounts.
Mr D remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 25 March 2022 as follows:
Having considered all of the information available to me here, I feel that NewDay
didnt handle Mr Ds request for payment holidays as they should have done 
including how NewDay later set up the payment holidays and considered the
outstanding balances of Mr Ds accounts  and I will be provisionally upholding this
aspect of Mr Ds complaint and instructing NewDay to pay further compensation to
Mr D as a result.
However, while I can appreciate that Mr D may have disputed the amounts listed by
NewDay as being outstanding on his accounts, this dispute doesnt absolve Mr D of
the responsibility to have made ongoing payments to the accounts. And because Mr
D didnt make any payments to the accounts following the end of the payment
holidays set up by NewDay, I dont feel that it was unfair or unreasonable for
NewDay to ultimately default the accounts for non-payment as they did. I will now
address each of these points in turn.
Mr Ds request for payment holidays on the accounts
NewDay have acknowledged that the email they first received from Mr D on 28
March 2020 did include sufficient IDV information for the email to have passed
security  had NewDay attempted to verify this information against all of Mr Ds
accounts rather than just one account, on which Mr D hadnt updated his address
details.
As such, I dont feel that its in disputing that when NewDay did eventually
acknowledge Mr Ds email request as having passed security, that they should haveset up three-month payment holidays on Mr Ds accounts backdated to the beginning
of April 2020. Indeed, I note that in NewDays correspondence with this service, they
state that the further amendments that NewDay made to Mr Ds credit file was done
in order to put Mr D in the position that he should have been in had NewDay actioned
his payment holiday requests when they were first received in March 2020.
But NewDay dont appear to have put Mr Ds accounts in the position that they
should have been in here, and instead set up payment holidays on two of Mr Ds
accounts which started in May 2020, meaning that the April 2020 payments on those
accounts were considered as being missed.
This meant that NewDay considered that these accounts were already in a state of
arrears when they entered the three-month payment holidays that NewDay set up.
And having his accounts fall into arrears such as this was exactly what Mr D was
trying to avoid when he made the payment holiday requests to NewDay in March
2020.
Confusingly, NewDay also agreed to remove the adverse credit reporting on Mr Ds
accounts for April 2020. As such it appears that NewDay were reporting to the credit
reference agencies that Mr D wasnt in arears for the month on April 2020, while they
themselves did consider Mr D to be in arrears for that month.
Additionally, because NewDay considered Mr Ds accounts to be a state of arrears
before, and therefore during, the three-month payment holidays, this meant that
when the payment holiday period ended, NewDay still considered the accounts to be
in arrears  which resulted in NewDay beginning default proceedings on these
accounts more quickly than should have been the case had the accounts not been
considered in arrears at that time.
Ultimately, I feel that NewDay should have ensured that the payment holidays that
they set up on Mr Ds accounts were backdated to cover the April, May, and June
payments that were due on those accounts. And by not doing this, Im satisfied that
NewDay have caused a degree of distress and inconvenience for Mr D that should
reasonably have been avoided.
Mr D has confirmed to this service that he found trying to communicate with NewDay
at this time to be very frustrating, and Im satisfied that Mr D did make ongoing
reasonable efforts to explain to NewDay why he disputed the balances of his
accounts, albeit without success. And in consideration of these points, I will be
provisionally upholding this aspect of Mr Ds complaint and instructing NewDay to
pay Mr D a further £450 compensation, above that which theyve already paid, which
I feel more fairly reflects the amount of trouble and upset that Mr D incurred.
NewDays defaulting of the accounts
Had Mr D resumed the contractual payments that became due again on his accounts
when the payment holidays came to an end, then I would almost certainly be finding
entirely in his favour here. However, Mr D didnt resume making these payments, and
while I can understand that Mr D was in continuing dispute with NewDay for the
reasons outlined above, this doesnt absolve him of the responsibility to have made
the monthly payments to the accounts that were due.
And because Mr D didnt make the payments that were due on the accounts, I find it
difficult to conclude anything other than that NewDay acted fairly and reasonably by
ultimately defaulting these accounts for non-payment. And as such I wont beupholding this aspect of Mr Ds complaint.
As explained above, I do feel that NewDay made errors in how they managed these
accounts, including that NewDay considered the accounts to be in arrears when they
entered and exited the payment holidays, which I dont feel should have been the
case. But as also explained, I dont feel that these errors fairly warrant the removal of
the defaults that NewDay have reported here.
Had it been the case that NewDay did apply the payment holidays to begin in April
2020, so that no arrears were considered to have accrued on the accounts before
they entered the payment holidays, this would have meant that Mr D would have
needed to have resume his payments in July 2020. Consequently, this would have
meant that NewDay could have begun default proceedings  which in many cases
can reasonably begin when three months of arrears have accrued on an account  in
October 2020, such that I feel that the accounts could have reasonably been
defaulted by NewDay shortly afterwards.
Mr Ds accounts were defaulted by NewDay in September 2020, which is a few
months earlier than I feel should reasonably have been the case. Because of this, I
wont be instructing NewDay to amend the dates of default on the accounts, and this
is because the dates of default that currently stand are earlier than any amended
default dates would be, meaning that the current defaults will cease being reported
on Mr Ds credit file sooner than would be the case if amendments were made 
which is to Mr Ds benefit.
Summary
I will be provisionally upholding this complaint in Mr Ds favour on the limited basis
that NewDay didnt fairly manage his request for payment holidays on his three
accounts, and I am instructing NewDay to pay Mr D a further £450 compensation for
this reason.
However, given that Mr D didnt make the payments that became due on his account
when the payment holidays ended, I dont feel that NewDay acted unfairly by
following the subsequent process that they did, including the eventual defaulting of
those accounts.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr D and NewDay the opportunity to provide
any comments or new information they might wish me to consider before I moved to a final
decision. Both Mr D and NewDay did provide points for me to consider, and this led me to 
issuing an updated provisional decision letter on 13 April 2022.
In their response to my initial provisional decision letter, NewDay explained that while they 
understood why I was provisionally upholding the service aspect of this complaint, they felt 
that the additional compensation amount of £450 I had provisionally instructed was too high 
and expressed concern that it might set a precedent for similar awards moving forwards.
I responded to this point as follows:
I can appreciate NewDays concerns here, and Id like to reassure them that this 
service doesnt instruct compensation on the basis of precedent. Rather, each 
complaint is assessed  and each instruction of compensation is issued  on the 
individual merits of that complaint. This includes an assessment of the impact of the 
complaint on the customer.In this instance, Ive considered the ongoing nature of this issue and the number of 
times Mr D attempted to communicate with NewDay about it. Ive also considered Mr 
Ds detailed testimony to this service in which he explains how the ongoing nature of 
this issue became more and more stressful and frustrating for him to deal with. And 
in consideration of these points I continue to feel that Mr D has incurred a significant 
amount of unnecessary distress and inconvenience here, and as such I will be 
continuing to provisionally instruct a further compensation payment of £450.
In his response to my initial provisional decision, Mr D acknowledged that he didnt make 
any payments towards his accounts when the payment holidays ended but questioned how 
he was supposed to make payments towards the accounts, given that he was in dispute 
about the account balances.
I responded to Mr Ds point as follows:
I can appreciate Mr Ds position here, to a degree. But the fact that Mr D disputed the
account balances didnt absolve him of the responsibility to make payments towards 
the accounts, regardless of whether he felt the amount of the payments that NewDay 
were requesting were correct or not.
If it were the case that Mr D had made payments towards the accounts to the 
amounts that he reasonably felt was owed on each of them, then I might have taken 
a different view here. But Mr D made no payments towards the accounts following 
the end of the payment holidays, and so I remain satisfied that it was fair for NewDay 
to have followed the collections processes that they did, which ultimately led to the 
defaulting of the accounts.
Mr D also questioned the dates of the defaults on his accounts, and noted that rather than 
being defaulted in September 2020  as I had referenced in my initial provisional decision
letter  the accounts were actually defaulted in November 2020 and January 2021. 
It was this point about the default dates led me to change my position on this complaint 
slightly, and I responded to this point as follows:
In my provisional decision letter, I explained that had the payment holidays been set 
up as I felt they should have been, that NewDay could have reasonably begun 
default proceedings in October 2020, and that the accounts could have been 
defaulted by NewDay shortly after.
I note that one of Mr Ds accounts was defaulted by NewDay on 30 November 2020, 
with the other two accounts both defaulted on 31 January 2021.
The November 2020 default date seems reasonable here and is in line with what I 
would I feel should have been the case. However, the January 2021 date seems 
somewhat late, and so I will be updating my provisional instruction to include that 
NewDay must amend the default dates of these two accounts so that they also show 
as having been defaulted on 30 November 2020. This also has the effect of aligning 
the three accounts, which I feel should have been the case had they all benefited 
from the payment holidays that I remain satisfied they should have.
In this second provisional decision letter, I again gave both Mr D and NewDay the 
opportunity to provide any comments or new information they might wish me to consider 
before I moved to a final decision. NewDay confirmed that they had nothing further to add, 
and while Mr D did reiterate his disagreement surrounding his not resuming payments on the 
account following the end of the payment holiday, he hasnt provided any new information 
that leads me to consider revising my position on this point.As such, I can confirm that my final decision here is that I am upholding this complaint in Mr 
Ds favour on the basis as outlined in my second provisional decision letter.
Putting things right
NewDay must amend the default dates of two of Mr Ds accounts so that all three accounts 
show as having been defaulted on 30 November 2020.
NewDay must also make a further payment of £450 to Mr D to compensate him for the 
trouble and upset that hes incurred. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 June 2022.
