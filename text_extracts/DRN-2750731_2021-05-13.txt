The complaint
Mr A complains that Vanquis Bank Limited (Vanquis) lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr A applied for a credit card from Vanquis in January 2016. This was agreed with a limit of 
£250. There were subsequent increases as shown:
Date Old Limit New Limit
January 2016 New card £250
May 2016 £250 £500
November 2016 £500 £1250
April 2020 £1250 £2250
Mr A complained that Vanquis didnt lend to him responsibly. Vanquis increased his limits 
and he couldnt manage the higher amount of debt. He said he was always close to the limit. 
Hed used cash withdrawals. He had other debts on other cards.
Vanquis disagreed. They said hed passed their credit checks for the new card and 
subsequent increases in limits. When the card was first approved, Mr A said his income was 
£24,000 per annum. He had no County Court Judgements (CCJs) but did have a defaulted 
account 11 months before. Other debts were £300. When the limits were then increased, 
there were no CCJs or newly defaulted accounts. Other debts had increased to £4,128 in 
May 2016, but then decreased to £3,172 in April 2020.
Mr A brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said that Vanquis had acted done the 
necessary and proportionate checks at each stage. Initially, he considered that the final 
increase to £2,250 in April 2020 was irresponsible, but after further consideration and 
feedback from Vanquis, he decided that this was also OK.
Mr A asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
All lenders have an obligation to lend money responsibly. We have to check whether 
Vanquis acted in line within the Financial Conducts (FCA) rules on creditworthiness 
assessment as set out in its handbook, (CONC) section 5.2. These say that a firm must 
undertake a reasonable assessment of creditworthiness, considering both the risk to it of the 
customer not making the repayments, as well as the risk to the customer of not being able to 
make repayments. We look at:
Whether the lender completed reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that the borrower would be able to repay any credit in a sustainable way?
If reasonable and proportionate checks were completed, did the lender make a fair 
lending decision made bearing in mind the information gathered and what the lender 
knew about the borrowers circumstances?
When Mr A applied for the card in January 2016, he said his income was £24,000 per 
annum. And  there were no signs of difficulties with other debts. There were no CCJs. 
There was a defaulted account  11 months before  so I agree that it was fine to give Mr A 
a card with its low credit limit of £250.
For the increase in limit to £500 in May 2016, other (non-mortgage) debt had gone down to 
£286. Borrowing against Mr As limit was only 74% and hed met the monthly payments. 
For the increase to £1,250 in November 2016, other (non-mortgage) debt had gone up to 
£1,953. But Mr As use of the limit was still modest  61% over the previous three months. 
And hed made the payments each month.
So  the issue of the card and first two increases in limit were OK.
The last increase to £2,250  is a more finely balanced judgement. I say that because Mr As 
external debts had increased to £4,295, and hed used 95% of the limit in the pervious three 
months. He was making monthly payments OK, but the amount of them had reduced to only 
1.5 times the minimum amount needed  theyd been a lot more previously. So  there were 
some signs that he was starting to struggle. So  Ive considered this increase closely. 
Ive looked at Mr As statements. And throughout 2018 and 2019, he was consistently 
borrowing up to the limit each month, and in several months he went over them. And  hed 
made several cash withdrawals (about one every two months)  typically, a sign of 
difficulties. But equally, in the six months before April 2020, Mr As debt was consistently 
below the previous limit of £1,250. And he made more than the minimum payments each 
month  and hadnt missed any. 
There were some defaults showing on other debts  but the most recent one was 20 months 
before. Mr A showed us his credit file. He had three other cards with limits totalling £6,050. 
This was quite a lot  but he was paying them successfully, with no missed payments 
showing. Mr A completed an income and expenditure analysis for Vanquis in March 2020  
before the increase. And this showed net monthly income of £2,100 and housing /living costs 
were £700. So  that looked OK also. Mr A told us he lost his job in January 2020. But he 
also told us he didnt tell Vanquis about that at the time. So  we cant expect them to have 
taken that into account.
So - on balance, I think Vanquis did complete reasonable and proportionate checks and 
reached a fair decision - in giving Mr A the last increase in limit to £2,250.
And so  and I can appreciate that Mr A will find this disappointing  I wont be asking 
Vanquis to do anymore here.
