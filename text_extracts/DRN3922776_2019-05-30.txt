K821x#15complaint
Miss W complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick  Quid) made short-term loans 
to her when  it shouldnt have.
background
Between July 2014 and September 2017,  Quick Quid made  19 loans and many top-ups to 
Miss W. She complained  that it hadnt  properly checked that she could afford repayment - 
which she says she couldnt.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld. She thought  Quick  Quid  
shouldnt have lent Miss W loan 4 top-up 1 to loan 19 including the associated top-ups. She 
said that the number of loans taken from loan 7 onwards  meant any information recorded 
about them  was adverse.  She recommended that Quick Quid should:
1.refund  all interest and charges that Miss W paid on loan 4 top-up 1 to loan 19 
including the associated top- ups;
2.pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
3.remove any negative information  about loan 4 top-up 1 to loan 6 from Miss Ws credit 
file;
4.remove all entries about  loan 7 onwards from Miss Ws credit  file.
*HMRC requires  Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest. If Miss W asks for a 
certificate showing how much tax Quick Quid has taken off, it should provide this. If 
Quick Quid intends  to use the refund to reduce  an amount Miss W owes,  it must do this 
after tax.
Quick Quid disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It asked for an ombudsman  to review 
the complaint.  It says in summary  that:
The Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA) guidelines CONC rule 5.2A.12R  requires 
affordability based on the consumers  ability to repay over the life of the loan, utilising 
their income and savings. 
Miss Ws income was £1,198.00 and her expenses were  just £275.00 as she was 
living with her parents.  So her normal monthly  disposable income was £923.00. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Quick Quids loans  were  high-interest loans, intended for short-term  use. Before each such 
loan, Quick Quid needed to carry out proportionate checks  to be able to understand whether  
it would  be sustainable  for Miss W. it needed  to make sure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
Ref: DRN39227762There is a range of possible  checks in terms of how much information  a lender asks for and 
what it does to verify that information. Generally, we think that the level of checks  should be 
higher if, for example,  the consumers income  was low or the amount lent was high. 
The longer  the lending  goes on, the greater the risk of it becoming unsustainable  and the 
borrower experiencing financial difficulty.  So we expect a lender to be able to show that it 
wasnt irresponsible to continue to lend.
From its records and her bank statements, Ive seen  that Quick  Quids first few loans  and 
top-ups to Miss W were  as follows:
loan No top-up No loan date loan amount (£) date loan repaid
1 29.07.14 400.00 26.08.14
2 05.09.14 300.00 23.09.14
3 12.10.14 150.00 23.10.14
4 21.11.14 200.00 23.12.14
4 1 02.12.14 350.00 23.12.14
5 23.12.14 350.00 23.01.15
6 08.02.15 150.00 23.03.15
6 1 07.03.15   50.00 23.03.15
6 2 10.03.15   75.00 23.03.15
7 12.04.15 100.00                22.05.15
7 1 20.04.15   75.00 22.05.15
Before each loan,  Quick Quid recorded Miss Ws normal  net monthly  income as £1,198.00. 
And it recorded her normal monthly  living costs, broken  down into a number of headings.  
That included Monthly Other Credit Commitments .
For loans 1 to 4 up to November  2014 Im satisfied  on balance  that Quick  Quid  had done 
proportionate checks. And I cant say that it shouldnt  have  made those loans. So I dont find 
it fair and reasonable to order Quick Quid to make any refund in respect of that lending.
But before repaying  loan 4, Miss W was asking to borrow  for the fifth consecutive month. 
The loan 4 top-up in December 2014  meant that Miss W was going to have to repay  later 
that month  about  £660.00. That was a significant proportion of her declared income. 
So I think proportionate checks  wouldve  included  enough checks to get a full picture of Miss 
Ws financial circumstances.  Such  checks mightve  included asking to see copies of payslips 
and bank statements.
From what  Ive seen much later, I find that such checks in December 2014 wouldve shown 
that Miss W wasnt  going to be able to afford  to repay loan 4 and the top-up in a sustainable  
way, that is to say without  further  short-term and high-cost borrowing. And indeed when she 
repaid loan 4 and the top-up on 23 December 2014, Miss W took out loan 5 the same day. 
So I dont  think the top-up in December 2014  was affordable for Miss W.
The subsequent pattern  was of borrowing nearly  every month  with no significant breaks until 
she repaid the lending  in December 2017  and didnt borrow  from Quick Quid again.  So I 
dont think Quick Quid shouldve made  the loan 4 top-up  or any of the later loans.
Ref: DRN39227763Therefore Ive thought about  whats fair and reasonable to put Miss W back  in the position 
she wouldve been in if Quick Quid hadnt  made that lending. I find it fair to order  Quick Quid 
to refund the interest  and fees that Miss W paid on that borrowing. I will also order  it to pay 
interest at our usual  rate.
From its records, Im satisfied that no balance is outstanding from Miss W to Quick Quid.
For the lending  from the loan 4 top-up to loan 6 (including top-ups) I will order  Quick  Quid to 
remove from Miss Ws credit file any adverse  information.  For the lending  from loan 7 to loan 
19 (including top-ups)  I think the existence of that lending  is itself adverse information, so I 
will order  Quick  Quid to remove all information  relating to that lending.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid) to:
1.in relation to the lending from the loan 4 top-up to loan 19 including any top-ups:
1.1refund  each amount of interest and charges that Miss W paid;
1.2pay Miss W simple  interest at a yearly rate of 8% on each such amount from the 
date she paid it to the date Quick  Quid refunds it. If Quick  Quid  considers that its 
required by HM Revenue  & Customs  to withhold income tax from that interest, it 
must tell Miss W how much its taken  off. It should  also give her a tax deduction 
certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue  & 
Customs if appropriate;
2.in relation to  the lending from the loan 4 top-up to loan to loan 6 including  any top-
ups, remove adverse  information from Miss Ws credit file;
3.in relation to the lending from loan 7 to loan 19 including any top-ups, remove  all 
information from Miss Ws credit file.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 June 2019.
