The complaint
Mr K complains that PayrNet Limited wont refund the money he was tricked into sending to
a PayrNet account.
Mr K has used a representative to bring his complaint. But, for ease of reading, Ill just refer
to and will ascribe the representatives comments to Mr K himself.
What happened
The detailed background to this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide
a brief overview of some of the key events here. In July 2021 Mr K made a payment from his
own bank (which is based outside the UK) to an account held with PayrNet. The payment
was for â‚¬5,080.16 and it arrived in the PayrNet account on 20 July 2021. At the time, Mr K
believed he was funding a genuine investment, but he later discovered hed been the victim
of a scam.
In 2022 Mr K contacted PayrNet. He alleged they had failed against various obligations and
requested that he be refunded for his loss. He also asked for details of where his funds had
been sent on to. Mr K says he didnt receive a meaningful response from PayrNet and he
referred the matter to our service.
One of our Investigators recommended that the complaint should be upheld. In summary
she said PayrNet hadnt provided sufficient evidence to support their position. But she also
thought as Mr K had made his investment as a result of a cold-call and without conducting
due diligence, that it would be fair for PayrNet to only refund half his loss. Mr K accepted this
outcome, but PayrNet didnt. They didnt believe our service could investigate this complaint
or that they should pay any redress.
Ive previously issued a jurisdiction decision confirming that our service can consider this
complaint. And following on from that I issued a provisional decision indicating my intention
to uphold the complaint in full, based on PayrNet not providing evidence to support their
position and because I didnt agree Mr K had been negligent. PayrNet then provided the 
information necessary to investigate this complaint and I issued a further provisional decision 
in which I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayrNet have now provided the information required to enable the investigation of this
complaint. Having reviewed this I now intend to reach a different outcome compared to what
Ive explained before. PayrNet have evidenced that they took appropriate proof of identity 
and other documentation when opening the account. So based on this, I dont think they 
reasonably could have known, at that time, that the account might later go on to be used in 
connection with a fraud or scam.
The recipient account was newly opened. Ive seen evidence to show that Mr Ks payment
was the first credit into the account. And that it was spent / withdrawn from the account
within around 48 hours. There was nothing so suspicious or indicative of potential fraud such
that I think PayrNet should have done more before accepting Mr Ks payment onto the
account or following their customers instructions to pay the money away. In reaching this
conclusion Ive considered the type of account involved with its expected use, as well as the
sum involved. And as the money was no longer in the account when Mr K raised this with
PayrNet, I cant say that they failed in their recovery efforts as the money was already gone.
Ive also considered Mr Ks request that PayrNet share the details of where the funds were
sent on to. PayrNet are required to comply with privacy laws. If they dont have a lawful basis
for holding and processing personal data (which includes disclosing that information to a
third party) it would be in breach of those. And in the circumstances of this complaint, there
isnt a basis upon which I can direct that information to be shared directly with Mr K. For any
information to be of use to pursue a third party, it would inevitably include personal data.
That being said, Im confident that a regulated firm like PayrNet would co-operate with any
police investigation and that they would share information with the police, upon receipt of a
request that they do so.
Overall, Im sorry that Mr K suffered a loss as a result of a scam. But as this isnt something I
think PayrNet are responsible for, Im not intending to uphold this complaint.
Neither PayrNet nor Mr K responded to my provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party had any further evidence or comments for my consideration, I see no 
reason to deviate from the outcome explained in my provisional decision. 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 December 2023.
