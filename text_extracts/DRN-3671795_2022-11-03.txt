The complaint
Mr D complains about inaccurate information and delays by Aviva Life & Pensions UK 
Limited (Aviva) in setting up his pension annuities
What happened
Mr D said he had two pension policies due to pay out on his 60th birthday. They both had 
guaranteed annuity rates with 5% per annum annual increases. He contacted Aviva about a 
year before his birthday to check details. It took several calls to get the details confirmed. He 
called again two months before his 60th birthday to get confirmation he could start to take his 
pension on his birthday. They sent him incorrect figures and he had to call numerous times. 
He got final confirmation 5 months after his 60th birthday . Payments started with effect from 
September 2020. He wanted to collect the pension he would have had if it had started on his 
60th birthday. He said the final response letter only quoted one not both policies.
Aviva accepted that in relation to policy 9606 it had provided incorrect and conflicting 
information over the past 2 years and apologised for the inconvenience and confusion 
caused. It issued a retirement quote on 6 August 2020 but said it quoted the wrong annuity 
rate. Mr D called on 14 August 2020 and it sent out the same quote on 20 August 2020. It 
revised the quote on 11 September 2020 with the correct rate. It said it would make sure he 
didnt lose out. It sent £200 by way of apology. It said the annuity actually paid was higher 
than it would have been had it been set up sooner. However it said he had lost 22 days of 
income and arranged to send him £841.46. It issued option packs on 29 March 2020 for his 
NRD but heard nothing until the IFA requested further information on 22 May 2020. It said 
there was no evidence Mr D would have taken his pension at age 60.
The investigator upheld the complaint. He said that it was clear that the information provided 
to Mr D was both unclear and incorrect. This was both before and after his NRD. There was 
evidence he was looking into his pension as early as August 2018 as he contacted his IFA 
and made contact with Aviva. There is further activity in 2019. Both Mr D and his IFA 
contacted Aviva again and question the information. He felt there was evidence Mr D would 
have taken his benefits at age 60 as he had been gathering information since 2018 and was 
even considering early retirement as the figures given were so high. There was also 
evidence Mr D and his IFA made significant efforts to clarify the Guaranteed Annuity Rate 
(GAR) before he reached age 60, and this continued for several months after his 60th 
birthday. The IFA could not advise Mr D without correct information. On balance he thought 
Mr D would have taken his benefits at age 60. He proposed an award for fair compensation 
and £600 for distress and inconvenience. 
Aviva did not respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr D has two policies one ending 9606 and the other 7406. I have seen the policy schedules 
which show
Policy 9606 started 12/07/1988 has a GAR of £100 per £1,150 at age 60 and 5% pa 
escalation
Policy 7406 started 04/07/1989 has a GAR of £100 per £1,830 at age 60 and 5% pa 
escalation
Mr D says he had no correspondence regarding either policy in the 10 years up to August 
2018. He made several requests between 19/8/2018 and early September 2019  all 
information was incomplete as they did not include escalation. This continued until they got it 
correct on 15 September 2020 but their proposed loss assessment was only done for one 
policy.
For ease of reference I have set out a timeline of events below based on the business file 
supplied. I have added some comments in bold italics.

23 June 2021 policy 9606 loss assessment based on retirement date of 10 September 2020 
and an annual pension of £17,569.11. The annuity at 19 August 2020 would have been 
£17,452.32 so the actual basis was higher. Loss of income for 22 days £841.46.
I have set out this timeline in detail as I think it creates a helpful picture of what was 
happening and the timeframe over which it occurred. 
It is clear to me that Aviva provided conflicting and incorrect information over a long period of 
time. It accepts this in relation to policy 9606 but I think it is clear that this was the case for 
both policies and the time lime of events supports that.
Where Aviva has made an error, such as providing incorrect information as was the case 
here, I can make an award for any financial loss and for distress and inconvenience. 
Putting things right
I have considered an award for financial loss. The purpose of making such an award is to 
put Mr D as close as possible back in the position he would have been but for Avivas 
mistake.
Aviva says the annuities actually paid are higher than they would have been had they been 
set up sooner at Mr Ds NRD. It said Mr D had lost 22 days of income and arranged to send 
him £841.46. It said it issued option packs on 29 March 2020 for his NRD but heard nothing 
until the IFA requested further information on 22 May 2020. It said there was no evidence Mr 
D would have taken his pension at age 60. But I dont agree. I asked Mr D whether he would 
have retired at age 60 and he confirmed he would. There was a long period of time over 
which he and his financial adviser had asked for information. That period started over a year 
before his NRD and as the timeline shows enquiries increased significantly in the 5 months 
prior to his NRD. In the final weeks before his NRD Aviva had sent valuations information 
that simply didnt make sense compared to earlier figures so I think it would have been very 
difficult to be confident any of the information was correct at the time of his NRD. Given this 
evidence I think it is reasonable to accept that Mr D would have retired and taken his annuity 
pensions at his NRD as he says he would have, had he been able to do so.
I accept that the amount used to purchase the annuities when they were finally set up should 
have been higher than the amount at NRD. I say should because many of the letters say that 
the capital was moved into a deposit account at NRD bearing interest at 7%. However I do 
not know what actual figures was used by Aviva, nor whether it actually applied 7% or some 
other figure, so I cannot be certain that was actually the case. 
It is clear that Mr D lost the benefit of monthly pension income for the months between his 
NRD and the date his annuity pensions started to be paid. The annuity rate was fixed in the policy terms so would not have changed during the period of delay. I think it is reasonable to 
direct that Aviva should now pay those missing instalments. Further as Mr D was deprived of 
the use of those instalments of pension they should be subject to interest at 8% pe annum 
simple from the date they would have been paid to the date of actual payment.
But I accept that to be fair Aviva should get some credit for the fact that the monthly pension 
payment may now be higher due to the delay. The investigator proposed a basis for redress 
which took this into account. Neither party has objected to it. Given this I think it is 
reasonable to use the basis he proposed. 
The investigator proposed the following which I think it fair..
How to put things right
Fair compensation
In assessing what would be fair compensation, my aim is to put Mr D as close as possible to 
the position he would probably now be in if he had been given the information necessary to 
take his benefits at age 60 and he did take his benefits at that date.
I am satisfied that what I have set out below is fair and reasonable given Mr Ds 
circumstances and objectives when he invested.
To put things right Aviva should either 
(A) Ideally unwind Mr Ds annuities and re-write them with a start date of his 60th birthday 
and pay him any arrears of pension unpaid as a consequence of the pension not 
starting at age 60 plus interest on those arrears from the date they should have been 
paid to the date of actual payment at 8% per annum simple. This would be the most 
favourable solution as it would take account of all the factors involved, including the 
indexation associated with the pension. However, I understand this is sometimes not 
possible.
OR, If a re-write isnt possible, to compensate Mr D fairly Aviva should:
(B)
1. Calculate the amount of pension income Mr D would have received each month, 
assuming his annuities from both policies had been in force from his 60th birthday, up 
to the date it was actually put in force.
2. Calculate interest at 8% per annum simple on each of the annuity payments from the 
date they ought to have been paid had they started at age 60 until the date the 
redress is paid to him under this direction. This when added to the amount under 1 
above, will give the gross redress figure.
3. The annual annuities actually paid to him might be higher than the annuity Mr D 
would have received on his 60th birthday because the value applied to secure those 
annuities was greater than would have been the case at age 60. If that is the case, 
Aviva might want to offset 10 years worth of the difference between the amount of 
the annuity currently in payment and the amount that would have been put into 
payment at age 60 (if the current amount in payment is higher), from the gross 
redress figure calculated under 1 and 2 above.
Aviva can also deduct the amount of £841.46 from the amount due under (A) or (B) if it has already paid that amount to Mr D. 
The compensation should be reduced to notionally allow for any income tax that would 
otherwise have been paid. This is an adjustment to ensure the compensation is a fair 
amount  it isnt a payment of tax to HMRC, so Mr D wont be able to reclaim any of the 
reduction after compensation is paid.
The notional allowance should be calculated using Mr D's actual or expected marginal rate 
of tax at his selected retirement age. Its reasonable to assume that Mr D is likely to be a 
basic rate taxpayer at the selected retirement age, so the reduction would equal 20%.
Aviva must also provide details of the calculation to Mr D in a clear, simple format.
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If Aviva considers that its required by HM
Revenue & Customs to deduct income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr D how
much its taken off. It should also give Mr D a tax deduction certificate in respect of
interest if Mr D asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax on interest from HM Revenue &
Customs if appropriate.
There is guidance on how to carry out calculations available on this services website and 
details were supplied by the investigator.
I have also considered an award for distress and inconvenience. Such an award is not to 
punish Aviva but to reflect the impact of the mistake on Mr D. We all experience 
inconvenience in our day to day lives but I think the prolonged period over which this 
happened is much greater than that. I think the impact was significant. I say that due to the 
long period of time over which the confusion persisted. And that it needed a lot of extra effort 
from Mr D and the IFA to point out to Aviva that the information it sent couldnt be correct 
and conflicted with the policy and earlier information or was incomplete in terms of details of 
the GAR etc. For those reasons I think an award of £600 is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt Aviva need only pay a further £400 if it has 
already paid the £200 it offered. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint.
I direct that Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited should within 30 days of this service notifying 
it that Mr D has accepted this decision pay Mr D:-
1. £600 for distress and inconvenience ( for the avoidance of doubt it need only pay a 
further £400 if it has already paid £200 it offered.)
2. Compensation for financial loss on the basis set out above in my section headed 
putting things right. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2022.
