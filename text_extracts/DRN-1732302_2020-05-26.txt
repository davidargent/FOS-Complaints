The complaint
Mr and Mrs C have complained that the term of their mortgage with The Royal Bank of 
Scotland Plc (RBS) is due to end about six months later than they thought.
What happened
Mr and Mrs C had a mortgage with RBS and in 2004 they changed to a flexible mortgage 
product.
A mortgage offer was produced in February 2004 with a 24-year term. RBS didnt receive 
back the signed acceptance of that offer and so it expired. A new mortgage offer was 
produced in June 2004, again with a 24-year term. Mr and Mrs C signed to accept that offer 
and it completed on 1 July 2004.
In 2019 Mr and Mrs C complained to RBS about the end date of the mortgage, saying it 
should be ending in January 2028, not July 2028.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint, saying the term was clear on the mortgage 
offer. Mr and Mrs C didnt agree and so the case has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When an application is made for a mortgage, whether that be a first mortgage or a rate 
change with your existing lender, then a term is noted on the application. The term will 
remain the same as on that regardless of how long it takes for the mortgage to complete. 
The reason for this is if the term is amended then the monthly payments will also change. If 
the term is amended each month the application doesnt complete, then the application will 
constantly need to be recalculated and re-underwritten. Thats simply not feasible when you 
consider how many applications are in progress at any one time.
So, as here, it may be you apply for a mortgage with a 24-year term in February 2004 and 
get a mortgage offer on that basis, but the application doesnt complete until July 2004. 
Youd still have the 24-year term that was applied for (but from July 2004) so the mortgage 
will now end in July 2028 rather than February 2028. This is completely normal practice in 
the mortgage industry and what Id expect to see. On that basis Im satisfied RBS did 
nothing wrong.
The second mortgage offer (after the first one expired) was issued to Mr and Mrs C on 16 
June 2004 and that clearly states that the mortgage term is to be 24 years. Mr and Mrs C 
signed to accept that mortgage offer  and therefore the mortgage term  on 18 June 2004. 
The term (and start date of the mortgage) have then been set out on every annual mortgage 
statement issued over the last 15 years. 
The July 2016 annual mortgage statement showed Mr and Mrs C had four sub-accounts at 
that time:1. Started on 1 July 2004 with a term of 24 years.
2. Started on 30 May 2007 with a term of 21 years and 2 months.
3. Started on 18 June 2010 with a term of 18 years and 3 months.
4. Started on 14 July 2014 with a term of 14 years.
 
This shows every further advance Mr and Mrs C have taken has been based around a 
similar end date. A mortgage offer was produced for each further advance which set out the 
term of the lending, and each time Mr and Mrs C accepted those offers. None of these offers 
implied an end date of around January/February 2028.
Its not a case of letting the big boys win as Mr and Mrs C have said. Its simply a matter of 
RBS running the mortgage in line with the mortgage contract Mr and Mrs C agreed to.
Mr and Mrs C have provided a copy of a letter that says they requested the new mortgage 
over the same remaining term. But that letter was dated 14 July 2017 so doesnt impact on 
the outcome of this complaint. As Ive explained, the original application may have been for 
the same term, but it took so long to complete because RBS didnt receive the signed 
paperwork back that the end date moved on. RBS did nothing wrong in not amending the 
term when it reissued the offer as thats normal industry practice, and for that reason I cant 
uphold this complaint.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im 
required to ask Mr C and Mrs C to accept or reject my decision before 24 June 2020.
