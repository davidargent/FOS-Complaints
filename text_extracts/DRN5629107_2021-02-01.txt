K820x#14complaint
Mrs F says she was mis-sold a payment  protection  insurance (PPI) policy.
I cant consider this complaint against  the policy seller directly because  the sale took place 
before it, or its predecessor-in-title, was regulated by the then Financial Services Authority 
(FSA) for insurance intermediation activities, or otherwise covered by our jurisdiction.
The party that at the time of the sale was the policy insurer, has accepted that the seller  was 
acting as its agent at the time  so it accepted responsibility for the sale. Following a transfer 
of business, AXA France IARD (AXA)  has taken on that responsibility.  To keep things 
simple, Ill only refer to AXA in this decision, rather than any other business.
background and summary to complaint
Mrs F bought the policy in 1999 at the same time as taking out a store  card. She applied for 
the store card and PPI policy in-store.
At the time,  Mrs F was employed as an administrator. She has told us she was entitled to at 
least six months full sick pay and some redundancy pay. She said she didnt have any other 
means of repaying  her store card should she be unable to work. Mrs F has said she had a 
number of medical conditions some  years prior to the time of the sale. I will come back to 
this later on. 
The policy provided  cover  for accident, sickness, unemployment and life  subject to its 
exclusions and limitations. It offered to repay  15% of Mrs Fs store card balance  in the event 
of Mrs F being unable to work due to accident,  sickness and unemployment. It would repay  
the outstanding balance  in full (subject to an overall  limit) in the event of death.  
The policy also provided Purchase and Price Protection Cover. Mrs F hasnt complained 
about this element of the insurance policy so I will not consider  it further  in this decision. 
At the time,  the policy cost £1.00 per £100  of the monthly outstanding  balance. The premium  
would continue to have to be paid during a successful claim and it did attract interest.  
According to AXAs records  Mrs F paid a total of just £7.50 for PPI during the policys  
lifetime.
Mrs Fs representative  has made  lengthy  and substantial representations on her behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have  read and considered  them all carefully. In 
summary, Mrs Fs representative  says:
AXA failed to meet the sales standards which applied at the time. In those 
circumstances, applying  the regulators rules and guidance for businesses  on 
handling PPI complaints  under  DISP  App 3, it should be presumed Mrs F wouldnt 
have taken out the policy and the complaint should be upheld.  Mrs Fs 
representatives believe there to be no evidence to rebut that presumption;
The policy excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress,  which  are some  of the 
most common reasons people  are off work. This significantly reduced  the value of 
cover;
Ref: DRN56291072The true costs including interest  and the fact it was unlikely you could make  a 
successful claim  meant the policy was of inherently poor value as shown by the low 
claims ratio. The common law duty of utmost good  faith means AXA should have told 
Mrs F about the poor value; 
The common law duty of utmost good faith also means AXA should have explained 
the significance  of the exclusions  and limitations of cover  to Mrs F and the impact 
they would  have had on her chances  of making  a claim; and
The information Mrs F received  was misleading. These policies were promoted as 
providing peace of mind, but the number of exclusions and limitations on the scope of 
the cover  meant this was untrue.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint  both parties have seen and provided their 
responses to the adjudicators opinion. Mrs F disagreed  with the adjudicators opinion  for 
several reasons.  
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
relevant considerations
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; relevant regulators rules, guidance  and standards;  relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published  some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mrs Fs. I dont intend to set that out in 
much detail here but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Fs complaint.
This sale took place  in 1999 before the General Insurance Standards Council (GISC) 
published its code  of practice in June 2000  and before the sale of general insurance 
products like this became  regulated in January 2005. So, the GISC Code, the FSAs (and 
FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses  and insurance conduct rules (ICOB and 
ICOBs) arent applicable to this complaint,  nor is the FCAs Perimeter  Guidance (PERG). 
The credit agreement itself was with a third-party  and not AXA. That means the unfair  
relationship provisions set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme Court  
judgment in Plevin  about s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance  made by the FCA 
about the handling of complaints  about  the non-disclosure of commission  in light of the 
Plevin judgment, arent  applicable.
There were a number of industry codes in existence  at that time, which Im satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint: 
Ref: DRN56291073The Association of British Insurers General Insurance Business Code of Practice for all 
intermediaries (Including Employees of Insurance Companies) other  than Registered 
Insurance Brokers   The ABI Code.  
The ABI Code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement  of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries  
Among other  things, the code said that As a condition of membership of the Association  of 
British Insurers (ABI),  members undertake  to enforce this Code  and to use their best 
endeavors to ensure that all those involved in selling their policies observe its provisions. 
The insurer  was a member of the ABI and the seller  its agent  was acting as an 
intermediary. 
The Finance  & Leasing  Association (FLA) Code of Practice
This code  was introduced in 1992  and set out standards of good  practice  for the finance  and 
leasing industry. Section  4 of the code  covered  Credit  Protection Insurance. 
As Ive explained, the insurer was a member  of the ABI, so it was subject to the ABI Code 
and its associated requirements. The seller  but not the insurer  was a member of the FLA 
and subscribed  to the FLA Code, so I consider it reasonable to assume that the seller  (as a 
member of the FLA)  should have complied  with its code when selling PPI, and this extends  
to when it was acting as an agent  of the insurer.  
So Im satisfied it is right that I should  take these  codes into account when deciding what is, 
in my opinion, fair and reasonable  in the circumstances of Mrs Fs case. 
 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including:  the law relating to 
negligence, misrepresentation and contract  (including the express  and implied duty on 
professional advisers  to give advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence); the law 
relating to the duty of utmost good faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness.  
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001,  Im also required  to take into account  what 
determination the relevant former  scheme   in this case the Insurance  Ombudsman  Bureau 
 might have been expected to reach in relation to an equivalent complaint. 
I note that under the Insurance Ombudsmans terms of reference  the Ombudsman  was 
required to decide  complaints by reference  to what was, in his opinion,  fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances   and that the Ombudsman was required to observe any applicable 
rule of law or relevant judicial authority. 
Im also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first issued 
by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating  to the sale 
of PPI. This sale took place before insurance  mediation became a regulated activity, so AXA 
was required to take into account  the provisions in DISP App 3 as if they were guidance 
when considering Mrs Fs complaint. 
Ref: DRN56291074key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account,  it seems to me that the key questions I need  
to consider in deciding  what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of 
this complaint, are:
-If AXA gave advice,  whether it advised  Mrs F with reasonable care and skill  in 
particular, whether the policy  was appropriate  or suitable for her, given her needs 
and circumstances.  
-Whether AXA gave  Mrs F sufficient, appropriate and timely information  to enable her 
to make an informed choice about  whether  to take out the policy,  including drawing to 
her attention and highlighting  in a clear,  fair and not misleading way  the main 
provisions of the policy and significant  limitations  and exclusions.  
-If, having considered  these questions,  I determine the complaint in favour of Mrs F, I 
must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Mrs F suffered loss or 
damage and what  I consider would amount to fair compensation for that loss or 
damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Mrs F and AXA,  
Ive decided not to uphold  Mrs Fs complaint.  Ive set out my reasoning below. 
did Mrs F know she had a choice?
AXA had to make  it clear that the PPI policy was optional.  
AXA has provided a copy of Mrs Fs store card application. Looking at this I can see there  is 
a separate section for PPI, which  required the applicant to sign a box to take out PPI. There  
is nothing her which says or implies  PPI had to be taken out  it says:  Only sign this box if 
you require Account Cover. And Mrs F has signed the box.  If she didnt want PPI she 
couldve left this section  blank and just signed the credit agreement  at the end of the 
application.
So taking everything into account, I think its more likely  that Mrs F knew  the policy  was 
optional and she agreed to take it out without undue  pressure. 
did AXA provide advice?
Both AXA and Mrs F agree that advice wasnt  provided during this sale.  
This means  AXA didnt  have to check if the PPI was suitable for Mrs F. 
Instead, it had to give her sufficient, appropriate and timely information to enable Mrs F to 
make an informed choice  about whether to take out the policy, including drawing to her 
attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main  provisions of 
the policy and significant limitations and exclusions.  
the information
AXA has provided us with Mrs Fs application  form or credit  agreement  showing that PPI 
had been selected. It has also referred us to a copy of the paperwork it says she wouldve 
Ref: DRN56291075received, including the policy terms and conditions  which I accept on a balance of 
probabilities  applied to policies like Mrs Fs. 
Looking at the information provided to Mrs F at the time, I dont think AXA gave Mrs F the 
information she fairly and reasonably needed  to make an informed decision about  whether 
or not to take out the policy. 
This sale took place  in a store. I dont know what AXA told Mrs F about the PPI but I think  its 
unlikely she would have  agreed to take it out without  at least having a broad understanding  
of the cover  it provided  i.e. life, accident, sickness and unemployment cover. And I think its 
unlikely Mrs F would have  thought  it was free.
But it was AXAs responsibility  to draw to Mrs Fs attention the important  information   i.e. 
the key information about the nature of the cover and any significant  exclusions and 
limitations which might be relevant to her decision. 
I dont think its likely  AXA did enough  to do this. For example, I dont think  its likely the true 
cost of the policy was made clear to Mrs F, including the need  to maintain premiums during 
a claim or that the payments would attract interest. In addition, its unlikely AXA adequately  
drew to her attention  the main  provisions of the policy and significant limitations and 
exclusions.
So I dont  think AXA gave Mrs F sufficient,  appropriate and timely  information to enable  her 
to make an informed choice about  whether  to take out the policy,  including drawing to her 
attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main  provisions of 
the policy and significant limitations and exclusions.  
Ive considered how my findings interact  with the FCAs  list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling  PPI complaints  set out at DISP  App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, Im persuaded that there were significant failings in this case.
In addition to the failings  Ive highlighted above,  Mrs Fs representative has raised a number 
of general points with regard  to the requirements on a business when providing information  
in PPI sales. It suggests these points  apply to all PPI complaints, like Mrs Fs. I have 
considered these carefully and summarised them as:
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Mrs Fs representative considers to be poor 
value. 
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  shouldnt have just 
told Mrs F about the limitations  and exclusions, it should have gone further and 
explained the significance of them to her. 
Im not persuaded by Mrs Fs representatives views  on this. The duty of utmost good  faith in 
insurance law imposed a duty on both parties  to the contract  to disclose material facts  and 
not to make  material misrepresentations. While I cant be certain what  a court  would say  I 
think its unlikely that a court would find that this extended to the insurer  having to disclose 
the claims ratio information  or explaining the significance of the limitations  and exclusions in 
the way Mrs F has suggested. And taking into account the law, industry codes and 
standards of good industry practice  applicable to this complaint, I dont think  it would be fair 
or reasonable to impose such requirements on AXA. 
Ref: DRN56291076what effect did AXAs shortcomings have on Mrs F? To what extent did Mrs F suffer 
loss or damage as a result?
I have found that AXA did not do all it should  have done when it sold this policy  to Mrs F. So 
I have gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to conclude Mrs F 
suffered loss and damage as a result. To answer  this, I must decide  whether or not Mrs F 
would have still taken  out the policy, had AXA done  things properly. 
Mrs F says she would not have taken  it out and believes that I should presume this to be the 
case given the significant failings identified  above. 
As this was a non-advised sale, Mrs F had to weigh up in her own mind the cost of the policy  
against the benefits offered and the potential consequences if she didnt insure against the 
risk of being  unable  to work. 
As Ive found above, Mrs F chose to take this policy out. So I consider that its reasonable to 
conclude she had some  interest in the benefits offered by this type of insurance. But she 
made this decision  based  on incomplete information. So what Mrs F thought she was getting  
is not exactly what she got. The extent to which this differed is a relevant consideration when 
determining if Mrs F has suffered any loss or detriment. 
In relation to the costs, Im satisfied Mrs F ought  reasonably to have known she would  have 
to pay something for the PPI and that it would cover  a portion of her outstanding balance   
this was set out on the store card application. But, I accept that AXA didnt make  clear the 
on-going cost information. So while Mrs F didnt know some things, the ultimate position in 
the event of a successful  claim was not dissimilar to what she would reasonably  have 
thought from the information she based  her decision  to take out the policy on and found  
acceptable. 
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mrs F thought  she had bought  and 
what she actually bought were the following:
The policy excluded claims relating to medical  conditions that Mrs F knew about or 
ought to have known about  or had consulted a doctor about during  the 12 months  
before the start date of the policy; 
The policy contained limitations on claims relating to back and mental health 
conditions placing more onerous evidential requirements to support a claim  on those 
grounds;
The policy limited, and in some situations,  excluded unemployment  cover  if Mrs F 
wasnt a permanent employee; and
The requirement that in order to be eligible for a disability claim  Mrs F be unable to 
do her own job, a similar job or any paid work  which her experience, education or 
training reasonably qualified her to do. 
I do accept that there is a possibility that the limitations and exclusions above might  well 
have caused Mrs F pause for thought  and may well have caused her to conclude  that the 
policy was not as good as she thought  and she might  have  decided  not to proceed.  The 
limitations on the cover, when coupled with the other shortcomings in this sale, might  have 
dissuaded some  consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mrs F from taking out 
the policy. 
Ref: DRN56291077But the evidence  about Mrs Fs circumstances at the time of sale shows that the policy 
wasnt fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her. She was eligible for its benefits and it 
provided cover that, despite its limitations  and exclusions, couldve proved  beneficial to her 
should the insured risks have become a reality. Although Mrs F has mentioned having some 
medical conditions  some time before the policy was taken out, I dont think  better information 
about this exclusion  would have put her off agreeing to it. 
I say this because  Mrs F said these things happened around 19 years and 11 years before 
she took out the PPI respectively and she hasnt said that these things  caused  her problems 
in the run up to or nearer the time of taking out the policy.  We asked  Mrs F for any more 
information about her conditions,  including  whether  she saw a doctor about them or had any 
treatment in the 12 months before  the sale, but she said that she couldnt remember. The 
evidence doesnt  therefore suggest Mrs F was suffering with the conditions  she referred to 
immediately before or at the time of sale.
In light of this and because I havent seen any evidence to suggest  she wouldve been 
caught by any of the other significant exclusions,  I still think she had some  good reasons to 
take the policy out.
I accept back pain and mental health conditions are common problems and the steps 
required to make a disability claim for these conditions were  more onerous than Mrs F might 
reasonably have expected. But its unlikely she would have expected to be able to make a 
disability claim without  having to provide some evidence to support that claim.  And while this 
limitation might have dissuaded  some consumers in slightly different circumstances to Mrs F 
from taking out the policy,  Mrs F, in her circumstances, still had some good reasons to take it 
out.
If Mrs F had known  she could only claim for disability if she was not only unable  to do her job 
or any similar job but also unable to do any work  which in the insurers  view she might 
reasonably be qualified for, it might have played into her thinking about  what she would  do. 
And I accept  it may have  given her pause for thought  although given Mrs Fs 
circumstances, on balance, I still think she would  have  been interested in taking out the 
cover. 
 
Having considered all of the evidence  and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not that Mrs F would still have taken out the PPI. The policy  was sufficiently close  to 
what she thought  she was getting and I think the policy  could provide a useful benefit in a 
difficult time, notwithstanding her employment  benefits. And in those circumstances I 
consider it more likely  than not that she would have taken out the policy  in any event.  
Mrs Fs representatives  say the rules about  how to handle PPI complaints (DISP  App 3) 
make it clear  that, where  a significant  failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have  taken out PPI, unless  there  is evidence  to outweigh  the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms,  but it is a relevant  consideration  so I take it into account along 
with many other things  when I decide  what is in my opinion  fair and reasonable. Considering  
the purpose of the guidance, I dont  think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken.  
Ref: DRN56291078I have thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, I have found  it would be reasonable to conclude  there  
were substantial flaws  in the sales  process.  In those  circumstances, DISP App 3 says it 
should be presumed Mrs F would not have bought the PPI she bought unless, in the 
particular circumstances  of the complaint, there is evidence to rebut the presumption. 
I am satisfied, applying DISP App 3, it is reasonable to conclude  the presumption  is rebutted 
in the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account Mrs Fs 
circumstances as detailed  above, I consider it reasonable to conclude  the position  Mrs F 
found herself in as a result of the sale was the same position  she would have been in had 
the breach or significant  failings not occurred. 
Mrs F believes the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws in the sales  process 
were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were  highly material and we have failed to give 
proper weight to the evidence  including her own comments  that she would not have taken 
out the policy. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance  for firms  set out at DISP App 3 (which  I 
dont consider I am), I am only doing so because  I do not consider, in this case,  that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Mrs F in the position she would have been in if she had 
not bought the policy.  
That is because,  while I accept its possible that she would not have  taken out the policy, I 
am satisfied  that of the two possibilities, it is more  likely than not that she would still have 
taken out the PPI had she been  given clear,  fair and not misleading  information about the 
policy she was buying. So Im not persuaded it would  be fair and reasonable in those  
circumstances, to conclude that AXA should pay Mrs F compensation, as that would put her 
in a better position  than she would have been in if everything had happened as it should  
have done. 
Im also aware that Mrs F thinks  AXA misrepresented  the terms of the policy  in how it 
described the PPI. While I accept there is a possibility a court  might  conclude some of AXAs  
statements misrepresented the contract, in my opinion the reason why AXA failed to act 
fairly and reasonably was not because  of what it did or didnt say in the information it 
provided  but because  the overall information  AXA gave Mrs F, in the way it did, was 
insufficient to meet  the standards I consider it fair and reasonable to expect it to have met in 
[date] when providing information  about  an insurance policy.  
Ive also thought about the approach Mrs Fs representative says a court might take if it were 
to find AXA negligently  misrepresented the contract  to Mrs F and about the remedy  a court  
might award if it were  to find that AXA had been  in breach of its duty of utmost good faith. 
But this doesnt  persuade  me to alter my conclusions about what  is fair and reasonable in all 
the circumstances of the complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the 
circumstances of this case.  For the reasons Ive already set out I dont think it would be fair 
and reasonable to put Mrs F in a better  position than if everything had happened as it should 
have done. 
my decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Ref: DRN56291079Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2021.
