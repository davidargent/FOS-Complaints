The complaint
This complaint is about a mortgage payment protection insurance (PPI) policy taken out in 
February 2006. Mr A says Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) mis-sold him PPI.
What happened
The background and circumstances leading up to this complaint, which include Mr As 
circumstances at the time of the sale as well as the PPI policy benefits, limitations and 
exclusions of cover, arent disputed. So I havent repeated all of this information here.
Our adjudicator did not uphold the complaint.
Mr As representative disagreed with the adjudicators opinion  it didnt raise any new or 
additional points but repeated the same complaint points and arguments it had previously 
made. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered all 
the evidence and arguments available to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
When considering what is fair and reasonable, I am required to take into account relevant: 
law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, 
where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the time. 
Weve set out our general approach to PPI mis-sale complaints on our website and 
published some example final decisions that set out in detail how these relevant 
considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mr As. I havent set out that detailed information 
here, but Ive taken into account all relevant considerations in deciding Mr As complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint and Ive summarised my reasons 
for this conclusion below:
 
I think Lloyds made it clear that Mr A didnt have to take out the PPI and he chose to take 
it out. I say this because Lloyds sent in copies of Mr As mortgage and PPI application 
forms and mortgage offer, and the offer clearly states PPI as being optional. Additionally, 
theres nothing on the mortgage or PPI application forms to suggest the PPI was 
presented as compulsory at the point that Mr A applied for the mortgage. 
Lloyds recommended the PPI to Mr A, so it had to check that the PPI was right for him. 
The evidence about Mr As circumstances at the time shows that the policy wasnt 
fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for him. For example Mr A was eligible for the cover 
and had limited means to fall back on he said he wouldnt have been entitled to sick pay 
from his employer, and had limited savings - so he had a need for cover.
There was nothing about Mr As employment or occupation which would have made it 
difficult for him to claim. And although Mr A says he had a medical condition when the 
PPI was taken out, I dont think it was wrong for Lloyds to have recommended it. I say 
this because Mr A indicated the condition was controlled by medication, and he didnt 
say hed needed any time off work for it, so I dont think he wouldve considered it a 
particular reason why he may have needed to claim on the PPI. There were also no 
additional restrictions on cover for mental health and/or back problems.
Its possible the information Lloyds gave Mr A about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Ive found that he chose to take it out - so it looks like he wanted this 
type of cover. The cover wasnt fundamentally wrong for Mr A as I concluded above, or 
too dissimilar to what he reasonably thought he was buying from the information he was 
given. It also looks like it was affordable  so it seems like it would have been useful for 
him if something had gone wrong. Because of this I dont think Mr A would have declined 
the cover had Lloyds done anything more.
Overall, I consider that Mr A would have still taken out PPI. I think the policy couldve 
provided a useful benefit in a difficult time, given his circumstances at the time. I also think 
the policy was sufficiently close to what its likely he thought he was getting. And in those 
circumstances, I think that he would have taken out the policy in any event.
Mr As representative has raised a number of what I consider to be general complaint points, 
which it says apply to all PPI complaints. These general points include a claim that the 
Financial Ombudsman Service is not correctly applying the regulators rules and guidance 
for handling PPI complaints; these policies represented poor value because of the number of 
significant exclusions and limitations of cover coupled with the low claims ratio; and the duty 
of utmost good faith meant Lloyds should have disclosed the poor value and explained the 
significance of the limitations and exclusions and the impact it had on the chances of making 
a claim.
But Mr As representative has not said how these points apply to the specific facts and 
circumstances of Mr As individual complaint  just that they apply to all PPI complaints.
I have thought about these things and how they might apply in Mr As particular case. But 
these points dont persuade me to alter my conclusions about what is fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances of the complaint  for the reasons Ive set out above I dont uphold this 
complaint.
This means Lloyds doesnt have to do anything to put things right.
My final decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont uphold Mr As complaint  so I make no award.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 November 2021.
