Mr B says Gain  Credit LLC, trading as Lending Stream, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  my provisional  decision on 4 July 2019. A copy is attached  and it forms 
part of this final decision. I explained why I was planning to uphold the complaint in part and 
asked Mr B and Lending  Stream to let me know if they had anything to add.
Mr B said he didnt  have anything to add. Lending Stream accepted  the provisional decision.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Lending Stream accepted my provisional decision  and as Mr B had nothing to add  I 
see no reason to depart from my provisional  findings. So my final decision is the same as my 
provisional decision, for the same reasons.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Bs complaint  in part. Gain Credit LLC must put things right in the way set out in 
my provisional decision.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 August 2019.

complaint
Mr B says Gain Credit LLC, trading as Lending Stream, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr B had 18 loans with Lending Stream between May 2012 and January 2014. Ive attached a table 
of these loans at the end of this decision.
An adjudicator considered Mr Bs complaint and recommended it be upheld in part. He didnt think 
Lending Stream shouldve approved loan 4 or loans  15 to 18. Lending Stream didnt  agree. It made  a 
number of points, including that it thought Mr B had enough  disposable income to repay  the loans and 
that it relied upon the information in his applications being accurate.
As there  was no agreement, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.
Lending Stream needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice 
this means that it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make sure 
Mr B could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks  could take into account a number 
of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure.  With this in mind,  in the early stages  of a lending  relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Lending  Stream should fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Lending Stream  was required to establish  
whether Mr B could sustainably repay his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  affordable 
on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the OFTs  irresponsible  lending guidance (ILG) defined  sustainable as being  without undue  
difficulties, meaning  the customer  should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows 
that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able 
Ref: DRN46060233to make their repayments  sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
I can see that for loans 1 to 4 Lending Stream  recorded information  about  Mr Bs income and 
expenditure. It isnt broken down into individual items,  but Mr Bs total expenditure is recorded  as 
between £300 and £600 a month. His total income is recorded as just under £1,600 a month. 
On balance I dont think proportionate checks at this stage in the lending  relationship wouldve 
suggested loans 1 to 4 were unaffordable. Some of the loans did overlap  meaning the total monthly 
amounts Mr B had to pay were quite high at times  and so by the time of loan 3, Lending  Stream 
shouldve been asking Mr B for more detailed  monthly expenditure  information. But I dont think  
questions like these wouldve likely caused Mr B to declare significant  extra  expenditure  and so the 
loans up to loan 4 wouldve still looked affordable to Lending Stream.
There was then a gap of over five months between loan 4 and 5. Given the length of this break, I think  
Lending Stream didnt need to be concerned  at this stage   that Mr B was struggling with his debts 
or was otherwise in financial  difficulty. So the income  and expenditure questions Lending Stream 
asked for loan 5 were proportionate and suggested this loan was affordable.
But I think Lending Stream ought to have noted an increase in Mr Bs reliance on credit  in the 
following months.  Loans  6 to 10 were  approved between June and August 2013 and they all 
overlapped  meaning by loan 10 Mr B had five loans with Lending Stream  at the same time.
Thats not automatically a problem  but in Mr Bs case it meant  that by September  2013 he was 
committed to repaying  a significant proportion of his income (in excess  of 40%) to Lending Stream. 
Ive also seen  that he was paying over £400 a month towards a debt management  plan at this time, 
something I think Lending  Stream  couldve established from proportionate checks.
So at some point between June and August  2013 I think Lending Stream  ought  to have realised  that 
Mr Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably  and that any further lending would likely not be 
sustainably affordable. 
I think  this point arose when Mr B asked for loan 10. This was the fifth time in three months Mr B had 
asked to borrow and was also his largest loan to date in this second chain  of borrowing. Lending 
Stream ought  to have realised by then that Mr B was likely  having to borrow  further to cover a 
persistent hole in his finances  which isnt a sustainable situation.
Mr B continued to borrow with no significant breaks between  loans 11 to 18. So I dont think Lending 
Stream shouldve  approved these loans either. Mr B wasnt making  any real inroads into clearing  his 
indebtedness to Lending  Stream and effectively was left in the position of repaying expensive short-
term debts  over a long period of time. So Mr B lost out because Lending Stream continued to provide 
borrowing from loan 10 onwards.
Im therefore  planning to uphold Mr Bs complaint  about loans 10 to 18.
putting things  right
I plan to tell Lending  Stream to:
refund the interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 10 to 18
add to the above  interest at 8% simple  per year, from when Mr B paid the interest and 
charges (if he did) until the date of settlement
remove any record of loans 10 to 18 from Mr Bs credit history
Ref: DRN46060234HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending Stream 
must give Mr B a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
Im planning to uphold the complaint in part and to tell Gain  Credit LLC to put things right as set out 
above.
