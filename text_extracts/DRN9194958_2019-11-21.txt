Mr R is unhappy with the action Lloyds Bank PLC took after he fell victim to a scam.
background
In September  2017, Mr R was befriended by a woman  online  who,  over the course of the 
next couple of months, persuaded him to transfer  a total of £323,600 to her as part of a cruel  
romance scam. 
Mr R has told us he was in a vulnerable  position  at the time. He has said he felt lonely 
having lost his father the year before, after caring for him for a long time during a terminal  
illness. Mr R has said the scammer was able to gain his trust by pretending to be in a similar 
position. And she convinced him to transfer her money by giving  various reasons for needing 
it, such as a family bereavement and moving costs.  Mr R used money  from his inheritance  
when making these payments, transferring money  from a savings account held with Lloyds 
and accounts  held with other external providers. 
In November 2017 Mr R met with his Independent  Financial  Advisor  (IFA) as he needed  
money from some of his other investments to send to the scammer. The IFA told Mr R he 
thought he was being scammed.  The matter  was reported to Action Fraud  and Mr R reported 
it to Lloyds on 27 November 2017.  
Lloyds didnt take any action at this point. It told Mr R that because  he sent the money  to the 
scammer himself there was nothing it could do. 
Lloyds conducted  a review of the scammers account (which was also a Lloyds account), in 
January 2018  and it contacted Mr R to ask about  the transfers hed made. At this point 
Lloyds discovered  there  was £111,500  left in the scammers account and Lloyds returned 
this to Mr R in February 2018.  
Following the recovery  of that money, Mr R realised Lloyds couldve done  more when he 
initially reported the fraud in November 2017 and so he complained.  In response,  Lloyds 
paid Mr R £500 for the inconvenience hed been caused and £50 to cover the cost of the 
telephone calls hed made about the matter. It also took another  look at the impact of its 
inaction in November 2017, and in July 2018  refunded a further  £69,197.92 to Mr R. This 
was the amount Lloyds said it wouldve been able to recover from the scammers account  
had it acted upon Mr Rs concerns  when he reported  it on 27 November 2017.  It also paid Mr 
R 8% interest on the amount from 27 November 2017 until the date of settlement which  
totalled £3,746.17. And it offered a further  £650  in compensation, which  Mr R didnt accept.
Mr R then referred his complaint to us in July 2018.   
In total Lloyds has recovered and refunded  £180,697.92 of the £323,600 the scammer took 
from Mr R. So Mr R remains  just over £142,902.08 out of pocket. 
I have set out a full list of the 43 transfers Mr R made later in this decision.   
Our investigation
One of our adjudicators reviewed the complaint. She was satisfied Lloyds had taken 
appropriate steps to correct its error  in not acting when Mr R called to report the fact hed 
been a victim of fraud in November 2017. However, she believed  Lloyds shouldve 
Ref: DRN91949582intervened sooner, and she felt that had it done  so, Mr R wouldve been  alerted to the scam 
after just a couple of days.  
The adjudicator pointed out that the pattern of spending on Mr Rs account was unusual; she 
said Lloyds shouldve been alerted to this through transaction monitoring and made  contact 
with Mr R to discuss it. She was persuaded that if this had happened Mr R wouldve realised 
he was being  scammed, just like when his IFA alerted him, and Mr R would have stopped 
transferring money  to the scammer. 
She explained that it was difficult to say at what point  exactly Lloyds shouldve intervened. 
She noted there was a balancing act for the bank to achieve in allowing a customer  
unrestricted access to their funds and it providing  an appropriate level of security and 
protection against fraud and scams.  
But she considered  Lloyds shouldve seen a pattern  developing after the first three larger 
transactions on 30 September 2017 (transfers 4 to 6). The new payee was set up the day 
before and three payments  were sent to the scammer, followed by three larger payments the 
following day over a much shorter space of time. The adjudicator concluded  these payments 
shouldve flagged with Lloyds that something unusual might  be occurring. 
As a result the adjudicator  recommended  Lloyds  refund Mr R the money it had not already  
returned to Mr R that he transferred after transfer six (£133,402.08), as well as interest and 
£1,000 compensation. 
Lloyds disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It said that having a system in place to 
identify and act on activity such as this would  significantly and negatively  impact a large 
group of people  who,  on the whole, were not the victim of a scam. It provided some  data to 
support - taking one months worth  of customer data from November 2018  (the year after Mr 
Rs transactions), and applying the criteria it said matched the pattern of spending on Mr Rs 
account during  the first two days  of the scam. The criteria it applied was:
the customer made 7 or more payments to the same beneficiary  within  24 hours  of 
the beneficiary being created;
the combined value  of those payments was £13,500 or more.
Lloyds told us there were  a total of 279 unique customers that met the criteria and 811 
transactions. None  of the customers reported those transactions  as fraud.  
I understand the point Lloyds is making to be that if -as the adjudicator  concluded -  it should 
fairly and reasonably have contacted Mr R when  he attempted  transfer  7, it should in 
practice also have contacted around 279 other customers in the same  month who were not 
fraud victims to discuss  the activity on their account.  It considers this to be an unreasonable  
expectation.          
The adjudicator responded to this point recognising the challenges that come with 
transaction monitoring. However, she explained that there is an expectation  on banks to 
monitor accounts for suspicious transactions and make contact with customers who are at 
risk of being  scammed.
Ref: DRN91949583Lloyds referred to the judges comments  in the case of Quincecare [Barclays  Bank plc v 
Quincecare Ltd [1992] 4 All ER 363] which it says supports that it is entitled and required to 
start from a position of trust in its customer and to process legitimate payment requests. It 
also pointed out that the spending on Mr Rs account during the scam was not that unusual  
when looking at the months  prior to September 2017. It explained that during  those  months 
Mr R had been making large transfers into and out of his account. So his spending during 
the scam  wouldnt have  appeared unusual for him.
Lloyds maintains that there was nothing  to distinguish this pattern of payments from many 
other customers with legitimate life events and to impose a burden on it to pick this up would 
go beyond legal or regulatory  standards.  
As Lloyds  remained  unhappy with the adjudicators opinion the complaint was passed  to me 
for a decision.
I issued a provisional decision, setting  out my thoughts, on 23 October 2019. 
In that decision  I acknowledged  that when considering what  is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of the complaint, Im required to take into account relevant: law and 
regulations; regulators  rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where 
appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the time. I remain  of the 
view that these considerations are the relevant ones. Ive set them out below:
relevant considerations
In broad terms, the starting position at law is that a bank  is expected  to process  payments 
and withdrawals that a customer  authorises  it to make, in accordance  with the Payment  
Services Regulations and the terms and conditions  of the customers  account.  And I have 
taken that into account  when deciding  what is fair and reasonable in this case.
But that is not the end of the story:
 The law recognises that a bank may be liable  to its customer if it makes  a payment in 
circumstances where  it has reasonable grounds  (although not necessarily proof)  for 
believing that the payment instruction was an attempt to misappropriate  the funds  of its 
customer (known as the Quincecare  duty).    
 Regulated firms like Lloyds are also required to conduct their business with due skill, 
care and diligence (FCA Principle for Businesses 2) and to pay due regard to the 
interests of its customers (Principle  6).  
And as a matter of good industry practice at the time, I consider firms should also have  taken 
proactive steps  to: 
identify and assist  vulnerable consumers  and consumers in vulnerable  
circumstances, including  those at risk of financial  exploitation (something recognised  
by the FCA in recent years and by the British Bankers Associations February 2016 
report improving outcomes for customers in vulnerable circumstances); 
look to identify and help prevent transactions - particularly unusual or out of character 
transactions  that could involve fraud or be the result of a scam (something also 
recognised by the British Standards Institutes October 2017  Protecting Customers 
Ref: DRN91949584from Financial  harm  as a result of fraud  or financial abuse  Code of Practice, which 
a number of banks and trade associations were involved in the development of); and 
in relation to branch transactions  follow  the Banking Protocol when available.     
This means  that there are circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, where a 
bank should, in my opinion,  fairly and reasonably take additional steps, or make additional 
checks, before processing a payment, or in some cases decline to make  a payment 
altogether, to help protect customers from the possibility of financial harm.  
This is particularly so in light of the environment created by the increase in sophisticated  
fraud and scams in recent  years  - which banks are generally more familiar  with than the 
average customer. 
my provisional decision
Having set out the relevant considerations in my provisional decision,  I made the following 
findings:
In this case, I need to decide  whether Lloyds acted  fairly and reasonably in its dealings  with 
Mr R when he made 43 payments totalling  £323,600  to a new payee over a period of two 
months, or whether it should have done  more than it did.
Ive set out all the payments Mr R authorised and sent to the scammer  below,  all made  
through online banking. I have included  the time for the first nine payments, but not the 
subsequent transactions.

Lloyds has suggested  the spending  on Mr Rs account during the scam was not that unusual 
given the activity on his account in the weeks leading up to 29 September  2017. It explained 
that during the three months prior to the scam,  Mr R made a number of large transfers into 
and out of his account. It said that during this period Mr R received £310,018.31 into his 
account over a number  of transactions.  And it said he made 18 large  payments from his 
account during  the same  period totalling £383,909.13.
Having reviewed Mr Rs statements, I dont think Lloyds is quite correct. Based on my review  
of Mr Rs statements, it would appear he made  17 large payments totalling £308,909.13  
£75,000 less than Lloyds has said was paid out. 
Nevertheless, I accept Mr R made  quite a few high value payments from his account  in the 
months preceding  the scam and I have taken that into account when deciding  whether 
Lloyds acted fairly and reasonably. But even if Lloyds might reasonably have thought  the 
pre 29 September  level of activity to be normal for Mr Rs account (and I am not persuaded it 
was given this particular period in time accounted for the receipt of inherited funds, and their 
subsequent movement),  his account  activity changed considerably  during the period of the 
scam from the period of activity which  preceded it. I say this for the following  reasons:
During the scam Mr R paid £323,600  to a single payee over the course of 43 
separate transactions in a two month period.  This is compared to Mr R making 17 
large debits to what seems to me to be six different accounts totalling £273,909.13  
over a longer  period of time,  prior to the scam.
During the scam, all 43 payments were  paid to the same new payee (another Lloyds 
account holder).  Prior  to the scam, the majority of the payments -12 out of the 17 - 
were paid to payees identified  as having Mr Rs initial and surname  so they appear  
to be transfers to Mr Rs other  accounts  and investments. 
During the scam between two and six payments were made  to the scammer on the 
same day on 14 separate days. Prior to the scam, between  two and three payments 
were made on the same day on just three occasions.
During the scam the payments to the scammer  were smaller and more  frequent  each 
day (on the whole), than they had been prior to the scam.
I think its also important to look at Mr Rs account activity during the first two days  of the 
scam in particular. Again this was different to what had gone before.
Ref: DRN91949587On day one, Mr R transferred £1,500 to the scammer in three  separate  transactions   these 
payments were made  over a short space of time (less than three hours). And by day two, Mr 
R had transferred a further £22,000 to the scammer, in six separate transactions.  Again, the 
payments were made  over a very short period of time (just over five hours).  
I can also see that, on the whole, Mr R made corresponding  transfers  into his account  from 
his other  accounts  to cover the payments he made to the scammer during those first two 
days. The transfers between his accounts, to pay the scammer, were also made  on the 
same day the money was paid. This is another distinction between  Mr Rs account  activity 
during the scam compared  with his previous account activity.
In my view a clear pattern had emerged  by the time the third payment was made on day two 
of the scam. This is because the payments on the second day followed a similar pattern to 
the payments  made on the first day of the scam   but with the payments being made in 
quicker succession and of an increasingly large  value.  
In my mind all of these changes during the period of the scam  amounted to unusual  account 
activity for Mr R. As Ive set out above, I consider that at the time the scam took place it was 
good industry practice for banks to be alive to and on the lookout for fraud, and I am satisfied 
this unusual activity  ought fairly and reasonably to have prompted  Lloyds to make additional 
checks when Mr R attempted to make  the fourth payment on day two (transfer number  7), 
notwithstanding Mr Rs previous recent account history which Lloyds has drawn my attention  
to.
The British  Standards Institutes Protecting  customers from financial harm  as a result  of 
fraud or financial abuse  Code of practice  (the BSI Code) gives recommendations to 
organisations for protecting  customers from financial harm  that might  occur as a result of 
fraud or financial abuse. It also gives guidance on how to recognise  customers  who might be 
at risk, how to assess the potential risks to the individual and how to take the necessary 
actions to prevent  or minimise financial harm. 
I recognise that the BSI Code was only introduced on 31 October 2017, so it came into force  
after some of the payments had already been  made by Mr R (although more than £243,000 
left Mr Rs account after that date), and I also recognise that Lloyds  was not itself a signatory 
to the BSI Code.
But I consider the BSI Code was in any event a reasonable articulation of what I consider to 
have already been good industry practice by the time Mr R made the initial payments and of 
the kinds of practical  steps businesses might fairly and reasonably take. I dont think the BSI 
Code suggested  wholly new practices.
 
Among other  things, the BSI Code said  and I consider this to have been good practice  
that businesses  should have measures  in place across all payment channels and products 
to detect suspicious transactions  or activities that might indicate  fraud  or financial abuse. 
And it gave  examples of what might amount to suspicious activity  on customer accounts:
a) multiple  chequebooks;
b) sudden  increased  spending; 
c) transfers to other  accounts; 
d) multiple  password attempts; 
e) logins from new devices, multiple geographical   locations; 
f) sudden changes to the operation of the account;  
Ref: DRN91949588g) a withdrawal or payment for a large amount; 
h) a payment or series  of payments to a new payee; 
i) financial  activity that matches  a known method of fraud or financial abuse  
In Mr Rs case Im satisfied: 
There were  sudden  changes to the operation of Mr Rs account   as I explained 
earlier Mr Rs account activity during the scam  was different to the months preceding 
the scam. And Im satisfied that change was evident as soon as the second  day of 
the scam.
A series of payments were sent to a new payee   43 individual payments were made 
to a new payee (the scammer), nine of which occurred over the first couple of days.
The account activity  was consistent with a known method  of fraud  I think the 
number of payments  made to the scammer  over a short period of time formed  a 
pattern consistent  with the possibility of fraudulent activity.
And Im also satisfied that Lloyds ought fairly and reasonably  to have done more and 
investigated the payments.
In response to the adjudicators view,  Lloyds said there is nothing to distinguish the pattern 
of payments on Mr Rs account during the scam  from many other customers  who want  to 
make legitimate payments. Its said it would impose  an unreasonable burden on it to pick up 
this kind of activity and this would go beyond  legal or regulatory standards. 
While I accept there is a balance to be struck between identifying payments that could 
potentially be fraudulent  and then responding appropriately to any concerns  and 
ensuring minimal disruption  to legitimate payments, I do not think  that means  Lloyds acted 
fairly and reasonably in Mr Rs case.   
Im satisfied the pattern of transactions meant Lloyds should reasonably have made  
additional checks at an early stage. And I do not think the fact that, applying the same 
criteria, Lloyds would have had to contact  other  customers (who  were not scam victims), 
means that it acted  reasonably in this case.
And even  if I were persuaded by Lloyds representations about  the unreasonableness of 
expecting it to contact  other customers with similar transaction patterns  (which having 
considered them carefully, Im not), I think is notable that Lloyds didnt take action at any 
point, even much later when few if any customers accounts would show similar patterns.     
 
Ultimately, how Lloyds  chooses to configure  its fraud detection systems given those 
competing concerns,  is ultimately a matter  for it to decide. But the question I need to 
consider here is: based on all the circumstances of this complaint, whether Lloyds ought 
fairly and reasonably to have done more in Mr Rs case  whether  its fraud  prevention 
systems detected the payment or not. And taking all of the above  into account, I think Lloyds 
should reasonably have  taken additional  steps, and if it had done, it is more  likely than not 
that those checks  would have prevented Mr R from being an ongoing victim of the scam at 
an early stage.  
And as Ive already explained,  I think the point Lloyds ought  to have made those  additional 
checks was when Mr R attempted to make the fourth payment on day two (transfer  number 
7).  
Ref: DRN91949589The new payee  (the scammer), had only been  set up the day before, and had already been 
used for three payments  on the first day. The payments on the second  day then followed a 
similar pattern   but with the payments being  made in quicker succession (09:27,  09:33 and 
10:31) and of an increasingly large value.  This was unusual  activity for Mr R  so these  
payments shouldve flagged that unusual account  activity was occurring, and Lloyds ought to 
have taken action  at this point.
Had Mr R not made  the payments he made in the three months before he was the victim of a 
scam, I might have concluded Lloyds should  have  had concerns slightly earlier.   
Lloyds has argued  that had any of the transactions been flagged,  as he was the genuine 
customer, hed have been able to answer the relevant security questions and wouldve 
confirmed he wanted to complete the transactions. But Im satisfied that Lloyds ought fairly  
and reasonably to have  done more than just ask whether Mr R wanted it to process the 
payment in order to satisfy itself that Mr R intended to authorise the payment.  
The BSI Code recommends that organisations should have a process in place to ensure  that 
staff make  contact with the customer to verify the financial activity,  challenge its authenticity,  
explain the nature of the suspected or detected fraud and discuss an appropriate plan of 
action. 
As Ive set out above, Im mindful of the limits of the relevance of the BSI Code to this 
complaint. But I am in any event satisfied that as a matter of good practice Lloyds should  
also have made enquiries about  the purpose  of the payment/payments with Mr R. And in 
addition, given the pattern of the payments,  I think  Lloyds should have alerted Mr R to the 
fact this activity was typical of fraudulent activity, and warned him he might be the victim  of a 
scam. 
Had Lloyds spoken  with Mr R before  it processed transfer number 7 (the fourth  payment on 
30 September 2017) - and asked him some  questions  about who he was transferring the 
money to, the reasons why, and the fact his account activity reflected typical  fraudulent  
activity, I think  its more  likely than not it wouldve dawned on him that he was being 
scammed. And as a result, I dont think hed have  transferred any more  of his money to the 
scammer. 
Mr R has explained that he had some suspicions about the requests  he received and I dont 
think it wouldve taken much for Lloyds to break the spell Mr R was clearly  under, in the 
same way it didnt take much for his IFA to convince Mr R he was being  scammed.  Im 
persuaded contact  from Lloyds  the broad content of which  Ive set out above - wouldve 
quickly cemented his suspicions, and deterred him from sending any more money to the 
scammer. 
I have thought about whether Mr R could be said to have  failed to mitigate his losses given 
his suspicions from the start of the scam. But Mr R has told me he asked the scammer 
numerous questions  about what the money was for, and he also sometimes  asked for 
evidence to demonstrate he was paying  for the items the scammer  had disclosed  (such as 
an invoice for alleged van hire). 
And when  thinking  about  whether Mr R acted  reasonably in the circumstances, I am mindful 
Mr R has described himself as vulnerable. Mr R told me hes been vulnerable  throughout his 
life having suffered from cancer as a child, losing his mum to cancer when he was 17, and 
then watching  his dad, who Mr R describes as his only and best friend,  die from cancer  a 
year before the scam  took place. 
Ref: DRN919495810Having considered what Mr R has said and the circumstances of the scam, I think  it is more 
likely than not the scammer  preyed  on Mr Rs vulnerability  offering to meet him and cook 
him dinner - which  in Mr Rs mind would go a long way to combat his loneliness.  Mr R also 
told me he was relatively reassured hed get his money back because the scammer had 
entrusted him with explicit photographs of herself, and provided him with the name and 
address of a relative who she told him would  pay him back. Mr R was the victim of a 
sophisticated and cruel scam. And while Mr R quite clearly regrets ever sending  any money 
to the scammer,  Im persuaded he took reasonable steps to reassure himself  of his actions 
at the time, particularly  when considering his vulnerable state.
For all the reasons Ive explained, I think its fair and reasonable, in the particular 
circumstances of this complaint, to say that Lloyds ought to have done more to help Mr R. 
Had it done so, Im persuaded Mr R wouldnt have suffered as much of a loss as he has and 
he wouldve stopped paying money to the scammer  after two days  and six transactions, 
rather than two months.
Finally, Ive considered  whether Lloyds should  fairly  pay Mr R more compensation for the 
distress and inconvenience hes experienced as a result of Lloyds actions. Lloyds has 
already paid Mr R £500  in recognition  of the distress and inconvenience hes experienced as 
a result of its actions. It has also offered to pay Mr R another £650 on top of this. 
In considering whats fair compensation,  Ive specifically thought about the impact of Lloyds 
actions, rather than the impact of the crime itself. Lloyds failure  to act, or take Mr R seriously  
when he initially reported that hed been the victim  of a scam  in November 2017 has had a 
lasting impact on him. As Ive explained,  Lloyds  had an opportunity  to prevent the 
continuation of the scam on day two. And on top of this it couldve  taken  action when Mr R 
reported the scam in November 2017   yet it didnt until January 2018. Lloyds offered further 
compensation to Mr R as late as July 2018. This has meant  that Mr R has continued to 
converse with Lloyds  over a long period of time. The back  and forth,  the fact an agreeable 
resolution to the complaint hasnt been  reached, and Lloyds view that it couldnt have done 
more to prevent  him being the ongoing victim  of a scam, has left Mr R feeling increasingly  let 
down, and unable  to move on from whats happened.  For these reasons, I think  Lloyds 
should pay Mr R a further £1000 in compensation, (in addition  to the £550 it has already 
paid).
responses to my provisional  decision 
Mr R accepted my provisional  decision.  Mr R provided some  further evidence to 
demonstrate his account activity was unusual during the scam, and he gave further  
explanation as to the purpose of the payments he made prior to the scam,  as well as 
information on how he typically  managed his account.
Lloyds has not accepted  my provisional decision. Ive summarised its key points  below.
Lloyds is sympathetic to how the scam  must have made Mr R feel but this should not 
outweigh the actions taken by Mr R and Lloyds  as the scam unfolded.
Lloyds continues to be of the view the transactions in question were  not seen as out 
of character and were typical of Mr Rs genuine spending during the three months 
prior to the scam. Mr R set up a new payee which  was confirmed as genuine.
Ref: DRN919495811There is a need for a balance between identifying payments that could be fraudulent 
and responding appropriately to these, but also ensuring minimal  disruption to 
legitimate payments.
Lloyds firmly believes that in order to flag the transactions  for further checks  there  
would be significant disruption to many  other  customers making legitimate payments.
Lloyds knew nothing  of Mr Rs circumstances  or the story behind the payments, so it 
was reasonable  to believe the payments were genuine. Lloyds believes that only with 
the benefit of hindsight  would  it become  apparent  that the payments may have been 
part of a scam.
Lloyds doesnt  think contact with Mr R during the initial days  of the scam would have  
made a difference. It has said it cant determine  a clear rationale (in my provisional 
decision) that engagement from the bank would have brought  about a different 
outcome. This is because  it believes Mr R would  have seen the payments as genuine 
and he would have  answered any questions appropriately.
Lloyds says that with the information  available to it, Mr R may only have become 
aware of the situation following a visit to his IFA and a number of broken promises by 
the fraudster.
Lloyds doesnt  think it should be held liable to refund £133,402.08.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I remain of the view that this decision should be upheld in part, for the reasons set out in my 
provisional decision, which I have reproduced  above, and which  now forms part of this final 
decision. Im not persuaded by the further  comments Lloyds has made,  and I believe Ive 
already dealt with them  in my provisional  decision.
Nevertheless, Id like to make some further  points.
I simply disagree with Lloyds view that the transactions in question werent seen as out of 
character and were typical of Mr Rs genuine  spend  in the three  months prior to the scam.  I 
set out the reasons why I considered this to be the case  in my provisional decision. 
I explained why I thought  Mr Rs account  activity changed considerably  during  the period of 
the scam  from the period  of activity which preceded it. And I explained why, in particular, the 
account activity  during  the first two days of the scam  was different to what had gone before, 
and in my view reflected  typical fraudulent activity.
I dont have anything  further to add on this point, other than that its disappointing  that in its 
response to my provisional  decision, Lloyds still doesnt appear to accept that it should  have  
intervened at any point.  In my opinion the question to answer was never  whether Lloyds 
should have intervened, but when  and I think that ought fairly and reasonably to have been 
before it processed  Mr Rs seventh payment  (as I explained in my provisional  decision).
Lloyds has also said it doesnt  think contact with Mr R, during the initial  days  of the scam, 
would have made a difference.  Its said that Mr R would have seen the payments as 
genuine, and would  have answered  any questions appropriately. It adds that Mr R may only 
have become aware of the situation following a visit to his IFA and broken promises by the 
scammer. 
Ref: DRN919495812I disagree with Lloyds. As I explained  in my provisional decision, Mr R had suspicions from 
the start of the scam. Because  of these suspicions I remain of the view that it wouldnt have 
taken much for a third party, unaffected by the spell of the scam  (such as his IFA or Lloyds),  
to break  the spell Mr R was under at the time. I remain persuaded that had Lloyds got in 
touch with Mr R and made enquiries  about the purpose of the payments, alerted him his 
account activity  was typical of fraudulent activity, and warned him he might be the victim of a 
scam, Mr Rs suspicions would  have  increased to such an extent that the spell he was under 
would have been broken,  and he wouldnt have sent any more money to the scammer.  
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Rs complaint about Lloyds Bank PLC in part.  
For the reasons  I have  set out above, Ive found  that Lloyds doesnt  have  to refund the first 
£9,500 Mr R paid to the scammer (transfers 1 to 6). Lloyds has already refunded 
£180,697.92 of the £323,600 that the scammer  took from Mr R. That leaves £133,402.08 
outstanding. 
So I require Lloyds  Bank PLC to:
Refund the first £133,402.08 (starting from transfer 7). Lloyds should pay interest  on 
each transfer  at the rate applicable to the savings accounts the money originally 
came from,  from the date it was transferred out of the savings accounts to the date of 
reimbursement.
Pay £1,000  compensation, in addition to the £550 already paid, for the material 
distress and inconvenience Mr R has experienced.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 December  2019.
