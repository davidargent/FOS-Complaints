The complaint
Mr J has complained that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA inappropriately shared his 
personal data with a third party.
What happened
Having previously been the victim of fraud, Mr J takes his online security very seriously and 
has taken steps to mitigate any future problems. One step he took was to have an email 
address that he only used to sign into his PayPal account on the basis that it would be more 
difficult for fraudsters to access that account if the email address was not in general 
circulation.
After making an online purchase to a gardening retailer (which Ill refer to as the merchant), 
whose website he signed into using a different email address, he was then contacted by the 
merchants courier company via his private PayPal email address. It became clear to Mr J 
that PayPal had shared his email address with the merchant who had subsequently passed 
it on to its courier.
Mr J says the merchant has accepted that it acted incorrectly in using information from 
PayPal to create customers account details. However, he holds PayPal ultimately 
responsible for failing to provide a secure service and not protecting his data.
Mr J has been so concerned about this issue that he has closed his PayPal account, which 
has caused him some inconvenience. 
Our adjudicator thought that PayPal had acted in line with its legal requirements and so 
didnt uphold Mr Js complaint. Mr J disagrees with the adjudicators opinion and so the 
complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In this decision, I can only look at Mr Js complaint against PayPal as the regulated financial 
business here. So I cant look at the actions of the merchant or hold PayPal responsible for 
anything the merchant itself may have done. 
It may also help to explain that if Mr J feels there has been a data breach by either PayPal or 
the merchant, then he may wish to contact the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) for 
them to investigate. 
When signing up to PayPal, Mr J would have needed to accept its User Agreement, which 
incorporated its Privacy Statement. That agreement contains information about how PayPal 
will share personal data. In brief, it explains that it may share information about customers 
and their accounts with other parties involved in processing transactions, which includes 
merchants and their service providers. That information might include Personal data and 
account information necessary to facilitate the transaction.
Mr J accepts that PayPal would need to share some of his data to enable a transaction. 
However, his view is that the sharing should be proportionate, so it cant use his information 
over and above what it needs to use it for. So, the question I need to consider independently 
and impartially is if it was fair and reasonable for PayPal to include Mr Js email address in 
the information it provided to the merchant.
PayPals general process is that it supplies merchants with the buyers name, email address 
and shipping address at the time an order is made. PayPal does not allocate account 
numbers to its customers and it is the email address that is the unique identifier for an 
individual customer. So, PayPal has explained that the email address is fundamental to 
sending and receiving customers payments through its systems. In my view, thats a 
reasonable explanation for why PayPal provided the email address to the merchant here, 
where it was needed to facilitate the transaction.
Ive thought very carefully about what Mr J has said. It is clear that he has strong views 
about online security, given his previous experiences. However, as the email address is a 
unique identifier for the account, on balance, Im satisfied that it was reasonable and 
proportionate of PayPal to share it with the merchant. This was in line with its terms and 
conditions and in the service of enabling a successful transaction.
Ive also not seen that Mr J suffered any financial detriment as a result of PayPal actions 
here. I realise he may be worried that this happened and is unhappy with PayPals systems 
and policies, which led to Mr J making the decision to stop using PayPal. But thats not 
something I can hold PayPal liable for. I understand he is now happily using alternative 
payment arrangements for his online transactions.
Mr J has provided suggestions about how PayPal could change its processes. However, as 
our adjudicator has mentioned, it is not the role of this service to stipulate how companies 
manage their businesses. 
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold Mr Js complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 October 2022.
