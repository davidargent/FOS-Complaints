The complaint
Mr A complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) failed to refund payments he says 
he didnt make. He wants PayPal to refund the payments.
What happened
Mr A holds a PayPal account and in March 2020 payments of £800 and £200 were made to 
his ex-partner, which Mr A says he didnt make.
Mr A says he awoke early morning of 17 March 2020 to emails from PayPal informing him of 
the payments from his account. On checking the payments made he realised they had been 
made to his ex-partner. Mr A says he didnt make these payments and that at the time he 
and his ex-partner were going through a breakup and that he was not staying at the same 
location as his ex-partner.
  
The first payment of £800 was made from the PayPal account around 4.48 am, followed by 
£200 at around 5.04 am. The PayPal account was then accessed, and the password 
changed around 6.26 am. The two payments made from the account and the change of 
password were made using different IP addresses. 
 
Mr As told us he didnt have his details written down and that he has never given anyone 
access to his account. He said he never used any of his ex-partners devices to login into his 
PayPal account but did explain that his ex-partner was with him a number of times when 
hes logged into his account. He believes that his ex-partner would have been aware/known 
the password as they used the same password for a few other things including his streaming 
service subscriptions. 
On 17 March 2020 Mr A contacted PayPal to raise claims about the two payments on his 
account on the basis they were unauthorised. 
PayPal investigated and decided not to refund the payments. It said there was no 
inconsistencies on Mr As account. It said there is no evidence of unauthorised use on 
Mr As account and that the password was used to login and send the payments. PayPal say 
when logging in - a customer is required to enter their registered email address and 
password. It adds that Mr A was prompted to authenticate his details and has provided 
examples of options that could be chosen. PayPal has said it cannot see which option Mr A 
chose but that the login was successful due to confirmation of one of the options being 
completed. PayPal added that had Mr A shared the password with his ex-partner he is liable 
for the losses incurred as per the PayPal User Agreement.
Mr A brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator recommended the complaint 
should be upheld saying, in summary, she found it likely from the evidence available that the 
transfers out of Mr As account were made without his authorisation. She also considered 
there to be a difference between Mr A using a password that his ex-partner knew existed 
and him deliberately telling her. As Mr A didnt share his password with his ex-partner, she 
didnt find hed acted grossly negligent. 
PayPal did not agree and asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman. In 
addition to the points it previously raised PayPal said that Mr A has agreed to its terms and 
conditions to keep his password safe. It referred to its user agreement which says customers 
must not reveal account passwords to anyone else and that PayPal would not be 
responsible for losses where a password has been misused. 
PayPal added that if Mr A decided to use the same password and share it with his ex-partner 
for other things, he did so of his own will. And that this would be considered as revealing his 
password.
As the matter hasnt been resolved, its been passed to me for a final decision. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold Mr As complaint. Ill explain why.
When considering what is fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where 
appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time. 
Authorisation 
Generally, PayPal can hold Mr A liable for the disputed payments if the evidence suggests 
that he most likely made or authorised them himself. 
PayPals user agreement requires its customers to keep their PayPal ID and/or 
password/PIN safe. It will also hold its customers liable if they deliberately enable a third 
party to gain access to the account, act fraudulently or the unauthorised transaction was 
caused by failure with intent or gross negligence to comply with their obligations.
It is not in dispute that two transfers totalling £1,000 were made from Mr As PayPal account. 
And from what Ive seen Im satisfied Mr A reported the payments to PayPal as 
unauthorised. So I have to decide whether I think Mr A made or authorised the payments 
and whether there is evidence that Mr A acted fraudulently or with deliberate or gross 
negligence. 
Having considered the evidence available, on balance, I dont think its reasonable for 
PayPal to conclude Mr A authorised the payments.  
As summarised above, PayPal has explained the process to log into the account. 
PayPals told us it does not accept that Mr As ex-partner accessed the account as 
there is no evidence she used his PayPal account. It adds that the ex-partner would 
need access to the registered mobile attached to his account if she chose the option 
of call or text to authenticate the details. 
Ive carefully considered the information PayPal has provided in relation to the 
possible options for authentication. But Im mindful when looking at the options 
available that while some would have required access to the registered mobile 
attached to the account, some of the other options would not have. And PayPal is 
unable to tell me which option was chosen. So, on balance, I cant safely say the 
option chosen to authenticate the details would have required access to Mr As 
registered mobile.Ive also considered the information provided in relation to the IP addresses of the 
login activity and transactions. Having done so, I can see both the transactions in 
dispute were carried out using the same IP address. And that there was a different IP 
address used following the transactions to log in and change the password. Given 
that each IP address is linked to a different location, Im persuaded this supports and 
appears to be consistent with Mr As testimony. He told us that he was not living with 
his ex-partner at the time of the transactions. That on receiving an email notification 
from PayPal early in the morning about the transactions he then logged in and 
changed his password. He then reported the transactions with PayPal.  
In view of the above, on balance, I find it more likely than not that the transactions 
were made without Mr As authority. 
Gross negligence and intent 
PayPals user agreement states its customers must not:
Reveal your account password(s) to anyone else, nor may you use anyone else's password. 
We are not responsible for losses incurred by you including, without limitation, the use of 
your account by any person other than you, arising as the result of misuse of passwords.
The user agreement also states it wont refund a customer when:
We can show that the payment was made because you did not keep your account safe 
either intentionally or with gross negligence (for instance, you very carelessly chose to share 
your PayPal ID and/or password/PIN with someone else)
PayPal considers that if Mr A decided to use the same password and share it with his ex-
partner for other things, he did so of his own will and that this would be considered as 
revealing his password. 
However, Im not persuaded Mr A intentionally failed to keep his account safe. And Im not 
persuaded he was so careless that no reasonable person wouldve acted as he did. Our 
service interprets gross negligence as a very significant degree of carelessness which goes 
significantly beyond ordinary negligence. 
Mr A told our service what happened in the lead up to the transactions. PayPal has been 
provided with Mr As recollection of events, which have been summarised above. In this 
case, I find the following relevant:
Mr A has been consistent in his testimony that he didnt reveal or share his PayPal 
password with his ex-partner or anyone and that he hadnt allowed anyone to log into 
his account and use it on his behalf. I am, however, mindful that Mr A said he 
believes his ex-partner would have been aware/known the password as he had used 
the same password for other things, such as his streaming service subscriptions. 
For me, what is important, are the particular circumstances of this case. Which are 
that Mr A was going through a breakup with his now ex-partner, that he was not living 
at the same location as his ex-partner at the time of the transactions and, the context 
of the relationship here. 
Mr A believes his ex-partner would have been aware/known the password as it was 
the same as his streaming service subscriptions. Ive thought carefully about this. However, Ive not seen anything that suggests Mr A actively shared or revealed his 
PayPal password. He has been consistent in his testimony and while I recognise the 
password was the same as other accounts he used, I dont consider Mr A to have 
deliberately and with intent shared his PayPal password. While I recognise that there 
are some risks that, if the relationship broke down, his ex-partner might deduce that 
this password was being used and use it, Im not satisfied that this amounts to such a 
degree of carelessness as to find he was grossly negligent.  
On balance, I find Mr A was not grossly negligent or intentionally breached his PayPal 
account terms by failing to keep his account secure. Instead, I find his version of what 
happened is plausible and persuasive. Mr A did not deliberately and with intent give his ex-
partner his password. It follows Im not persuaded Mr A has acted with gross negligence in 
the circumstances of this case. So, under the terms of PayPals user agreement PayPal 
should refund the money he lost.
Putting things right
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie (PayPal), SCA must:
 
Refund the two payments totaling £1,000 to Mr A 
Add 8% simple interest on that sum from the time the payments were made to the 
time they are refunded. The interest is taxable income, so PayPal can deduct income 
tax from the interest payment, but it should make it clear to Mr A if it does.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. And I direct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay redress to Mr A 
according to the directions Ive given above. 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2021.
