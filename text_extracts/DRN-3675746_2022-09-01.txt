The complaint
Mr M complains that Shop Direct Finance Company Limited irresponsibly lent to him.
What happened
Mr M held three home shopping credit accounts administered by Shop Direct. 
Account ending *9040 was opened in February 2011 with a £1,000 credit limit. The limit was 
increased three times between August 2011 and January 2014. With a fourth and final credit 
limit increase to £2,000 in April 2017.
Account ending *9571 was opened in November 2007 with a credit limit of £550. The limit 
was increased several times between 2008 and 2015. The final limit increase  to £2,000 
was made in June 2017.  
Account ending *1746 was opened in February 2012 with a credit limit of £1,000. The limit 
wasnt increased, and the account was closed in January 2015 after it had been repaid in 
full.
Mr M complained to Shop Direct saying that all three initial home shopping credit accounts 
and the subsequent limit increases had been approved irresponsibly  he didnt think 
enough checks were done to ensure the credit limits were affordable for him.
In a previous decision I concluded that this service couldnt consider the initial credit limits, or 
the limit increases approved before 2017. This was because Mr M had referred his complaint 
about those lending decisions too late. So, in this decision, Im solely considering the limit 
increases made to account ending *9040 in April 2017 and account ending *9571 in June 
2017.      
Shop Direct didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint about these credit limit increases. It said that it 
would have completed proportionate checks when these credit limits were increased. But it 
didnt provide details of the checks it had done in 2017. It explained that Mr Ms account 
balance on these accounts had never exceeded the initial credit limit it had approved in 2007 
and 2011 when the accounts had been opened. 
One of our investigators looked into it this. But he didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint about the 
2017 credit limit increases. He acknowledged that Mr Ms borrowing on both accounts had 
never exceeded the initial credit limit approved by Shop Direct. And so, he didnt think Mr M 
had lost out as a result of Shop Direct increasing the account limits in 2017.  
Mr M didnt agree, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When approving credit Shop Direct  like most lenders, is required to undertake 
proportionate checks to ensure the credit being provided is affordable for the consumer. But 
there isnt a set list of checks it is required to do.
Based on what Ive seen about this complaint, Ive reached the same conclusion to that of 
our investigator. Thats because I dont think Shop Directs actions have caused Mr M a 
financial loss. Ill explain why
Shop Direct has provided evidence of Mr Ms account balances from inception to 2017  
when the credit limits on the two accounts under consideration in this decision were 
increased for the final time. Having looked at this, Im satisfied that Mr Ms account balances 
never exceeded the initial credit limits that Shop Direct approved. 
So, I dont need to make a finding on whether proportionate checks were undertaken in April 
or June 2017. Even if Shop Direct hadnt done sufficient checks in 2017, Mr M has not 
suffered any detriment as he didnt use the additional credit provided.
 
I say that because financial redress is designed to put someone back in the position they 
would have been in had an error not happened. In this case, as Ive mentioned above,         
Mr Ms credit usage never exceeded the initial credit limit of £1,000 and £550 respectively. 
As such, even were I to think these credit increases were unreasonable, there would not be 
any redress to pay. 
So, while Im sorry to disappoint Mr M, I wont be telling Shop Direct to take any further 
action in respect of this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2022.
