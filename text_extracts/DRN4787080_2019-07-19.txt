K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid)  was irresponsible to lend 
him money.
background
Mr B took out 15 loans  with QuickQuid between September 2013 and August 2018. Mr B 
topped up some of these  loans.
Mr B wants  QuickQuid  to refund the interest and charges that he paid together with interest 
on the refund.
The adjudicator recommended that Mr Bs complaint should  be upheld  in part. In summary, 
she thought that QuickQuid  should not have  agreed loan seven and loans  11 to 15. 
The adjudicator asked QuickQuid to remove any negative information about loan seven from 
Mr Bs credit  file. She recommended that QuickQuid remove loans 11 to15 entirely from     
Mr Bs credit  file. The adjudicator also recommended  that QuickQuid  refund the interest and 
charges that Mr B had paid on the affected loans.
QuickQuid disagreed with the adjudicators view. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that 
QuickQuid should  fairly  and reasonably  have  done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN47870802There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think its important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook defines sustainable as being  
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. 
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if they will need to borrow  
more money to afford the repayments.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
As the adjudicator explained,  there are two separate periods of lending. This is because  
there were significant enough gaps in lending between loan two and three and then between 
loan seven and eight to effectively break the lending chains.  
At the beginning  of each period of lending, there wasnt anything  in the information that Mr B 
gave or the information that QuickQuid  shouldve been aware of which meant that it was 
unreasonable of QuickQuid  to agree to lend based  on what it knew about  Mr B.
loan seven
QuickQuid has told us that before agreeing loan seven, it asked Mr B for details of his 
income and outgoings. Although there had been a break in lending  between loans two and 
three, by the time Mr B applied for loan seven,  it was his fifth loan in just over six months. I 
think that QuickQuid  shouldve been doing more than it did to make  sure that Mr B could 
afford to repay the loan.
If QuickQuid had carried out the kinds of checks that I think  were  proportionate, it seems 
likely that it wouldve discovered that Mr Bs actual living costs and regular credit  
commitments meant he was only left with about  £200 disposable  income. The highest 
monthly repayment on loan seven was over £300. This meant that Mr B wasnt able to 
sustainably afford to repay the loan. It follows that I agree with the adjudicator that 
QuickQuid shouldnt have  lent loan seven to Mr B.
loan 11 onwards
Having looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history with Mr B; I think  
QuickQuid should  reasonably have  seen that he was unlikely to have been  able to make his 
loan repayments  in a sustainable  manner by the time it provided loan 11. I say this because:
Ref: DRN47870803by the time that Mr B applied for loan 11 hed been borrowing money for almost a 
year. In my view, Mr Bs pattern of borrowing was in itself a demonstration of his 
inability to settle his loans  over the life of his credit agreement.  
Although the amounts that Mr B was borrowing fluctuated, he had topped up the 
previous loan to £600 less than a month  after taking it out. And even though  Mr B 
borrowed less for loan 11 than for loan 10, he went on to top it up and then asked  to 
borrow more for loan 12. So Mr B wasnt making  any real inroads into what  he owed 
QuickQuid and his indebtedness was being prolonged. This meant that Mr B had 
been paying large amounts of interest  to, in effect; service a debt to QuickQuid over 
a long period.
QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr B was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole the repayment  of his previous loans left in his 
finances and that Mr Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
QuickQuid said that Mr B managed to repay the loans early  so there was nothing to indicate 
that he was experiencing financial difficulties. QuickQuid said that it isnt possible to 
determine whether  Mr B was able to sustainably  repay each loan without analysing Mr Bs 
particular circumstances  at the time of each loan application.   
I think that QuickQuid will know (or should  know) from previous decisions that this service  
considers there will be times  when  the pattern of lending alone is enough to indicate that its 
likely the customer is experiencing financial difficulties or would  otherwise  be harmed by 
further lending.  So it follows that a good  repayment history doesnt automatically  mean  that 
Mr B could afford to repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. 
I think that Mr B lost out because QuickQuid provided loans 11 to 15 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the extended period of time he owed QuickQuid money was likely to have had 
negative implications on Mr Bs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Bs complaint about  loans seven and 11 to 15.
Ref: DRN47870804putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges that Mr B paid on loans seven and 11 to 15;
 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;  
remove any negative information  about loan seven from Mr Bs credit file; and
the number  of loans taken by the time of loan 11 means that any information about loans 
11 to 15 is negative. So all entries  about  loans 11 to 15 should be removed from Mr Bs 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint in part and direct  CashEuroNet UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 August 2019.
