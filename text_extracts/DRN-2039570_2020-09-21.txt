The complaint
Mr L is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc reported that it had carried out credit 
searches to credit reference agencies when he applied for a current account.
What happened
Mr L applied for a current account with NatWest in February 2020. He has explained he 
didnt apply for an overdraft so was not looking to borrow money / credit.
As part of the application NatWest performed two searches of Mr Ls credit file. This 
information was reported to credit reference agencies and recorded on Mr Ls credit file. The 
application for the current account was later declined.
Mr L complained to NatWest about the information it had reported. He said he hadnt applied 
for credit, so this information was misleading as it indicated he had  and he also questioned 
why there had been two searches for one application. Mr L said NatWest hadnt made him 
aware it would record information with credit reference agencies when he applied. And he 
said the searches had caused a reduction in his credit score  which might affect future 
applications. Mr L also said he hadnt received an explanation why the application was 
declined.
NatWest said it didnt think it had done anything wrong. It said that when a someone applies 
for a current account, it always conducts credit searches regardless of whether they are 
applying for an overdraft. It also felt it had made Mr L aware of this in advance  hed applied 
online and NatWest says information is provided, before someone proceeds with an 
application, to explain data would be shared with credit reference agencies.
Unhappy with this response Mr L asked our service to look into his complaint. 
One of our investigators considered the complaint. Having done so, he didnt think NatWest 
had made a mistake by performing a credit search. Based on what hed seen he thought this 
was in line with NatWests application process. He also felt NatWest had given sufficient 
information in advance to make Mr L aware this would happen. And he didnt think NatWest 
needed to provide an explanation as to why the application was declined  as this was its 
commercial decision.
Our investigator did ask NatWest why two searches had been recorded for one application. 
NatWest acknowledged that there should only have been one search and agreed to arrange 
to remove the second search from Mr Ls credit file. Our investigator thought this was fair.
Mr L did not agree with the investigators opinion. He said that the information being reported 
by NatWest was incorrect as he hadnt applied for credit and he did not think NatWest had 
done enough to get his agreement before the credit search took place. So, he asked for his 
complaint to be reviewed. As a result, it has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has sent us details of the information it provides to applicants online, before a 
current account application is made. There is a section about how information will be used, 
and it recommends that the person making the application read a summary of this before 
proceeding. The summary explains that, amongst other things, NatWest will share 
information with credit reference agencies. And it explains that one of the purposes of doing 
so is so that NatWest can perform a credit check. The notes also explain that any check may 
affect an applicants credit score. 
I think this information is sufficiently clear that an application for a current account with 
NatWest will result in a credit check. NatWest has explained this is part of its lending criteria 
 which it is entitled to decide at its commercial discretion.
It isnt in dispute that Mr L applied for a current account with NatWest in February 2020. And 
he applied for this online. I think it was reasonable for NatWest to assume, as it had made 
this information available to Mr L, that he understood that a credit check would be carried 
out. And so, based on the information Ive seen, I dont think NatWest did anything wrong by 
recording a search on Mr Ls credit file when he applied for a current account with it.
Mr L argues that he wasnt applying for credit, as he didnt request an overdraft. But the 
information NatWest made available before his application was made doesnt say that there 
wont be a credit check if there is no overdraft applied for. So, I dont think this would mean 
NatWest was not entitled to carry out a credit check. 
Mr L also says that the fact that no credit was applied for makes the search misleading. But I 
dont agree. A credit search represents a review by a lender, or other business, of the 
information held with a credit reference agency about a person when considering an 
application. The application does not necessarily have to involve credit being provided. For 
example, utility providers often carry out credit checks. 
Here Mr L applied for an account with NatWest. NatWest made information available 
beforehand to say that a credit search would be carried out if Mr L proceeded with the 
application. And this is what happened  for the purposes of NatWest deciding whether it 
was willing to provide an account to Mr L. 
So, taking everything into account, I dont think NatWest was wrong to carry out a credit 
check or that it has made a mistake by reporting to credit reference agencies that it did so.
NatWest does appear to have made a mistake by recording two searches on Mr Ls credit 
file. As only one application was made, Id have only expected there to be one search 
recorded. But here weve seen evidence that two were recorded  one in February 2020 and 
a second one in March 2020. NatWest has acknowledged that the second search was not 
necessary, and it says it has instructed credit reference agencies to remove that second 
search from Mr Ls credit file. I think this is fair.Mr L has said his credit score has been impacted by the searches NatWest recorded against 
him. Hes provided an extract from his credit file showing that his credit score has reduced 
but has declined to provide a full copy of his credit file. I dont doubt that a second credit 
search having been recorded is likely to have impacted his credit score. But as Ive already 
explained, I dont think NatWest made a mistake by recording one of the searches against 
him, which would always have had some impact on his overall score. And based on the 
information available, I cant say on balance that the second search recorded by NatWest 
was the only factor responsible for the reduction in Mr Ls credit score. And in any event, Ive 
not seen anything to suggest that this reduction in his credit score has caused Mr L a 
financial loss. So, with that in mind, I dont think NatWest needs to do more here.
Turning to the application itself having been declined, Mr L has indicated he is unhappy that 
NatWest has not explained why this happened. But NatWest is entitled to decide if it is 
willing to provide accounts to a customer. And here it has decided it was not willing to 
provide Mr L with a current account. Beyond communicating that decision, I dont think 
NatWest is required to provide a reason for this. So, I dont think NatWest has made an error 
in this regard.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, I find that, by arranging to remove the unnecessary 
second search from Mr Ls credit file, National Westminster Bank Plc has provided a fair 
resolution to Mr Ls complaint. So, I dont require it to do more. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 October 2020.
