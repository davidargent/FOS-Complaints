K820x#14complaint
Mr G complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA has made a number of payments  which
he says he didnt authorise.  He says that there  were  a number of duplicate payments and
that in total PayPal had paid out around  Â£3,000 more than he had authorised   over a period  
of about six weeks.
background
Mr G has a PayPal account  which he uses to make purchases on eBay.  He said though that
there were a number  of payments  he didnt recognise and which were made between July
and September  2017. At first he didnt specify which payments he was disputing, only that
there were many more  than he was expecting.
When he referred the matter to this service, we asked PayPal to review  all the payments 
over 120 in total  that had been  made  in the relevant  period.
A large  number of payments  had been  made to pay for eBay purchases, and PayPal was
able to provide  more  information showing that they were linked to Mr Gs registered email
and postal addresses. Our adjudicator was satisfied that these payments were genuine, in
the sense that Mr G had bought items and received them as he expected.
In addition, though, there  were more than 50 payments described  as personal payments
made to an individual. PayPals personal payment service  allows  individuals  to transfer
funds to another PayPal account holder, even where  theres  no linked purchase or other
transaction involved. So, unlike the eBay purchases, there was nothing  in PayPals records
to show what the payments  were for and no evidence  that anything  had been provided or
delivered to Mr G in return.
PayPal provided  information  about  the recipient of the funds.  Mr G acknowledged that he
knew the individual concerned, who was a former neighbour.  He initially  described her as a
passing acquaintance, but later clarified  that she was his girlfriends  mother. He provided
some contact details for her. He didnt believe however that she had ever been in his house 
(so it was unlikely shed  been able to access his PayPal account).
Our adjudicator recommended  that PayPal refund the value of the personal payments. She
said, in summary, that PayPal hadnt shown that Mr G had authorised them  and that the
effect of relevant regulations was that PayPal should refund them.
PayPal didnt accept  the adjudicators conclusions and asked that an ombudsman  review
them. I did that and issued a provisional decision.  I didnt accept  as PayPal had suggested 
 that there was collusion  between Mr G and the recipient of the payments. But I did note 
that Mr G hadnt initially  provided much  information about the payments or his relationship  
with the recipient of the funds. I also noted that Mr G hadnt  taken  any steps to recover  the 
money from the recipient. This was not a case where Mr Gs account had been taken over 
by someone unknown to him  if indeed it had been  taken over at all. He might,  therefore,  
have an alternative  means  of recovery. 
I concluded, provisionally, that Mr G hadnt  provided this service  or PayPal with the full 
picture of what had happened. In the circumstances, I didnt believe it would be fair to 
recommend that PayPal  refund them. I did however give both parties  but in particular Mr G 
 an opportunity to make  further submissions before I reached my final decision.  Neither  Mr 
G nor PayPal has had anything further to add.      
Ref: DRN66241962my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Since Ive received no further evidence or arguments since  I issued my provisional  decision, 
I see no reason to change  my view or the reasons  for it.
my final decision
For these reasons, as well as those  set out in my provisional decision,  my final decision is 
that I dont  require PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA to take any further  steps to resolve Mr 
Gs complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr 
G to accept or reject my decision before 31 January  2020.
