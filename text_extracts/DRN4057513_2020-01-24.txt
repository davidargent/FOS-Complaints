K821x#15Complaint
Mr and Mrs W complain about problems they experienced with National Westminster Bank 
Plc while they were  applying for a loan.  
Background
In April 2018 Mr and Mrs W applied for a joint loan with NatWest.  They  wanted to 
consolidate two existing loans with the view of reducing the interest  rate and repaying the 
balance quicker.  
There were extensive problems with the applications which  were  declined after Mrs Ws 
existing loan was incorrectly  referred  to the collections department.  There  were other delays 
as well when loan applications werent progressed as agreed and lapsed. 
Mr and Mrs W had unsuccessful applications in April,  May and June 2018. Mrs W has told 
us that during the June  2018 application the rate applied  for was 10.4% but it wasnt 
successful. 
A final application was made in August 2018  and it was successful.  But the loan amount had 
reduced from £10,150 to £8,600. The interest rate approved  was 14.1%. 
Mr and Mrs W have  complained several times throughout the process. NatWest has issued 
several responses and paid a total of £960  in compensation for the way the applications 
were handled.  It also waived £454 of loan payments and sent a gift to apologise. NatWest 
took steps to remove records of their credit searches for the unsuccessful applications from 
Mr and Mrs Ws credit files as well. 
Mr and Mrs W referred their complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. 
The investigator upheld  their complaint and said NatWest should  honour the 10.4% interest  
rate Mr and Mrs W would likely have received if their June 2018 application had been 
successful. NatWest didnt agree. It said the loan application for 10.4% had never actually 
been approved  and that Mr and Mrs W benefited from the delay by not having to take out 
such a large loan. NatWest asked  to appeal so the complaint has been passed  to me to 
make a decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive been reasonably brief above in setting out the background  to this complaint as all parties 
broadly agree about what happened. And NatWest has upheld their complaint and paid 
£960 to Mr and Mrs W in addition to waiving £454  of loan payments and sending them a gift. 
I can see that this situation  went on for a very long time and NatWest made several 
important mistakes. Im satisfied the compensation paid for the distress and inconvenience 
caused fairly reflects the impact of the situation  on Mr and Mrs W. 
Mrs Ws responses to the investigator centre on the interest rate they finally  got of 14.1%. 
Mrs W says they should get a rate of 10.4%, in line with their loan application in June 2018.  
The investigator upheld  the complaint on that basis. I agree that, in addition to the above  
compensation, NatWest  should amend Mr and Mrs Ws loan rate to 10.4%. 
Ref: DRN40575132NatWest says it didnt approve the June 2018  loan application at 10.4%. I accept thats  the 
case. But the application didnt proceed because of mistakes by NatWest,  not because  it 
was unwilling to lend to Mr and Mrs W. I need to consider what  would have happened if 
NatWest hadnt  made errors with the application  in June 2018 and I think its most  likely it 
would have been approved. Mr and Mrs Ws subsequent loan application was correctly 
processed by NatWest and approved. So I think its more likely than not that the June 2018 
would have been successful as well if it had been  processed correctly. 
NatWest says the loan amount changed between applications which means they arent 
comparable. But Mr and Mrs W were borrowing to consolidate existing debt. Because of the 
delays by NatWest  the existing  debt they needed  to consolidate reduced in size  
Mr and Mrs W were making monthly  repayments. As a result, Mr and Mrs W only needed 
£8,600 instead of £10,150 when they applied again  in August 2018. I dont think its fair to 
expect Mr and Mrs W to have borrowed more than they needed because NatWest made 
mistakes with their applications. 
I asked NatWest to provide details of the rates on offer when Mr and Mrs W applied again  in 
August 2018 to see if the 10.4% rate would have been available if the loan amount had 
remained at £10,150.  But NatWest says its not possible to say whether that rate would have 
been available to Mr and Mrs W. NatWest  has sent details of representative  rates that were 
applicable in August  2018 and they appear  to be in line with those  available  in June 2018. 
Taking everything Ive seen into account, I agree with the investigator that this complaint  
should be upheld  and that NatWest  should  amend the interest rate on Mr and Mrs Ws loan 
from 14.1%  to 10.4%. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. In addition to the compensation already paid I 
direct National  Westminster Bank  Plc to do the following: 
-Amend Mr and Mrs Ws loan interest rate to 10.4%
-Refund any interest applied above that rate to Mr and Mrs W.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs W to 
accept or reject my decision  before  24 February  2020.
