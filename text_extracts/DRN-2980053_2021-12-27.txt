The complaint
Mrs S has complained that CarCashPoint Limited lent to her irresponsibly.  
What happened
Mrs S was given two logbook loans by CarCashPoint in 2018 and 2019. The loans were 
secured against a vehicle that she owned.
Loan 1 in June 2018 was for around £2,560 and due to be repaid in 60 monthly instalments 
of around £221. The total amount to be repaid including interest was just over £13,312.
Loan 2 in September 2019 was for around £4,896 and was due to be repaid in 60 monthly 
instalments of around £424. The total amount to be repaid including interest was just over 
£25,459. Mrs S used the second loan to settle Loan 1 and took an amount in cash.
One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint. He didnt think CarCashPoint should have 
provided Mrs S with either loan and he asked the lender to put things right. CarCashPoint 
didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment. As the complaint hasnt been settled, it has 
been passed to me to resolve the matter.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
  Weve set out our approach to considering unaffordable and irresponsible lending 
complaints on our website - including the key relevant rules, guidance, good industry 
practice and law. And Ive considered this approach when deciding Mrs Ss complaint.
I think there are overarching questions I need to consider in order to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this particular complaint:
Did CarCashPoint complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mrs S would be able to repay her loans in a sustainable way? If so, did it make a fair 
lending decision each time? If not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks 
have shown at the time?
Did CarCashPoint act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
CarCashPoint needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend to Mrs S 
irresponsibly. This means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that she could repay the loans in a sustainable way. The lender was required to carry out a 
borrower focussed assessment each time - sometimes referred to as an affordability 
assessment or affordability check. 
The checks had to be borrower focussed  so CarCashPoint had to think about whether 
repaying the loans sustainably would cause any difficulties or adverse consequences for Mrs 
S. In other words, it wasnt enough for CarCashPoint to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of loan repayments on Mrs S.
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of each loan application. 
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer, such as their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications 
of vulnerability or financial difficulty and the amount / type / cost of credit they are seeking. 
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough: 
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); and 
the longer the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit is 
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make payments for an extended 
period) and 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,  
unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered all the evidence, arguments and information Ive seen about this 
matter and what it means for Mrs S. 
CarCashPoint says it asked Mrs S for information about her income and expenditure, but it 
wasnt its usual practice to carry out formal credit checks at the time. The lender thinks that 
the both the loans were affordable for Mrs S. 
Loan 1
I would have expected CarCashPoint to want to gather enough information for it to have a 
thorough understanding of Mrs Ss financial position, to ensure that she could repay her loan 
sustainably over an extended period. Given that the lender didnt carry out a formal credit 
check, I think it would have been proportionate for CarCashPoint to have taken steps to 
independently verify Mrs Ss circumstances, and to check her regular monthly expenditure - 
for example by requesting bank statements - rather than rely largely on information that Mrs 
S was providing about her expenditure.
And from what Ive seen, CarCashPoint did review Mrs Ss bank statements from a joint 
account she held with her husband. But I dont think that CarCashPoints checks went far 
enough or that it made a fair lending decision on this occasion and I will explain why. 
CarCashPoint was providing Mrs S with an expensive loan, repayable over an extended 
period. I think that when CarCashPoint reviewed Mrs Ss joint bank account statements it 
would have become aware that Mrs Ss finances were showing signs of financial distress: 
the account was fairly consistently overdrawn; in March the account only went into credit due 
to other high cost lending; there were unplanned fees and bank charges and opening and 
closing balances that remained overdrawn; expenditure shown on the account regularly 
seemed to exceed income and there appears to be other high cost lending and credit being 
taken, beyond what Mrs S had declared. I think CarCashPoint ought reasonably to have realised that Mrs Ss income might not be sufficient to support the large number of credit 
repayments showing on the joint account. CarCashpoint referred to Mrs Ss husbands 
income in its Final Response which suggests that the lender was taking his income into 
account. But this was sole lending to Mrs S, so CarCashPoint was required to establish 
whether Mrs S had sufficient disposable income to meet her loan repayments, without 
relying on her husbands income.
As Ive already explained, CarCashPoint was required to establish whether Mrs S could 
sustainably make her loan repayments. On balance, I think CarCashPoint ought reasonably 
to have recognised from the information it gathered that Mrs S may be having some difficulty 
managing her financial situation. And so it would have been reasonable and proportionate to 
have looked at Mrs Ss wider financial circumstances by carrying out further checks.
Mrs S has provided bank statements from her sole bank account at the time which show a 
number of other high cost loans. I think reasonable and proportionate checks by 
CarCashPoint would have uncovered more about Mrs Ss true financial position and the 
lender would most likely have discovered that she was borrowing from several other high 
cost lenders and she had other creditors. 
CarCashPoint says Mrs S had sufficient disposable income to afford the monthly 
repayments. But I think CarCashPoint focussed its calculation of whether loan 1 was 
affordable for Mrs S on a pounds and pence basis. And as Ive already explained, the lender 
was required to establish whether the borrower could sustainably meet the loan repayments 
 not just whether the loan payments were technically affordable on a strict pounds and 
pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
On balance, I think CarCashPoint ought reasonably to have realised that Mrs S was 
borrowing to keep up with her ongoing financial commitments and that it was most likely she 
would need to borrow elsewhere to repay her loan. I think the lender ought to have realised 
that given her financial circumstances, it was unlikely that Mrs S would be able to 
sustainably repay the loan over the extended term. So it ought reasonably to have declined 
to provide her with the first loan.
Loan 2
Mrs S returned to borrow for a second time around 15 months into the 60 months term for 
loan 1. CarCashPoints customer contact notes indicate that Mrs S experienced some 
difficulties repaying her first loan, but it still lent to her for a second time. I understand that 
Mrs S used her second loan to settle loan 1 and she took the remainder in cash.
On balance, I dont think CarCashPoint made a fair lending decision when it provided Mrs S 
with the second loan. I think the information CarCashPoint gathered from the joint bank 
statements ought reasonably to have suggested that Mrs S was not making any headway 
into repaying her existing creditors and that she was most likely continuing to rely on an 
overdraft to meet her regular financial commitments as well potentially borrowing from other 
high cost and payday lenders. Mrs S was returning only just over a one year into a five-year loan term to borrow again  and her overall indebtedness to CarCashPoint was substantially 
increasing. Mrs S says she told CarCashpoint that she was in arrears on her mortgage 
payments. CarCashPoint disputes this. Overall, I cant be sure exactly what was discussed 
at the time but I think CarCashPoint had sufficient information for it to be reasonably aware 
that Mrs S might be struggling financially when she applied for further lending and so it ought 
reasonably to have looked deeper into her financial circumstances. Had it done so, I think it 
would most likely have realised that it was unlikely that Mrs S would be able to repay the 
second loan sustainably.
Taking everything into account, I think CarCashPoint ought reasonably to have realised that 
Mrs S was struggling financially and that she would most likely be unable to sustainably 
repay the further lending over the extended loan term. I think in the circumstances 
CarCashPoint ought reasonably and fairly to have concluded that it wouldnt be appropriate 
to provide Mrs S with the second loan.
I havent seen anything which makes me think that CarCashPoint treated Mrs S unfairly in 
any other way. But I dont think it should have provided the loan to her. So CarCashPoint 
needs to put things right.
Putting things right
I think its fair and reasonable for Mrs S to repay the principal amount that she borrowed, 
because she had the benefit of that lending. But she has paid interest and charges on loans 
that shouldnt have been provided to her. I think Mrs S has lost out and CarCashPoint should 
put things right for her.
If CarCashPoint sold any outstanding debt payable in respect of Mrs Ss loans, it should buy 
it back from the third party, if its able to do so, and then take the following steps. If 
CarCashPoint isnt able to buy any outstanding debt back then it should liaise with the new 
debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
CarCashPoint should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges from both loans and treat all the payments 
Mrs S made as payments towards the capital. 
If reworking Mrs Ss loan account results in her having effectively made payments 
above the original capital borrowed, then CarCashPoint should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled*. 
If reworking the account leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, then 
CarCashPoint should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mrs S, 
bearing in mind its obligation to treat her positively and sympathetically in these 
discussions.
CarCashPoint might have already returned the logbook to Mrs S, but if it has not 
done this, it should cancel the bills of sale and return the V5 document to her 
once any outstanding capital has been repaid.
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mrs Ss credit file in relation to the 
loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to deduct tax from this interest. 
CarCashPoint should give Mrs S a certificate showing how much tax its deducted if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Ss complaint and direct CarCashPoint Limited to put 
things right as set out above.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 January 2022.
