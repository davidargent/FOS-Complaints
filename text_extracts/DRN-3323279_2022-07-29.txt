The complaint
Mr C complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has not refunded him for an item he paid 
for but didnt receive.
What happened
Mr C brought an item from a seller and used PayPal to pay for it. Mr C paid approximately 
£220 for the item but says he didnt receive it. 
Mr C says he spoke to the delivery company but they told him the seller needed to raise the 
issue with them directly. But the seller wouldnt communicate with Mr C. 
Mr C says he registered a claim with PayPal. He says PayPal rejected his claim because the 
seller had provided evidence of delivery. Mr C says the evidence is a photograph of the 
parcel outside his block of flats and a tracking number.  
Mr D subsequently complained. PayPal looked into his complaint. It didnt uphold it and told 
Mr C the seller had provided PayPal with tracking information that showed the item was 
successfully delivered. And so the case was decided in the sellers favour. 
PayPal said it was satisfied the item was delivered to Mr Cs front porch. And its user 
agreement stipulates a purchaser doesnt qualify for a refund under its buyer protection if the 
seller has provided proof of delivery. PayPal said there was no error and the claim was 
closed correctly since the seller provided tracking information.
Mr C wasnt happy with the response received from PayPal and so brought his complaint to 
this service. One of our investigators looked into his concerns. He upheld the complaint as 
PayPal hadnt provided evidence the item had been delivered since the photograph showed 
the parcel outside a porch when Mr C lives in a block of flats and doesnt have a porch. The 
investigator also said PayPal hadnt taken Mr Cs version of events into account when 
looking into the claim. 
PayPal said it would be unfair to uphold the complaint since PayPal werent responsible for 
the delivery, and Mr C should direct his complaint to the courier company. And so the case 
has been passed to me for review. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPals user agreement includes protection for buyers. It provides for buyers to be able to 
claim their money back where goods they have purchased havent been received. 
After Mr C raised his claim with PayPal the seller provided tracking information in response 
to the claim. The tracking information provides details of the address, date, and time of 
delivery. There is also an accompanying photograph showing a parcel leaning against what 
appears to be an exterior wall with a closed door in the background. The delivery information 
says the parcel was left in the porch. As a result PayPal closed the claim. 
But Mr C says he doesnt have a porch since he lives in a block of flats. And the photograph 
doesnt explicitly show the parcel was delivered to Mr Cs address. So I dont think what the 
seller has provided counts as evidence of delivery since Mr Cs version of events is entirely 
possible. Even when taking the sellers evidence into consideration. 
PayPal has also argued Mr C should direct his complaint to the courier since it acts as a 
payment service and is not responsible for delivery. But as the investigator explained, the 
seller has a contract with the courier company and not the buyer. And so I would expect the 
seller to contact the courier. 
Mr C and PayPal provided a copy of the tracking update received from the delivery 
company. But I dont think it shows the item was delivered to Mr Cs address. The difficulty I 
have is I dont have enough evidence to safely say the item was delivered to Mr C. The trail 
leads to what appears to be the entrance of the block of flats. But its not clear.
I understand that since our investigator issued his view of Mr Cs complaint the seller has 
provided Mr C with a replacement item. But Mr C asked for an ombudsman to review his 
case in any event. He says he only received the replacement because of the numerous calls 
and messages he made to the seller, rather than any assistance from PayPal. 
Putting things right
Given the inconvenience to Mr C in trying to deal with his missing parcel I think PayPal 
should pay him £50 for the distress and inconvenience caused to him. 
My final decision
So for the reasons set out above Im upholding Mr Cs complaint against PayPal (Europe) 
Sarl et Cie SCA. 
I direct PayPal to pay Mr C £50 in resolution of this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 August 2022.
