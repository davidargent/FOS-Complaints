K820x#14complaint
Mr E complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA unfairly blocked his account. He wants  
PayPal to provide  an explanation for its actions. 
Background
In September  2001, Mr E opened an account  with PayPal. In May 2018, PayPal conducted a 
review of Mr Es account. Following its review PayPal told Mr E that a permanent  limitation  
had been applied to his account due to a violation of its acceptable  use policy.
 
One of our investigators  looked into Mr Es complaint. He explained why he didnt think 
PayPal had done anything wrong. Mr E disagreed. So, the complaint has come  to me to 
decide.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as the investigator. Ill explain why.
The user agreement which Mr E would have agreed  to when he opened his account in 2001 
with PayPal sets out the terms under which PayPal operates the account. And these allow  
PayPal to limit or close an account  if it wishes to do so.
PayPal reviewed the use of Mr Es account  and identified an issue  with the use of it. And it 
decided to permanently  limit the use of the account.  I know  Mr E is frustrated that he hasnt 
been given a detailed reason as to why PayPal has done this. But its not obliged  to do so. 
Having said that I can see that when PayPal  wrote to Mr E in August 2018 to let him know  it 
had limited his account, it did provide Mr E with an explanation for its actions. So, I think  
Mr E had some understanding of the reason behind PayPals decision.  
Mr E says he hasnt done anything wrong and PayPal hasnt given him an opportunity to 
defend himself. But it is a matter of commercial judgement on PayPals part if it chooses  to 
end its relationship with Mr E. So, I cant say it has done anything wrong.
In summary,  I recognise how strongly Mr E feels about whats happened.  But based on the 
information Ive seen, I cant say PayPal has acted  unreasonably and treated Mr E unfairly.  
Im satisfied that PayPal  has followed its processes and the terms of its user agreement. So, 
I dont think its done anything wrong by permanently  limiting Mr Es account.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 March  2020.
