Mr H says CashEuroNet UK LLC (CEN), trading as QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket, lent 
to him irresponsibly.
Background
Mr H had ten loans  with CEN. The QuickQuid  (QQ)  loans were generally payday loans, 
repayable in between one and three  monthly  payments. The exception  to this is loan 10, 
which was a FlexCredit facility  this allowed Mr H to make drawdowns  up to a credit limit of 
£650 and then repay those drawdowns in up to ten months. The Pounds to Pocket (PtP)  
loans were instalment  loans, repayable  in monthly instalments over about  one year.

An adjudicator considered  Mr Hs complaint and recommended it be upheld  in part. She 
didnt think CEN shouldve approved loans 3 or 4 or loans  7 to 10. CEN didnt agree with this 
but did make  an offer in respect  of loans 3, 4 and 7 (having already made an offer in respect 
of loan 7 in its final response  letter).
As there was no agreement, the complaint has been passed to me to decide. Theres been 
no further dispute about the loans the adjudicator  didnt  think were lent irresponsibly (1, 2, 5 
and 6) and CEN has made a fair offer in respect  of loans 3, 4 and 7. My decision will 
therefore focus on the unresolved complaint about loans 8 to 10.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
CEN needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
Ref: DRN31580482consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CEN  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CEN was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. The OFTs  irresponsible lending guidance  defined sustainable  as being without 
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, 
while meeting  other reasonable  commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Having done so I agree with the adjudicator  that by loan 7, CEN should reasonably have 
seen that further  lending  would be unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful  to Mr H. And so CEN  
should have realised that it shouldnt have provided  loans 8 to 10. I say this because:
By the time he requested loan 8, Mr H had been borrowing from CEN for about eight 
months and there was a clear history  of him taking out new loans within days  or 
weeks of settling  a previous  loan. Some of the loans overlapped and on some 
occasions there were  no gaps  between the loans. So CEN ought  to have realised it 
was more likely than not Mr H was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness  
was increasing unsustainably.
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed CEN.  Loan 10 was 
taken out 13 months after Mr Hs first. And it was for a larger amount, due to be 
repaid over a longer term. This means Mr H paid large  amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to CEN over an extended  period.
Ref: DRN31580483I think that Mr H lost out because CEN continued  to provide borrowing from loan 8 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Hs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
Ive thought about the points CEN made  in response  to the adjudicator. Its concerned that 
the adjudicator  didnt  mention details  of Mr Hs monthly expenses. But, as CEN  will know, 
this service considers  theres sometimes a point at which the pattern of lending  alone is 
enough to suggest further lending would be unsustainable or otherwise  harmful. If the 
lending reaches that stage, it isnt necessary (as Ive said above) to carry out a strict pounds 
and pence calculation.
CEN also says that in its experience, consumers  in difficulty will usually have gaps of less 
than 15 days between  loans. But the gaps between Mr Hs loans were  generally less than 15 
days. Loans 6 to 7 (a gap of 28 days) and 9 to 10 (a gap of 130 days, or four months) are 
the exception.
Clearly the gap between loans 9 and 10 is the largest  in Mr Hs borrowing  relationship  with 
CEN. Ive thought  about whether this gap was significant enough to suggest there could  
have been a change in Mr Hs circumstances. But I dont think it was. Mr Hs reported 
income (£1,000 net a month) didnt  change and CEN hasnt shown me anything  else to think 
Mr Hs circumstances may have changed.  Mr H was, after 13 months of consecutive  loans, 
asking for a new credit commitment designed  to be repaid  over about ten months   
potentially resulting in charges of £774.19 on borrowing of £650  the same  amount he 
borrowed for loan 9. As Ive said above, I think this would  mean  hed effectively be unfairly  
extending his indebtedness with QuickQuid  in a way which  wasnt sustainable.
The points raised by CEN havent therefore changed my mind and Im upholding the 
complaint about  loans  8 to 10, in addition to the loans on which CEN has already made a fair 
offer.
Ref: DRN31580484Putting things  right
For loans 3 and 4 and 7 to 9 CEN must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 3, 4 and 7  as it has offered
refund  the interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 8 and 9
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Mr H paid the interest 
and charges until the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  it has recorded about loans 3 and 4 and all the 
information it has recorded about  loans  8 and 9
I understand loan 10 still has an outstanding balance. If this is correct,  CEN should remove 
interest and charges from that balance and treat any payments made as if they were paid 
towards the principal.  CEN can then deduct the remaining balance from what  it owes  Mr H. 
CEN may only do this if it still owns the debt (or buys  it back). CEN should also remove  this 
loan from Mr Hs credit history  but it can do this once  the debt is repaid.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires CEN to take off tax from this interest. CEN must  give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Hs complaint  in part. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 August 2019.
