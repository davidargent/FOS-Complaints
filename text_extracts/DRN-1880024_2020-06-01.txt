The complaint
Mr P complains about NewDay Ltds decision to default his credit card account.
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions are set out in my provisional 
decision dated 30 April 2020. In my provisional decision I explained why I didn't intend to 
uphold Mr P's complaint. I said:
Mr P had a credit card with NewDay and missed payments from January 2018. NewDay
sent Mr P a default notice on 21 March 2018. In April 2018 NewDay closed the credit card
account and asked a third party business to contact Mr P and attempt collection of his
payments and arrears.
A payment of £187.23 was received by NewDay on 1 May 2018.
On 16 June 2018 the third party completed an income and expenditure assessment with Mr
P and he agreed to a payment arrangement. Mr P agreed to pay £100 a month from July
2018. NewDay says that stopped its collections process so it didn't proceed with the default.
In July 2018 Mr P paid a total of £250. In August, September and October 2018 Mr P paid
£100 but after that no further payments were made. NewDay says the arrears continued to
build on Mr Ps account so it took the decision to default and sell it to a third party. NewDay
reported the default from March 2019.
Mr P referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
thought NewDay had waited too long to record the default and asked it to change the default 
date to April 2018. But NewDay didnt agree and asked to appeal so Mr Ps complaint has 
been passed to me to make a decision.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr P says he didnt receive important letters and information NewDay sent him about the
status of his account or its decision to default. Ive looked at all the available information,
including copies of letters NewDay sent to Mr P, and theyre all correctly addressed. 
The address details NewDay used match those Mr P has given our service when bringing 
his complaint. From the information available, Im satisfied NewDay did write to Mr P with
statements and important letters about his credit card, including the default notice, and that
they were most likely received.
NewDay only sent one default notice on 21 March 2018. It didnt send another one in March
2019 when it took the decision to default Mr Ps credit card. But I dont think thats impacted
Mr Ps situation. NewDay only took the decision to default Mr Ps credit card after a
sustained period of arrears and a failed payment arrangement.
The investigator thought NewDay should back date the default to April 2018 but I dont agree 
thats a fair approach. Ive carefully considered the pattern of arrears and timeline of events to see whether NewDays decision to default in March 2019 was reasonable. Having done 
so, Im satisfied that March 2019 was a fair point to record the default. Ill explain why.
Industry guidance says a default should be used to record the fact that a relationship
between a business and consumer has broken down. The guidance says businesses will
generally default when the account is in arrears for three to six months. In this case, Mr P
missed four payments between January and April 2018 but made a partial payment on 1
May 2018. In June 2018 Mr P completed an income and expenditure assessment with a
third party acting for NewDay and a payment arrangement of £100 per month was agreed.
Given Mr P agreed a payment arrangement I think NewDays decision to halt the default
process was reasonable.
Mr P maintained the payment arrangement for four months but then the payments stopped.
As a result, NewDays collections process started again. NewDay took the decision to
default Mr Ps account and sell it around five months after Mr Ps last payment was made.
Mr P says that the payments made between July and October 2018 were collected from his
parents account by direct debit. Mr P says that NewDay stopped collecting the direct debit
which meant nothing further was paid after October 2018. But Mr P hasnt provided any
evidence to support that. And I have to take into account that after the payments stopped
NewDay sent several arrears letters to Mr P and asked him to make contact. Im satisfied Mr 
P would have been aware of the arrears after the payments stopped in October 2018.
Im sorry to disappoint Mr P but, based on what I've seen so far, I havent been persuaded to 
uphold his complaint. Im satisfied NewDay followed industry guidelines and treated Mr P
positively and sympathetically while he was experiencing financial difficulties. I havent found 
grounds to tell NewDay to amend the default date to April 2018 and Im satisfied its dealt 
with Mr Ps complaint fairly. As I havent found any evidence that NewDay has made a
mistake or treated Mr P unfairly Im not telling it to take any further action.
My provisional decision
My provisional decision is that I don't intend to uphold Mr P's complaint.
In my provisional decision, I invited Mr P's representative and NewDay to send me any 
additional comments they wanted me to consider before I made my final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay responded to say it accepted my provisional decision. We haven't heard back from 
Mr P or his representative. 
As NewDay has accepted my provisional decision and Mr P's representative hasn't sent us 
any additional information for me to consider, I see no reason to change the conclusions I 
reached in my provisional decision. I still think NewDay's decision to default Mr P's credit 
card was reasonable and that it dealt with his complaint fairly. As I haven't found that 
NewDay has made a mistake or treated Mr P unfairly, I'm not upholding this complaint or 
telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 June 2020.
