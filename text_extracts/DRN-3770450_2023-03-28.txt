The complaint
Mr and Mrs P complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited has rejected the claims that theyve 
made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre being represented in their complaint by 
a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs P entered into fixed sum loan agreement with a finance provider in February 
2008 to pay for a trial membership of a holiday club. The price of the trial membership was 
£3,795, they made a payment of £330 and agreed to make 36 monthly repayments of 
£122.78 to the finance provider. Mr and Mrs P upgraded their membership in July 2008 
when they entered into a purchase agreement to buy some membership points. The 
purchase price of the points was £15,872, they paid membership dues of £815 and traded in 
their trial membership which was given a value of £5,595 so the amount due from them was 
£11,092. They entered into a loan agreement with the finance provider for a loan and they 
say that the February 2008 loan was consolidated with that loan. They agreed to repay the 
loan by 180 monthly payments. The loan was transferred to Shawbrook Bank in July 2016.
Mr and Mrs Ps representative made claims to the finance provider and to Shawbrook Bank 
in July 2021 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act. It said that the points 
were mis-sold and, but for the misrepresentations made, Mr and Mrs P wouldnt have 
purchased the points nor entered into a loan agreement. It said that the terms of the 
agreement were unfair as an undisclosed commission was paid and they were pressured 
into entering the loan agreement.
Shawbrook Bank said that the claim and complaint were time-barred under the Limitation Act 
1980 so it wouldnt be investigating the matter. Mr and Mrs P werent satisfied with that 
response so a complaint was made to this service. Their complaint form says that: the 
finance provider paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mr and 
Mrs P; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mr and Mrs Ps ability 
to afford the loan, unduly pressured them into entering the agreements and used aggressive 
commercial practices to pressure them; and the membership was misrepresented to them; 
all rendering the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A  and it said that the claim 
should also be considered under section 75.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Ps complaint should be upheld. He 
thought that Shawbrook Bank was entitled to rely on the timing of the misrepresentation 
claims to turn them down. He said that he hadnt seen enough to suggest that the 
relationship between Mr and Mrs P and the finance provider was unfair and he wasnt 
persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He later 
said that he wasnt persuaded that the money lent to them was likely to have been 
unaffordable.
Mr and Mrs Ps representative says that Mr and Mrs P disagree with our investigators 
recommendations and have asked for their complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. 
Their representative says, in summary, that:
Mr and Mrs P were sold a product with little or no benefit or value and theres little or 
no secondary market for memberships;
non-members regularly holidayed at and were given easy access to the resorts 
without requiring to purchase membership points or pay annual maintenance fees;
the membership was an in perpetuity contract with unlimited liability for 
management charges which was concealed at the point of purchase in breach of the 
Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010;
Mr and Mss P were pressurised into entering into an agreement on that day and the 
contractual terms relative to maintenance charges were contained within voluminous 
documentation and were neither plain nor intelligible and did not accurately describe 
the liabilities incurred when entering into the contract; and
a properly advised consumer making an informed decision wouldnt have agreed to a 
contract with such onerous and unfair terms.
It has also described its concerns about the way in which the finance was sold to Mr and 
Mrs P and has provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Ps complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr and Mrs Ps complaint is that Shawbrook Bank turned down the claims that theyd 
made to it and I accept that they referred their complaint to this service within six 
years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to 
their claims;
Mr and Mrs Ps claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not 
determining the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be 
able to do that - Im considering whether or not Shawbrook Banks response to those 
claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr and Mrs Ps claim under section 75 is that the memberships were misrepresented 
to them and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented 
to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Shawbrook Bank would be 
expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr and Mrs P could have made a claim to the holiday company or the 
finance provider about the misrepresentations that they say induced them into buying 
the memberships in July 2008 as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations 
would have been made and any loss would have been incurred as that was when 
they also entered into their second loan agreement with the finance provider;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or the finance provider  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made to the 
finance provider and Shawbrook Bank until July 2021, about thirteen years later so 
was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act and I consider that their 
claim under section 75 is now time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Ps representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr 
and Mrs P and the finance provider and section 140A gives a court the power, 
amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under 
a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the 
debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Mr and Mrs Ps loan was transferred to Shawbrook Bank in July 2016 and 
Shawbrook Bank has provided an account statement which shows that there was still 
an outstanding balance on the loan in April 2022 so I dont consider that Mr and 
Mrs Ps claim under section 140A is time-barred;
the only documents that Ive seen relating to the purchases in February and July 
2008 are the loan agreement that was made to Mr and Mrs P in February 2008 and 
the purchase agreement for the points that they bought in July 2008;
Mr and Mrs Ps representative then made claims to the finance provider in July 2021 
and described the misrepresentations that it said had been made to Mr and Mrs P in 
February and July 2008  thirteen years earlier;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs P had complained to the holiday 
company, the finance provider or Shawbrook Bank about any such issues before July 
2021 and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have raised any 
such concerns much sooner after they entered into the agreements than that;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence in these circumstances to show that 
the memberships were misrepresented to Mr and Mrs P or that they were induced 
into entering into any of the agreements by misrepresentations made by the holiday 
company;
Mr and Mrs P complaint form says that the finance provider should have told them 
about any commission that it paid to the holiday company for arranging the loan  but 
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid 
by the finance provider to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that the finance provider 
wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any 
regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that the finance 
provider should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr and 
Mrs P risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr and Mrs Ps representative says that the holiday company failed to conduct a 
proper assessment of Mr and Mrs Ps ability to afford the loan  the loans were made 
to Mr and Mrs P in February and July 2008 and were transferred to Shawbrook Bank 
in July 2016  Shawbrook Bank hasnt provided any evidence about the assessment 
of the affordability of the loans for Mr and Mrs P but it has provided a loan account 
statement which shows that Mr and Mrs P have been able to make the loan 
repayments and that there are no arrears on their account;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs P contacted the finance provider or 
Shawbrook Bank about the affordability of the loans or to ask about the affordability 
assessments that were conducted before their representatives letters in July 2021  
and if they were concerned about either of those issues I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have raised their concerns much sooner after they 
entered into the agreements than that;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs P were 
unduly pressurised into buying the trial membership in February 2008 or the 
membership points in July 2008 or entering into either of the loan agreements and 
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
used unacceptable sales practices against them  Ive seen no evidence to show that 
Mr and Mrs P complained to the finance provider or Shawbrook Bank about those 
issues until their representatives letters in July 2021, about thirteen years after the 
July 2008 loan had been made to Mr and Mrs P, and I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have complained about any such issues before then;
Mr and Mrs Ps representative has described its concerns about the way in which the 
finance was sold to Mr and Mrs P but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that either of the loans was mis-sold to them;
Mr and Mrs Ps representative has also provided a generic submission from counsel 
about the holiday company - but Im not persuaded that its enough to show that Mr 
and Mrs Ps relationship with the finance provider was unfair;
Ive carefully considered what Mr and Mrs Ps representative has said about the 
unfairness of the terms of the agreement that Mr and Mrs P entered into with the 
holiday company in July 2008 and the breaches of regulations that it has described 
but Ive not been provided with most of the contractual documents that would have 
been signed by Mr and Mrs P at that time and it would be for a court to determine 
whether or not any of the terms in those agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr and Mrs P and I 
consider it be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs P and the 
finance provider;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Ps 
relationship with the finance provider was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and 
Mrs P and the finance provider in these circumstances;
Shawbrook Bank said that Mr and Mrs Ps claims were time-barred, so I cant say 
that its response to their claims was fair and reasonable  but if it had properly 
responded to their claims I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it 
not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs P for the issues that theyve had with their 
memberships, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require Shawbrook Bank to refund to them any of the money that theyve 
paid under the loan agreements, to pay them any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs P to 
accept or reject my decision before 25 April 2023.
