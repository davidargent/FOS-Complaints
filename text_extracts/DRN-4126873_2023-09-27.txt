The complaint
Miss M complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) unfairly recorded a missed 
payment on her credit file. 
What happened
Miss M has a revolving credit account with PayPal with a £200 limit. Miss Ms statements are 
set to be sent out in the post each month. Miss M has explained that in early December 
2022 she checked her credit file and found a missed payment recorded by PayPal. Miss M 
says she wasnt aware that her payment had failed and called PayPal to find out what had 
happened. 
Miss M was advised that the October 2022 payment was missed. Miss M had tried to make 
two payments, one for £10 on 25 October 2022 and another for £5.33 on 26 October 2022. 
Both payments failed which meant Miss Ms account fell into arrears. 
The following payment was due around 7 November 2022 but wasnt made until 25 
November 2022 when Miss M paid £10. 
Miss M says that PayPal failed to contact her about the missed payment before it recorded 
the information on her credit file. Miss M went on to raise a complaint and PayPal issued a 
final response on 3 January 2023 but didnt uphold his case. PayPal said it had sent Miss M 
a statement advising of the due date for payments. PayPal didnt agree it had acted unfairly 
by recording a missed payment on Miss Ms credit file. 
Miss M referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. The 
investigator thought PayPal had acted reasonably by recording the missed payment on Miss 
Ms credit file and didnt ask it to do anything else. 
Miss M asked to appeal and said PayPal had failed to send her statements. Miss M also said 
PayPal had failed to contact her after her payment was missed and before it took the step of 
reporting it to the credit reference agencies. Miss M added that her payment was due on 7 
November 2022 but PayPal logged the missed payment on 4 December 2022, only 27 days 
later. Miss M said that whilst the email address PayPal holds isnt the one she mainly uses, it 
is open and she has access to it. As Miss M asked to appeal, her complaint has been 
passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In response to the investigator, Miss M said that PayPal had only waited 27 days to report 
the missed payment. But PayPals explained to us that Miss M missed two payments. One in 
October 2022 and another in November 2022. The October 2022 payment was missed as 
no funds were successfully received that month. And the November 2022 due date of 7 
November 2022 was missed but Miss M made the payment up on 25 November 2022. 
PayPal has explained that as the payment was made up, it wasnt recorded as missed on 
Miss Ms credit file. 
I think PayPals final response couldve been clearer in explaining what payment it recorded 
as missed on Miss Ms credit file. And I think that caused some confusion as Miss M said 
PayPal had only waited 27 days before reporting the payment as missed. But PayPal 
actually waited around 57 days from the October 2022 due date before the payment was 
reported. 
Miss M has told us she didnt receive the relevant statements in the post. But Ive seen 
copies of PayPals statements and theyre addressed correctly and in line with the 
information we hold for Miss M. Whilst I appreciate Miss M may not recall having received all 
her statements Im satisfied, on balance, that they were sent by PayPal as claimed. 
Miss M says that PayPal failed to contact her when the payment was missed. PayPals 
provided systems evidence that verifies it sent Miss M emails about her account, including 
confirmation her payments had failed on 26 October 2022 and 28 October 2022. But the 
systems record shows that the emails couldnt be delivered to the nominated email address. 
I note that PayPals final response requests Miss M updates her email address. Miss Ms 
told us that the email address remains open and active. But Im satisfied the evidence shows 
PayPal emailed the address on file without error but that they ultimately failed. I havent seen 
anything that shows PayPal made a mistake with the emails it sent.  
In response to the investigator, Miss M asked why the failed emails werent chased up. But 
the account terms and conditions require the customer to ensure an active email address is 
recorded with PayPal so it can send emails of this nature. I wouldnt expect PayPal to take 
follow up action in addition to sending statements and email payment reminders when a 
payment is missed. 
Miss Ms told us she thought the payments made on 25 October 2022 and 26 October 2022 
had gone through and wasnt aware theyd failed. In its file submission, PayPal provided 
evidence that shows the times and dates Miss M logged into her online account. I can see 
that Miss M logged in on 25 October 2022 and 26 October 2022 and again on 7 November 
2022. Im satisfied that the account wouldve shown whether the payments Miss M 
attempted were successful or not. c
Im very sorry to disappoint Miss M but as I havent been persuaded that PayPal made an 
error or acted unfairly by recording a missed payment on her credit file Im not telling it to 
amend her credit file or take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Ms complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 October 2023.
