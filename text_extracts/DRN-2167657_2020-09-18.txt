The complaint
Mr S is unhappy with the amount of compensation Assurant General Insurance Limited has 
offered after it failed to repair his laptop on the first attempt and then lost it by returning it to 
an incorrect address. 
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Given the laptop has now been lost there is no way of proving whether it was faulty 
when it was first returned to Mr S. I dont think Assurant need to cover the cost of the 
new charger Mr S bought as he did this after testing out other chargers. At that point 
Mr S would have been aware there was a possibility something was wrong with the 
laptop. 
Assurant has now paid Mr S an amount to cover the cost of purchasing a 
replacement laptop, so I dont think it needs to do anything more here. 
Its clear there were some delays with the claim and the fact the laptop was ultimately 
delivered to the incorrect address would have caused Mr S some trouble and upset. 
Mr S has explained he used the laptop for work so this would have caused additional 
inconvenience. 
I think £150 is a reasonable amount of compensation to reflect the trouble and upset 
Mr S has been caused. 
For these reasons, I uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ss complaint against Assurant General Insurance 
Limited. I direct it to pay Mr S £150 compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 October 2020.
