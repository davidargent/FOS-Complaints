The complaint
Miss H complains that Acorn Insurance & Financial Services Ltd (Acorn) mishandled her
motor insurance.
Where I refer to Acorn, I refer to the above-named company and I include employees and
others insofar as I hold Acorn responsible for their acts or omissions. 
What happened
Acorn acted as an intermediary between Miss H and her insurers. Through Acorn, Miss H
took out a policy for the year from mid-December 2019.
Acorn also acted as an intermediary between Miss H and a finance company that Acorn has
described as its sister company. Miss H agreed to pay monthly instalments of the premium
and interest to the finance company by direct debit from the bank account she had at the
time.
Miss H renewed the policy for a year from mid- December 2020. At about that time, she told
Acorn that her old bank account had been closed.
In about January 2021, Miss H opened a new account with another bank. She made card
payments of about £94.00 for each of the instalments that fell due in early 2021.
In mid- June 2021, Acorn treated the policy as cancelled because of missed payment.
In early July 2021, Miss H made a payment of £119.13, and Acorn set up a new policy for
her.
In late November 2021, Miss H took out a policy with another provider. She contacted Acorn
to get evidence of her no claims bonus (NCB). Acorn said that she still had a policy through
Acorn with several months before it expired. Acorn said it had an incorrect email address for
Miss H.
In December 2021, Miss H complained to Acorn that it had re-started the policy without her
knowledge. She complained that shed paid a deposit of about £110.00 to the other provider
for the new policy, then cancelled it and paid a £25.00 cancellation fee.
By a final response dated February 2022, Acorn partly upheld the complaint. It said it would
refund the payments of about £110.00 and £25.00. Acorn also offered a further £25.00 in
recognition of holding the incorrect email address. Acorn has told us that it made those
payments in late February 2022. Miss H brought her complaint to us without delay.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He thought that
what Acorn had paid was fair in the circumstances.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Miss H   
and to Acorn on 17 January 2023. I summarise my findings:
I found it more likely that Miss H hadnt paid the balance of the instalment due in 
early May 2021 or any of the instalment due in early June 2021 (totalling about 
£163.00) - and thats why Acorn cancelled the policy from mid-June 2021.
There wasnt enough evidence that Acorn wrote any seven-day notice. Ive seen a 
letter dated 23 June 2021 confirming the cancellation. But I found it unlikely that 
Acorn sent it to Miss Hs correct email address. So I didnt consider that Acorns 
cancellation treated Miss H fairly.
I found it possible that Miss H wouldve responded by paying the arrears of about 
£163.00 by the deadline. That wouldve avoided the cancellation and preserved her 
opportunity to earn another years NCB by mid-December 2021, and then pay less 
for her insurance.
But the arrears had arisen because she couldnt pay the total of the instalments due 
in early May and early June 2021. So I found it more likely that Miss H wouldnt have 
paid the arrears in June 2021. Therefore, I wasnt minded to assess compensation by 
reference to the lost opportunity for extra NCB and lower premium for the period from 
mid-December 2021 to early July 2022.
Subject to any further information from Miss H or from Acorn, my provisional decision was to 
uphold this complaint in part. I intended to direct Acorn Insurance & Financial Services Ltd 
to:
1. write a letter to Miss H (which she may show to current and future insurers) 
apologising for cancelling her policy unfairly in June 2021; and
2. pay Miss H £150.00 for distress and inconvenience.
Acorn agreed with the provisional decision or at least with the recommendation to pay  
£150.00 to Miss H for not issuing a 7- day cancellation notice.
Miss H asked for an extension of her time to respond to the provisional decision to 27 
February 2023 and we agreed. However, she didnt respond by that deadline.
So I see no reason to change my view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen a statement of facts dated 2 December 2020. It said that Miss H had four years
NCB. It included her correct email address. Ive also seen a policy schedule dated 2
December 2020. Ive also seen a covering letter dated 2 December 2020. It said that Miss H
had to pay 11 instalments of about £100.00, by direct debit form her old bank account,
starting from 11 January 2021.
But Miss H contacted Acorn on 10 December 2020. And both agree that she had to pay
monthly instalments of about £94.00 from about 1 January 2021. So I find that Miss H and
Acorn agreed some changes, which had the effect of reducing the instalments.I accept Acorns statement that it was around that time that it recorded Miss Hs email
address incorrectly.
I find that Miss H made card payments for the instalments due in early January, early
February and early March 2021.
I accept Miss Hs evidence that she asked to set up a direct debit for the 27th day of every
month. On 19 March 2021, the finance company emailed her to refuse that request. The
finance company used her correct email address. But the finance company was replying to
an enquiry. So that doesnt persuade me that Acorn hadnt already mis recorded the email
address at that time.
I find that Miss H made a card payment for the instalment due in early April 2021.
Both Miss H and Acorn have mentioned a split payment. From what each of them has said,
that was an option offered on the finance companys website.
Acorn has given us conflicting information about payments in about May 2021. But I find
that, for the instalment of about £94.00 due in early May 2021, Miss H made a split payment
of about £23.00. Miss H told us (in July 2022) that on 21 May 2021 the website wouldnt let
her pay the balance. But  even if that were the case  the balance was about £69.00, and it
was still overdue. And Miss H hasnt said that she made such a payment.
For the instalment due in early June 2021, Miss H told us (in July 2022) that she made a
card payment on 1 June 2021 of about £94.00. She sent us extracts from her bank
statements. But the entry for 1 June 2021 is redacted. So Im not persuaded that she made
such a payment.
I find it more likely that Miss H hadnt paid the balance of the instalment due in early May
2021 or any of the instalment due in early June 2021 (totalling about £163.00) - and thats
why Acorn cancelled the policy from mid-June 2021.
Nevertheless, the Financial Ombudsman Service regards cancellation of a motor policy by a
business as having serious consequences for the policyholder. So we expect the business to
give the policyholder seven days notice of its intention to cancel. Further, we expect the
business to use the means of communication for which the policyholder has expressed
preference - and ideally a second means of communication.
In Miss Hs case, theres not enough evidence that Acorn wrote any seven-day notice. Ive
seen a letter dated 23 June 2021 confirming the cancellation. But I find it unlikely that Acorn
sent it to Miss Hs correct email address. So I dont consider that Acorns cancellation treated
Miss H fairly.
In early July 2021, Miss H went onto the finance companys website. I accept Acorns
evidence that the pages she opened included the following information:
IMPORTANT MESSAGE. Unfortunately your policy has been cancelled. If you
would like to set up a new policy, please click the Continue Button below
Although we are unable to reinstate your cancelled policy, to help you stay covered
we can setup a new policy.
Your new policy will be on the same terms as your cancelled policy and will be for a
new 12 month period.
I also accept Acorns evidence that Miss H was asked the following question:Have there been any changes to your circumstances, or have you requested a
change against your most recent cancelled policy?
That was before she made the card payment of about £119.13.
As Acorn had, by that time, made a mistake with the email address, I accept that Miss H
didnt receive the new policy documents by email.
Miss H made the payments due in early August, early September, early October and early
November 2021. She mustve known that the amount was about £84.00. So she ought
reasonably to have noticed that this was less than shed been paying in the early months of
2021.
I accept Miss Hs statement that she arranged a new and cheaper policy to start in mid-
December 2021, when she believed the Acorn policy would end. I dont doubt that she was
upset and inconvenienced by finding out that Acorn had cancelled her policy and re-started it
for a year to July 2022. But I consider that she shouldve known that from what shed seen
online in July 2021.
By late November 2021, Miss H knew she had two policies and she chose to cancel the one
with the new provider.
From what Ive seen, Miss H made the remaining payments due to Acorn from December
2021 to July 2022.
Ive thought about whats fair to try to put Miss H back in the position she shouldve been in if
Acorn had sent a seven-day notice to her correct email address in June 2021.
I find it possible that Miss H wouldve responded by paying the arrears of about £163.00 by
the deadline. That wouldve avoided the cancellation and preserved her opportunity to earn
another years NCB by mid-December 2021 and then pay less for her insurance.
But the arrears had arisen because she couldnt pay the total of the instalments due in early
May and early June 2021. So I find it more likely that Miss H wouldnt have paid the arrears
in June 2021. Therefore, I dont find it fair and reasonable to assess compensation by 
reference to the lost opportunity for extra NCB and lower premium for the period from mid-
December 2021 to early July 2022. 
Putting things right
I keep in mind that Acorn has already refunded what Miss H had paid to the new provider.
But  unlike the investigator  Im not satisfied that this went far enough to put things right.
I find that Miss H suffered upset at the cancellation and reinstatement of her policy. Only a 
part of that was caused by Acorns failure to send a seven-day notice of cancellation.
The impact of that failure can be mitigated by directing Acorn to write a letter to Miss H 
(which she may show to current and future insurers) apologising for cancelling her policy 
unfairly in June 2021.
In addition to that, I find it fair and reasonable to direct Acorn to pay Miss H £150.00 for 
distress and inconvenience.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Acorn Insurance & Financial Services Ltd to:
1. write a letter to Miss H (which she may show to current and future insurers) 
apologising for cancelling her policy unfairly in June 2021; and
2. pay Miss H £150.00 for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 March 2023.
