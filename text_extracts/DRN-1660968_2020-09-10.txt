The complaint
Mr B complains that John Lewis Financial Services Limited wont reimburse him for the 
losses that hes claimed as a result of a failed repair of his car.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr B used his John Lewis Finance credit card to pay £949.74 for some repairs to his 
car in November 2018 but the repairs werent completed correctly and the car broke-
down in January 2019 with significant engine damage;
he contacted John Lewis Finance and it made a successful chargeback claim for the 
money that hed paid for the repairs but Mr B also claimed consequential losses 
totalling £3,858.60 for hire car costs, tax and additional insurance for a replacement 
car, his time, three months additional theoretical depreciation on the replacement car 
and inspection costs;
John Lewis Finance offered to pay him £454.86 (£177.86 for his hire car costs and 
£277 for the inspection costs) and credited his account with £140 for its delay in 
dealing with his claim  but Mr B didnt accept that offer and complained to this 
service;
our investigator said that Mr Bs car was out of use as a direct result of a breach of 
contract and so the insurance and road tax that he paid for that car for the five 
months that it was being repaired should be considered a direct loss  so he 
recommended that John Lewis Finance should reimburse £394.87 to Mr B (with 
interest) for those costs;
John Lewis Finance accepted the investigators recommendation but Mr B has asked 
for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Bs complaint about John Lewis Finance, I must be satisfied 
that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that 
John Lewis Finances response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or 
reasonable - Im not determining the outcome of Mr Bs claim under section 75 as 
only a court would be able to do that;
John Lewis Finance has now agreed to pay a total of £849.73 to Mr B to reimburse 
him for his car hire costs, the cost of the inspection report and the tax and insurance 
costs for his car and its also paid him £140 compensation for its delay in dealing with 
his complaint;
I consider that to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances and Im not persuaded 
that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to also pay Mr B for the £2,000 
that hes claimed for depreciation on a replacement car or the £1,500 that hes 
claimed for his time; and
I dont consider that the additional theoretical depreciation on the replacement car 
and the compensation for the time that Mr B has claimed are direct consequential 
losses arising from the breach of contract or that theres enough evidence to show 
that any such compensation is justified in these circumstances - so I consider that 
John Lewis Finances response not to pay those amounts to Mr B was fair and 
reasonable.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for John Lewis Finance to pay £849.73 to Mr B to 
reimburse him for the car hire costs, the cost of the inspection report and the tax and 
insurance costs that hes incurred (all as described above) and that it should pay interest on 
each part of that payment from the date that each of the costs was incurred. I dont consider 
that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to make any other payments to Mr B in 
these circumstances.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint in part and I order John Lewis Financial 
Services Limited to:
1. Pay £849.73 to Mr B to reimburse him for the costs that hes incurred.
2. Pay interest on each part of that payment at an annual rate of 8% simple from the 
date of each payment to the date of settlement.
HM Revenue & Customs requires John Lewis Finance to deduct tax from the interest 
payment referred to above. John Lewis Finance must give Mr B a certificate showing how 
much tax its deducted if he asks it for one.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 October 2020.
