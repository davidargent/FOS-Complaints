The complaint
Mr S complained that the value of his pension funds fell significantly while managed by 
PensionBee Limited (PensionBee).
What happened
In February 2022, Mr S transferred a number of existing pension funds to PensionBee, with 
a total value of approaching £105,000. No further payments were subsequently made either 
by lump sum or by setting up regular payments. The funds were invested in a default 
Lifestyle plan, the BlackRock Life LifePath 2031-33.
In April 2022, Mr S contacted PensionBee, concerned that the value of his funds had fallen, 
seeking an explanation. He remained concerned, noting that the value of his funds continued 
to fall over the summer and contacting PensionBee twice during this period.
On 11 October, Mr S requested a transfer from Pension Bee to another provider. The value 
of his fund at this time was almost £91,000.
An instruction to disinvest was sent by PensionBee to the fund manager BlackRock, the 
following day 12 October 2022. The transfer was completed on 19 October 2022.
The full amount of Mr Ss benefits, almost £88,000 was transferred to the new provider.
Mr S complained to PensionBee on 19 October 2022, after discovering the transfer value 
was some £3,000 less than the value of his funds on 11 October. 
PensionBee investigated Mr Ss complaint and responded to his complaint on 26 October 
2022. It did not uphold his complaint and explained that when it received the request from Mr 
S to transfer out his benefits on 11 October 2022, it  instructed the Asset Manager of his 
plan, BlackRock, to sell his funds on the next working day. BlackRock subsequently began 
the disinvestment of the funds on 13 October. Unfortunately for Mr S, the value of his funds 
fell between the time of his request and the sale of his funds, which meant the amount he 
received was lower than the amount he had been expecting. 
Mr S was not satisfied with this response and brought his complaint to this service.
Our investigator reviewed the evidence and formed the view that the complaint should not be 
upheld. Mr S disagreed, so this case has been passed to me to review the evidence again 
and make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, and considering the view of our investigator, I have reached the same 
conclusion and will not be upholding Mr Ss complaint.
I can appreciate that this will be disappointing for him, so let me explain how I have reached 
my decision.
Firstly, I thin
k its important to establish that PensionBee acted solely as the administrator of Mr Ss 
pension. It is not authorised to provide any investment advice, but to act as directed by Mr S 
in relation to any investment decisions relating to his pension. This is made clear to potential 
investors in its terms and conditions where it states:
PensionBee does not provide any advice (especially financial, tax or legal advice) or 
individual recommendations on any PensionBee plans and you must make your own 
investment decisions as to whether to invest in the PensionBee Personal Pension.
When Mr S first transferred his existing pension funds into PensionBee, his funds were 
invested into its default Lifestyle fund, the PensionBee Tailored Plan. This was because 
during the initial application stage, Mr S had to confirm the following before being able to 
proceed with the application:
I agree to transfer the pension balance(s) to the PensionBee Tailored Plan. Im aware that I 
can change my plan at any time.
I confirm that Ive read, understand and agree to the terms, including the declaration, Data 
Protection and Transfer authorisations contained therein.
Im satisfied that Mr S was transferred into the Lifestyle fund as a result of providing this 
confirmation, and that he was also informed that he could switch to any other of the funds 
offered by PensionBee at any time, so I cant see that it has done anything wrong here.
Looking now at the performance of the fund that Mr S as invested in, the BlackRock Life 
LifePath 2031-33, The fund is a Lifestyle fund, which seeks to protect the value of the 
assets of its investors as they move toward their planned retirement date, in this case the 
years 2031-2033. It does this primarily through changing the assets it holds to try and reduce 
risk as the retirement date approaches. It is worth noting that all investments carry a level of 
risk, and the factsheet also carries the prominent warning that:
Capital at risk. All financial investments involve an element of risk. Therefore, the value of 
your investment and the income from it will vary and your initial investment amount cannot 
be guaranteed.
Although this type of fund is designed to reduce risk for investors approaching their planned 
retirement date, it does so by reducing exposure to equities and increasing the proportion of 
the assets held in fixed income gilts. When interest rates rise, as they did during the period 
Mr S was invested, the value of gilts falls, reducing the absolute value of an investors 
benefits, as has happened in this case. The rapid fall in the value of Mr Ss fund has been 
caused at least in part by market fluctuations that have reduced the price of gilts, including 
rises in interest rates from historically stable, low levels. Other factors such as the conflict in 
Ukraine, which began one week after Mr S had transferred his pension benefits to 
PensionBee also caused significant volatility in the financial markets. That this has been a 
market wide phenomenon, and not just an underperformance of the fund Mr S was invested 
in can be seen by its performance in line with a benchmark of other similar funds from other 
providers.
I cannot comment on whether this investment approach was suitable for Mr S, but 
PensionBee was acting in the way it had been instructed to by Mr S when he first 
established the pension scheme. Mr S was free to switch investment strategy and move his 
funds at any time, rather than remain within the default scheme. As a result, I find that PensionBee has done nothing wrong in this respect either.
Turning now to the transfer from PensionBee to the new provider, it is standard industry 
practice for fund transfers from one provider to another to not take place instantaneously, but 
to be completed within a few working days. This is because the funds must be transferred as 
cash. Consequently, once PensionBee was instructed by Mr S to make the transfer, it had to 
inform BlackRock, which then had to sell Mr Ss investment in its fund and send the cash 
back to PensionBee to complete the transfer to the new provider. 
In this case, PensionBee received the instruction on 11 October 2022, informing BlackRock 
on the following day. BlackRock subsequently completed the trade, sending the funds back 
to PensionBee which passed them on to the new provider on the same day, 19 October 
2022. BlackRock has provided evidence to show that this was 4 days ahead of its normal 
target for completing this process. Given this, I cant see that PensionBee has done anything 
wrong and Mr Ss transfer took place with no delays.
Unfortunately, this does mean that there is a period of time between an instruction being 
given by an investor and the trade taking place, during which time the price of the fund can 
fluctuate. 
Consequently, and disappointing as it will be for Mr S to hear, I do not find PensionBee to be 
responsible for the loss in value to his pension fund during the transfer to the new provider.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, I do not uphold Mr Ss complaint.
As a result, I will not be asking PensionBee to do anything else.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 June 2023.
