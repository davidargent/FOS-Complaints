K821x#15complaint
Miss S says CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to her irresponsibly. She says 
that the loans  made up most  of her wages. She says she became dependent on short term 
lending but she couldnt afford to properly repay the loans.  
background
This complaint is about 15 payday  loans  and one running credit  account QuickQuid provided 
to Miss S between August  2012 and August 2018.  Some of the information QuickQuid has 
provided is in a table  at the end of this decision. 
QuickQuid didnt think that the financial Ombudsman Service should look at loans 1 and 2. 
After some correspondence Miss S has withdrawn her complaint about these loans. So I 
wont look at them here. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that Miss S should  receive  
compensation in respect of loans 3 to 10 and 11a to 16. QuickQuid disagreed with the 
adjudicators opinion so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN66563642And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss S complaint. Ive decided  to uphold Miss S 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Miss S didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about the initial  approval  of loan 11. 
Because of this I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  this loan. So I wont  be 
making a decision  about it. But it was part of the borrowing relationship Miss S had with 
QuickQuid. So its something  Ill take into account when considering the other loans she 
took.
Also there was a break in the lending of over two years between  loans 10 and 11. Given the 
length of this break it would be reasonable for QuickQuid to have  treated Miss S as new 
customer. So Ive looked at these  periods  as two separate chains of lending. 
what I think about QuickQuids decisions to approve loans  3 and 4 and loans  11a to 
13 
For loan 3 Miss S needed to repay around  £300  the month after taking  it. She needed to 
repay the same for loan 4. But QuickQuid had recorded her monthly income as being around 
£400. So the loan repayments  were around  three quarters of her income.  
These repayments took up a significant portion of Miss S income. And even if Miss S had a 
very low level of expenditure I think she would have likely needed to borrow again to meet 
her regular expenditure or loan repayments.  So I dont think  QuickQuid could reasonably 
have thought that Miss S could sustainably repay  these loans
And similarly for loan 11a Miss S needed to make three repayments over three months, 
there were two repayments  of about  £150  and a final larger repayment of about  £700. 
Miss S said her income was just over £1,400  and QuickQuid estimated that she had a 
monthly disposable income of just over £550.  So these repayments were  again very high in 
relation to the spare income  QuickQuid recorded that Miss S had. 
And over loans 12 and 13 the total amounts Miss S borrowed  increased,  the highest  
repayment (after  the loan increases) for loan 12 was just over £1,200  and just under £1,000  
for loan 13. So again  these were very high amounts for her to pay, particularly for loan 12 
and I dont think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid  to think that Miss S could sustainably  make 
these loan repayments. 
I dont think QuickQuid shouldve approved  these  loans. So Im upholding Miss S complaint 
about loans 3, 4 and loans 11a to 13. 
was QuickQuid acting  reasonably when it approved loans 5 to 10 and loans 14 to 16
Ref: DRN66563643I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 5 to 10 and 14 to 
16 because I dont  think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of 
QuickQuids lending history with Miss S, with a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which 
QuickQuid should  reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss S case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 5 in the first chain of lending and loan 14 in the second chain  of lending. I say this 
because:
up to loan 5 the amounts Miss S was borrowing had been  generally increasing, And 
going forward  she was provided with a new loan within days or weeks  of settling a 
previous one. And Miss S had problems repaying  loan 4. 
as Ive outlined  above the amounts Miss S needed to repay at the start of the second  
chain of lending,  from loan 11 onwards were very large.  And she went on to borrow  
high amounts going forward.   
QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss S was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loans was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss S indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss S wasnt making any real inroads to the amounts  she owed QuickQuid in both 
chains of lending.  By the time Miss S took out loan 5 shed had a lending relationship 
with QuickQuid for over a year. 
similarly in the second chain, loan 14 was taken  out more  than eight months  after 
loan 11. So Miss S had already been  borrowing for significant amounts of time by 
these points, and she went  on to borrow further. 
So I think its reasonable to say that Miss S had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect; service a debt to QuickQuid  over an extended period.
I think that Miss S lost out because  QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loans 5 
and 14 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss S indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss S 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5 to 10 and loans 14 to 16 and QuickQuid 
should put things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss S paid on loans 3 to 10 and loans 11a to 16
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 and 4 and loans 11a to 13 from 
Miss S credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 and loan 14 means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 to 10 and loans  14 to 16 should 
be removed from Miss S credit  file.
Ref: DRN66563644*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss S a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Miss S complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 October  2019.
