The complaint
Mr B complains that MBNA Limited (MBNA) sold his debt to a debt collection agency.
What happened
Mr B had a debt with MBNA. In March 2019 they sent him a notice of default. On 16 July 
2019 they issued a final demand for payment. On 1 August 2019, MBNA defaulted Mr Bs 
account and sold the debt to a debt collection agency (DCA) on 19 September 2019.
Mr B complained that MBNA passed his debt to a DCA while he had complaints being 
looked at by this service. He said that this should mean that MBNA suspended action 
against him.
MBNA said they had the right to register a default against Mr B and sell his debt to a DCA if 
he fell behind with repayments. Referring his complaint to the financial ombudsman service 
didnt mean his account was put on hold.
Mr B brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator said that the fact that Mr B had 
put complaints to this service didnt mean that MBNA had to stop any action. This service 
cant compel any business to do that. They were entitled to do that as part of their terms and 
conditions  and for several months in 2018 and 2019, Mr B hadnt maintained the minimum 
payments, and his account was over the limit. 
Mr B asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr B has made other complaints about MBNA  in terms of the interest rates they applied to 
his account and the amount of monthly minimum payment needed. Im not going to comment 
on those aspects as its not part of this complaint  which I interpret as  could MBNA sell Mr 
Bs debt to a DCA while he had an open complaint with MBNA. I can see that he made other 
complaints about MBNA in 2018 and 2019. 
Ive looked at MBNAs terms and conditions. These say that they can take legal action 
against a borrower if theyre over their limit or behind with making repayments. They say: 
Missing payments could have severe consequences, such as legal action against you to 
recover your debt or negative feedback from us to credit reference agencies, which may 
make getting credit more difficult for you in future. If you continue to miss payments, we may 
sell your debt and we or the purchaser may take legal action to recover money you owe us. 
This may include asking a court for an order that your home must be sold, or an order that
we or a purchaser can be paid from the sale proceeds of your home. 
And  they also say that the minimum payment must include the amount of any balance over 
the limit:
Paying your balance
The minimum payment you must make will be shown on your statement. And
You must pay us immediately:
any amount by which your balance goes over the credit limit on your account
Ive looked at Mr Bs statements. And these show he wasnt making the minimum payments 
needed as shown on his statement, and he was in arrears.

So  Mr B was regularly not making the minimum payments and his account was over its 
limit  and seriously in arrears. On that basis, I cant say that MBNA were wrong in defaulting 
his account  and then passing the debt to the DCA.
Turning to whether a business must suspend action if a customer complains to the 
ombudsman service. Theres no such agreement or rules that this is the case. Occasionally, 
we may ask a business to do that  in rare circumstances. But then  the business would 
have to agree to this  we cant make them stop action. We are an informal dispute resolution service  not a regulator of MBNA, and so we cant force them to suspend any 
action in the way Mr B suggests. 
So  my decision is that MBNA were entitled to sell Mr Bs debt to a DCA for them to deal 
with.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2021.
