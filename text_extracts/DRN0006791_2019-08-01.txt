K821x#15complaint
Ms W complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to her. 
She said she had borrowed money  from friends and family in order to continue  to be able to 
live and pay off the payday loans and bills  and that money borrowed from family and 
friends is still owed to them.  
Ms W wants a refund  of the interest and extra charges she paid. 
background
QuickQuid provided  Ms W with ten payday loans between May 2016  and June  2018 . 
She took out capital advances that ranged  between £50 and £1,450  sometimes  topping up a 
loan with some additional  borrowing. 
After loan 1 was paid there was a gap of around four months or so before Ms W started 
borrowing again. 
Then, after November  2016 she took out a number  of loans over the next nineteen  months, 
often with quite  short gaps between the borrowing   and sometimes  within  a day or so of the 
previous lending being paid.

Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Ws complaint and thought that although the initial borrowing 
(loans 1-4) wasnt unfair, all of the top ups on loan 4 and loans 5 -10 shouldnt have been  
lent to Ms W. 
The complaint came to me to decide. I issued a provisional decision. 
what I said in my provisional decision
Here are some of the main things I said. 
Based on all the information Ive seen so far, Im planning partly to uphold Ms Ws 
complaint. Ill explain  why.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN00067913the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Ms W could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ws complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history  with Ms W to see if there was 
a point at which QuickQuid reasonably shouldve seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Thats when QuickQuid shouldve  realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
There was a gap of around  six months  after loan 1 was taken  (and some  four months after it 
was paid) before Ms W asked to borrow again.  So that looks to me like a one off borrowing 
application. I think that the gap between loans 1-2 was long enough  for QuickQuid  to be able 
to say that it looked like Ms Ws finances  had moved on since  shed needed her previous 
loan and the clock effectively started  again  in terms of what QuickQuid shouldve been  
thinking about when considering if there were any concerns about Ms W being  dependent on 
its lending.
I dont think QuickQuid was wrong  to give the first four loans to Ms W. Looking at the 
amounts Ms W needed to repay,  what was apparent  about her circumstances at the time,  
and her history with the lender,  I dont think it wouldve been proportionate  for QuickQuid to 
ask her for the amount  of information  that would be needed to show the lending was 
unsustainable. And it doesnt  look like there was anything in the information Ms W provided 
or the information QuickQuid shouldve been aware  of, which  meant it wouldve been 
proportionate to start verifying what she was saying.   
Ref: DRN00067914But, looking  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids  lending history with Ms W, I think  by the 
time of the first top up on loan 4 (given on 27 April 2017) the lender should reasonably have 
seen that further  lending  was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  Ms W had topped  up the 
loan shed taken  out just 5 days earlier  and borrowed almost  as much  again. By this time,  
I think its fair to say that due to the increased  loan repayments,  QuickQuid  shouldve  been 
carrying out a full financial review of Ms Ws circumstances. Ive see nothing to indicate this 
happened. Proportionate checks would most likely  have shown Ms W was having problems 
managing her money.
In these circumstances, I think there  was a significant risk that Ms W wouldve been  unable 
to sustainably meet her repayments for this loan - and any subsequent loans. I think at this 
point QuickQuid shouldve  been  concerned she was facing serious problems  managing her 
money  particularly as appropriate checks wouldve revealed that it looked like the lending 
was helping to fund online betting.  
I dont think QuickQuid shouldve given any top ups on loan 4 to Ms W.
 
And QuickQuid ought to have continued its thorough checks  each time Ms W asked for 
further credit. I havent gone on to consider  what proportionate  checks would have shown 
because, in my view,  the pattern of lending itself shows  from loan 5 and onwards that 
borrowing was unsustainable for Ms W - so I dont think QuickQuid shouldve given Ms W 
any further lending  at all after this point. 
I think that by loan 5 QuickQuid  shouldve concluded that the lending  history alone indicated  
that the borrowing was unsustainable. 
I say this because:
Although there were  some limited gaps  between loans being  repaid and a new loan 
being granted I dont think it wouldve been  reasonable  for QuickQuid  to conclude 
these gaps were any indication that Ms Ws finances  had moved on from whatever 
situation had required her previous loans. 
By the time Ms W asked for the first top up on loan 4 shed been borrowing from 
QuickQuid repeatedly and in quick succession  and she wasnt  making any inroads 
into the amount  she owed  the lender. 
I think that Ms W lost out because QuickQuid then continued to provide borrowing after the 
first top up on loan 4 onwards when:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ws indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and top ups was likely to have had negative  implications 
on Ms Ws ability to access  mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
Ive taken into account what QuickQuid says about this lending,  and the offers it made. But 
this doesnt affect  my overall view for the reasons Ive explained. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  the top ups on loan 4 and loans 5 through  to 10 
(including top ups) and Im planning to tell QuickQuid it should  put things right.
Ref: DRN00067915what the parties said in response to my provisional  decision 
QuickQuid has sent a detailed response which Im only summarising here  but I have  
carefully considered  everything it has said. 
Briefly, QuickQuid has drawn my attention to its entire lending process including all the 
checks performed prior to lending, screenshots of customer applications, as well as the 
sample acknowledgement from the contract  that customers have to check  when their 
repayment amount  is greater than their estimated disposable income. QuickQuid questions 
how it wouldve known for certain  that funding Ms W wouldve added detriment to her 
financial position. It says that Ms W had a lending relationship with QuickQuid for 2 years 
and didnt incur  any late fees. And given her substantial break periods between loans and 
her pretty sound  repayment history  prior to the final loan, it cant  agree that any of the loans 
were unsustainable.
Ms W says that shed like me to review what Ive said about loan 10  which  shes  now 
cleared. And shes sent me QuickQuids confirmation of repayment. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Ive taken account of the checks that QuickQuid  says it did before lending to Ms W, when 
considering whether these loans should have been agreed. And having done  so I dont think 
that the information QuickQuid gathered was sufficient to suggest that lending was fair, 
affordable and sustainable  for her. 
When a consumer takes this number of loans over such a long period of time, its most likely 
that the loans  arent being used  for their intended  purpose of addressing temporary  cash  
flow problems. As QuickQuid will know, the FCA made it clear in a recent letter  to CEOs of 
high cost lending  firms  that a high volume of relending..may be symptomatic  of 
unsustainable lending  patterns. And I think that is the case  here at the time of the top ups 
on loan 4  and going forwards from that point.
I dont think it necessary to scrutinise  Ms Ws bank statements from that time. I think the very 
fact that she used credit, that was specifically intended for short term use, over such  a 
prolonged period is in itself evidence  of the problems she was having managing her money 
and the unsustainable nature of her borrowing.
So, after taking carefully into account  everything  thats been  said in response to my 
provisional decision, I still think its fair to uphold this complaint for the reasons I explained in 
my provisional decision. 
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to give Ms W:
the top ups on loan 4 (on 27/04/2017, 07/05/2017 and 12/05/2017 ) or 
any of the following  loans or top ups - loan 5 (25/08/2017 ) to loan 10 (20/06/2018 )
Ref: DRN00067916So for each of those  loans  QuickQuid  should:
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*
Remove any adverse  information on Ms Ws credit file in relation to the top ups on loan 4 
The number of loans  taken after the top ups on loan 4 onwards means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about loans 5 to 10 should be removed 
from Ms Ws credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Ms W a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  and direct CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) to pay Ms W 
as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 September 2019.
