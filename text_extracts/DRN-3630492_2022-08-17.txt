The complaint
Mr M complains that he was incorrectly charged for a packaged bank account from 2019 by 
The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr M has received a final decision from an ombudsman in this service to tell him that his 
complaint about things that happened before April 2020 are out of this services jurisdiction. 
So, I cant look at any that happened before April 2020.
Part of the above decision included the ombudsmans view that its more likely than not that 
Mr M received the final response letter from RBS dated 8 April 2020.
That final response letter contained clear instructions that Mr M should follow if he wanted to 
downgrade or close his packaged bank account. 
RBS could not alter the account without Mr Ms instruction. 
And neither party has any evidence that Mr M instructed the bank to change the account 
until he says he changed it in August 2021.
So, while I know Mr M will be disappointed, I think its more likely than not that RBS didnt do 
anything wrong in continuing to charge Mr M for his account from April 2020 to August 2021.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 September 2022.
