The complaint
Miss E complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) have unreasonably added a 
missed payment record to her credit file. Miss E says she thought shed made a payment 
due in January 2019, but her bank have told her they weren't asked for any money by 
PayPal. She also complains that PayPal should have done more to tell her the payment 
shed tried to make had not been made.
What happened
In December 2018, Miss E told her bank to stop a direct debit paying towards her PayPal 
Credit account. Instead, Miss E went online in January 2019 to make the payment due for 
the account.
Her attempts to pay didnt work. PayPals records show Miss E logged in to her account on 
2 January 2019 and tried to make a £50 payment. But this was rejected, with the record 
saying the card used was invalid. Miss E says she tried to pay £5 around 21 January, but 
PayPals records dont show any attempts to pay around this date. Ill discuss those records 
in more detail shortly. 
With no payments made, PayPal added a missed payment record to Miss Es credit file. 
Miss E found out about this some months later, when she looked in detail at her file after 
being turned down for a mortgage.
PayPal say that an automated email would have been sent to Miss E when the payment on 
2 January failed. And theyve shown they made a request for £5 on 21 January from 
Miss Es bank, but this failed because the direct debit had been cancelled.
The investigator looked into this and decided PayPal acted reasonably. Theyd asked for the 
direct debit on 21 January and werent responsible for the bank refusing to pay the £5. With 
no payment received, the missed payment record was accurate to show what had happened 
to the PayPal Credit account.
Miss E didnt agree with this view, so it has come to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In addition to what the investigator saw, Ive also seen PayPals record of the activity on Miss 
Es online account in January 2019. This information, and the details provided during our 
investigation, lead me to conclude that PayPals service was reasonable in this case. 
Its not disputed that Miss E cancelled her direct debit with her bank in December 2018. 
Thats why PayPal couldnt get the minimum payment for the account when they asked for it 
on 21 January 2019.Miss E has said in response to the investigators view that she knew the direct debit was 
cancelled. So I dont think it would have made any difference had PayPal told her the direct 
debit failed  thats what she was expecting to happen. 
Miss E says she tried to make the minimum payment around 21 January. But the PayPal 
records show no log-in on 21 January. So I cant see PayPal could have known if Miss E 
was trying to make a payment on that date. 
There was a log-in on 19 January, so Ive looked at that to see if it could be the date Miss E 
tried to make the minimum payment. But theres no record of a payment being attempted on 
that log-in. PayPal have shown me a record that says Miss E read an email about a refund 
on 19 January. 
Im not sure why Miss E thinks she made a payment, or what might have gone wrong to 
make her think shed made the payment when she hadnt. But PayPal have no record of her 
trying to make a payment. And I cant see anything in the records to say that PayPal are at 
fault for there being no trace of any payment attempts in late January. I also cant see they 
ever told Miss E that a manual payment had been successful around that date. 
So while I appreciate Miss E says she made a manual payment around 21 January, I cant 
see PayPal had anything that told them that was the case. I cant see anything to link the 
lack of a payment at this point to a failing in PayPals service. 
The only other question then is whether PayPal should have done more to tell Miss E that 
her attempt to pay on 2 January hadnt worked.
PayPal say that an automated email would have been sent when the payment failed, but 
they dont have a copy of it. Miss E says she didnt receive any email to tell her it had failed. 
Ive thought about Miss E saying she tried to make the £5 minimum payment to the account 
in late January. That says to me that she knew she still needed to make the minimum 
payment at that point. That in turn suggests she knew the 2 January payment hadnt worked 
and wasnt going to cover the minimum payment. So I find it likely that whether there was or 
wasnt an email after the failed 2 January payment, the position would have been largely the 
same  Miss E would have tried to make a second payment later in the month.
I cant see an email around 21 January was needed, as I cant see there was anything to tell 
PayPal that Miss E had tried to make a payment at that point. And as noted above, an email 
to say the direct debit had failed would simply have confirmed what Miss E was expecting 
would happen. 
My final thought is about whether generally PayPal should have done more to tell Miss E she 
had missed a payment before adding a record to her credit file. While I appreciate Miss E 
feels other lenders would have tried contacting her directly, theres no requirement for credit 
providers to do so after one missed payment. The account looks to have been paid off in full 
shortly after, and I dont see a pattern to suggest PayPal needed to do something to help 
Miss E deal with a financial difficulty.
Ultimately, PayPal have done enough here to process the payment attempt they received 
from Miss E. Its unfortunate all Miss Es efforts to pay failed, but I cant see PayPal did 
anything unreasonable to cause that, or that there was more they needed to do. The 
payment information recorded on Miss Es credit file is accurate, and Ive no persuasive 
reason to require PayPal to amend it.My final decision
I dont uphold Miss Es complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA. They dont need to 
do any more to resolve this matter. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 June 2020.
