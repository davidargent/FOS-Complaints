The complaint
Mr P complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay), trading as Fluid, irresponsibly granted him a 
Fluid credit card account that he couldnt afford to repay. 
What happened
Mr P entered into an agreement with NewDay to have access to credit with an account that 
was opened for him in October 2020 with an opening credit limit of £450. NewDay went on to 
give Mr P an increased credit limit of £1,450 in February 2021 and then a further increase to 
£2,700 in July 2021. 
Mr P says NewDay didnt complete adequate affordability checks when it opened the 
account and increased his credit limit. He says that had it done so, NewDay would have 
seen he had a history of financial difficulty. 
NewDay offered to refund Mr P all interest and charges added to Mr Ps account from when 
it increased his credit limit in July 2021. Our adjudicator said this offer was fair but Mr P is 
unhappy about it. 
The complaint has therefore come to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. So, I dont 
consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about our approach to 
these complaints is set out on our website. 
Ill first look at the account opening to see if it was fair of NewDay to grant Mr P the initial 
account credit. Ill then consider the offer NewDay has made. 
Account opening
Before granting the new account, NewDay looked into Mr Ps financial situation. I think 
NewDay gathered a reasonable amount of evidence and information from Mr P about his 
ability to repay his account. This included completing a credit check with credit reference 
agencies. These checks showed he already had around £8,500 in unsecured borrowing and 
ongoing credit commitments. NewDay says that, based on that Mr P had met its acceptance 
criteria. However, just because it looks as if NewDay carried out proportionate checks, it 
doesnt automatically mean it made a fair lending decision. So, Ive thought about what the 
evidence and information showed. 
Ive also looked at the other information and evidence NewDay gathered, including from 
Mr Ps initial application. Having done so, Im satisfied that the checks that were completed 
showed that the agreement was likely to be affordable to Mr P. I say this given what Ive 
seen about Mr Ps financial history and the income hed declared alongside the relatively low 
credit limit hed been given. So I dont think NewDay acted unfairly when approving the 
finance application. 
It follows that, having looked carefully at all the available evidence and information, I dont 
think Ive seen evidence or information that shows NewDay was unfair in allowing Mr P to 
open the account and that regular, sustained payments on the account by him would be 
unaffordable. I cant reasonably conclude that at that point NewDay ought to have known he 
would struggle to make the repayments. 
Is NewDays offer fair?
Having looked at the terms of NewDays offer to refund the interest and charges arising 
following the credit limit increase up to £2,700 in July 2021, Im satisfied that this is 
consistent with how wed expect businesses to compensate consumers in these cases. I see 
that Mr P started incurring successive late fees after his first credit limit increase, which 
suggests he was beginning to get into difficulty with managing his account. And Ive seen 
that the credit reference agency data NewDay was using shows that his overall level of 
unsecured borrowing had increased significantly in the previous two months. 
Ive kept in mind all that Mr P has told us about his financial difficulties, including reviewing 
his credit report, but unfortunately this doesnt affect my finding that NewDay acted fairly in 
granting Mr P his account and that the offer it has made is fair. However, I note that Mr P 
recently agreed a payment holiday with NewDay which ended in June 2022. I would expect 
NewDay to continue to act with appropriate forbearance in seeking to assist Mr P in his 
efforts to find a fair and manageable way to pay back the balance that is still owing on his 
account.
Putting things right  what NewDay needs to do
As NewDay has agreed it shouldnt have increased Mr Ps credit limit to £2,700, I dont think 
its fair for it to charge any interest or charges on any balances which exceeded that limit. I 
am pleased to see that NewDay has already provided a breakdown of these sums and it 
says they have now been refunded.  
To be clear, if it hasnt done so already, NewDay should:
Rework the account removing all interest and charges that have been applied to 
balances above £1,450, being the previous credit limit. 
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Mr P along with 
8% simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the 
date of settlement. NewDay should also remove all adverse information recorded 
after 21 July 2021 regarding this account from Mr Ps credit file. 
Or, if after the rework the outstanding balance still exceeds £2,700 New Day should 
arrange an affordable repayment plan with Mr P for the remaining amount. Once 
Mr P has cleared the outstanding balance, any adverse information recorded after 
21 July 2021 in relation to the account should be removed from his credit file. *HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. It must 
give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if he intends to apply the 
refund to reduce an outstanding balance, it must do so after deducting the tax.
My final decision
Im upholding Mr Ps complaint in relation to the second credit limit increase and require 
NewDay Ltd to put things right in the way Ive set out above if it hasnt done so already. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2022.
