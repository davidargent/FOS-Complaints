The complaint
Mr C complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money declined his request 
for a payment holiday when he contacted it seeking support as a result of the Covid-19 
pandemic.
  
What happened
Mr C entered into a loan agreement with 118 118 Money in June 2019. In December 2020, 
he contacted 118 118 Money and asked for a payment holiday on the loan. He said he had 
lost his job as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. 118 118 Money declined Mr Cs request, 
saying that he wasnt eligible for a payment holiday because he was unemployed.
118 118 Money offered Mr C a reduced repayment arrangement or a temporary hold on his 
account. But Mr C decided not to accept these options and instead managed to maintain the 
loan repayments until the end of the term in 2021.
But Mr C was concerned by 118 118 Moneys stance and raised a complaint. It confirmed 
that it wouldnt grant a payment holiday as Mr C was unemployed. Mr C wasnt happy with 
118 118 Moneys response and brought the complaint to this service.
Our Investigator didnt think 118 118 Money had acted fairly here. But 118 118 Money didnt 
agree and asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an Ombudsman.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont think 118 118 Money acted fairly here. Ill explain why.
During 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued guidelines for firms on the 
treatment of customers who were negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The 
guidelines said that firms should offer payment holidays to customers who were 
experiencing payment difficulties as a result of the pandemic. They said that customers 
credit files shouldnt be affected by taking a payment holiday.
Its clear that the reason Mr C contacted 118 118 Money in December 2020 was because of 
the impact Covid-19 was having on his income. He confirmed that hed lost his job as a 
result of the pandemic. His account was up-to-date at that point and had been well 
maintained from the start. 
But 118 118 Money says that, if it had granted a payment holiday, interest would have 
continued to accrue on Mr Cs loan during that period. It says this would have led to higher 
repayments after the payment holiday in order to clear the balance within the term. It says it 
didnt think this was in Mr Cs interests as he was unemployed.
The FCA guidance didnt oblige a firm to offer a payment holiday if it determines (acting 
reasonably) that it is obviously not in the customers interests. But I dont find that 118 118 
Money made a reasonable determination that this was the case for Mr C. It didnt ask any 
questions about his situation even at the complaint stage, and its clear from the call he 
made in December 2020 that the agent was applying a blanket policy of declining payment 
holidays to customers who were unemployed. I dont think that was fair or in the spirit of the 
FCA guidelines.
118 118 Money also says that the guidelines were intended to apply to temporary loss of 
income and that Mr C becoming unemployed wasnt a short-term issue. As above, I dont 
find that 118 118 Money looked into Mr Cs situation enough to establish whether this was 
the case. And its approach is at odds with the fact that he told it he had lost work earlier in 
the pandemic but had managed to find employment again, albeit for a short time only. If 118 
118 Money had granted the payment holiday, it would have eased the pressure on Mr C 
over that period while he tried to find work. I dont find that 118 118 Money really considered 
what was in Mr Cs interests and I dont think its decision was reasonable.
I note that 118 118 Money offered Mr C some other options. But I think it was reasonable for 
him to decline these. Thats because they would have had a negative impact on his credit 
file. A payment holiday in line with the FCA guidelines wouldnt have had this negative 
impact, and I think it would have been the more suitable option here.
In summary, I think Mr C was eligible for support in line with the FCA guidelines. I dont think 
it was reasonable for 118 118 Money to decline his request for the payment holiday. By 
doing so, it caused stress and inconvenience for Mr C which could have been avoided.
  
Putting things right
As Mr C managed to maintain the loan repayments and has now repaid the loan in full, I 
think the most appropriate way for 118 118 Money to put things right here is to pay Mr C 
compensation. Taking everything into account, I think £150 would be a fair amount.
  
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint. Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 
Money should pay compensation of £150 to Mr C.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 February 2022.
