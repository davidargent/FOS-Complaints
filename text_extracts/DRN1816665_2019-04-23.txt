K820x#14complaint
Mr E complains that NewDay Ltd unfairly  charged  late payment fees to his credit card 
account and then registered  a default on his credit  file. As a result his mortgage application 
was declined.
Ref: DRN18166652background
In October  2017 Mr E took out a NewDay credit card during an online purchase.  He made  
two small purchases with it. He says he tried to set up repayments by direct  debit online with 
NewDay but that option wasnt available.  He said he rang NewDay  to set up repayments by 
phone but couldnt get through.  He therefore didnt make his first repayment and NewDay 
added a late payment  charge.
In January 2018 Mr E rang NewDay  and paid the sum he owed for his purchases,  but 
disputed the late payment  charges.  He also tried to close the account, but NewDay  wouldnt 
allow this. As Mr Es account continued to show a balance,  and he made no more  
repayments, late payment  charges continued  to accumulate. 
NewDay sent regular  letters  to Mr E about his balance and the fact that he wasnt making  
the necessary  minimum repayments. These  letters  included contact phone numbers so that 
he could discuss any financial difficulties he might  be having. They also included  contact 
details for debt advice  organisations.
After  some  months NewDay sent Mr E a statutory  default notice, and when he failed to 
respond to that within the stated time period, NewDay registered  a default on his credit file 
and sold his debt to a third party.
Having complained initially to NewDay Mr E then complained to us.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Mr E's complaint  should  be upheld. She commented that 
although Mr E had said he didnt receive his account statements by post, and therefore didnt 
know he had an outstanding balance, she could see that he had accessed his account 
online in December 2017. His statements were available  on the account and showed his 
outstanding balance. Furthermore,  having  used his card for purchases  he should reasonably 
have known that he would be expected to make a repayment.
And although Mr E had said the website hadnt  allowed him to set up direct debit 
repayments, our adjudicator said that it did include a direct  debit option. But in any event 
there were a number  of other repayment  mechanisms  open to Mr E.
Subsequently, when  Mr E failed to respond  to any of the repayment  reminders  sent by 
NewDay, the business issued a default notice and then recoded a default  on Mr Es credit 
reference file. Having considered all that had happened here our adjudicator didnt think that 
NewDay had done anything wrong.
Mr E asked for an ombudsmans decision. He said that the default  had been unfairly 
recorded by NewDay  and had resulted in his mortgage application being refused. The 
consequences of the default  had therefore been severe and disproportionate. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The terms and conditions  attached to credit  card accounts require card holders to make  
minimum repayments by the due date. If they do not then late payment  fees will be incurred.
Ref: DRN18166653Having taken out a NewDay credit card and made two small purchases with it, it was 
incumbent on Mr E to ensure that he repaid  the minimum sum required each month. Mr E 
said he tried unsuccessfully to set up a direct  debit on the website, and to ring NewDay.  But 
whilst I accept that he may indeed have done so the fact that he wasnt  successful doesnt 
absolve him from the responsibility to pay what he owed. The website lists alternative ways 
that customers can make repayments  and Mr E should have pursued one of these.
Having failed to make the minimum repayment  by the due date NewDay  applied a late 
payment charge to the account, which it was entitled  to do based on the account terms and 
conditions. Mr E believed  that this had been unfairly  applied and although he paid off the 
purchase element  of the outstanding balance he refused to pay the late payment charge and 
complained to NewDay.
As he made no further repayments he inevitably continued to incur monthly late payment 
charges. NewDay wrote  regularly about the non-payment and suggested  that he rang them 
to discuss help that might be available if he was in financial difficulty. After some  months 
NewDay sent Mr E a default  notice giving him 28 days to take action. But he didnt and a 
default was recorded on his credit  file. NewDay also sold the debt to a third party.
Having considered the detail of what happened  here Im afraid that I cannot  conclude that 
NewDay has done anything wrong.  Mr E didnt make the necessary repayments  and so late 
fees were validly  applied. As this situation continued  his account was defaulted.  I note 
however that NewDay agreed to refund two late payment fees, which  it was not required to 
do.
Mr E believes the default on his credit file prevented him from getting a mortgage. This may 
be true although  mortgage companies  take a range of factors  into account in determining 
whether to approve an application. Although I am sorry  about this, and about the possible 
adverse implications of the default  on any future applications Mr E may make for credit, Im 
afraid that I cannot  reasonably conclude  that NewDay has done  anything wrong here.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 May 2019.
