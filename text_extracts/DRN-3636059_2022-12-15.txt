The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank UK Plc (NatWest) defaulted his credit card 
account.
What happened
Mr M says that NatWest did not respond appropriately to his financial difficulties due to the 
pandemic. He says his monthly income dropped from over £4,000 to about £500 and he 
asked for the interest to be frozen and to be allowed to make token minimal payments. Mr M 
says NatWest continued to charge interest during his first payment holiday and his account 
went over its credit limit. He says that, although he continued to make token payments the 
account was defaulted and passed to a debt collection agency (DCA). Mr M adds that he did 
not feel NatWest had engaged with him to try to find a long-term solution.
NatWest apologised that it did not respond to a letter Mr M sent on 29 December 2020, but 
explained that it did not receive it. However, it credited £50 to Mr Ms credit card account for 
the disappointment this caused. It said its collections team would have provided all the 
relevant information before Mr M entered into a financial hardship plan which resulted in the 
closure and default of his account. It confirmed that NatWest was following the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance and was using a DCA to manage Mr Ms plan and 
payments. NatWest added that it had attempted to help Mr M with payment breaks, a 
repayment plan and refunds of arrears and interest, so it could not agree it hadnt offered 
support.
Our investigator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He thought it was fair 
for NatWest not to extend Mr Ms payment break given this would require full contractual 
payments at the end of the plan. He found NatWest discussed the option of a repayment 
plan, but that Mr M declined this due to the impact on his credit file. Our investigator 
considered it was inevitable the account would default given the pandemics effect on Mr Ms 
business and it was in his best interests to have the default registered as early as possible.
Mr M responded to say, in summary, that the actions of NatWest were short-sighted and that 
had his account not been defaulted he said it was highly likely that he would have been able 
to resume normal payments by July 2022.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Ms business relied on income that was severely impacted by the Covid pandemic 
restrictions. As a result, he contacted NatWest in April 2020 to request a payment deferral.  
In line with recent FCA guidance, NatWest agreed to a three-month payment deferral.
In July 2020, NatWest wrote to Mr M to tell him that his payment break was ending. When 
Mr M requested an extension of the deferral period, NatWest asked him about his income 
and expenditure and offered him free independent money advice, which he declined. 
NatWest said it couldnt offer a further payment break, as this would require Mr M to return to 
contractual repayments following the break which he was unable to do. Instead it offered its 
forbearance plan which meant interest would be frozen. Mr M declined this due to the impact 
this would have on his credit file.
NatWest charged no further interest after July 2020 and Mr M made his minimum payment in 
August 2020 but was unable to make any further contractual payments. His account was 
then defaulted on 30 November 2020.
I have considered the FCAs guidance in the context of NatWests response to Mr M and Im 
satisfied NatWests actions were within the guidelines. The guidance was clear that deferrals 
should only apply where payment difficulties were considered temporary, as interest would 
continue to be applied and any deferred payments would need to be repaid. In Mr Ms case, 
it became clear that his financial difficulties would extend beyond a further three months and 
so another deferral wouldnt be appropriate due to the likely detrimental impact on Mr Ms 
financial situation.
I consider NatWest acted fairly and reasonably by freezing interest when it did and 
subsequently defaulting Mr Ms account. Im satisfied that NatWest applied the default when 
it became clear that Mr M would not be able to make his repayments for the foreseeable 
future. I acknowledge that Mr M said this approach was short-sighted as he believed hed 
have been able to resume normal payments by mid-2022. Given the Payment Deferral 
Guidance expired on 31 July 2021, I find it likely that Mr Ms account would still have 
defaulted. As a default shows on a credit file for six years, any delay in applying it would 
have impacted Mr Ms credit file for longer and so Im satisfied NatWest acted in his best 
interests by defaulting the account when it did and not allowing further interest charges to 
accrue.
Finally, I consider the £50 NatWest credited to Mr Ms account was fair and reasonable for 
the lack of response to his letter. I also find NatWest was entitled to pass the management of 
Mr Ms account to a DCA.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 January 2023.
