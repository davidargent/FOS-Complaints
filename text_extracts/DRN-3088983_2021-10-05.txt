The complaint
Mrs T complains that someone elses information was displayed on her TransUnion 
International UK Limited credit report. 
What happened
Mrs T has explained when she applied for a mortgage last year it was initially declined. 
When Mrs T checked her credit file she found entries that related to someone else. 
Mrs T complained to TransUnion and explained her mortgage application had been 
impacted by the incorrect information it was reporting. 
TransUnion responded to Mrs Ts complaint at the end of December 2020 and apologised 
for the error. TransUnion said it would take steps to remove the duplicate entries, but Mrs Ts 
credit file wasnt fully corrected until May 2021. 
Mrs T referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
upheld Mrs Ts complaint and asked TransUnion to pay her £500 for the distress and 
inconvenience caused by its actions. TransUnion asked to appeal so this complaint has 
been passed to me to make a decision. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive been reasonably brief in setting out the background as all parties broadly agree on the 
timeline of Mrs Ts complaint. Im pleased that, despite taking several months, TransUnion 
was able to remove the other individuals details from Mrs Ts credit file. That resolves the 
main issue. 
Ive considered how to fairly resolve this complaint. Mrs T has provided evidence that shows 
her mortgage application didnt go smoothly and I understand it was delayed as a result of 
the information on her TransUnion credit file. In addition, despite Mrs T first reporting the 
issue to TransUnion in November 2020, it took until May 2021 to resolve. I agree with the 
investigator that the delay in resolving the credit file issues caused Mrs T an unreasonable 
amount of inconvenience. And Im satisfied she had to keep contacting TransUnion to ask 
for help, despite being told the problem was fixed. 
I agree with the investigator that £500 fairly reflects the impact of the errors made in this 
case on Mrs T and the length of time the situation remained ongoing. I understand 
TransUnion feels the level of compensation awarded is too high, but I dont agree. I think it 
reflects the stress and worry caused to Mrs T along with the amount of time she spent trying 
to resolve matters with TransUnion and her mortgage lender. 
As Im satisfied a settlement of £500 is fair in all the circumstances, Im going to uphold Mrs 
Ts complaint on that basis. 
  
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct TransUnion International UK Limited to 
pay Mrs T £500.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 November 2021.
