The complaint
Mr E complains that PrePay Technologies Limited closed his business bank account without 
notice and withheld his funds. 
What happened
Mr E had an account with one of PrePays agents. For ease, within my decision, Ill only to 
refer to PrePay. 
On 13 October 2021 PrePay blocked Mr Es business account. On 15 October 2021 they 
closed his account and asked Mr E for a nominated account, and bank statement, to allow 
the return of his funds, £239.86. 
Mr E complained to PrePay about their decision to close his account with immediate effect. 
But he wasnt satisfied with PrePays response so Mr E brought his complaint to our service. 
One of our investigator's looked into Mr E's complaint. In summary they thought PrePay 
didn't act fairly in closing Mr E's account without notice, and recommended he was 
compensated £100. But they thought PrePay acted fairly in not refunding his balance as he 
wasn't able to supply a statement for an account outside the PrePay group. 
PrePay didnt accept our investigators view, in response they argued that they had sufficient 
reasons to close Mr Es account without notice. 
As PrePay didnt agree the case has been passed to me to decide. 
On being allocated Mr Es decision I shared my initial thoughts with both parties. In summary 
I explained to PrePay that I didnt think theyd acted fairly in closing Mr Es account without 
notice. 
I explained that I was satisfied that the initial block on 13 October 2021 was fair, however as 
PrePay should have provided Mr E the full 60 day notice period I recommended his funds 
were returned plus 8% and £200 compensation for the inconvenience caused. 
Neither party agreed to my thoughts. In summary PrePay agreed to pay £200 compensation 
to Mr E, however they didnt accept my recommendation to return the account balance and 
8% from the date of closure to the date of return. PrePay argued that they couldnt return the 
funds as Mr E didnt provide a suitable alternative bank account. 
Mr E argued that the level of compensation wasnt sufficient for the impact on him from 
PrePays actions. Mr E advised that he lost out on a lucrative contract with a large business 
as he didnt have an open business account. 
I asked Mr E for further evidence of the lost contract, and details of the failed business 
account applications. 
As neither party accepted my thoughts Ive proceeded to issue my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PrePay have now accepted they didnt have sufficient evidence to close Mr Es account 
immediately. But for completeness Ill briefly consider PrePays actions in closing Mr Es 
account immediately. 
I cant see any evidence that PrePay reached out to Mr E to provide him with a chance to 
explain his account activity. Mr E explained that he was paying contractors for insulation and 
security. And he's provided invoices which fit the timeframe and amounts he withdrew. 
Having reviewed the invoices I'm satisfied that Mr E provided a satisfactory explanation for 
the large cash withdrawals on his account. 
I've moved on to consider the restriction of Mr E's funds. I'm satisfied the initial block, on 
13 October 2021, was fair. However on 15 October 2021 Mr Es account was closed 
immediately, which for the reasons I've already explained I think was unfair. If PrePay had 
given Mr E 60 days' rather than immediate notice, he'd have been given the chance to 
withdraw the funds - and wouldn't have lost access. PrePay have argued that Mr E didnt 
provide a suitable account for the money to be withdrawn too  however, if hed been given 
60 days notice then Mr E would have been able to transfer or withdraw his funds into an 
account of his choosing during the notice period. 
It follows, I think Mr E should be compensated for not having access to his funds since 
15 October 2021. I think Mr E should be compensated 8% interest from the date of the 
closure to the date these are returned. 
Ive considered the impact of PrePays actions on Mr E. Mr Es argued that he lost out on 
contracts because he wasnt able to get a new business current account. I asked Mr E for 
evidence of the lost contracts, and the declined business current accounts. Mr E provided a 
copy of an email he received from a business agreeing a contract for his services. However, 
hes not provided anything to show why he wasnt able to fulfil this contract  or why the loss 
of his PrePay business account led to him losing the contract. I understand this will be 
disappointing to Mr E, but having considered the evidence hes supplied I cant fairly 
conclude PrePays actions led to him losing out on a lucrative contract  and therefore I 
wont be increasing the compensation I awarded in my initial thoughts. 
Putting things right
Im satisfied that Mr E experienced distress from PrePays actions in withholding his funds 
and closing his account with immediate notice. I think £200 is fair compensation for the 
inconvenience caused in not having access to them. 
My final decision
My final decision is I direct PrePay Technologies Limited to:
Pay Mr E £200
Pay Mr E £239.86 plus 8% interest from 15 October 2021 to the date the funds are 
returned. 
If PrePay considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct income tax from 
that interest, it should tell Mr E how much its taken off. It should also give Mr E a tax 
deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 September 2023.
