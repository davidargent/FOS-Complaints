The complaint
Mr N and Mrs S complained about the difficulties they encountered when trying to redeem 
their mortgage with Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays).
What happened
Mr N and Mrs S had a buy to let mortgage with Barclays. Barclays sent them a letter in early 
September 2020 stating that their mortgage was due to mature on 3 April 2021 and asking 
that they make arrangements to redeem the mortgage. They were also offered the option of 
applying to extend the term of the mortgage and were asked to contact the sales team if they 
wanted to discuss options. Mr N and Mrs S said they tried to ring Barclays numerous times 
but werent able to get through because the queue times were too long.  
Barclays sent another letter in mid-February 2021 letting Mr N and Mrs S know that a 
maturity redemption statement would be sent 30 days before the redemption date. 
Mr N and Mrs S said they didnt receive a redemption statement and so tried to ring Barclays 
again. They said they werent able to get through and so spoke to an advisor using the 
online chat facility. They were provided with the details of the account that was to be used to 
repay the mortgage, but not the full redemption amount. They requested a redemption 
statement. 
Barclays sent a redemption statement dated 23 March 2021, although Mr N and Mrs S said 
they didnt receive this until after the redemption date. This listed the redemption amount as 
£135,080.63  made up of £135,000 capital balance and £80.63 interest. 
Mr N and Mrs S werent able to make a single payment to pay the mortgage off, so they 
made a payment of £50,000 on 29 March 2021, £50,000 on 30 March 2021 and £35,000 on 
31 March 2021. This meant the capital balance was paid off in full. 
Barclays didnt immediately apply the three payments to Mr N and Mrs Ss account. The 
payment made on 29 March 2021 was applied on 6 April 2021. Barclays then sent Mr N and 
Mrs S a redemption statement dated 7 April 2021, which showed the other two payments 
hadnt been applied. Mr N and Mrs S contacted Barclays to query this and Barclays said it 
would correctly apply the other two payments. 
Barclays wrote to Mr N and Mrs S on 21 April 2021 and said there was a balance of 
£49,996.86 outstanding on the mortgage. Barclays said the new monthly mortgage payment 
amount would be £45.41. 
Barclays wrote to Mr N and Mrs S on 27 April 2021 to say it hadnt received a response to its 
letter dated 7 April 2021, and asked them to forward the redemption funds. 
Mr N and Mrs S complained to Barclays. 
Barclays responded on 11 May 2021. It acknowledged that Mr N and Mrs S received poor 
service. It said the three payments made by them hadnt been applied by it to the mortgage 
account on time. Barclays said that once the payments were applied, it was only able to 
backdate the payments to 3 April 2021. So it offered a refund of £30 towards the interest 
incurred from the time the payments were made to the date the payments were backdated 
to. It said that, as a result of its errors, a balance of £146.45 remained on the mortgage. 
Barclays said it cleared this amount as a gesture of goodwill. It also offered £175 
compensation, by way of an apology. 
Mr N and Mrs S then brought their complaint to this Service. When our Investigator 
contacted Barclays, it revised its offer to Mr N and Mrs S. It offered to do the following: 
To refund the amount of £45.41 collected by direct debit on 4 May 2021.
Pay £30 for the additional interest charged in early April 2021. 
Pay £250 for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Mr N and Mrs S declined the offer, so our Investigator then looked into the complaint. She 
said Barclays initially offered to waive the final repayment charge of £195 and this, along 
with what it offered more recently, as outlined above, was a fair outcome. 
Mr N and Mrs S didnt agree. They asked for the last monthly payment of £122.62 to be 
refunded and for compensation totalling £500. Our Investigator said Barclays didnt need to 
refund the £122.62 as this was taken to cover interest from the period 3 March 2021 to 
3 April 2021. She said Barclays recognised it shouldnt have charged interest between 
29 March 2021 and 3 April 2021, which is why the £30 refund was being offered. 
As Mr N and Mrs S didnt agree, this came to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres no doubt Barclays has made errors here, in terms of the letters and statements it 
should have sent out but didnt, the delays in applying the payments made to the mortgage 
account and its inability to properly backdate the payments so that no interest would be 
charged. I can see how Mr N and Mrs S must have found this situation frustrating and 
inconvenient, in particular as they had to contact Barclays on several occasions to try and 
make sure Barclays put right the errors made. I can also see how they must have found it 
worrying to have been sent letters telling them payments they knew had been made werent 
received. 
I think its important to let Mr N and Mrs S know that this Service doesnt punish businesses 
for errors made. When a business makes an error, our approach is to consider the impact of 
that error  in other words, whether it has caused distress, inconvenience or financial loss. 
So Ive looked at what Barclays has offered to do to put things right here, to see whether 
what its offered is fair. 
Ive first of all looked at whether any interest needs to be refunded. Mr N and Mrs S want 
Barclays to refund the last payment of £122.62 they made to cover interest charged on the 
mortgage account. But I dont think its fair to ask Barclays to refund the entire amount. This 
payment was made to cover interest charged between 3 March and 3 April 2021. So the 
majority of this has been fairly charged. Barclays has already said it shouldnt have charged 
interest from the date of the first payment made by Mr N and Mrs S on 29 March 2021 to the 
date it was able to backdate the payments to, which was 3 April 2021. To make sure Mr N 
and Mrs S arent out of pocket, its agreed to refund a total of £30 interest. I can see that this 
is more than the actual interest charged during the period in question, so Im satisfied 
Barclays acted fairly here when it said it would refund this amount. Barclays also said it would waive the £195 final repayment charge, because it said it omitted 
this amount on the first redemption statement sent to Mr N and Mrs S, and so Mr N and 
Mrs S werent aware of it. I think this is fair. In order to do this, Barclays applied a credit of 
£146.45 to their mortgage account. The full amount of £195 wasnt credited at that stage, as 
it should have been, as two other payments had been credited to the account  one of £3.14 
interest and one of £45.41 for a direct debit collected in early May 2021. This means that 
Mr N and Mrs S didnt initially have the benefit of having these two amounts credited to their 
account. 
However, Barclays has now agreed to refund the direct debit of £45.41, which I think is fair 
as interest shouldnt have been charged for April/May 2021. And the interest amount of 
£3.14 is part of the interest payment of £30 to be refunded to Mr N and Mrs S. This means 
that Mr N and Mrs S will not have suffered a financial loss of any kind, once Barclays make 
the refunds its said it will make. 
Barclays has also offered to pay £250 compensation for the distress and inconvenience 
caused. The distress here is that Mr N and Mrs S were put in a position where the lack of 
information meant they were unsure about how much to pay and how to pay it, and the 
additional worry of not knowing where their payments went when Barclays failed to correctly 
apply them. And they were inconvenienced by having to contact Barclays on numerous 
occasions to sort these matters out. Im satisfied the amount of £250 already offered by 
Barclays is fair compensation for that distress and inconvenience. 
Putting things right
To put things right Barclays should: 
Refund £30 to cover interest charged in error to 3 April 2021. 
Refund £45.41, which is the amount of the direct debit taken on 4 May 2021
Ensure the final repayment charge is waived. 
Pay £250 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
My final decision
Its my final decision that I require Barclays Bank UK PLC to refund £30 to cover interest 
charged in error, refund the direct debit amount of £45.41, ensure the final repayment 
charge is waived and pay £250 compensation to Mr N and Mrs S. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision before 28 July 2022
