The complaint
Mr K complains that British Gas Insurance Limited is responsible for poor service in 
connection with his home emergency insurance policy.
What happened
Where I refer to British Gas I refer to the insurance company of that name and I include 
other companies and individuals insofar as I hold that insurance company responsible for 
their actions.
Mr K had kitchen appliance cover including for a fridge freezer. After visits in July 2019, he 
complained about poor service going back about six years.
Mr K brought his complaint to us in October 2019. British Gas sent its final response on 19 
October 2019. It offered £20.00.
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld in part. She thought that 
British Gas didnt fit a part correctly and had to schedule another appointment to rectify this. 
She thought it reasonable for British Gas to cover food costs on this occasion.
The investigator recommended that British Gas should:
1. increase the compensation amount for inconvenience from £20.00 to £50.00; and
2. pay £30.00 for the cost of food loss.
British Gas agreed with the investigators opinion. It says will agree to the increase in 
compensation by a further £60.00.
Mr K disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. He says, in summary, that:
The fridge freezer had one predominant issue and it concerns its ability to maintain
the required cooling temperature.
Had the previous engineers undertaken a thorough investigation equal to what the
engineer had done on 26 April 2019 then the issue would have been resolved a long
time ago.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
DRN-1690513reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
From the later renewal letters, I find it likely that Mr K had a policy from 27 August 2013 at 
the latest. 
Mr K says that the fridge freezer suffered a cooling fault in around 2013. But neither he nor 
British Gas has provided details of a visit that year.  I can see that British Gas made a visit 
for the fridge freezer in June 2014.
Ive seen a renewal letter for the year from 27 August 2014. Since at least that time, the 
policy terms provided for repair or  if that was impossible or uneconomic  a percentage of 
the cost of replacement. In the case of an appliance over there years old the contribution 
was 30%. 
Since at least 2014 the British Gas policy terms have said that its visit may be by its own 
engineers or its contractors. 
I can also see that British Gas made visits for the fridge freezer in April 2015. 
Ive seen a renewal letter for the year from 27 August 2015. But Ive also seen a letter for the 
year from 3 April 2016 relating to Mr Ks current address. So I find that Mr K took out a new 
policy. I think that since then he has lived with his sister and his mother who needs to store 
medication in the fridge.
I can see that British Gas made a visit for the fridge freezer in March  2017.
Ive seen a renewal letter for the year from 3 April 2017. And I can see that British Gas made 
a visit for the fridge freezer in February 2018.
Ive seen a renewal letter for the year from 3 April 2018. And I can see that British Gas made 
visits for the fridge freezer in June 2018.
Ive seen a renewal letter for the year from 3 April 2019. And I can see that British Gas made 
three visits in July 2019.
On the visit on 24 July 2019, the engineer suggested a mod kit.  The engineer returned to 
fit the mod kit on 26 July 2019.
There was another visit on 29 July 2019 when the engineer re-fitted a fan. From that I find 
it likely that he hadnt fitted it correctly on 26 July 2019. And that caused some 
inconvenience to Mr K and his family.
Mr K hasnt provided any details of wasted food or of take-away meals he bought. So he 
hasnt provided enough evidence to show a loss. But British Gas has accepted the 
investigators figure of £30.00.
From what Mr K has said, I infer that the mod kit worked well. He was left with the 
impression that British Gas could and should have fitted it years previously. He quotes 
British Gas as saying it shouldve fixed the appliance by the third visit. 
Mr K thinks some of the previous engineers were contractors and not all as good as the 
British Gas engineer who visited in July 2019. But Mr K left long gaps after the visits in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018 before he contacted 
British Gas again. So  whatever it said in July 2019  I dont find it likely that British Gas 
had failed to fix a single problem that had been ongoing for all those years.  
As British Gas has repaired Mr Ks appliance, I dont uphold his complaint that British Gas 
should contribute to the cost of a replacement.
Under the rules by which the Financial Ombudsman Service is bound, a business has up to 
eight weeks after a complaint to issue a final response. We can only investigate complaints 
brought to us after a final response or the expiry of the eight weeks.
After Mr K complained in about August 2019, British Gas closed his complaint in error for a 
few days. And it didnt send a final response within eight weeks.
But Mr K brought his complaint to us on about 11 October 2019  before the British Gas final 
response dated 19 October 2019. So I dont find that its errors caused any significant delay.
Theres no evidence that Mr K complained to British Gas about increased premiums before 
he brought his complaint to us. So  in the absence of consent from British Gas  Mr Ks 
complaint about that will have to be dealt with separately.
Putting things right
Overall I find it fair and reasonable to direct British Gas to pay Mr K  in addition to its offer 
of £20.00  a further £60.00 for distress and inconvenience including any loss of food.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct British Gas Insurance Limited to pay Mr K (insofar as it hasnt already paid him) 
£80.00 for distress and inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2020.
