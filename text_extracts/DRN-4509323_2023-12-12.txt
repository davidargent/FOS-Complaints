The complaint
Mrs Z complains that HSBC UK Bank plc wont refund to her the money that she paid for a 
timeshare interest. Shes being represented in her complaint by a claims management 
company.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in October 2023 in which I described what 
had happened as follows:
Mrs Z entered into a contract for purchase and sale to buy a timeshare interest from 
a holiday company in September 2017. The purchase price of the interest was 
US$37,900. Her representative says that she part-exchanged a previous purchase 
that was given a value of US$22,745 and that she paid US$13,655 using her HSBC 
credit card, but the evidence thats been provided shows that she entered into a 
promissory note with the holiday company in the amount of US$13,655 in which she 
agreed to pay that amount by 120 monthly instalments of US$203.80. Mrs Z did 
make a payment to the holiday company using her HSBC credit card in September 
2017 for US$2,090 and £1,605.56, and a non-sterling transaction fee of £48.01, were 
charged to her account.
Mrs Zs representative, on behalf of Mrs Z, made a claim to HSBC in July 2020 under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the holiday company 
misrepresented the product to Mrs Z and breached its contract with her by not 
providing its services with reasonable skill and care and by not providing its services 
within a reasonable time.
HSBC didnt provide a substantive response to that claim so a complaint was made 
to this service. Mrs Zs complaint form says that the holiday company was in breach 
of the contract by misrepresenting the contract to Mrs Z and breaching the EU 
timeshare directive. HSBC then said that the documents provided show that Mrs Z 
made payments using her HSBC credit card to the holiday company totalling 
£8,843.15 but the agreement was for £38,490 and section 75 only applies to claims 
up to £30,000 so it was unable to review Mrs Zs claim any further.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Zs complaint should be upheld. She said 
that the purchase price was in excess of £30,000 which meant that the protections 
under section 75 didnt apply. She said that she thought that HSBC had fairly 
investigated Mrs Zs claim and wasnt going to ask that it do anything further to 
resolve this complaint.
Mrs Zs representative, on behalf of Mrs Z, says that it doesnt agree with our 
investigators recommendation and has asked for this complaint to be referred to an 
ombudsman. It says that Mrs Zs evidence has been given no weight and there are 
various elements of the contract agreed between Mrs Z and the holiday company 
that give rise to an unfair bargaining position, under section 140A of the Consumer 
Credit Act, such as the loss of use of the significant sums paid by Mrs Z in the event 
of any default of payment. It also says that other claims brought by those who have 
purchased from the holiday company are similarly ignored.
I said in my provisional decision: I consider that Mrs Zs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mrs Zs claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right 
to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided 
that certain criteria set out in that section are met);
one of those criteria is that section 75 doesnt apply to a claim so far as the claim 
relates to any single item to which the supplier has attached a cash price not 
exceeding £100 or more than £30,000;
HSBC says that the purchase price for the timeshare interest was £38,490 so it 
was unable to review Mrs Zs claim any further;
the contract for purchase and sale shows that the purchase price for the 
timeshare interest was US$37,900  Ive looked at the applicable exchange rates 
from September 2017 and consider that US$37,900 was less than £30,000 at 
that time so I consider that Mrs Zs claim did relate to a single item to which the 
supplier had attached a cash price of less than £30,000 and I consider that HSBC 
should have considered her claim under section 75;
Mrs Zs representative says that Mrs Z paid US$13,655 to the holiday company 
using her HSBC credit card but the evidence thats been provided shows that 
Mrs Z entered into a promissory note with the holiday company in the amount of 
US$13,655 in which she agreed to pay that amount by 120 monthly instalments 
of US$203.80 and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs Z paid any of the 
purchase price using her HSBC credit card;
Mrs Z did make a payment to the holiday company using her HSBC credit card in 
September 2017 for US$2,090 and £1,605.56, and a non-sterling transaction fee 
of £48.01, were charged to her account  and HSBC says that Mrs Zs evidence 
shows that the following amounts were also charged to her HSBC credit card 
account for payments made to the holiday company: £151.15 and £1,073.96 in 
May 2018 and £6,012.48 in June 2018; so it says that shes evidenced payments 
totalling £8,843.15;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that those payments 
were made to pay any part of the purchase price that Mrs Z agreed to pay for the 
timeshare interest  it may be that they were payments under the promissory 
note but, even if they were, I dont consider that Mrs Z would then be able to 
make a section 75 claim to HSBC about a breach of the contract for the purchase 
and sale of the timeshare interest or that the timeshare interest was 
misrepresented to her;
even if Im wrong about that and the payments made to the holiday company by 
Mrs Z using her HSBC credit card were payments towards the purchase price of 
the timeshare interest, I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that 
Mrs Zs complaint should be upheld for the following reasons;
Mrs Zs claim under section 75 is that the timeshare interest was misrepresented 
to her and that she wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to her 
and that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday company;Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court 
would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not HSBCs response to 
Mrs Zs claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mrs Zs representatives July 2020 letter says that the holiday company breached 
its contract with Mrs Z by not providing its services with reasonable skill and care 
and by not providing its services within a reasonable time  and Mrs Zs 
complaint form says that the holiday company was in breach of the contract by 
misrepresenting the contract to Mrs Z and breaching the EU timeshare directive;
Mrs Zs representative July 2020 letter also says that Mrs Z was advised that: the 
package would enable her to purchase an investment, which she could sell at a 
later date for an amount in excess of the sum paid; and the product was of some 
substance but its now clear that its worthless and has no merit;
the contract for purchase and sale shows that Mrs Z was buying a timeshare 
interest in a timeshare resort which entitled her to use an assigned unit for a 
specified week each year  I consider that interest to be of substance and to 
have worth;
neither Mrs Z nor her representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which she was told that the purchase would be an investment, 
the conversations that took place or the information that was provided to her and 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday 
company represented to Mrs Z that the purchase would be an investment;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the timeshare 
interest was misrepresented to Mr Z by the holiday company or that she was 
induced into entering into the contract by any such misrepresentations;
the timeshare interest is located outside of the UK and the EU so Im not 
persuaded that the EU timeshare directive would apply to Mrs Zs timeshare 
interest and neither Mrs Zs representatives July 2020 letter nor Mrs Zs 
complaint form provides any detailed information about the alleged breaches of 
contract by the holiday company so Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that theres been a breach of contract in these circumstances;
Mrs Zs representative has said, in response to our investigators 
recommendation, that there are various elements of the contract agreed between 
Mrs Z and the holiday company that give rise to an unfair bargaining position, 
under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act, such as the loss of use of the 
significant sums paid by Mrs Z in the event of any default of payment  but no 
claim under section 140A was included in the July 2020 letter that was sent to 
HSBC and no complaint about HSBCs response to such a claim was included in 
Mrs Zs complaint form so Im unable to make any finding on such a complaint in 
this decision;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor 
to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines 
that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor  but, even 
if I was able to make a finding on a claim under section 140A, Mrs Z used her 
existing credit card to make payments to the holiday company and I dont 
consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that the relationship between 
HSBC and Mrs Z arising out of her credit card agreement with it was unfair in 
these circumstances;
Mrs Zs representative says that other claims brought by those who have 
purchased from the holiday company are similarly ignored  but this service 
considers each complaint on its individual merits and it would be for those purchasers to make claims to their credit providers about the unfairness of the 
debtor-creditor relationship if theyre entitled to do so;
HSBC didnt respond to Mrs Zs claim and then I consider that it incorrectly said 
that it was unable to review her claim so I cant say that its response to her claim 
was fair or reasonable  but if it had properly considered her section 75 claim I 
consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it not to have upheld that 
claim; and
I sympathise with Mrs Z for the issues that shes had with her timeshare interest 
but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require HSBC to refund to Mrs Z any of the money that she paid for it, to pay her 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
Subject to any further comments or evidence that I received from any of Mrs Z, her 
representative and HSBC, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend to uphold this 
complaint. HSBC says that it has nothing further to add but neither Mrs Z nor her 
representative has responded to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Mrs Z nor her representative has responded to my provisional decision and HSBC 
says that it has nothing further to add, I see no reason to change the findings that I set out in 
my provisional decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Zs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2024.
