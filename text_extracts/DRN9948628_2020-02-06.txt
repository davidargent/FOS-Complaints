K821x#15complaint
Mr S says PDL Finance Limited,  trading as Mr Lender, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent Mr S and Mr Lender my provisional  findings  on this complaint  on 21 January 2020. 
An extract  from my provisional decision can be found below and forms part of this final 
decision. I explained which parts of Mr S complaint I was able to look at. And I set out what 
I intended to ask Mr Lender  to do to put things  right in respect of the parts  of Mr S complaint  
I thought should be upheld.
I asked Mr S and Mr Lender to let me know if they had anything  to add. Mr S said he was 
happy with my proposed resolution.  Mr Lender responded, but only with procedural points 
which I do not need to address in this decision.  
I am now ready to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mr S accepted my provisional  findings, and as Mr Lender didnt send me anything else to 
consider in respect of the merits  of Mr S complaint, I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional findings. So my final decision is the same  as my provisional decision, for the 
same reasons.
putting things right
Mr Lender must:
refund  the rollover charges Mr S paid on loan 1 after May 2012
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid in respect of loan 2
add to the above refunds interest at 8% simple per year, from when Mr S paid the 
interest and charges,  until the date of settlement 
remove any adverse information  about  loan 2 from Mr S credit history (if it hasnt yet 
fallen off his credit  history)
HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest.  Mr Lender must  give 
Mr S a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr S complaint. PDL Finance Limited must put 
things right by taking the steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 March 2020.

Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
Loan 1  rollovers after 30 May 2012
As Ive noted  above  and as can be seen from the loan table  loan 1 was not repaid according to 
plan. It was originally  due to be repaid on 27 February 2012 but was not repaid  until more  than a year 
after that date. It seems  Mr S paid 12 rollover fees of £99 each. 
I dont think Mr Lender treated Mr S fairly by allowing the loan to rollover for so long. It had a duty to 
treat Mr S positively and sympathetically  if he was in financial difficulty  and I think it ought  to have 
seen by the fourth  time Mr S had rolled  over his loan that this was likely  to be the case. By the time of 
the fourth rollover, Mr S had paid more in extension  fees than hed originally  borrowed. At this same 
time, good industry practice was developing  which  pointed towards three rollovers being the 
maximum that should be considered responsible.
So Mr Lender shouldve treated Mr S positively  and sympathetically and come to an arrangement to 
pay the outstanding loan balance,  rather than permit  him to continually  rollover the loan. Im therefore 
planning to say Mr Lender should refund all the rollover charges applied to loan 1 from 30 May 2012 
onwards.
Loan 2
Loan 2 was approved on the same day that loan 1 was repaid, despite loan 1 having  been repaid 
more than a year late, with Mr S having paid the final rollover fee on loan 1 on 28 February  2013. 
I think  that is enough in itself to make the lending irresponsible.
In addition, Mr S actually  borrowed more and so had a larger repayment  to make. Mr Lender 
shouldve realised  it was unlikely, given  the history of loan 1, that Mr S was in a position to make the 
repayments in a sustainable  manner. And thats borne  out by what happened; Mr S second loan was 
repaid very late after he entered a debt management plan.
For these  reasons, I intend to uphold  the complaint  about Mr Lenders decision to approve loan 2.
