The complaint
Mr G complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA deducted £230.01 from a refund he
received for an item he bought not received.
What happened
Mr G says he bought an item online from Australia for over £3,300 but didnt receive it. He
says he was refunded some of the money but didnt receive the full amount back. Mr G
accepts there may have been slight exchange rate fluctuations which may have amounted to
about £30 but that should not have meant he lost just over £230. He would like that money
back and says he asked PayPal for an explanation but was given conflicting information.
PayPal says it acted in line with its user agreement and doesnt guarantee an exchange rate
if a refund is made 24 hours after the payment. It says Mr G bought the item but rejected it
as he was asked to pay customs fees before the item could be shipped from Australia.
PayPal says its been clear throughout and says its user agreement allows it to set the
exchange rate and charge a currency conversion fee.
Mr G brought his complaint to us and our investigator upheld the complaint in part. The
investigator thought PayPal hadnt provided Mr G with clear communication about what took
place but thought the currency calculations were made in line with the user agreement. The
investigator recommended PayPal pay £75 compensation.
Mr G accepts that view, but PayPal doesnt and says it has been clear about the reasons he
received the money he did.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision and said as follows.
I came to the provisional view that PayPal had been clear about the calculation of the refund 
and acted in line with the user agreement.
I said I could see that Mr G told us he didnt receive the item he bought. But I didnt think that 
was an accurate summary of what took place and could see that Mr G rejected the item as 
he didnt want to pay the customs fees. I didnt think PayPal responsible for those fees and 
was satisfied it refunded money back to Mr G.
I looked at the user agreement which I thought Mr G would have agreed to when the
PayPal account was opened, and I was satisfied it was made clear that PayPal is entitled to 
set the exchange rate and that a fee will be charged. So, I didnt think PayPal made a 
mistake by not refunding the full cost of the item Mr G bought and that it ought to have been 
reasonably clear to Mr G the reasons for that.
I appreciated that Mr G says he was given conflicting information about the reason for the 
refund difference. So, I looked at PayPals notes and could see that Mr G was told the 
reasons for the refund difference on 13 February 2020 and again on 5 March 2020. So, I 
thought on balance PayPal has provided a clear answer and has been consistent in what it 
told Mr G. I also thought it explained what took place in its final response letter and all of the 
information it provided was contained in the user agreement.
I accepted that PayPal didnt provide Mr G with the exact breakdown of the refund. But 
having looked at this complaint carefully I was satisfied that Mr G told us he expected a 
refund for the full amount less any currency fluctuations and doesnt seem to have 
appreciated that there is a charge involved as per the user agreement.
Overall, I didnt think PayPal made a mistake in its calculations and acted in line with
the user agreement. I also thought provisionally that PayPal told Mr G why he received less
money back than he was expecting. For those reasons I didnt think PayPal should refund
the money or pay compensation.
Mr G has replied to my provisional view, but PayPal hasnt.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the same view that I reached in my provisional decision and 
for the same reasons.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 March 2021.
