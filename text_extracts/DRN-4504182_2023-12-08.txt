The complaint
Mrs P and Mr P complain that Barclays Bank PLC wont refund disputed ATM withdrawals 
that they say they didnt make or otherwise authorise. 
As most of the submissions were made by Mr P, for ease of reading, Ill refer to him alone in 
this decision.
 
What happened
From 13 October 2022 to 22 October 2022, Mr P was on holiday abroad. He says on the 
evening of 14 October 2022, he used his Barclays debit card  linked to his current account 
 to withdraw money from an ATM. He attempted to withdraw €150 but the transaction was 
declined. Mr P then tried another of his Barclays debit cards  linked to another current 
account  and the transaction was also declined. He said no cash was withdrawn from the 
ATM provider on either card. 
Mr P says he checked his account the following day and saw there had been four 
withdrawals on each card which he did not recognise totalling just under £2,000. He reported 
the matter to Barclays. 
Barclays reviewed the situation and issued temporary credits to Mr P. It issued its final 
response to Mr P on 8 November 2022. It said no errors were made when the transactions 
were carried out and they were chip and PIN authorised. It advised Mr P the temporary 
credits would be removed. 
Unhappy with Barclays response, Mr P referred his complaint to this service.
One of our Investigators reviewed the complaint. She suggested that Barclays refund the 
disputed transactions together with interest. She didnt feel Barclays provided enough 
technical evidence to rule out the ATM not being tampered with. Barclays didnt agree and 
asked for the complaint to be passed to an Ombudsman for review. 
The complaint has therefore been passed to me for determination. 
On 31 October 2023, I issued a provisional decision upholding this complaint in part in 
relation to the poor customer service Mr P received. I did not recommend a refund of the 
disputed transactions. 
For completeness, I repeat my provisional findings below:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached different conclusions to that of our investigator and I dont 
intend to tell Barclays to return Mr Ps disputed transactions, Ill explain why.
Generally speaking, Barclays is required to refund any unauthorised payments made from 
Mr Ps account. Those rules are set out in the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (PSRs). 
Mr P has said he didnt carry out the transactions in dispute. I therefore need to determine 
whether or not I think he did authorise the transactions or not. 
Ive seen from Barclays records that the genuine cards and PINs were used to make the 
transactions, so Im satisfied they were authenticated. This is important, though not enough 
on its own to say Barclays can hold Mr P liable for the transactions. 
A payment out of someones account can only be treated as authorised if the payer has 
consented to it. This means the customer must have consented to a payment transaction 
taking place. So, Ive gone on to consider here whether I think Mr P consented to the 
transactions and therefore whether they were authorised or not.
Ive thought about the technical ATM evidence our investigator wanted to see. I dont think 
that evidence is required for me to make a determination on the matter at hand. Evidence 
from the ATM provider of machine tampering or a surplus of funds would be helpful in 
scenarios where a customer says they didnt receive cash from the ATM or there was a 
difference in the amount debited and the cash actually received. Here, Mr P says he didnt 
make the transactions at all. Ive determined that Mr Ps genuine cards were used, which 
means they would have needed to be presented on each occasion. There are multiple 
disputed transactions with sufficient time and space between them, rather than one isolated 
incident, therefore the likelihood of machine tampering being a factor is highly unlikely in my 
judgement.  
Mr P disputes transactions that were carried out on two of his Barclays debit cards  linked 
to his current accounts. Ill refer to the accounts as debit card 1 and debit card 2. Ive listed 
the disputed transactions below:

Ive noted the genuine spend on debit card 1 prior to the disputed transactions was on 12 
October 2022 but it was a contactless payment so Mr P didnt need to enter his PIN. The last 
genuine spend on debit card 2 prior to the disputed transactions was on 13 October 2022 
(two days prior to the disputed transactions). This was a mobile payment and again didnt 
require Mr Ps PIN to be presented. 
Ive also noted that the transactions Mr P acknowledges making himself (transaction 2 on 
both debit card 1 and debit card 2) were both declined on the basis that Mr P entered his 
PIN incorrectly on both occasions. And transaction 3 on debit card 1 was for the exact 
amount as transaction 2.
I therefore think its very unlikely that an unknown third party could have taken Mr Ps debit 
cards prior to or on the night of the disputed transactions, guessed his PINs correctly (first 
time), carried out multiple disputed transactions at different intervals  the first on debit card 
1 being the exact amount that was attempted by Mr P himself  before returning both debit 
cards to Mr P without him noticing. This is because, there was no point that Mr P entered his 
PINs correctly prior to the disputed transactions, so I rule out the possibility of someone 
having shoulder surfed him. I also dont think its probable that someone could have shoulder 
surfed Mr P at a time he entered his PIN correctly before he travelled abroad, to then have 
followed him abroad to carry out the disputed transactions. 
Mr Ps account of events are that he visited multiple bars/pubs on the evening/early morning 
of 14 October 2022/15 October 2022. He says he attempted to withdraw cash from an ATM 
and when these transactions were declined, he almost immediately took a taxi back to his 
hotel. Based on the technical evidence, this doesnt seem possible. 
The evidence shows that the PIN was entered incorrectly first time on each card, then a 
couple of minutes later, the PIN on debit card 1 was entered correctly and cash was 
withdrawn on a few occasions. Then the PIN for debit card 2 was entered correctly and cash 
was withdrawn on a couple of occasions. Multiple transactions on each card were declined 
but the evidence shows that the PINs were still entered correctly. Barclays hasnt provided 
any additional commentary as to why transactions were declined, I would assume that it may 
have found the pattern and location of the transactions unusual, or cash withdrawal limits 
were reached. Id invite any additional commentary Barclays has to make on this  though 
its not pertinent to my outcome. 
The transaction Mr P accepts making himself was a taxi ride back to his hotel. However, the 
technical evidence shows this transaction was made at 2.07am on 15 October 2022. This is inconsistent with his testimony that he took a taxi almost immediately after his cards were 
declined as these attempted cash withdrawals were made approximately two hours earlier. 
The pattern of the transactions is consistent with Mr Ps testimony that he visited various 
bars/pubs before returning to his hotel. This is because cash was withdrawn, then there was 
a break on each card for over an hour before more cash was withdrawn and the final 
transaction was the taxi ride which Mr P acknowledges making. There are no further 
disputed transactions after this. 
If an unknown third party had access to Mr Ps debit cards, I think its likely they would have 
withdrawn as much as they could, as quickly as possible. I dont find it likely that an unknown 
third party would have waited an hour before attempting to make further transactions. 
I therefore think the most likely scenarios were either; Mr P made the disputed transactions 
himself, or, he authorised another party to carry out the transactions. In either case, I think 
the transactions were authorised by Mr P in accordance with the PSRs. And because of this, 
I dont think Barclays acted unreasonably by holding him liable for the transactions. 
Customer service
I think Barclays could have done a better job when logging Mr Ps claim. He was on hold for 
a while and when he eventually spoke with someone, he was told his claim couldnt be 
logged as its systems were down. Barclays systems being down werent within its control 
but I think it could have offered to call Mr P back when its systems were back up again 
instead of asking him to call back later that day or the day after. I also think Barclays could 
have explained why it was holding Mr P liable for the disputed transactions. Whilst I accept it 
was reasonable to do so, I think it would have come as a surprise to Mr P. The Barclays 
adviser Mr P spoke with said it was strange that the transactions were re-debited and they 
also couldnt explain why this had happened. From his perspective his claim was accepted 
when he was issued with temporary credits but a month later these transactions were re-
debited without a good explanation as to why. I think the re-debits came as a shock to Mr P, 
which would have been avoidable had Barclays provided a better explanation. I think the 
poor customer service would have had an impact on Mr P, particularly as large amounts 
were re-debited from his account. So, I propose that Barclays pays him £150 compensation 
for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Responses to my provisional decision
Mr P didnt accept the decision and in summary said:
He complained to Barclays numerous times after the incident and didnt receive the 
information I provided in my provisional decision. He was provided with poor service. 
The information provided by Barclays has caused bias in this services investigation. 
He refutes that he withdrew cash and entered his PIN for the transactions on debit 
card 1 and debit card 2 except for one attempt. 
Using debit cards 1 & 2 he did attempt to withdraw cash from an ATM and he entered 
the PIN correctly, but the cash transaction was declined. 
He did not receive text alerts or notifications from Barclays about the transactions 
until the following day. 
Until he received my findings, he didnt know that cards had been used and declined 
that evening. 
He was unaware his PIN was entered incorrectly, only that the card was declined. 
He didnt know there were any unauthorised withdrawals, or any card transactions 
being declined on 15 October. The first alert that Mrs P and he received alerting them to the theft came the following 
day, 16 October, when they received mobile notifications from Barclays. He called 
Barclays immediately to cancel both cards. 
He would like Barclays to explain why they werent alerted sooner. Had they been 
alerted by Barclays, they could have acted to prevent the perpetrators from 
withdrawing so much of their funds. 
He had the same PIN for a significant period. He did not enter it incorrectly. This 
further evidences how unlikely a scenario this is that he would not know his PIN, he 
suggests Barclays check their records and provide evidence of how many times hes 
had his card declined due to entering the incorrect PIN. 
Cash withdrawals from both accounts is highly irregular. One of the debit cards is 
solely used for household bills. They would like the Ombudsman to request a 
breakdown of cash withdrawals made from one of the accounts over the past five 
years which will evidence this. 
To establish fraud, he would like the Ombudsman to investigate why Barclays 
declined some requests and authorised others. It would appear that Barclays 
suspected unusual activities and should have alerted them sooner. 
Mr and Mrs P have been loyal customers of Barclays for over 30 years they have 
multiple accounts with significant amounts of money deposited. Its unfounded to 
suggest he would attempt to commit fraud in this manner. 
He believes the cards were compromised in a sophisticated system potentially using 
some sort of malware in the ATM and/or the cards were cloned. 
For the Ombudsman to reach a final decision, he requests the technical evidence 
from the ATMs be obtained and reviewed for an unbiased and fair conclusion. 
Barclays replied accepting my provisional decision. It said in summary:
Mr P claims he genuinely attempted to use each card in the ATM once but was 
unsuccessful. Its records support this account of events however, both attempted 
withdrawals were declined due to the incorrect PIN being entered. 
The authorisation reports show that further attempted withdrawals were declined 
because the cards exceeded the ATM daily withdrawal limit and not due to any fraud 
concerns. 
It has no method of contacting the ATM operator. The only method of disputing a 
foreign ATM (for an ATM dispute, not fraud) is via the VISA chargeback process. But 
it can only raise these types of chargebacks when a customer genuinely makes an 
ATM withdrawal but the cash is not dispensed correctly and this case does not match 
that description. 
Technical data from the ATM provider is not relevant to this type of case. This is a 
fraud case and is a question of authorisation, technical evidence from the ATM 
provider would only support cases involving cash not being dispensed. 
If the ATM was tampered with, the cards would have been retained whilst the PINs 
are recorded by a device. The fraudsters would then have retrieved the card from the 
device and used it without Mr Ps knowledge or consent, that did not occur in this 
instance as Mr P retained possession of the cards. 
Further, if the ATM was tampered with in another manner and a skimming device 
was fitted, the disputed activity would not be authorised via chip and PIN. A skimming 
device records card details, such as the 16-digit card number and the magnetic strip 
details, then the cards can be cloned for the purpose of card not present transactions 
(i.e. online transactions). The evidence in this case shows that the cards chips were read. The cards have a chip capability which is used to ensure cards cannot be 
cloned or copied. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so and whilst I know this will not be the outcome Mr P hoped for, I dont find 
that Barclays acted unfairly by refusing to refund his disputed transactions. 
I acknowledge that Barclays should have provided clearer information when Mr P made his 
claim and subsequently complained. This is why I awarded compensation and I maintain that 
Barclays ought to have provided a better explanation for Mr P to understand why he was 
being held liable for the disputed transactions. 
I appreciate Mr P maintains that he entered his PINs for both cards correctly first time but the 
transactions were declined. However, Im more persuaded by the technical evidence as this 
shows me the reason those initial authorised transactions were declined on debit card 1 and 
debit card 2 were due to the incorrect PINs being entered. And so in my judgement, it 
wouldnt have been possible or probable that an unknown third party could have shoulder 
surfed Mr P whilst he was at the ATM to learn his PINs as these werent entered correctly. 
As I explained in my provisional decision, the last time the cards were genuinely used prior 
to the disputed spend were days prior to the disputed transactions and the PINs werent 
required or presented when the undisputed transactions occurred. 
Mr P also explained during the course of his complaint that no one knew his PINs. So I dont 
find it likely that someone known to him could have taken and replaced both debit card 1 and 
debit card 2 on more than one occasion with more than one hour between the transactions 
on each debit card without Mr P noticing and without knowing his PIN in the first instance. 
Ive noted Mr Ps comments about the unusual nature of the transactions, particularly the 
declined transactions. The question of the irregularity of spend is relevant if I were to think 
on balance that the transactions were unauthorised. In this case, Im satisfied that the 
transactions were authorised by Mr P and Barclays wouldnt be expected to intervene in 
legitimate transactions that are not the result of a fraud or scam. So I dont require a history 
of Mr Ps account use. 
Barclays explained and evidenced that the transactions declined (after the first declined 
payment on each debit card) were declined because the maximum daily cash withdrawal 
limit was reached on each card. This is consistent with the lesser amounts being attempted 
after each declined transaction until a permitted amount could be accepted. 
I dont think its likely that the ATM was tampered with. As I explained in my provisional 
decision, obtaining the technical evidence from the ATM provider would support claims 
where cash wasnt dispensed from the ATM or an incorrect amount was dispensed. I dont 
think the technical evidence would be helpful in this case. The evidence shows that the chip 
on each card was read for each transaction and the PINs were entered correctly. I dont 
think its likely the ATM was tampered with nor do I think its likely that the cards were 
cloned. The transactions stopped shortly before Mr P got a taxi back to his hotel. Mr P paid 
for the taxi via contactless payment on debit card 2 which he accepts he authorised. For the 
avoidance of doubt, I have no reason to doubt the timings of the technical evidence provided 
and Im satisfied this payment was made after the disputed transactions were carried out. If 
a third party tampered with the ATM or cloned Mr Ps cards, I think its unlikely that the chips 
on the cards would have been read. I also dont think its likely that the transactions would 
have ended when they did. I think a fraudster would have likely tried other payment methods to obtain as much money from Mr Ps cards as possible. Mr P didnt cancel his debit cards 
until later that morning and so I think its likely a fraudster would have continued to attempt to 
use the cards. That didnt happen here. 
And so, for the reasons I explained in my provisional decision and here, I think the most 
likely scenarios were either; Mr P made the disputed transactions himself, or, he authorised 
another party to carry out the transactions. In either case, I think the transactions were 
authorised by Mr P in accordance with the PSRs. And because of this, I dont think Barclays 
acted unreasonably by holding him liable for the transactions. 
My final decision
My final decision is I uphold this complaint in part and Barclays Bank UK Plc should pay 
£150 for the distress and inconvenience caused to Mr P.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P and Mr P to 
accept or reject my decision before 5 January 2024.
