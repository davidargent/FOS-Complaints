The complaint
Mr M is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA have permanently limited his 
account. 
What happened
PayPal placed a permanent limitation on Mr Ms account because of what PayPal felt were 
an excessive number of claims made by Mr M on a linked PayPal account. Mr M wasnt 
happy about this and felt that he hadnt made excessive claims such as PayPal believed and 
that he didnt have a linked account.
PayPal looked at Mr Ms complaint. But they felt that theyd permanently limited Mr Ms 
account fairly and in line with their terms. Mr M wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so 
he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that PayPal had been able to 
demonstrate that a significant number of claims had been raised on an account which had 
been reasonably linked to Mr M. Because of this, they didnt feel PayPal had acted unfairly 
towards Mr M by permanently limiting this account, and they didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Mr M remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In much the same way as a consumer is free to choose which businesses they will engage 
with, PayPal are themselves entitled to choose whether to offer, or to continue to offer, their 
full services to a particular consumer. A caveat to this point is that it would be expected that 
where a business elects not to continue to offer its full services to a consumer  as is the 
case in this instance  that the business would have a fair and reasonable justification for 
making this decision.
I note that a policy on PayPals website includes the following statement:
PayPal takes action against buyers with a history of abusing our policies. This 
includes buyers who may be filing dishonest or excessive disputes, claims, 
chargebacks, or bank transfer returns.
Mr M has stated that he doesnt hold any other PayPal accounts besides the one under 
consideration today. However, PayPal have provided this service with evidence which Im 
satisfied does show other PayPal accounts that have been reasonably linked to Mr M, and I 
say this because links to the other accounts include the same email address, the same first 
and last customer name, and record of being accessed via the same IP address from which 
the PayPal account under consideration here has been accessed.
PayPal have also provided a list of the claims made by the account holder on one of these 
linked accounts. PayPal consider the number of claims to be excessive. And having 
reviewed the list of claims on this linked account, I find PayPals position on this matter to be 
understandable and compelling.
All of which means that Im satisfied that PayPal havent acted unreasonably by considering 
the other account on which the large number of claims has been raised to be an account 
linked to Mr M, or that PayPal have considered the number of claims raised on that linked 
account to be excessive such that its reasonable for them to take action. 
Consequently, it also seems fair to me that PayPal have elected to permanently limited all 
PayPal accounts linked to the account on which the excessive number of claims has been 
raised, including the account under consideration here.   
It follows therefore that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing PayPal to take any 
action at this time. I realise this wont be the outcome that Mr M was wanting, but I trust that 
hell understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 May 2022.
