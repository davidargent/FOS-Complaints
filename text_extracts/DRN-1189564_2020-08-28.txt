The complaint
Mr H has complained that PayPal (Europe) Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) charged him a £14 
chargeback fee after a transaction was stopped due to fraudulent activity.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat all of them 
again here. Instead Ill give a brief overview and then Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision.
Mr H sold a tablet computer online on 10 May 2019 and received a payment for the item via 
PayPal. Later on the same day he was advised by the website that he used to sell the item 
that the payment hadnt been authorised by the genuine PayPal account owner. He was 
advised not to send the item to the buyer, and not to communicate with them.
Around five weeks later PayPal contacted Mr H to ask whether he disputed returning the 
funds to the authorised account owner. Mr H didnt respond  which he says is because he 
didnt dispute this  as he had never sent the item that he sold. 
PayPal debited the funds for the transaction of £119 on 18 June 2019. It also debited a £14 
chargeback fee, which it says is to cover the administration involved in returning the funds 
to the genuine account owner. It says that Mr H wasnt covered by its Seller Protection 
Policy, which wouldve meant he didnt pay the fee, as he didnt comply with the 
requirements of the policy (more specifically he didnt send the item). Mr H says he didnt 
send the item because he was notified of the fraudulent activity. And he says he didnt 
proactively issue a refund for the item because he was told not to contact the buyer. 
Our investigator recommended the complaint should be upheld. She didnt recommend that 
PayPal should change its terms and conditions (or User Agreement), but she didnt think 
PayPal had applied them fairly in Mr Hs case. 
PayPal didnt agree, so the case has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator. Ill explain why.
Ive carefully considered PayPals comments around the Seller Protection Policy, which it 
says Mr H wasnt eligible for. If he was, he wouldnt have been charged the £14 fee. The part 
PayPal has highlighted says:
11.6 Eligibility Requirements
What are the eligibility requirements for PayPal seller protection?
d. You must follow the delivery requirements described below.
e. You must accept a single payment from one PayPal Account for the purchase.
f. You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information that 
is reasonably required by PayPal to investigate the matter in a timely manner.
PayPal says that Mr H doesnt meet the eligibility criteria of the policy because he didnt 
dispatch the item  so he doesnt meet point (d). And whether Mr H shipped the item or not 
isnt in dispute. But considering the facts surrounding Mr Hs actions, I dont think that was 
an unreasonable course of action for Mr H to take, and I dont think PayPal is fair to rely on 
this.
Mr H chose not to ship the item due to being made aware that the payment was fraudulent, 
and because he was told by the online auction site not to. I do understand that PayPal has 
repeatedly said that it cant comment on what the auction site told Mr H  and I accept that  
but I dont think it affects this situation. Mr H was simply following instructions and, in my 
view, mitigating his losses by not sending the item hed sold to a fraudulent seller. Even if he 
hadnt been told not to ship the item, I think it would have been unwise for him to do so  
knowing that the genuine account holder hadnt bought it. If he had sent the item as PayPal 
is suggesting he should have done, this would likely have left him in a situation where the 
payment hed received was refunded and he no longer had the item he sold in his 
possession. 
In its defence, PayPal has also highlighted that Mr H didnt contest the chargeback when it 
asked him whether he wanted to. But I dont think this bears any relevance on the outcome 
of this case. Mr H has explained that he didnt contest it because he didnt genuinely sell the 
product  and I think thats a reasonable explanation. 
I note that Mr H withdrew the funds from his PayPal account around two weeks after the 
fraudulent sale, before the genuine PayPal account holder had been refunded. And I agree 
that Mr H couldve contacted PayPal before doing that. But I dont think this has shown any 
dishonesty on Mr Hs part, nor does it make me think that he didnt want or intend for the 
situation to be sorted out. Given the access PayPal has to account holders bank accounts 
and linked cards, PayPal wouldve been able to debit this from one of Mr Hs funding 
sources. I think its likely Mr H wouldve been aware of this, and Mr H doesnt dispute the 
refund is due. So again, this doesnt change my decision in this case. 
I fully understand that all of PayPals customers are required to accept its User Agreement 
when signing up to a PayPal account. And I note that PayPal has repeatedly referred to this 
in its submissions to this service. Whilst I dont dispute that, or indeed the content of the 
User Agreement, I dont think PayPal has applied it fairly or pragmatically in this case. Im 
also mindful that the most up-to-date PayPal User Agreement is 79 pages long and doesnt 
include the Seller Protection Policy wording. Instead it links to a separate Legal 
Agreements page, which is to be read in addition to the User Agreement. So I dont think its 
unreasonable if Mr H didnt have the detail of the Seller Protection Policy in the forefront of 
his mind when he reacted the fraud notification and decided not to dispatch the item he sold.
I also note that Mr H says that PayPal didnt respond to his complaint properly when he 
raised it. He received an automatically generated reply which wasnt relevant to his concern. Mr H replied to this email, as directed, but he says that when PayPal replied it still didnt 
address his concerns.
Ive reviewed the correspondence between Mr H and PayPal, and I can see that the 
automated reply to Mr Hs initial contact included information how to dispute an item he had 
purchased. It directed him to reply to the email if it didnt answer his query. Mr H did that 
within a couple of days. When PayPal responded shortly after, its response didnt address 
the concerns Mr H had raised. Instead the response gave him generic information on the 
nature of a chargeback  instead of addressing Mr Hs concerns. So I agree that PayPal  
didnt provide a clear explanation of what it had done when Mr H contacted it.
Having considered all the facts of Mr Hs case  where he was unwittingly involved in a 
fraudulent payment  I think its unreasonable for PayPal to rely solely on its terms and 
conditions or legal agreements without giving thought to the individual circumstances of the 
case. PayPal shouldve taken a holistic view of the situation, which it didnt. So I havent 
concluded that PayPal has acted fairly.
Its also clear that PayPal was less than helpful in attempting to answer Mr Hs concerns 
when he contact it about what had happened. So I agree that £50 compensation is a fair and 
reasonable way to compensate him for this additional inconvenience.
It follows that I uphold this complaint.
Putting things right
For the reasons Ive explained, my decision is to uphold Mr Hs complaint and I order PayPal 
(Europe) Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
Refund the £14 chargeback fee;
Pay £50 compensation for the trouble and upset caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl & Cie, SCA and 
I require it to do what Ive set out above to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 September 2020.
