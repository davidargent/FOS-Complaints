The complaint
Ms A complains about the incorrect information she was given by NewDay Ltd in relation to 
a credit card she holds with it.
What happened
Ms A has a credit card with NewDay. In April 2020, she successfully applied for a payment 
holiday on the card, due to last for three months. Following this, in June 2020, Ms A said she 
tried to use the card to make a payment to move her belongings out of a storage facility, but 
the payment was unsuccessful. Ms A called NewDay and an adviser explained that there 
was an issue with how the payment was being processed, and suggested that she 
attempted the payment again, but using Chip and PIN instead.
Following this, Ms A said she still wasnt able to make the payment. She called NewDay 
again later that day and spoke with another adviser. They said that the information 
Ms A was previously given was incorrect. The adviser explained that the reason the payment 
hadnt been successful was because the payment holiday was still active on the account, 
and the terms Ms A agreed to meant that she was unable to use her card during that period.
Ms A was unhappy she had been given wrong information previously and complained to 
NewDay. She says she incurred fees on the day as a result of what had happened, including 
removal fees, despite not being able to move her belongings on the day. Ms A also says she 
made several calls to NewDay about her complaint and was assured she would receive a 
call back from someone, but this never happened.
NewDay reviewed matters and acknowledged the service it provided couldve been better. It 
apologised for initially giving Ms A incorrect information but pointed out that she was given 
the correct information later that day. It acknowledged that Ms A said she had incurred fees 
as a result on the day and repaid these  a total of £135. It also paid an additional £120 
compensation for the delays in responding to her complaint, the inconvenience of being 
given wrong information and the overall customer service provided  which brought the total 
compensation figure to £255.
Ms A didnt think this fully reflected the impact of not being able to move her belongings as 
she had planned. She said that because NewDay took so long to deal with the matter, she 
was left with no option but to leave her belongings in the storage unit which charged a 
monthly fee. She said these fees had built up over the period of time NewDay was reviewing 
matters, and she hadnt paid these because she thought NewDay was responsible for 
covering them. Ms A brought her complaint to our service.
One of our investigators looked into things and agreed Ms A wouldve been disappointed 
with receiving incorrect information about why her payment was declined. But he also 
acknowledged that NewDay had given her correct information later that day. He also 
explained that as Ms A was still in her payment holiday when the transaction was attempted, 
she wouldnt have been able to make the payment on her card anyway, even if she hadnt 
been given wrong information. He acknowledged the overall service NewDay provided 
couldve been better, but he thought the overall compensation it had paid was enough to put 
matters right.
NewDay didnt dispute our investigators findings, but Ms A did and mostly repeated her 
earlier points. As an agreement couldnt be reached, the case has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Although a number of issues have been raised, this decision only addresses those issues 
I consider to be materially relevant to this complaint. However, Ive given careful 
consideration to all of the submissions made before arriving at my decision.
Following contact from Ms A, NewDay agreed to her request for a payment holiday on her 
account, from 2 April until 11 July 2020. But, as a result, Ms A wouldnt be able to use her 
card  terms that she agreed to. Having considered this, I think NewDay treated Ms A fairly, 
as it took steps to assist her when she found herself in financial difficulty.
Ive reviewed contemporaneous contact notes, which show that NewDays advisers clearly 
explained that Ms A wouldnt be able to use her card during the payment holiday. NewDay 
also sent Ms A a letter dated 2 April 2020 which also explained this. So, I think both the 
information on calls with NewDays advisers and the letter it sent ought to have made Ms A 
aware that she wouldnt be able to use her card whilst the payment holiday was active on the 
account.
On 30 June 2020, Ms A attempted to make a payment on her card which was declined, in 
line with the agreed terms of the payment holiday. Following this, she had a telephone 
conversation with one of NewDays advisers, where she was given incorrect information 
about why the payment was unsuccessful. Whilst I acknowledge being given incorrect 
information wouldve been frustrating, Im not persuaded that it impacted Ms A in the way 
she describes. I say this because Ms A was given the correct information shortly afterwards 
on the same day. And, NewDay had been consistent and clear prior to the mis-information, 
in explaining that Ms A wouldnt be able to use her card during the payment holiday. So, 
whilst I acknowledge the frustration in being given wrong information, I think NewDay quickly 
rectified matters and provided correct information later that day.
As I understand it, there was an issue with registering Ms As complaint and NewDay didnt 
provide its initial final response until November 2020  some five months after Ms A 
originally complained. Ms A says she made several phone calls to NewDay during this 
period and was promised call backs which never happened. Ms A has detailed the effects 
NewDays service had on her and said the matter had a negative impact on her mental 
health.
I was sorry to hear about how the matter had affected Ms A. Ive considered that in its 
response, NewDay has acknowledged the service it provided couldve been better. It has 
said that it considered the initial mis-information it gave Ms A, the delays caused and the 
overall service it offered her when considering a global compensation figure. Having thought 
very carefully about the circumstances, and how quickly NewDay gave Ms A the correct 
information about her account, I think the £255 compensation it has already paid fairly 
reflects the impact NewDays customer service had on Ms A. 
In her testimony, Ms A says the delay in NewDays response left her with no choice but to 
leave her belongings at the storage facility. She says she hasnt made the monthly payments to the facility for close to a year because she believes NewDay should cover this, due to the 
mis-information it originally gave her. Im afraid I disagree with Ms A here. As previously 
mentioned, NewDay gave Ms A the correct information about why she was unable to make a 
payment shortly after the mis-information it provided. And this reason was made clear to 
Ms A when she initially requested the payment holiday on the account. Therefore, whilst I 
can understand Ms As concern about the situation that she now finds herself in, I cant fairly 
ask NewDay to take responsibility for any further costs Ms A incurred after she was given 
the correct information about her account. Particularly considering that Ms A wouldnt have 
been able to use her card to make the payment, regardless of the information NewDay gave 
her on the day.
Overall, I think the customer service NewDay provided Ms A with couldve been better. But I 
think the overall compensation it has paid is enough to recognise the impact caused in the 
circumstances.
My final decision
NewDay Ltd doesnt need to do anything more to resolve this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2021.
