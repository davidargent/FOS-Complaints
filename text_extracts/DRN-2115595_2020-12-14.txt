The complaint
Mr F complained to National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) about a telephone banking 
payment he was unable to make. 
What happened
Mr F has a current account with NatWest. 
Mr F phoned NatWest towards the end of February 2020 and told it he intended to make a 
direct payment for more than £2,000 in the near future, to a tradesperson who was 
undertaking work on his home. Mr F was eager for the payment to go through smoothly and 
asked for a note of his intention to make the payment to be put on his account. 
Mr F contacted NatWest on 2 March 2020 to make the payment and was told he would need 
to complete pin and password security, in order to use telephone banking to make the 
payment. Mr F didnt know his pin or password and so the payment could not be made by 
phone.
Mr F spoke to a second advisor at NatWest and was told he would need to reset telephone 
banking on NatWests website as the first advisor had locked it when he said he was unable 
to provide a pin or password. Mr F decided to write a cheque for the tradesperson. Mr F also 
made a complaint to NatWest. 
Mr F contacted NatWest the following day as the tradesperson told him NatWest declined to 
pay the cheque. The advisor told Mr F that the cheque had been flagged as potentially 
fraudulent and NatWest made additional security checks. It seems Mr F was sent a text 
message by NatWest, asking him to confirm he had written the cheque. But Mr F did not see 
the text message. When the advisor enquired about the security checks, he was told the cut 
off time had passed to authorise the cheque.
The same NatWest advisor offered to re-enrol Mr F for telephone banking so that the 
payment could be made immediately. Mr F declined to do this as this involved him logging 
onto NatWests website and he said he was too ill to use a computer. The advisor suggested 
Mr F could visit his local branch to make the payment and this is what Mr F did. So the 
payment was made on 3 March 2020. 
NatWest responded to Mr Fs complaint on 12 March 2020. It said it was unable to locate the 
recording of the phone call Mr F said he made to it on 22 February 2020. But it said, from the 
later conversation it was able to hear, it was reasonable to conclude it failed to make sure Mr 
F was correctly set up for the ID procedure it requires. NatWest said it upheld Mr Fs 
complaint as it was unable to evidence that he was given the correct advice on 22 February 
2020. It offered Mr F £50 compensation for the inconvenience that this matter caused him. 
Mr F continued to correspond with NatWest after it issued its response to his complaint. So it 
issued another complaint response on 16 April 2020. NatWest said its decision, as detailed 
on 12 March 2020, remained unchanged and it would no longer be responding to any 
correspondence. 
Mr F was unhappy with NatWests response and so complained to this service. He said he 
thought a more appropriate amount of compensation was £1,000. He also said he had asked 
for a senior manager to be available at the branch he visited so he could discuss his 
complaint. 
Our investigator did not uphold Mr Fs complaint. 
Mr F didnt agree with what our investigator said, so this has come to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I am not upholding this complaint
I first of all want to clarify that I will be looking at Mr Fs complaint about the payment he tried 
to make on 2 March 2020 and the difficulties he said he experienced in that respect. But I 
wont be looking at what Mr F said about NatWests handling of his complaint. This service 
can only look into complaints about regulated financial products and services, and this is the 
category that the payment Mr F was trying to make falls into. But we cant look at how a 
business processes a complaint, as this isnt a regulated financial product or service. And 
this is the category that the difficulties Mr F said he had when his complaint was closed too 
early and the attempts he made to have the Chief Executive of NatWest personally look at 
his complaint falls into. So I wont be looking at the complaint Mr F made about NatWests 
handling of the complaint. 
Mr F feels he was given misleading advice about being able to make the payment using 
telephone banking. He said he wasnt told when he rang NatWest on 22 February 2020 that 
he would need his pin and password to make a payment. Ive listened to a phone call that is 
undated, but Im satisfied happened around a week or so before Mr F tried to make the 
payment. In this call Mr F was told when he phones at a later stage to make the payment 
that we would need to go through security when you make the payment anyway and we 
would just go through the usual security when making a payment.. So, although the advisor 
didnt specifically say Mr F needed his pin and password to make the payment, he was told 
he needed to go through security in the usual way. And for telephone banking with NatWest 
this is using a pin and password. So Im satisfied the advisor didnt provide him with 
misleading information. 
I understand that Mr F was trying to do all he could to ensure the payment would go through 
smoothly by calling in advance of making the payment and by asking NatWest to attach a 
note to that effect to his account. But Mr F was told by the advisor that a note on his account 
wouldnt stop a payment potentially being flagged. And I think its important to note that 
NatWest is allowed to take appropriate steps to ensure proper security checks are 
undertaken, irrespective of whether its given advance notice of payments. 
Mr F was also unhappy that the cheque he then wrote, when he was unable to make the 
payment using telephone banking, was flagged as potentially fraudulent and declined. When 
NatWest flagged the cheque, it sent a text message to Mr F asking him to confirm he had 
written the cheque, but Mr F unfortunately didnt notice this text and the cheque was 
declined. Mr F feels NatWest should have phoned him rather than sending the text. While I 
appreciate Mr F might not be accustomed to text messages being sent as a security 
measure, I cant fault NatWest for trying to communicate with him in this way when making 
security checks. If Mr F would prefer for NatWest to phone him in the future, should security checks need to be made, then he should perhaps consider letting NatWest know now how 
he would prefer to be contacted. 
I understand it must have been inconvenient for Mr F to travel to his local NatWest branch to 
make the payment. Ive listened to the phone conversation he had when he was advised by 
NatWest that this was an option. However, I can see that Mr F was first of all offered the 
option of reactivating telephone banking. The advisor offered to talk Mr F through this 
process, so that the payment could be made immediately. But this involved Mr F logging 
onto NatWests website and he said he didnt want to do this as he was unwell. But its my 
understanding that this is the only way NatWest can reactivate telephone banking, short of 
visiting the branch. 
I know that Mr F feels he should be compensated for having made the journey to his local 
branch. But because he was offered an option that involved him not having to travel, and 
was also offered assistance in setting up this option, I dont think it would be fair to ask 
NatWest to increase the compensation its offered to include the inconvenience of having to 
travel to his local branch.  
Mr F also complained that he asked the same NatWest advisor to make sure a senior 
manager was available to meet him, so that he could discuss his complaint, when he went to 
his local branch to make the payment in person. But, having listened to the call, I dont think 
Mr F asked for this. He asked for staff at the branch to be told he was coming and the 
advisor agreed he would send an email to that effect. So I dont agree that NatWest made an 
error here. 
Mr F said that one of the NatWest advisors cancelled his telephone banking service without 
telling him and he doesnt think that should have happened. Ive listened to the call where 
Mr F initially asked to make the payment in question. I can see that he told the advisor he 
didnt know his pin and password and as a result the advisor locked the pin. This meant 
Mr Fs telephone banking could no longer be used until the pin and password were re-set. 
My understanding is that the advisor locked the telephone banking service as a security 
measure. Given that Mr F said he didnt know his pin and password, the service couldnt be 
used anyway. So Im satisfied that Mr F would have always needed to reset this service and 
so didnt experience any detriment when it was locked. 
To summarise, NatWest has already offered Mr F £50 compensation, as it accepts that he 
was more than likely given misleading advice during a phone call with one of its advisors. 
And although I appreciate that Mr F had difficulties making the payment, I dont agree that 
NatWest were at fault for these, for the reasons outlined above, and I wont be asking it to 
increase the amount of compensation offered. 
My final decision
Its my final decision that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 January 2021.
