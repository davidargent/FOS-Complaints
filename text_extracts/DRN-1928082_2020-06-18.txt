The complaint
Miss C complains that MYJAR Limited lent to her irresponsibly. She says MYJAR ought to 
have known she could not afford to repay the multiple payday loans and that she became 
trapped in a debt spiral.
 
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in May 2020 that I summarise below.
Miss C was given 6 loans by MYJAR between December 2015 and November 2018. The 
loans were due to be repaid over varying periods. Miss C has repaid loans 1-5 but loan 6 is 
still outstanding. A summary of Miss C's borrowing is as follows:

In my provisional decision I explained why I didnt think the complaint should be upheld. 
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, in particular the checks that 
MYJAR needed to do such as the amount being lent, and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, I thought less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate in the early stages of the lending relationship.
I thought that the checks that MYJAR carried out for loans 1-4 and loan 6 were 
proportionate. So I didnt think there was any reason why MYJAR should have declined 
those applications.  And whilst I thought the lender ought to have carried out better checks before it gave Miss C 
loan 5, I hadnt been provided with enough evidence for me to say whether better checks by 
MYJAR would have shown that Miss C might have any difficulty repaying the loan in a 
sustainable manner. So I couldnt fairly say that MYJAR shouldnt have given loan 5 to Miss 
C or that it lent to her irresponsibly. So I didnt think the complaint about loan 5 should be 
upheld.
 
I also didnt think MYJAR acted unfairly when it gave Miss C loan 6  more than two years 
after she had paid off loan 5. I thought the two-year gap was such that MYJAR might 
reasonably have considered that any problems that had led Miss C to take the first five loans 
had been resolved.
 
I invited both parties to send me any further comments or evidence. MYJAR has told us it 
agrees with my provisional findings and has nothing more to add. Ive not received any 
response from Miss C. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that MYJAR has agreed with my provisional decision, and I havent received any 
further response from Miss C, I see no reason to alter the conclusions I reached in my 
provisional decision.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Miss Cs complaint or make any award 
against MYJAR Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 July 2020.
