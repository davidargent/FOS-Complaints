The complaint
Mr O complains that Shelby Finance Ltd made a mistake, twice, which inconvenienced him 
and affected him mentally. It set up a wrong payment date for a loan and he got a series of 
text messages and emails and phone calls to chase that payment. And the same issue 
reoccurred a few months later.
What happened
Mr O took a loan from Shelby in 2020 for £1,000 plus £952 fixed interest. The agreement 
was that he repay Shelby in nine equal instalments apart from a  penny difference on the
last instalment) and the dates were to be these:
27/11/2020 - £216.89
24/12/2020 - £216.89
29/01/2021 - £216.89
26/02/2021 - £216.89
26/03/2021 - £216.89
30/04/2021 - £216.89
28/05/2021 - £216.89
25/06/2021 - £216.89
30/07/2021 - £216.88
The 26 March 2021 payment did not go through and Mr O did pay on 31 March 2021. In a 
telephone call between Mr O and one of Shelbys representatives, the request by Mr O that 
all future repayment dates were altered to the last day of the month was carried out 
incorrectly. Despite Mr O being all paid up and correct on 31 March 2021, the Shelby 
representative re-set the new repayment dates to commence on 31 March 2021. So, from
1 April 2021, Mr O started to receive chase up texts and emails as it looked as though hed
missed the repayment on 31 March 2021.
Mr O complained and the final response letter (FRL) to that complaint was 28 May 2021. 
Shelby accepted it had got it wrong and apologised to Mr O. It amended what it needed to 
amend.
After that, the repayment records for that loan appeared to show they were paid on the 
correct dates up to 30 June 2021. But Mr O started to receive texts and emails about arrears 
again in early July 2021. So, he called a Shelby representative on 5 July 2021 and we have 
a copy of that recorded call. 
Mr O raised a second complaint and he pointed out in the call with Shelby that
- the earlier missed payment in March 2021 was paid; and
- the payment arrangement put in place had been incorrectly done in March 2021: and
- hes not late paying or in arrears; and
- if the last repayment was due at the end of July 2021 rather than end of June 2021 then 
he ought not be receiving further chase up texts and emails about arrears in early 
July 2021 as he has been doing. Mr Os view was that these were not justified.
Mr O received a second FRL for that second complaint in August 2021 in which Shelby 
accepted that the mistake in March 2021 had meant that the arranged payments had been 
set to end on 30 June 2021 instead of 30 July 2021 and so it was their mistake.
One of our adjudicators looked at the first complaint (which was before the two complaints 
were merged) and thought that Shelby had done what it needed to do straight away after 
accepting it had made a mistake. And so our adjudicator did not think that anything further
was required of Shelby.
Mr O was not content and said that he wanted compensation and explained as follows:
-I told you my mental health was affected because of consistent pressure via email, 
phone calls and text messages from Dot Dot Loans.
-I demand some sort of compensation for the discomfort and hardship I experienced 
over this period of aggressive email, phone calls and text messages.
The complaint was passed to me and during the course of my requesting additional 
information from Shelby I realised that the July 2021 complaint had been made by Mr O 
against Shelby. I requested that the two complaints were combined.
I decided to issue a provisional decision to cover Mr Os experience for the whole of the 
management of the loan account. That was issued on 2 December 2021 and is set out here 
and in smaller type size to differentiate it. 
The provisional decision findings dated 2 December 2021
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Shelby has accepted that it did something wrong on both occasions. For the first incident, to put it 
right it made some changes to the repayment schedule for Mr O within three days of the chase-up 
texts and emails commencing on 1 April 2021. It resolved the situation on the first opportunity.
I asked Shelby for some additional account notes and the recorded calls for March 2021 and April 
2021. It has said it does not keep calls which are older than six months and so it cannot send any 
which took place with Mr O. This is disappointing but not unreasonable.
I have listened to the call between our adjudicator and Mr O on 8 June 2021. And the explanations 
I have gathered from Mr O are
-that Shelby were quick to come after me
-this mistake was not Mr Os fault and he was expecting some compensation
-he said that he was receiving texts or emails or phone calls every 6 hours for about three days 
until he contacted Shelby
-the money that was supposed to go for something else went to Shelby because of all the text 
messages. I made payment when usually I would not
-he says he has suffered inconvenience; he was mentally disturbed, experienced mental 
pressure  uncalled for through no fault of my own
I have understood that Mr O has said to our adjudicator that he needed to juggle his finances to pay 
Shelby because of the March 2021 mistake.Ive no evidence that money earmarked for other necessary payments had to be re-directed to pay 
Shelby due to the chase-up emails around early April 2021. Mr O has said this to us but has sent 
nothing to demonstrate that was the case. The Shelby loan statement of account does not show extra 
payments in April or May 2021. But I mention this point here for completeness so that Mr O knows 
I have considered it.
Having asked Shelby for additional notes and information about this complaint I realised that there 
was a second issue causing Mr O concern with Shelby in July 2021. So, I asked for those details too. 
I could see that hed received a second FRL in August 2021.
After Shelby and Mr O agreed that the two complaints should be considered together then the overall 
picture gives me an impression of poor management on the account from early 2021 which 
precipitated the second issue in July 2021. I did receive a copy of the recorded call between Mr O and 
Shelby which took place on 5 July 2021 and Ive listened to it.
Following Mr Os second complaint to Shelby, the August 2021 FRL to Mr O says:
When we spoke on 3 April 2021, we agreed on a new repayment plan which should have 
remained in place until your loan was repaid in full. Due to a keying error, this was not done 
correctly and the repayment plan completed before we had collected your remaining 
outstanding balance. As your loan was originally due to end on 30 June 2021, and there was 
no repayment plan in place for the remaining balance, we attempted to contact you under our 
normal collections activity. Had we of placed the plan in place correctly, this would not have 
happened.
When we spoke on 5 July 2021, a new repayment plan was put in place to collect your 
outstanding balance, and your loan has since been fully repaid.
Overall, I am satisfied that Shelby has managed this account poorly and that it has led to Mr O 
receiving unnecessary and numerous texts and emails about arrears and missed payments. These 
are intrusive and can be humiliating when the receiver has done nothing wrong. Shelby has accepted 
that the mistakes it made led to the experiences Mr O suffered in April 2021 and July 2021.
I do think that Mr O has suffered distress and inconvenience on those occasions and has experienced 
a poorly managed loan account. So, I am planning to make a money award to Mr O to compensate 
him of £200.
In addition, I plan to direct that the credit file entry for this loan is accurate and there is no adverse 
payment information relating to this loan on Mr Os credit file. I have not seen copies of that loan entry 
but I do plan to include this as a task for Shelby to complete.
My provisional decision is that I am planning to uphold Mr Os complaints and I am planning to make a 
money award for the distress and inconvenience he has experienced throughout the management of 
the loan account. I am planning to ask Shelby Finance Ltd to do as I have outlined above.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Despite writing to both parties twice with copies of the provisional decision, we have not 
heard from either. Mr O brought his complaint to this Service in May 2021 and I know he is wanting a 
resolution. So, as seven months have passed since Mr O first referred it to us, and as I know 
that Shelby have had time to respond, I have decided that this is the appropriate time to 
issue my final decision. 
And, in the absence of any further evidence or submissions then I see no reason to alter my 
provisional decision findings and so I repeat them here and I uphold Mr Os complaints for 
the same reasons given already. 
Putting things right
I uphold Mr Os complaints and Shelby needs to put things right for him.
I make a money award for the distress and inconvenience he has experienced throughout 
the management of the loan account of £200. 
If any amendments to Mr Os credit file are required to remove any adverse payment 
information from the loan record then Shelby needs to do that. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Os complaint and I direct that Shelby Finance Limited 
does as I have outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 January 2022.
