The complaint
Mr B complains that Madison CF Limited trading as 118 118 Money (118) sold his loan 
whilst he was on a repayment plan.
 
What happened
Mr B took out a loan with 118 for £1,100 on 29 November 2019, repayable in 12 monthly 
instalments of £124.79. The loan documents were electronically signed by Mr B and the first 
payment was due on 02 January 2020. 
On 13 December 2019 Mr B contacted 118 to tell them he didnt think hed be able to meet 
the total monthly payment as his wife was out of work. 118 agreed to set up a repayment 
plan for reduced payments of £41.60 for three months, with the first payment due 02 January 
2020. 
When the first reduced payment failed on 02 January 2020, 118 moved Mr Bs account back 
to its normal collections process, meaning that his original payments of £124.79 would now 
be due. 
Mr B contacted 118 on 25 January 2020 to tell them that hed had to travel abroad due to the 
unfortunate passing of his brother, and hed been unable to make payment. 118 agreed to 
set up a new repayment plan for Mr B under the same terms as before; payments of £41.60 
for three months with the first of these due on 24 February 2020. 
118 issued a notice of arrears to Mr B on 5 February 2020 letting him know how far behind 
he was with his repayments. 
Mr B didnt make the payment of £41.60 due on 24 February. He contacted 118 on 29 
February 2020 to tell them that hed been unable to meet the payment due to his overseas 
travel. 118 agreed to restart the repayment plan, with the first £41.60 payment due on 27 
March 2020. 
On 10 March 2020 118 issued a default notice to Mr B confirming that his account had been 
in arrears since 3 January 2020. 
When the agreed payment wasnt made on 27 March, 118 moved Mr Bs account back to 
the normal collections process, and it was ultimately sold to a third party on 24 April 2020 
with no payments having been made. 
Mr B complained to 118 that they had sold his account whilst he was on a repayment plan. 
118 told Mr B that theyd sold his account in line with the terms and conditions and didnt 
uphold his complaint. Unhappy with this, Mr B brought his complaint to this service. 
Our investigator looked into things for Mr B. He felt that 118 had acted within the terms of the 
loan and didnt need to do anything more. Mr B has asked for his complaint to be reviewed 
by an ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear about the passing of Mr Bs brother and understand that this was a difficult 
time for him, particularly with the need for unexpected overseas travel. 
Mr B has said that the terms and conditions of the loan werent explained to him. I am 
satisfied that Mr B was provided with, and signed, the terms and conditions document prior 
to entering into the loan. What I need to decide is whether 118 did anything wrong in selling 
Mr Bs account to a third party. 
The terms of Mr Bs agreement with 118 do give them the ability to transfer their rights or 
duties under the agreement to another third party or entity, so they have not acted outside of 
these terms when selling Mr Bs account. 
In agreeing to set up a repayment plan, and in agreeing to rearrange a repayment plan on 
two occasions, I find that 118 have been reasonable in trying to help Mr B to make his 
repayments under the agreement. 
118 are required by regulation to issue arrears and default notices. They issued these to Mr 
B when he was behind with his payments, and in line with when I would expect these notices 
to be issued. At the point that 118 sold Mr Bs account, he had missed four monthly 
payments, and broken the arrangements of three repayment plans that he had agreed with 
118. 
Mr B is not disadvantaged by the sale of his account by 118. There are no additional fees or 
interest for Mr B to pay, but he makes his repayments to a different company. The decision 
to sell his account was a commercial one made by 118 after they were unable to collect any 
payment from Mr B. 
That Mr B had a repayment plan in place doesnt prevent 118 from selling his account to a 
third party, and I find that their decision to do so in the circumstances was not an 
unreasonable one. Therefore, they dont need to do anything more in respect of this 
complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above. My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2021.
