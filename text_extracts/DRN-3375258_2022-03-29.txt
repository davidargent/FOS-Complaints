The complaint
Mr J complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their decision to limit his 
account.
What happened
In 2008, Mr J opened an account with PayPal. At the time, Mr J was under the age of 18 but 
this wasnt noticed.
Mr J continued to use this account for several years. And in 2019, Mr J applied for PayPal 
credit using the same account. He provided documents confirming his age through this 
process and again, Mr Js age at the time of the account opening wasnt noticed.
But in August 2021, PayPal Limited Mr Js account meaning he could no longer use it to 
send or receive funds. PayPal explained this was because Mr J was under the age of 18 
when the original account was opened.
Mr J was unhappy about this, so he raised a complaint. Mr J didnt think PayPal were fair to 
limit his account some 13 years after it was opened. Mr J thought PayPal shouldve realised 
he was underage both in 2008 and in 2019 when he provided further documentation. He 
explained the limitation impacted his business which in turn created severe stress and 
anxiety that significantly impacted his health and left him unable to work. And he explained 
hed needed to borrow money from friends and family to continue to make payments towards 
his credit account, which he was unable to repay due to his health. So, he wanted PayPal to 
compensate him enough to repay the money hed borrowed.
PayPal didnt agree initially. They thought they had an obligation to limit and close the 
account as Mr J was under the age of 18 when he opened it. And they thought it shouldve 
been clear to Mr J at the time of opening that he needed to be over the age of 18. So, they 
didnt think they needed to compensate Mr J. But they explained Mr J would be able to open 
a new account to replace the one theyd closed. And they explained Mr J would be able to 
continue to make payments to his credit balance over the phone. Mr J remained unhappy 
with this response, so he referred his complaint to us.
While Mr Js complaint was with our service, PayPal offered to pay Mr J £200 to recognise 
the trouble and upset hed been caused. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint and upheld it. They recognised the impact Mr Js 
health had had on his financial situation. And they acknowledged Mr Js belief that it was 
PayPals actions that had caused his health to deteriorate. But they didnt think PayPal had 
acted unfairly by limiting and closing the account, as PayPal were obliged to do so as Mr J 
was under the age of 18 when it was opening. 
But they did recognise PayPal couldve realised this sooner, especially in 2019 when Mr J 
provided them with additional documentation. Even so, they thought Mr J had benefitted 
from this mistake, as hed been able to use the account for a period of time when he 
shouldnt have been. So, considering all of the above, they thought the £200 PayPal offered 
was a fair one, to recognise the length of time it took them to realise the account needed to 
be closed. And because of this, they didnt think PayPal needed to do anything more.
Mr J didnt agree. He maintained it was PayPals error allowing him to create the account 
underage and then not noticing this for several years. And because of this, he thought 
PayPal were partly responsible for the deterioration of his health and the financial impact this 
has had. So, he maintained his belief that PayPals offer of compensation should be 
substantially increased. As Mr J didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Mr J. I think its reasonable for 
me to assume PayPals decision to limit and then close the account came as a shock to Mr 
J, as hed been using the account for several years without any issue. And I recognise Mr J 
has said the shock of this, and the stress it created, directly related to the deterioration of his 
health. Ive seen evidence that shows Mr J has been unable to work due to his health and I 
understand the financial impact this wouldve had. So, as Mr J believes PayPals actions 
were a direct cause of his health problems, I can understand why Mr J thinks PayPal should 
compensate him in a way that helps ease his financial difficulties. 
Since Mr Js complaint has been with our service, PayPal have made an offer of £200 to 
recognise any upset Mr J has felt. And I appreciate why Mr J sees this as an acceptance of 
their errors. So, Ive thought about the actions PayPal have taken, and the offer theyve 
made, to decide whether I think they made a mistake and if so, if the offer theyve put 
forward is a fair one.
Ive first thought about whether PayPal have acted fairly when limiting and closing the 
account. When Mr J opened the account in 2008, he wouldve needed to confirm he read 
and accepted PayPals terms and conditions. And these terms and conditions state Our 
service is not available to individuals under the age of 18 years. We may refuse to provide 
our service, change the qualifications for your use of the service and/or terminate this 
agreement with you at any time giving you notice by email. 
It's not in dispute that Mr J was under the age of 18 at the time the account was opened. So, 
Mr J was in breach of this condition when the account was created. Because of this, I think 
PayPal acted reasonably when closing the account as they had an obligation to do so as it 
couldnt be legally binding when Mr J was underage. And Ive seen they notified Mr J of their 
intention to do so, which falls in line with the terms and conditions. So, I cant see theyve 
done anything wrong in their actual decision to close the account.
But I do think this shouldve been noticed much earlier than 13 years after the account 
opened. Especially when Mr J provided documentation in 2019 and PayPal credit was 
approved. So, I cant say PayPal acted fairly. Because of this, Ive then thought about what I 
think PayPal should do to put things right.Putting things right
When thinking about what I think PayPal should do to put things right, any award or direction 
I make is intended to place Mr J back in the position he wouldve been in, had PayPal acted 
fairly in the first instance. And I cant place Mr J in a position of betterment in order to ensure 
I remain fair to both parties.
In this situation, Mr J had made use of the account for over 13 years. And hes been able to 
access PayPal credit, which hes been able to benefit from. So, while I recognise Mr J had a 
credit balance outstanding that he needs to repay, Mr J has be able to make use of this 
balance and so, I think its fair for PayPal to expect this to be repaid. 
But I recognise as the account has been closed, its now more difficult for Mr J to make 
payment. Although PayPal have shown me Mr J was able to make payments through his 
app in October, their emails to Mr J explain payments should be made over the telephone. 
And I appreciate this would be more inconvenient. Had PayPal recognised the age issue 
sooner, I think its reasonable for me to assume this inconvenience wouldnt have arisen. So, 
I think it should be compensated for.
I also do think it wouldve been shocking and upsetting for Mr J to realise so many years 
later that he was now unable to use the account. And I recognise Mr J may have intended to 
utilise the remaining credit limit available, which he was unable to do once the account had 
been limited. So, I think its likely that some immediate short-term financial impact wouldve 
occurred.
But Ive also seen that Mr J had other accounts with PayPal, using different e-mail 
addresses. So, I think Mr J is likely to have had other ways to access the services of PayPal. 
And when his account was limited, PayPal explained to Mr J that he was free to open a new 
account using the same e-mail address linked to the closed account. I cant see Mr J 
decided to do so, but I cant say this is the fault of PayPal.
And I can see when PayPal were made aware of Mr Js financial circumstances due to his 
health, they gave Mr J the option of speaking to them to arrange an affordable repayment 
plan that took into consideration his loss in income due to being off work. But I cant see Mr J 
has done so. Instead, Mr J has made multiple payments which exceeded the minimum 
monthly repayment. While I appreciate Mr J has borrowed money to pay this, I dont think it 
would be fair for me to then say PayPal should cover these amounts.
I also recognise Mr Js comments about PayPals mistake, and the direct link between this 
and the deterioration of his health. Ive thought about this at length. While I appreciate Mr Js 
health deteriorated around the time PayPal limited and closed his account, and I do 
understand the upset this caused, I dont think it would be reasonable or fair for me to decide 
that this mistake alone led to the deterioration of Mr Js health. So, I dont think it would be 
fair for me to say that PayPals compensation should be based on them taking full 
responsibility for Mr Js health, and the financial difficulty that arose from this.
So, considering all of the above, I think the £200 PayPal have offered is a fair and falls in line 
with what I wouldve awarded had it not already been made. So, I think PayPal should pay 
Mr J this amount.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I uphold Mr Js complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA and direct them to take the following action:Pay Mr J £200 to recognise the trouble and upset hes been caused by their delay in 
limiting and closing his account.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2022.
