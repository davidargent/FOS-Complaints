The complaint
Mr V complains that National Westminster Bank Plc sent him a letter to say it wasnt 
pursuing him for outstanding debts but that a third party is still trying to collect payments. 
Mr V also complains that NatWest failed to offer support whilst he was experiencing financial 
difficulties. 
  
What happened
Mr V had two personal loans and an overdraft with NatWest. In 2018 Mr V experienced 
some financial difficulties and NatWest referred his account to a third party (W) to manage. 
W contacted Mr V and said it may instruct solicitors to take legal action in relation to his 
debts. 
In July 2019 NatWest says it sold Mr Vs accounts to a third party business (C). In August 
2019 both NatWest and C wrote to Mr V with Notices of Assignment. The Notice of 
Assignment C sent Mr V confirms it had acquired both personal loans and his overdraft. 
Mr V has told us W continued to collect payments for the debts and he wasnt aware they 
had been sold to C. 
In March 2020 NatWest wrote to Mr V to say it wasnt going to pursue him for the 
outstanding debts. Mr V later told his debt management plan administrator that payments to 
W, in relation to his NatWest accounts, were no longer due. Later, it came to light that C was 
still pursuing Mr V for the outstanding balance of the debts it had bought from NatWest in 
2019. C sent Mr V a letter explaining the debts remained outstanding. 
Mr V referred his complaints about the support provided by NatWest and the letter he 
received to this service and it was passed to an investigator. The investigator arranged for a 
new complaint to be set up concerning Mr Vs concerns that NatWest had lent irresponsibly. 
NatWest explained that the letter it sent Mr V in March 2020 was issued on the basis it had 
sold the debts to C and written off accounts. But NatWest apologised that its letter wasnt 
clear and offered Mr V £150. 
The investigator went on to uphold Mr Vs complaint as NatWest provided further confusing 
information about the status of his debts in its response to the irresponsible lending 
complaint. NatWest agreed to pay Mr V a total of £250 for the trouble and upset caused. Mr 
V asked to appeal so his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr V has complained that NatWest failed to provide reasonable support while he was going 
through financial difficulties. Mr V has explained that he found letters from W that said it 
could take legal action to be particularly distressing. When a consumer is in financial 
difficulties businesses should treat them positively and sympathetically if asked for help. In 
this case, Ive looked at the contact notes NatWest has provided and it doesnt show Mr V 
notified it of his situation. And Mr V hasnt sent anything to demonstrate he asked NatWest 
for help. 
Ive also looked at Ws correspondence and whilst I understand the situation was serious, I 
havent found it treated Mr V unfairly. I appreciate W said it could take legal action to recover 
NatWests debt, but I think that reflects the outstanding balance on Mr Vs accounts and lack 
of payment arrangement or information about his circumstances. Im sorry to disappoint Mr V 
but I havent found NatWest treated him unfairly while he was experiencing financial 
difficulties. 
Ive looked at the timeline of this case and Im satisfied that the two personal loans and 
overdraft were sold to C in 2019 as claimed. Whilst I understand Mr V may not have 
received the letters, I can see both NatWest and C wrote to him independently to confirm the 
new arrangements. Both letters are addressed in line with the details we hold for Mr V and 
Im satisfied NatWest wrote to him as it claims. 
That means when NatWest wrote to Mr V in March 2020 it had already sold his debts to C. 
As C is a separate business, NatWest cant write off any balance it holds. So I agree with the 
investigator that the debts in question remain with C and are outstanding. 
Our investigator upheld Mr Vs complaint and recommended NatWest pay him £250 for the 
unclear and confusing information provided. I think thats a fair way to resolve this complaint. 
I agree that NatWests March 2020 letter and recent correspondence have included unclear 
and confusing information. But that doesnt mean the outstanding balance now owed to C 
has been written off. The error in this case is that NatWest has sent Mr V confusing 
information. 
I can see Mr V contacted his debt management plan administrator to stop making payments 
to W. And its clear the situation has caused him some distress and inconvenience. I agree 
that Mr Vs complaint should be upheld on the basis that NatWest has sent unclear and 
confusing information about his debts. And Im satisfied £250 fairly reflects the impact of that 
unclear information on Mr V. Im not telling NatWest to take any further action in relation to 
the accounts it sold to C. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
Mr V £250.  Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V 
to accept or reject my decision before 23 June 2021.
