Ms S looks like she may have had some problems repaying her final two loans because STF 
has told this Service that outstanding balances remain.
For loans 1  14 the only information that STF has been able to provide this Service about 
these loans are as follows;
loan amount; 
interest due to be charged;
term the loan was due to run for and 
how long the loan ran for. 
What STF hasnt been able to provide this Service is the start and end date of each loan. 
In response to Ms Ss complaint it issued its final response letter. In the response it 
explained that Ms S had taken a total of 30 loans between 2014 and 2019. STF didnt uphold 
Ms Ss complaint but it did explain that there were some signs of financial difficulties towards 
the end of the lending relationship. 
The adjudicator, reviewed Ms Ss complaint and she thought STF had acted reasonably 
when it approved loans 1  5. But, the adjudicator thought, that from loan 6 and all future 
loans shouldnt have been granted. In her view, the overall pattern of lending was now 
harmful for Ms S and so these loans ought to not have been provided. 
Ms S appears to have accepted the adjudicators findings. 
STF disagreed with the adjudicators assessment. In response, it said;
there was no nothing wrong in the way STF dealt with Ms S;
it adhered to all the regulations that were applicable at the time and
it was only from November 2018 that STF had the ability for the agents to keep any 
evidence they gathered as part of the application, for example bank statements. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.There doesnt appear to be any ongoing disagreement about the outcome the adjudicator 
reached about loans 1  5. So, I no longer think they are in dispute and so I wont be making 
a finding on them. Instead, this decision will focus on what happened when loans 6  44 
were lent. But Ive kept in mind loan 1- 5 as they do form part of Ms Ss lending history with 
STF. 
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms S could
repay her loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might suggest STF should have done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Ms S. These factors include: 
Ms S having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income); 
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ms S having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms S coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms S. The loan payments being 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case.
Although we dont have the start dates when loans 1  14 I think its most likely that either all 
or most of them were lent when STF was regulated by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). And 
at the time loans 15  44 were given, STF was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, 
which has set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) that payments are 
sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and in particular, made on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to make them. 
If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those 
repayments are unsustainable. The OFTs Irresponsible Lending Guidance didnt said 
something similar. 
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Ms Ss complaint.I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 6 - 44 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. 
STF has been able to provide this Service with a copy of Ms Ss application forms for loans 
15  40.
For the final few loans STF has provided this Service with a detailed income and expenditure 
information. This seems to be in response to the change in process and its new system that 
STF had in place from November 2018. 
I can see that on these reports, there is reference to credit reports. So, it appears that the 
figure for certain expenditure categories STF was able to confirm the information from Ms 
Ss credit report, for example, loan 41, for other home credit STF has recorded as £331. Its 
worth noting that by then, it does seem that Ms S was servicing a not insignificant amount of 
other home credit debt. 
I would say, that based on the details in the application form and the later income and 
expenditure assessments, that STF couldve have reasonably concluded that Ms S would be 
in a position to afford the repayments she was committed to making. 
But Id be inclined to think that from loan 6, STFs checks really needed to go further. At this 
point in the lending relationship, I think STF ought to have been verifying Ms Ss income and 
overall expenditure in order to have an accurate understanding of her actual financial 
position. I dont think it did this level of checks for all of Ms Ss loans. So STFs checks didnt 
go far enough. 
But in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Ms S, STF also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Ms S. Having looked at the overall pattern of STFs 
lending history with Ms S, I agree with our adjudicator that STF should reasonably have 
seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided 
loan 6. I say this because;
At this point STF ought to have realised Ms S was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Ms S had taken out six loans in at least 35 weeks (based on how long 
the loans had actually run for) and its likely she had been indebted to STF for the 
entire time. Although the amount of time wasnt very great, its likely that Ms S was 
repaying each of her loans much earlier than STF had anticipated. 
So STF ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms S was having to borrow 
further to cover an ongoing need and that Ms Ss indebtedness was increasingly 
unsustainably. It also seems from Ms Ss loan history, it indicated that her underlying 
financial situation didnt seem to be improving, given her loans were increasing in 
value. 
Ms Ss capital borrowing had increased from £100 to £450. This suggests to me that 
Ms Ss indebtedness was increasing unsustainably, and she was likely needing 
further borrowing to cover ongoing living costs, rather than as a means to cover one-
off purchases, for example. 
Ms S developed a pattern of taking new loans around the same time previous ones 
were repaid, for example, loans 15 and 16 and at times Ms S had more than one 
loan running at the same time. This pattern continued through the remainder of the 
lending relationship. So, STF ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms S, 
on these occasions, was having to borrow further to effectively cover a long-term financial need. To me, this is also indicative of her indebtedness not being 
sustainable.
Ms S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed STF. Loan 44 was 
taken out over five years after Ms Ss first loan that it has provided full information for. 
But its likely the lending relationship extended beyond that.  And it was for a similar 
sum.  Ms S had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to STF 
over an extended period.
I think that Ms S lost out when STF provided loans 6 - 44 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ss indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans and the time in debt was likely to have had negative 
implications on Ms Ss ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 - 44 and Ill go on to set out
what STF should do to put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms S from loan 6 as I think it ought to. 
Clearly there are several possibilities, and all hypothetical answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms S may have simply left matters there and 
not tried to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed between 
her and STF which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, she may 
have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and 
substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Ms S in a compliant 
way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Ms S would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
STF shouldnt have given Ms S loans 6 - 44.
If STF has sold the outstanding debts it should buy these back if it is able to do so and then 
take the following steps. If STF isnt able to buy the debts back then it should liaise with the 
new debt owner to achieve the results Ive outlined below; 
A. STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms S towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance. B. STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms S 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms S originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled. 
C. STF should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Ms S as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Ms S having 
made overpayments then STF should refund these overpayments with 8% simple 
interest* calculated, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date 
the complaint is settled. STF should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E. 
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Ms S. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then STF should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with 
Ms S and Id remind STF of its obligation to treat Ms S fairly and with forbearance. 
E. The overall pattern of Ms Ss borrowing for loans 6 - 44 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so STF should remove these loans entirely from Ms 
Ss credit file. STF do not have to remove loans 43 and 44 from Ms Ss credit file until 
these have been repaid, but it should still remove any adverse information recorded 
about these loans. 
As Ive explained above, STF has only very limited information about the first 14 loans that 
were granted to Ms S. It hasnt been able to tell us the start or end date of each loan but has 
told this Service the amount borrowed, interest due and the how long the loan was due to 
run for. 
Given the pattern that Ms S displayed later on in her lending relationship, I dont consider it 
unreasonable to assume that each loan ran consecutively after each other. By making this 
assumption STF should be able to work backwards from loan 15 to work out how much 
redress to pay for loans 6  14 because it knows how long the loan ran for and how much 
the loan wouldve cost.  
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. It should give Ms S a 
certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Ms Ss complaint in part.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 December 2021.
