The complaint
Mr P complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC  trading as Barclaycard (Barclaycard) placed a 
missed payment marker on his credit file at credit reference agencies.
What happened
Mr P had a Barclaycard. His income was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. On the 
statement issued on 24 March 2020, the limit was £11,400 and balance £5,666.34. The 
payment due was £141.65 and had to be paid by 24 April 2020. The statement dated 27 
April 2020 showed the payment wasnt made. On 2 May 2020, Mr P applied for a payment 
holiday. This was agreed until 30 June 2020. Barclaycard marked Mr Ps credit file with a 
missed payment for April 2020.
Mr P complained. He said he applied for a payment holiday when the first lockdown was 
announced but because Barclaycards systems werent ready for applications, he heard 
nothing. He then applied using Barclaycards online application process but only on the 
fourth attempt was his application successful. He asked that his payment history be taken 
into account and the marker deleted. He said his credit record had now been affected. He 
said all other finance companies had shown compassion and support, but Barclaycard 
hadnt.
Barclaycard issued a final response to Mr P which said his complaint had been resolved. 
The letter referred to a conversation with Mr P. Barclaycard told us that Mr P missed the 
payment due by 24 April 2020. So  Barclaycard reported that to the credit reference 
agencies (CRAs). Barclaycard said they introduced payment holidays on 9 April 2020. Mr P 
applied for a payment holiday on 2 May 2020 and that was agreed until 30 June 2020. Mr P 
had sent a secure message to Barclaycard on 23 March 2020 and Barclaycard replied to this 
on 10 April 2020  inviting him to apply for a payment holiday.  He didnt read the email until 
1 May 2020 which corresponded with his application on 2 May 2020.
Mr P brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Barclaycard acted fairly. She agreed 
with what Barclaycard had said and didnt think they needed to do anymore in dealing with 
Mr Ps complaint.
Mr P didnt agree. He said he didnt open the email from Barclaycard (dated 10 April 2020) 
and they should be sympathetic to that. He asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
To be clear, in April 2020, The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced guidance to 
lenders in response to the effects on customers of the COVID-19 pandemic. All lenders, 
including Barclaycard, had to put in place payment holidays on many credit agreements, 
including credit cards  to help customers who were affected. Customers could ask for a 
total of two payment holidays each of three months  whereby payments could be 
suspended. Missed payments would not be reported to credit reference agencies, although 
interest would still be debited to the accounts. This support was provided by firms up to the 
end of October 2020. 
In the context of Mr Ps complaint, its important to note that the FCA said that payment 
holidays came into effect on 9 April 2020. And so, while Mr P indicated that he applied for a 
payment holiday in March 2020, it wasnt possible for Barclaycard to agree one  as they 
didnt then exist. And Ive not seen anything in Barclaycards records that an application was 
made.
I looked at Mr Ps email to Barclaycard  dated 23 March 2020; it looks like he was then in 
possession of his statement dated 25 February 2020 (which needed payment by 23 March 
2020) - and he was asking for support regarding the payment due. He said I have my 
monthly bill to pay today, which I clear in full each month. Yet Im worried that paying this will 
leave me in a black hole as I cannot work.until the government grant is approved 
(furlough) I am a sitting duck. Can you tell me how interest and late fees will be 
addressedif I do not pay the minimum until the government grant comes throughare you 
able to postpone late payment and interest fees until I receive the Covid 19 government 
support?
I can see that Barclaycard replied to Mr Ps email on 10 April 2020  the day after they 
introduced the payment holiday scheme to customers - and invited him to click on the link 
and apply for a payment holiday  which is what he did. But he didnt do that until later  on 
2 May 2020, and it was agreed the same day. 
Mr Ps statement dated 24 March 2020 asked for the minimum payment to be made by 24 
April 2020. So  if he had applied for the payment holiday when he received Barclaycards 
email on 10 April 2020 (or shortly afterwards)  he couldve got the payment holiday in time 
to ensure he didnt need to make the payment. But unfortunately, he didnt. He told us he 
didnt open the email. And in Barclaycards records it shows he didnt read it until 1 May 
2020  which is consistent with Mr P applying for the payment holiday on 2 May 2020. I also 
saw in a letter from Barclaycard sent to us by Mr P that he wrote on it 2 May 2020 applied 
for holiday. So, I dont think theres any doubt that thats when he did apply for it.
So, this comes down to whether we can ask Barclaycard to remove the missed payment 
marker because Mr P didnt apply for the payment holiday because he didnt open the email. 
I think it would be reasonable to expect Mr P to have opened the email from Barclaycard -  
especially as he was clearly concerned about how he was going to make payments to his 
account. And so, I dont think its fair for me to ask Barclaycard to change Mr Ps credit file 
because of that.
I also looked at Mr Ps statements. The 24 March 2020 statement was clear and said the 
£141.65 had to be paid by 24 April 2020. And then, the next statement dated 27 April 2020 
said We have not received the payment requested on your previous statement. If you have 
not already paid, please pay £141.65 immediately, followed by £139.31 to reach us by 
26/05/2020. And so, at that time  I think its reasonable to say that Mr P shouldve been 
aware that the payment hadnt been made for the previous month, and nor had any payment 
holiday been agreed. 
All lenders, including Barclaycard, have an obligation to report accurate information to CRAs 
about customers accounts. And this cannot be changed or removed unless there is an 
error. And in the circumstances of this case, I dont think I can say that Barclaycard made an 
error.And so, while I know Mr P will find this disappointing, Im not going to ask Barclaycard to do 
anything here. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 July 2022.
