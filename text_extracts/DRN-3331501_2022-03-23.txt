The complaint
Mr N complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money lent him money on 
loans he was unable to afford to repay
What happened
118 118 Money provided Mr N with the following loans:
Date 
takenAmount Term Monthly 
repaymentAmount 
receivedDate repaid
Loan 1 29/11/2019 £1,434.60 12
months£119.55 £1,000 25/07/2020
Loan 2 25/07/2020 £1,898.45 24
months£163.53 £1,500 Outstanding
 
Mr N said that 118 118 Money offered him the loans and a credit card when he was 
struggling financially. He was offered a top-up loan after just a few payments, but 118 118 
Money didnt recheck his circumstances. If it had it would have known that he was now self-
employed and unlikely to be able to afford repayments.
118 118 Money said that for both loans it carried out a credit check and verified his income 
independently for the first loan. It also asked Mr L to check that the financial details it held for 
him were still correct in respect of the second loan, and if not to notify it of any updated 
information. It assessed that for both loans they were affordable. 
Mr N has supplied his bank statements for two accounts for the period around both loans.
In respect of both loans our adjudicator said that the checks 118 118 Money carried out were 
proportionate She thought that the information obtained confirmed that for both loans, Mr N 
should have been able to afford the instalment payments.
Mr N didnt agree, reiterating that for the second loan he had become self-employed and that 
118 118 Money didnt check his up to date circumstances.
The matter has been passed to me for further consideration.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending - 
including all the relevant rules, guidance, and good industry practice - on our website. 
Considering the relevant rules, guidance, and good industry practice, I think the questions I 
need to consider in deciding whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint are:
Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr N would be able to repay the loans in a sustainable way?
If not, would those checks have shown that Mr N would have been able to do so?
The rules and regulations in place required 118 118 Money to carry out a reasonable and 
proportionate assessment of Mr Ns ability to make the repayments under the agreements. 
This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or affordability 
check.
The checks had to be borrower-focused  so 118 118 Money had to think about whether 
repaying the loans would be sustainable. In practice this meant that 118 118 Money had to 
ensure that making the repayments on the loans wouldnt cause Mr N undue difficulty or 
significant adverse consequences. That means he should have been able to meet 
repayments out of normal income without having to borrow to meet the repayments, without 
failing to make any other payment he had a contractual or statutory obligation to make and 
without the repayments having a significant adverse impact on his financial situation.
In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 Money to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back - it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr N. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of 
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they are seeking. Even 
for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different applications.
I think that such a check ought generally to have been more thorough:
The lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income).
The higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet 
a higher repayment from a particular level of income).
The greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during which a 
customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal 
that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
loan 1
For this loan the credit checks revealed that Mr N had a credit card with a balance of £1,091, 
and two loans with respective balances on them of £476 and £1,256. He also had a mail 
order account with a balance on it of £126. The first loan had been in default from 2017 but 
Mr N had been making regular payments to it. He had a verified income of £1,400 a month. 
He said he was paying £200 in respect of his credit commitments. I think that was 
reasonable.
He had other declared expenses of £250 a month, and appeared to be able to afford the 
necessary loan instalment payments.. In respect of this loan, I think 118 118 Money carried out proportionate checks. And that 
those checks wouldnt have alerted it to carry out any further checks. I think it made a fair 
lending decision.
loan 2
For this loan, again 118 118 Money carried out a credit check. Mr N had paid off the credit 
card identified in the previous credit check. However he now had three credit cards, with 
balances on them of £460, £151, and £248 (the latter being a credit card issued to him by 
118 118 Money). He still had the loan now with a balance on it of £969. Despite the new 
credit cards, his overall credit balances outside the 118 118 money loan had gone down, 
and he had maintained the payments on his loans and credit cards. 
As to whether 118 118 Money should have verified his income again, bearing in mind that 
his loan was only issued eight months after the first one and that Mr N was specifically asked 
to check the financial information 118 118 Money held and if his circumstances were not the 
same, to advise it of any updates, I think that the checks carried were proportionate. And 
again I dont think those checks would have alerted it to carry out any further checks. I think 
it made a fair lending decision.
I should say as a final point that Ive considered Mr Ns bank statements. Although 118 118 
Money didnt ask for these, I dont think they raise any concerns. Mr N appears to have kept 
his accounts in credit and was managing his finances. 
My final decision
I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2022.
