The complaint
Mr F complains NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua have refused to refund some transactions 
made on his credit card.
What happened
Mr F reported some transactions to NewDay he didnt recognise as having made himself. 
The transactions, including foreign transaction fees, totalled about £3,200. He later said he 
had made the transactions but had done so while intoxicated and couldnt afford to repay the 
balance. Mr F also said they were made to gambling companies abroad so he thinks 
because of this, and the amount involved, NewDay shouldnt have allowed the transactions 
to debit his account. NewDay didnt agree they were responsible for the transactions, so 
Mr F complained. 
NewDay responded to Mr Fs complaint. They said, although Mr F had initially said he didnt 
recognise the transactions, hed later said they were made by him and that hed received 
confirmation of the transactions from the merchants. They also found the transactions were 
made from the same device Mr F has registered with NewDay. So they didnt agree there 
was any evidence the transactions had been made fraudulently. NewDay said the 
transactions hadnt been processed by the merchants as gambling transactions so thats 
why they hadnt been declined by NewDays systems. 
Mr F referred his complaint to our service. An Investigator considered what had happened. 
She said, in summary, as Mr F authorised the transactions it wasnt unreasonable for 
NewDay to hold Mr F liable for them and apply interest and charges in line with the terms 
and conditions of the account. She also considered that these were gambling transactions 
made on a credit card  which is now not permitted in the UK. But said NewDay werent 
aware the transactions were gambling transactions when they were processed because the 
merchant had used a different category code. So she didnt think theyd done anything 
wrong.  
Mr F said he didnt accept the Investigators findings but didnt say why. As Mr F didnt 
agree, the complaints been passed to me to decide.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Payment Services Regulations 2017 say customers can be held liable for transactions 
on their account made or authorised by them. Mr F, despite initially saying he didnt think the 
transactions were made by him, now accepts that they were. 
So Im satisfied Mr F authorised the transactions and therefore NewDay are entitled to hold 
him liable for them, and apply interest and charges in line with the account terms and 
conditions. 
Mr F says the transactions in question were for gambling. Gambling transactions are no 
longer allowed on credit card accounts in the UK. However, NewDay have said the merchant 
did not process these transactions as gambling transactions. The technical evidence theyve 
provided shows they were processed by the merchant using a different category code, so 
NewDay wouldnt have known they were gambling transactions at the time they were made. 
Mr F also thinks NewDay shouldnt have allowed such a high amount of money to debit his 
account in such a short space of time. But NewDay have also provided evidence to show Mr 
F was asked to verify the transactions in their app and also by text message  which the 
records show he did. So I dont think NewDay made a mistake by allowing these 
transactions to debit Mr Fs account.
 
Mr F has said he cant afford to repay what he spent on these transactions and hes in 
financial difficulty. I can see NewDay agreed a payment holiday with Mr F in September 
2022, which was due to continue until 1 January 2023. Its unclear what arrangements Mr F 
has made with NewDay to repay the balance since then, but thats for Mr F to discuss 
directly with them. And Ill remind NewDay of their obligations to treat Mr F positively and 
sympathetically. 
I also note NewDay credited Mr Fs account with £25 in recognition of some poor service he 
received on the phone and I find thats fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Fs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 June 2023.
