The complaint
Mr D is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) wont honour the 
information given to him by one of NatWests staff, which was that the balance he owed to 
them had been written off.
What happened
Mr D spoke with NatWest in May 2020 and was told by one their staff that a balance of 
£14,930.76 that he owed to NatWest had been written off and the account closed. But in 
February 2022, Mr D received a letter form NatWest requesting payment towards the 
balance of £14,930.76. Mr D wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Mr Ds complaint. They confirmed the balance was still owed by Mr D and 
hadnt been written off. However, they apologised if Mr D had incorrectly been told the 
balance had been written off, and they sent a cheque to him for £75 as compensation for 
any upset or inconvenience this provision of incorrect information may have caused. Mr D 
wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt the complaint response issued by 
NatWest to Mr D already represented a fair and reasonable outcome. Mr D remained 
dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This service isnt a regulatory body or a Court of Law. This means it isnt within my remit to 
declare that NatWest have acted in a non-regulatory or unlawful way - such declarations 
would be for a regulatory body or a Court of Law to potentially make. Instead, this service is 
an informal dispute resolution service with a remit based on fairness of outcome. 
I dont dispute that Mr D was told by a member of NatWests staff that the balance he owed 
to NatWest had been written off. However, NatWest have confirmed that this information 
was incorrect, and that Mr D does in fact continue to owe the balance outstanding to them.
Mr D feels that NatWest should honour the information given to him incorrectly by NatWests 
staff member and write off the balance of £14,930.76 that he owes. But this doesnt seem 
reasonable to me, and I dont feel that NatWest should fairly be asked to write off a 
legitimately owed balance because of an information error of this nature.
Instead, I feel that a fair outcome in this circumstance is that Mr D should have been told that 
he was still liable to pay the balance in question, but that NatWest should have apologised to 
Mr D for the provision of incorrect information by their staff member and compensated Mr D 
for any trouble and upset the mistake made by their staff member had caused. 
NatWest have done that here, and I feel the £75 compensation paid to Mr D by NatWest as 
compensation for his incorrectly being told his balance had been written off does provide fair 
compensation for any trouble and upset Mr D may have incurred because of that error.
This includes that NatWest didnt reach out to Mr D about the balance he owes them for over 
a year and a half, and so I can appreciate how it must have come as a shock to Mr D to be 
told that he still owed the balance in question in February 2022 as he was. But I dont feel 
that because NatWest didnt chase any payment towards the balance for an extended period 
that the balance in question is or should be in any invalidated. 
Additionally, given that the balance outstanding doesnt accrue interest, Im satisfied Mr D 
hasnt been financially disadvantaged during the time that he hasnt been making monthly 
payments towards this amount.
NatWest have provided an explanation as to why their staff member may have made the 
error they did, which in short is that the balance outstanding originates from many years ago 
and as such is recorded on one of their older systems, meaning that information about the 
balance might not be readily apparent to members of their staff unfamiliar with that older 
system. This explanation seems reasonable to me, although it doesnt in any way justify or 
redeem the error that led to Mr D being given incorrect information, but only explain it.
Ultimately, I dont feel that NatWest should fair or reasonably be expected to write off the 
balance Mr D owes to them because incorrect information about that balance was given to 
him by NatWests staff. Rather, I feel any balance that Mr D owes to NatWest isnt and 
shouldnt be affected by the specific information error that occurred here, especially as it 
appears that Mr D hasnt incurred any material financial detriment because of it.
I do feel Mr D should be compensated for NatWests error in giving incorrect information to 
him, but Im satisfied that the £75 compensation already paid to Mr D in this regard is fair.
All of which means that I wont be upholding this complaint as Mr D would like. I realise this 
wont be the outcome Mr D was wanting, but I hope hell understand, given what Ive 
explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2023.
