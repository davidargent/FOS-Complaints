The complaint
Mr B complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) debited his bank account without 
his authority. 
What happened
Mr B says his bank account was debited with a sum of £220.93 and after referring this 
transaction to his bank, he was informed it was debited by PayPal, but Mr B had no 
knowledge of this transaction. Mr B says PayPal told him the transaction didnt relate to them 
and he is now left in a difficult financial position. Mr B wants PayPal to refund the amount 
debited to his bank account and explain to him what the transaction relates to.
PayPal says they have no record of any transactions passing through Mr Bs account since 
2016 and this transaction didnt relate to them.
Mr B wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator says Mr Bs bank have closed their claim on this, but PayPal have provided 
evidence to show no transactions have passed through his PayPal account since 2016. The 
investigator concluded it was therefore unlikely the debit to Mr Bs bank account originated 
from PayPal.
Mr B didnt agree with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision. 
I can understand it would have been upsetting for Mr B to see a debit charged to his bank 
account without any understanding what it related to. When looking at this complaint I will 
consider if PayPal were responsible for incorrectly debiting Mr Bs bank account.
Mr B provided this service with a letter dated April 2021 from his bank, which says the debit 
of £220.93 charged to his bank account relates to a direct debit authority dated October 
2019. This letter doesnt explain fully what the transaction relates to other than its for a 
recent indemnity claim against PayPal.
What is important here is PayPal have provided evidence to this service, to show no 
transactions have passed through Mr Bs account with them since 2016 and with that in 
mind, its not likely the debit to Mr Bs account was initiated by PayPal. PayPal have also 
confirmed they have no record of this transaction, so I cant say with any certainty there is 
any evidence to support PayPal are at fault here. 
Like the investigator, I suggest Mr B should now approach his bank and ask them to provide 
further information regarding this transaction and Mr B can use both this and the 
investigators view letter to assist him. I do have some sympathy with Mr B here, especially 
given his current financial situation, but when coming to a full and impartial decision, I can 
only consider the complaint raised against PayPal. Based on the information I have been 
provided with, I am satisfied there isnt sufficient evidence to support Mr Bs claim that 
PayPal are at fault. 
While Mr B will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking any more of PayPal 
here. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 November 2021.
