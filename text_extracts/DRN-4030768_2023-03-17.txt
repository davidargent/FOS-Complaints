The complaint
Miss I complains that National Westminster Bank Plc made errors and told her incorrect 
information regarding a balance transfer she completed with a third party provider.
What happened
Miss I opened a third party credit card and transferred £5,000 to pay her NatWest credit 
card. But she believed the transfer hadnt gone through correctly, so she transferred another 
£5,000 to the NatWest credit card. This resulted in her being in credit on her NatWest credit 
card and this amount was refunded to her. But as Miss I owed £10,000 on her third party 
credit card so she spoke with both NatWest and her other provider to see what could be 
done to rectify the situation of the duplicate balance transfer.
Miss I says when she spoke to NatWest on 15 January 2022, the call handler advised her to 
request a recall for one of the £5,000 payments, so she contacted the third party provider to 
do this. But when she spoke to NatWest again, she says they told her that this process 
would take too long so she cancelled this in order to process a manual overpayment. Miss I 
says she made several follow up calls to both banks in February and March to ensure that 
the recall request had been cancelled. She says on 3 February 2022, she contacted 
NatWest and was told that her account was closed and she was assured that no recalls 
would take place. She was told there were sufficient and clear notes on the account which 
would avoid this. But on 16 March 2022, £5,000 was recalled, but the third party bank could 
not locate the £5,000, despite NatWest sending them this money.
As a result of the funds being missing, Miss I was being asked by the third party bank to 
make repayments on the £10,000 outstanding balance, but as NatWest had sent the third 
party £5,000, then they were also asking Miss I to make the repayments on a £5,000 
balance. So in effect she was paying £5,000 twice while the funds were missing. Miss I 
made a complaint to NatWest. 
NatWest partially upheld Miss Is complaint. They said they understood they informed her 
when she called in January 2022, that it would be quicker to arrange a refund of the credit 
balance, however, neither the original balance transfer nor recall appears to have been 
cancelled with the third party provider. They said they must honour a recall request when 
received within three months of the original payment. NatWest acknowledged she wrote to 
them about the third party not receiving the funds and they apologised for the service delays 
and the way the issue had been handled. 
NatWest said they had transferred £295.14 to Miss Is account, which was £150 in 
recognition of the distress and inconvenience while dealing with this. They said £133.14 
covered interest on March-April statements and included was £12 reimbursement of the late 
payment fee incurred March 2022. They also requested any missed payment in 
February/March was removed from her credit file. Miss I brought her complaint to our 
service. 
Our investigator did not uphold Miss Is complaint. He said he had received a response from 
NatWest to show that they had correctly sent the £5,000. He said he couldnt agree that 
NatWest delayed the return of the funds. Miss I asked for an Ombudsman to review her 
complaint. She raised new points such as her online access once her account had been 
closed and her difficulties in making payments over the phone especially in August 2022.
As my findings differed in some respects from our investigators, I issued a provisional 
decision to give both parties the opportunity to consider things further. This is set out below:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss I has brought a separate complaint to our service regarding the actions of the third 
party provider. As this is a separate complaint to the one against NatWest, Im only able to 
look into the actions of NatWest here and not the third party provider.
Miss I has made new complaint points which werent in her original complaint to NatWest 
and therefore I wont be able to address this as part of this complaint, such as her online 
access once her account had been closed and her difficulties in making payments over the 
phone especially in August 2022. This is because NatWest will need to respond to these 
issues first before our service can look into them, so she will need to make a complaint to 
NatWest if she wants to on the issues I cant resolve for her here.
Although Miss I made the original error as she processed 2 x £5,000 balance transfers 
instead of one when she opened the third party credit card, Ive looked at the role of 
NatWest once she asked for their help in this matter. NatWest were originally the ones who 
discussed a payment recall with her, so she acted upon this. But due to the time the recall 
can take, it was always probable that the 0% introductory balance transfer rate would have 
expired before this could be actioned. 
Miss I then called up NatWest to let them know she would manually process this as this 
would be quicker than the recall. The amount of credit that she was in with her NatWest 
account was refunded to her current account. She then asked for the recall to be cancelled 
with both NatWest and the third party provider. It appears that Miss I had conversations with 
NatWest on 3 February 2022 and 3 March 2022 amongst other calls where she had been 
told by NatWest staff that she had nothing to worry about with the cancellation. I asked 
NatWest for these calls so I could hear exactly what was said about the situation, but they 
have told me that they have been unable to locate these calls, although they have said that 
they dont dispute that Miss I may have been given incorrect information. 
I can see from NatWests system notes that they have provided me that they show several 
notes to not honour a recall request from the third party provider. Im persuaded that the call 
that Miss I had with NatWest here, was a big factor in what subsequently happened. I say 
this as NatWest have since confirmed that they are unable to cancel a recall request once 
they receive a request and that the team who process these wouldnt look at the notes on an 
account. So when the call handler told Miss I that this wouldnt be a problem and that he had 
left several notes on the system to not honour the request, this set an expectation to Miss I 
that everything was in hand, and the recall request wouldnt go ahead.
If Miss I had been told the correct information initially - if the third party bank requested a 
recall then NatWest would need to honour it and they couldnt cancel it, this could have 
managed her expectations. I say this because then she would have known not to process a 
manual payment and have the amount she was in credit refunded to her bank account. But 
instead, she was very distressed when she found out that NatWest had actioned the recall 
and she was inconvenienced by having to speak to them again on the phone about this. So 
Im persuaded that they let Miss I down here. NatWest did send the £5,000 to the third party provider in March 2022. But when the third 
party provider couldnt locate these funds, Im persuaded that they could have done more to 
help Miss I and the third party provider locate these funds. I say this because the third 
partys payment provider had been using a reference number in the title of their emails 
between themselves and NatWest, but this reference number wasnt quoted to Miss I when 
they gave her the details of the payment to chase this up with the third party provider, which 
delayed the third party locating the funds. 
It may be that NatWest would argue the third party provider should be able to locate the 
funds on the details they gave Miss I. And while that may be true to some extent, the way 
they received the funds didnt show all of the other details, therefore the reference they were 
using to communicate to each other in the subject line  which NatWests reference wasnt in 
the subject line of the emails, would have, in my opinion, helped them locate the funds 
quicker. They could have also placed a trace on the funds they sent, and this information 
could have been provided to the third party provider. But Miss I was left ringing each 
company, only for each company to blame each other.
Unfortunately, as a result of the delay of the £5,000 recall, Miss I technically owed the third 
party provider £10,000 and owed NatWest £5,000. And she could not afford to make 
payments on both accounts as she would need to pay a lot more than she would have paid if 
the recall request was cancelled originally. As a result of this, Miss I missed payments on her 
NatWest credit card which may have had an impact on her credit file. 
Im satisfied that both NatWest and the third party had a role to play in what happened here. 
But in terms of NatWest, they gave Miss I wrong information about the recall. This resulted in 
an expectation that everything would be fine for Miss I. She was not told that they could not 
refuse a recall request and that the team who process these wouldnt look at any system 
notes before processing this and Im persuaded they could have done more to help Miss I 
locate the funds with the third party provider.
In terms of what I believe would be a fair outcome of this complaint, Ive considered what 
NatWest have already done. They have transferred £295.14 to Miss Is account, which £150 
was for distress and inconvenience. They said £133.14 covered interest on March-April 2022 
statements and included in the compensation was a £12 reimbursement of the late payment 
fee incurred in March 2022. They also requested any missed payment in February/March 
was removed from her credit file. But Im not persuaded that this is enough.
I say this because the impact the wrong information had on Miss I had further reaching 
consequences as this payment request wasnt cancelled and as such this created an extra 
£5,000 that Miss I had to pay. NatWest had a role to play in this and Miss I could not afford 
to pay both NatWest and the third parties minimum repayment. The third party provider 
would not be able to ask the credit reference agencies to alter a consumers credit file on 
behalf of NatWest to reflect any errors they may have contributed to.
The timeframe Im looking at where things went wrong is between January-June 2022. 
NatWest have agreed already to cover the interest from March-April 2022. I wont be asking 
NatWest to pay the interest and charges that were applied to the statement in May 2022 as 
this has been paid by the third party provider as part of a settlement of a separate complaint 
Miss I made, due to the third party errors. 
But Im not persuaded it is fair for Miss Is credit file to be impaired during this period (if it has 
been) when she had received incorrect information from NatWest. They have already said 
they would request that any missed payment for February/March is removed from her credit 
file, but Id like them to go further than this. As the funds were only located in late June, Id 
like NatWest to ensure that there are no missed/late payments reported on Miss Is credit file up to and including July 2022. I say July 2022 as this also covers part of June where there 
was uncertainty of where the funds were. I can see Miss I paid her arrears on the following 
statement, so Im persuaded that the fairest thing to do here, given that NatWest had given 
Miss I incorrect information on several occasions which impacted the actions she took, is to 
ensure that her credit file isnt impacted due to the role that NatWest has played in this. 
NatWest have told me that there were no late payments from the date the account was 
opened until the date it was settled, but it doesnt appear the account has been settled yet. 
Although the third party provider was more at fault for the delays in locating the funds than 
NatWest  and they have already paid Miss I compensation to recognise their role in what 
happened, they would be unable to ask the credit reference agencies to remove any 
late/missed payment markers than NatWest have told the credit reference agencies. So 
based on the unique individual circumstances here, Ill be asking NatWest to put this right for 
Miss I as this was due to no fault of her own with the delays, especially when she was 
constantly ringing both parties to get this resolved.
I know Miss I wants NatWest to apply a 0% interest rate on her account as she was deprived 
the opportunity to take up the third parties promotional offer prior to it expiring. But Im not 
persuaded that this is proportionate. I say this as NatWest werent offering a promotional 
rate, so it would be unfair to ask them to do so based on a third party offer. Miss I did agree 
to the recall and as such there would always be a chance that this wasnt completed before 
the offer expired, so I cant say it would be proportionate for NatWest to not charge their 
standard interest rate here. 
I have considered that Miss I was paid £150 compensation for distress and inconvenience. 
But Im persuaded that another £100 would be fair and reasonable here. I say this because 
of the impact that the errors/incorrect information had on Miss I. She was told wrong 
information several times. She was assured multiple times that everything would be ok when 
it wasnt. She was inconvenienced by having to make several phone calls/emails over 
several months to try and find out where the money was and why the recall had not been 
stopped by NatWest after she was assured it would be. So I intend to ask NatWest to put 
things right for Miss I.
I invited both parties to let me have any further submissions before I reached a final 
decision. Both parties accepted my provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party have provided me with any further information to consider, then my decision 
and reasoning remains the same as in my provisional decision.
Putting things right
In my provisional decision I said I intend to uphold this complaint. I said I intend to ask 
National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Miss I a further £100 compensation for distress and 
inconvenience. I also said I intend to ask them to ensure that there are no late/missed 
payment markers for the NatWest credit card on Miss Is credit file from March 2022-July 
2022 if there are any showing. Im still satisfied this is a fair outcome for the reasons given 
previously.My final decision
I uphold this complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Miss I a further £100 
compensation for distress and inconvenience. They should also ensure that there are no 
late/missed payment markers for the NatWest credit card on Miss Is credit file from March 
2022-July 2022 if there are any showing. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss I to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 April 2023.
