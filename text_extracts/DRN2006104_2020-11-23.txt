K820x#14complaint
Miss M complains that Moneybarn No. 1 Limited has terminated her conditional sale 
agreement and repossessed the car that had been  supplied to her under it. She also 
complains about  the amount that it says she owes to it. 
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus  on giving the reasons for 
my decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Miss M under  a conditional sale agreement with 
Moneybarn that she signed in October 2015   she agreed to make 59 monthly  
payments of Â£371.51 for the car;
Miss M didnt make all of those  payments  and Moneybarn  accepted  some  reduced 
payments from her in 2017 but it says that her account was over three months in 
arrears in October 2017 so it sent her letters in November and December 2017 which 
explained her options for ending the agreement;
Miss M says that she didnt receive those  letters  because shed moved  - but Ive 
seen no evidence to show that shed notified  Moneybarn of her change of address  so 
I consider that it was reasonable for it to send those  letters to the address that it held 
for her;
Moneybarn says that it tried to contact Miss M without  success and her account  went 
further into arrears so it sent her a default  notice in May 2018 but she didnt  take the 
action set out in that notice;
Moneybarn then terminated the conditional sale agreement in June 2018  and it 
obtained a court  order in October  for it to repossess the car, it appointed agents to 
repossess the car and the car was then sold at auction after it had been repossessed 
and the proceeds  of sale were  credited to Miss Ms account;
I sympathise with Miss M for the financial and other difficulties that shes 
experienced, but Im not persuaded that theres  enough evidence  to show  that 
Moneybarn has acted  incorrectly  in these circumstances;
she didnt make the payments required under the agreement, it accepted reduced 
repayments from her and then explained her options for ending the agreement, it 
sent her a default notice before terminating the agreement and obtained a court order  
before repossessing  the car  I consider those actions to have been fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances; 
I consider that Miss M remains liable for the outstanding balance of her account 
which Moneybarn has calculated in accordance  with the terms of the agreement that 
were accepted by her and Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence  to show  
that Moneybarn  has calculated that balance  incorrectly;
Ref: DRN20061042I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Moneybarn to reduce or 
waive that balance,  to pay any compensation to Miss M or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint; and
I suggest that Miss M contacts Moneybarn to try to agree an affordable repayment 
arrangement for the amount that she owes to it and its required to respond to her 
financial difficulties positively and sympathetically.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold Miss Ms complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 December 2020.
