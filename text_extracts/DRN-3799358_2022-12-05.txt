The complaint
Miss H complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua lent irresponsibly when it approved her 
credit card and increased the credit limit.
What happened
Miss H applied for a  credit card with NewDay in April 2021. NewDay approved the 
application and gave Miss H a credit card with an initial credit limit of £250. In October 2021 
the credit limit was increased to £1250.
Miss H complained that NewDay had complained irresponsibly. NewDay didnt agree that it 
had lent irresponsibly but as a gesture of goodwill it refunded interest applied between 
December 2021 and March 2022 amounting to £85.61.
Miss H remained unhappy and brought her complaint to this service. Our investigator looked 
at everything but didnt think NewDay had acted irresponsibly.
Miss H didnt agree so Ive been asked to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Account opening
Before agreeing to lend, the rules say that NewDay had to complete reasonable and 
proportionate checks to ensure that Miss H could afford to repay the debt in a sustainable 
way. These affordability checks need to be focussed on the borrowers circumstances. The 
nature of whats considered reasonable and proportionate will vary depending on various 
factors  including the amount of credit, the total sum repayable, the amount of repayments, 
the cost of the credit and the consumers individual circumstances.
Theres no set list of checks a lender must complete. But lenders are required to consider 
the factors Ive mentioned above when deciding whats reasonable and proportionate.
NewDay says it looked at the information Miss H provided on her application. It also looked 
at information it obtained from credit reference agencies.
Miss H told NewDay she was living in rented property with an income of around £25,600. 
Her credit file showed no county court judgements or accounts in arrears. There was one 
default on her credit file, recorded around 33 months prior to the application.
I think NewDay completed reasonable and proportionate checks before opening the credit 
card account. It gathered information about Miss Hs financial circumstances. I dont think 
any of the information obtained by NewDay wouldve given cause for concern. It wouldnt 
have been proportionate for NewDay to have carried out further checks.
Ive gone on to consider whether the lending decision was fair.
Ive reviewed the information obtained by NewDay. I havent seen anything to suggest that 
the credit card wouldnt be affordable for Miss H. There was no adverse information on Miss 
Hs credit file which wouldve given cause for concern. There was a default on the credit file 
but this was historic and would not have been a reason not to decline the application. Taking 
all the information into account and given that the initial credit limit was low in relation to Miss 
Hs income and other borrowing, Im satisfied that the decision to lend was fair.
Credit limit increase
NewDay has explained that prior to increasing the credit limit in October 2021 it looed at how 
Miss H had managed the account including whether she had exceeded the credit limit or 
missed any payments. It also checked Miss Hs credit file to check whether she had arrears 
on other accounts or payment arrangements.
Because the credit limit was increased significantly, I think it would have been proportionate 
if, in addition to the checks it carried out, NewDay had carried out further checks to find out 
more about Miss Hs income and expenditure, including other credit commitments at the 
time.
This service asked Miss H to provide bank statements for the three months prior to the credit 
limit increase. Miss H hasnt provided enough information for me to be able to assess  
whether or not NewDay had made a fair lending decision. Because of this, Im unable to 
safely conclude that NewDay lent unfairly. 
Ive taken account  of everything Miss H has said about her health issues. Im sorry to hear 
about these. However, based on the information Ive seen, Im not persuaded that the 
increase to the credit limit wasnt affordable for Miss H, or that she wasnt able to sustainably 
repay the debt.
In conclusion, I think NewDay carried out reasonable and proportionate checks before 
approving the credit card and increasing the credit limit. I dont think NewDay lent 
irresponsibly.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 January 2023.
