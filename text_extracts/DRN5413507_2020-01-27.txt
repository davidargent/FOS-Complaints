K821x#15complaint
Mr B says MYJAR  Limited (MYJAR) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about seven short-term loans  MYJAR provided to Mr B between  
February 2016 and March  2018.  Mr Bs borrowing history is as follows:
LoanDate 
TakenDate 
RepaidInstalments Amount
1 04/02/2016 17/03/2016 1 £100.00
2 20/03/2016 28/04/2016 1 £100.00
3 06/06/2016 02/12/2016 6 £300.00
4 05/11/2016 04/05/2017 6 £350.00
5 04/07/2017 21/05/2018 12 £450.00
6 07/12/2017 15/03/2018 3 £100.00
7 05/03/2018 Outstanding 6 £550.00
MYJAR had already offered  to refund interest  and charges and remove  any negative  
information for loan 5. So, our adjudicator didnt need to consider that loan.
For the remaining  loans  our adjudicator concluded  that for loans 1 to 4 it wasnt 
unreasonable of MYJAR to think Mr B could afford  to make the repayments. 
But for loans 6 and 7 our adjudicator thought  they should be upheld  as in both cases  MYJAR 
hadnt done enough to confirm that Mr B could make his repayments in a sustainable 
manner. It hadnt  carried out enough proportionate  checks.
In response, MYJAR agreed with the adjudicator and offered to repay interest and charges 
for loans  5 to 7 and remove any negative comment from Mr Bs file. 
Mr B didnt accept the offer. He didnt think it reflected MYJARs responsibility as a lender 
and he was still living with the negative impact  of its lending process.
As the complaint remains unresolved, its been  passed to me for decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN54135072But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Bs complaint 
in part and have explained why below. 
There isnt any remaining disagreement  about  loans 5 to 7. MYJAR  had already made  an 
offer for loan 5, and loans  6 and 7 were  upheld by the adjudicator with which MYJAR has 
agreed. It has offered redress and to remove any negative comment from Mr Bs credit file. 
Having looked  at the circumstances surrounding the sale of loans  5 to 7, I agree that MYJAR  
shouldnt have approved these loans  and that is should pay compensation. I also agree with 
the offer it has made.
So it only remains for me to consider loans 1 to 4. 
In his response to the offer, Mr B said he didnt think the offer reflected MYJARs 
responsibility as a lender. He said he was still living with the negative impact of MYJARs 
lending process.  However, I agree with the adjudicator that for loans  1 and 2 it wasnt  
unreasonable of MYJAR to think Mr B could afford  to make the repayments. And for loans 3 
and 4 again MYJAR was reasonable in its lending in that Mr B could sustainably afford the 
repayments based on the checks  it had carried out. 
So I dont  think this would have flagged to MYJAR that it needed to carry out any further 
checks on Mr Bs financial  position than it already had done. And, overall, I dont think its 
lending decision for the first four loans was unreasonable and Im not upholding Mr Bs 
complaint about  them.  
So I think what MYJAR has offered to resolve  Mr Bs complaint is fair. So Im upholding the 
complaint about  loans  5 to 7. I understand that repayment for loan 7 is still outstanding, but 
that a debt management plan is already  in place. To clarify what  MYJAR needs to do - 
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do 
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 5 to 7;
Ref: DRN54135073pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
rework loan 7 applying all payments made  by Mr B as if they went towards  the 
principal amount borrowed. But importantly,  MYJAR needs to make  sure that it 
collects no more than the principal sum lent. 
If and when the amount Mr B has paid exceeds the amount he was lent, any further 
amounts paid should be treated as overpayments. Any overpayments  that may have 
been made should be refunded to Mr B with 8% simple  interest  from the date the 
overpayment was made to the date of settlement ;
if there is still an outstanding balance, any refunds  should  be used to repay any 
balance remaining on the outstanding loan. If there  is any surplus this should be 
repaid to Mr B.
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Bs credit file in relation to loans  5 
to 7. 
                                                                                                                               
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must give Mr B 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Bs complaint. MYJAR  Limited  
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 February  2020.
