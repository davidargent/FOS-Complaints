borrowed ranged between £50 and £610.

Mr M said that Lending Stream didnt do proper affordability checks and the loans were 
unaffordable for him. 
He told us this led to him being in a debt spiral, leading to repeat borrowing and this made 
his already poor financial situation even worse. 
Our adjudicators overall view was that he hadnt seen enough to say it was unfair for 
Lending Stream to have provided loans 1 - 9 to Mr M. 
But he felt that the pattern of lending itself showed that by loan 10 Mr Ms overall borrowing 
record suggested hed become persistently reliant on short-term loans and the borrowing 
was now unsustainable  so Lending Stream shouldnt have given Mr M loan 10, or any 
further loans after that.
Lending Stream said it disagreed with the adjudicators opinion and requested an 
ombudsman review. It mainly said the loans were all affordable and asked questions about 
the way our adjudicator had approached his assessment. So the complaint comes to me to 
decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
The information already available online largely covers the particular points Lending Stream 
has mentioned but Ill say a bit more in my decision about why I agree with the outcome 
reached by our adjudicator.
I hope this will be helpful in explaining how Ive come to the conclusion Ive reached.   
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Mr M could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income) 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.Lending Stream was required to establish whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  
not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence 
calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Id like to reassure Lending Stream that Ive looked at the complaint afresh  and Ive 
independently reached the same conclusions as our adjudicator.
Ive looked at each of the loans Mr M took out with Lending Stream. 
Looking at the repayments that Mr M needed to make on loans 1-3, the amounts wouldve 
seemed relatively affordable compared with the disposable income hed declared. 
Given these repayment amounts, what was apparent about Mr Ms circumstances at the 
time, and his borrowing history with Lending Stream, I dont think it wouldve been 
proportionate for Lending Stream to ask Mr M for the amount of information that would be 
needed to show the lending was unsustainable before agreeing the first three loans. 
I do think Lending Stream should have looked further into Mr Ms circumstances by the time 
he took out loan 4  and from then on when he applied for loans. 
But I havent seen anything in the information available to me which shows Lending Stream 
would have decided not to agree this loan had it done so  or the following loans (at least up 
to loan 9). 
So I agree with our adjudicator about loans 1-9  and as it seems Mr M hasnt objected to 
what our adjudicator has said, then I don't think I need say more about these loans. 
But given the particular circumstances of Mr Ms case, I think by loan 10 Lending Stream 
should reasonably have seen that further lending was likely to be unsustainable and it 
shouldnt have provided this loan  or any further loans to Mr M (even if on the figures alone 
this borrowing mightve appeared to be affordable). 
I say this because at this point Lending Stream ought to have realised:
Mr M was not managing to repay his loans sustainably. This was Mr Ms tenth loan 
since hed first started borrowing from Lending Stream around 6 months or so earlier 
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads into the amount he owed Lending Stream. 
Although the loan amounts had been variable, this record of borrowing doesnt suggest that he was asking to borrow because of a new need for a short term loan. 
Rather, I think this indicated that overall his financial circumstances hadnt improved 
and he had ongoing money problems 
Lending Stream ought to have realised it was more likely that the real underlying 
reason Mr M was borrowing further was to cover the hole repaying the previous loan 
was leaving in his finances each time and that Mr M wasnt using the loans for their 
intended purpose. 
Ive carefully considered everything Lending Stream has said, including its response to our 
adjudicators view. But for the reasons Ive explained, I think Lending Stream shouldve seen 
that Mr Ms indebtedness was increasing unsustainably by the time he took out loan 10  
and it shouldve realised then that it was unfair to continue to lending to him. 
I think that Mr M lost out when Lending Stream provided loan 10 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time 
the length of time over which Mr M borrowed these loans was likely to have negative 
implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for high-cost loans. By this point, Mr M had already borrowed ten loans in a 
row so any further borrowing was likely to be detrimental to his credit rating.
So Im upholding the complaint about loans 10 - 21. 
Putting things right
what Lending Stream needs to do
A)add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 10 - 21, including payments made to a third party where applicable, 
but not including anything already refunded
B)calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr M which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr M originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled
C)pay Mr M the total of A plus B
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ms complaint. Gain Credit LLC 
(trading as Lending Stream) should pay Mr M as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2020.
