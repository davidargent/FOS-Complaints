K820x#14complaint
Mr B says Yorkshire Building Society (YBS) mis-sold him a mortgage payment protection 
insurance (MPPI) policy.
background
Mr B took out an MPPI policy with a mortgage  in 1989. He paid a monthly  amount  for the 
policy.
Our adjudicator didnt  think YBS was responsible for selling the MPPI. Mr B disagreed  with 
the adjudicators  opinion,  so the complaint has been  passed to me. 
I issued a provisional decision saying I wasnt planning to uphold  the complaint. This gave  
Mr B and YBS the opportunity to respond, but neither provided any additional comments.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
I see no reason to change  my findings from those set out in my provisional decision.  So Ive 
decided not to uphold this complaint. I dont think  YBS is responsible for the sale of the PPI. 
And therefore YBS didnt mis-sell the PPI to Mr B. My reasons are below. 
The mortgage and MPPI application forms were completed at the same  time, during a 
conversation with a mortgage broker. I think the broker was from another company, not YBS 
 because the mortgage application form lists the other company as having  introduced  Mr B 
to YBS.  
Also, the MPPI application  form says it needs to be returned to YBS to be processed. So it 
appears that Mr Bs decision to take out MPPI  was made as a result of his conversation  with 
the other companys broker  without any input  from YBS.
Ive taken into account Mr Bs comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion 
my final decision
For the reasons  above, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 April 2019.
