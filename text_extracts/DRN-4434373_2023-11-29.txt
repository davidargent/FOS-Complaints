The complaint
Mr P says he has a Group Additional Voluntary Contribution (AVC) plan with Scottish 
Widows Limited (Scottish Widows) of which he was unaware. When he queried it, Scottish 
Widows failed to provide information about it.
What happened
When accessing Scottish Widows online platform, Mr P saw that it showed he had two AVC 
plans. One was labelled Group AVC and the other Civil Service AVC. Different plan numbers 
for each were given. Mr P was unaware of any Group AVC. He contacted Scottish Widows 
on 3 August 2022 to query it. He emailed again on 8 August 2022.
 
Scottish Widows sent policy information to Mr P on 23 August 2022. It showed the plan 
number as *****73, a start date of 1 April 2003 and a value of £8,338.75. But Scottish 
Widows didnt deal with any of Mr Ps queries. Mr P chased matters up but Scottish Widows 
didnt provide any further information. On 7 November 2022 Scottish Widows acknowledged 
Mr Ps complaint. Scottish Widows was unable to provide its final response within eight 
weeks and wrote to Mr P on 23 December 2022 saying he could contact this service. 
On 31 January 2023 Scottish Widows wrote to Mr P with some further information. Scottish 
Widows issued its final response letter on 16 February 2023, saying it would send a cheque 
for £100 for the inconvenience Mr P had been caused. Scottish Widows acknowledged that 
hed tried to get in contact multiple times for an update on his second policy P*******14. 
Scottish Widows said a letter had been sent on 20 January 2023, advising that policy 
number P*******14 Civil Service AVC Scheme commenced on 30 October 2000 and was still 
active. Scottish Widows apologised for the time it had taken to provide Mr P with information 
and for the level of service hed received. I think Mr P received the cheque but didnt cash it. 
Mr P asked this service to look into the matter. He said he has an active Group AVC policy 
that he knows nothing about  when it started, how it was funded, the current value or if it 
relates to his Civil Service AVC policy. He says Scottish Widows has never referred to the 
Group AVC policy in any letters or emails despite Mr P clearly stating its that policy hes 
complaining about. Both policies are active so the Civil Service AVC didnt fund the Group 
AVC. Scottish Widows final response letter didnt resolve things as it makes no mention of 
the Group AVC policy. 
Mr P then received a letter from Scottish Widows dated 18 July 2023. He forwarded it to us 
and said it didnt answer his complaint. Scottish Widows explained that the original policy 
was numbered Z*****00-YP****41A but had been transferred to a new AVC scheme 
numbered P*******14 and within that Mr Ps policy numbered *****73/1 was held. So the two 
policies were linked and the earlier policy Z*****00-YP****41A wouldve been viewable 
because it was now policy *****73/1 and which had a value of £8,338.95 as at 18 July 2023. 
We asked Scottish Widows for some further information but we didnt get a prompt 
response. When Scottish Widows did respond they said, although information had been 
issued to Mr P, that and the complaint response letter hadnt clarified that Mr P holds one 
(active AVC) policy with Scottish Widows, policy number *****73. And the final response 
letter had referred to P*******14 as a policy instead of a scheme which had probably caused 
confusion for Mr P. But a letter had been issued on 18 July 2023 explaining matters. 
The investigator issued his view on 14 August 2023. He said, when accessing Scottish 
Widows online platform, Mr P could see he had two policies with different names and 
numbers. So hed queried that with Scottish Widows and had asked some specific 
questions. Although he received some information, he didnt get a reply to his queries 
despite much chasing. And Scottish Widows final response letter in February 2023 hadnt 
answered the questions hed raised back in August 2022. It wasnt until July 2023 that 
Scottish Widows had responded. 
Although Mr P didnt think that letter dealt with his questions, the investigator thought it did. 
He said Scottish Widows had explained, amongst other things, the connection between the 
two AVC policies, why Mr P was moved from one to another and who was responsible for 
that. The investigator said the information Mr P was able to view online was misleading and 
the explanation provided by Scottish Widows in the final response letter didnt help as it 
referred to P*******14 as a policy rather than a scheme. 
The investigator said Mr P held one policy numbered *****73/1. The AVC scheme number 
was P*******14, formerly Z*****00-YP****41A. The investigator said the only issue was how 
long it had taken Scottish Widows to provide that explanation  18 July 2023 when Mr Ps 
original query had been made on 3 August 2022. £100 wasnt a fair reflection of the time 
taken to properly answer Mr Ps queries and the distress and confusion hed been caused. 
The investigator said £200 would be fair. 
Scottish Widows accepted the investigators view. Mr P didnt. He referred again to what 
hed seen online. He said policy *****73/1 couldnt have been funded from Z*****00-
YP****41A as both were active at the same time. He referred to Scottish Widows letter of 31 
January 2023. He said he didnt have Scottish Widows letter of 18 July 2023 and he hadnt 
received the letter dated 20 January 2023 which Scottish Widows had said in its final 
response letter had been sent. We forwarded a copy of the letter dated 18 July 2023 which 
Mr P had in fact forwarded to us. We dont seem to have sent a copy of the letter dated 20 
January 2023 and Im not sure if weve seen it. The investigator maintained the letter of 18 
July 2023 did clarify things and showed that what Mr P had seen online had been incorrect 
and that he only had one policy. 
Mr P remained dissatisfied. He said, even if the scheme trustees shouldve notified him of 
changes, so should Scottish Widows, as the policy provider. He continued to query if he had 
two active policies, what the Group AVC policy was and the difference between that and the 
Civil Service AVC and how the Group AVC policy was originally funded. He also said 
Scottish Widows had told him that, since August 2022, it was no longer possible to view AVC 
policies on line and that the call handler had been told by a colleague that Mr Ps two 
policies had been merged in 2003. 
The investigator replied, dealing with the queries Mr P had raised on 3 August 2022 and 
those set out in his latest email to the investigator. There were some further exchanges and 
the investigator asked Scottish Widows for some more information. Once that was to hand 
he wrote to Mr P again on 27 October 2023. The investigator maintained that Mr P only had 
one AVC policy although hed been given misleading information which suggested he had 
two policies. The investigator still though £200 compensation was fair. 
In response Mr P said he shouldnt be expected to dismiss information provided to him by 
numerous members of Scottish Widows staff in letters, emails and online as errors. The 
investigator responded to say that Scottish Widows had said some of the information Mr P 
had received on 31 January 2023 was incorrect and that had misled Mr P. The investigator said he was relying on information from the relevant line area which looks after Mr Ps policy. 
It was likely the call agents Mr P had spoken to could see what Mr P could see on line when 
hed logged onto Scottish Widows online platform in August 2022. The investigator provided 
a screenshot which confirmed Mr Ps only active policy (*****73). was in force. 
Mr P remained unhappy. Amongst other things, he said hed spoken to the relevant policy 
support team himself on more than one occasion. He suggested Scottish Widows had 
deliberately avoided providing correct contact telephone numbers, email addresses and 
policy information. The fact that it took Scottish Widows more than a year to provide what is 
now said to be the correct information, without any supporting evidence, raised doubts in his 
mind. He didnt consider £200 was fair compensation.
 
The investigator replied but he wasnt persuaded to change his view and said that the 
complaint would be referred to an ombudsman for decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive read and considered everything but Im only going to focus on what I consider to be key.  
As I see it, the central issue is whether Mr P has two active AVC policies or one. Mr Ps 
concerns arose in August 2022 when, from what he saw online, it seemed he had two AVC 
policies. Ive seen the screenshot Mr P has provided. Its headed Your Policies Client 
Services Online and says a list of his policies is shown below, with a box ticked if he can 
view details online or crossed if he cant. Under the heading Policy Number two different 
policy numbers are given (*****73/1 and Z*****00/YP****41A). Under Policy Type a Group 
AVC is shown and a Civil Service AVC. Under View Online? theres a tick in the box for the 
Group AVC and a cross for the Civil Service AVC.
I entirely accept, if Scottish Widows online system showed two differently named policies 
with different policy numbers then Mr P would naturally assume that was correct and there 
were in fact two policies. And I understand that when he called Scottish Widows to query 
things, Scottish Widows confirmed that but couldnt provide further details so Mr P sought 
clarification in writing. 
But I dont think thats conclusive. While I dont underplay the importance for companies 
such as Scottish Widows to ensure that all information provided to a customer  whether in 
correspondence, by email, over the telephone or on line  is correct, mistakes can and do 
arise. As the investigator explained, if there was an error on Scottish Widows online system 
then whoever Mr P spoke to presumably wouldve seen the same information as Mr P had 
which wouldve led them to confirm that he did have two AVC policies. That wouldve 
reinforced Mr Ps belief that there were two policies. But, if the underlying information held 
on Scottish Widows system was incorrect, that would likely lead to the misinformation being 
repeated, unless and until any errors were corrected. 
Further it seems that information provided by Scottish Widows hasnt always been accurate 
or consistent which wont have helped. And Scottish Widows delays in dealing with Mr Ps 
enquiries (a pattern that was repeated during our investigation) and the failure to address his 
queries directly will have added to Mr Ps frustration. As well as impacting on his confidence 
in Scottish Widows and his willingness to accept what Scottish Widows now says is correct. 
But I dont see any evidence that Scottish Widows has deliberately sought to withhold 
information. And it seems that Mr P has more recently been told that AVC policies now (and 
since August 2022) cant be viewed on line. Although he may not accept thats a coincidence, we cant tell a business how to operate and what information is made available 
to its customers on line. 
Weve looked into whats happened and, like the investigator, Im satisfied that Mr P only has 
one active AVC policy. In a case such as this, which turns on whether a business records 
are correct, we are to some extent dependent on what the business itself tells us about how 
its records came to show what they did. And where, as here, theres a dispute and the 
evidence is unclear, incomplete or contradictory, we reach our decisions on the balance of 
probabilities, that is what we think is likely to have happened, taking into account what 
information and evidence is available and the wider circumstances.  
I note that Mr P himself didnt seem to think he had two AVC policies. When he initially 
queried on 3 August 2022 what hed seen on line, he seemed surprised that two policies 
were shown. He wanted to know if they were connected and if hed been moved from one to 
the other without agreeing or being informed. And, in his email of 8 August 2022, he said he 
was confused to find he had two policies and he queried what the Group AVC was. I further 
note that hes said he made a single lump sum AVC payment in 1997 and no further 
contributions since, which would be consistent with having only one AVC policy.  
Ive seen that the investigator has tried to explain why he accepts what Scottish Widows 
says. Im not sure I can add much to what the investigator has already said. 
I think Scottish Widows letter of 18 July 2023, if a bit late in the day, is helpful. It explains 
that the scheme number for the original AVC arrangement was Z*****00/YP****41A. I think 
thats made up of the scheme number and Mr Ps member ID. In 2003 the scheme trustees 
transferred to a different AVC scheme. The number of the new AVC scheme was P*****14. 
Mr P holds policy number *****73 with that new scheme and the value was £8,338.99. 
I think that letter did tell Mr P what he needed to know. Technically I dont think the scheme 
has any trustees  its a public sector scheme with a scheme administrator who administers 
the scheme on behalf of the scheme manager. So references to the trustees should really be 
to the scheme administrator/manager. But that doesnt change anything. I just wanted to be 
clear as to the terminology. 
Theres an AVC arrangement with Scottish Widows to allow members to boost their 
retirement provision. Decisions about how the main scheme and the AVC arrangement 
operate are made by the scheme administrator/manager. Scottish Widows is just the 
provider of the AVC scheme  that is the insurance company selected to provide and 
operate the AVC scheme. Or rather the AVC schemes  the original AVC scheme and the 
new one set up in 2003. 
I dont know why the scheme administrator/manager decided to change the AVC 
arrangements in 2003. I think there was also a change of name then  instead of being 
called Civil Service AVC scheme, the new AVC arrangement is referred to as Group AVC. If 
Mr P wants to know more about the changes that were made hell need to contact the 
scheme administrator. As Scottish Widows has pointed out, it was up to the scheme 
administrators to tell members about any changes to the AVC arrangements and notify those 
members who held AVCs as to what would happen to their contributions. So Id have 
thought Mr P wouldve received some information from the scheme administrator in or 
around 2003.
I think Mr P accepts that but he also considers that Scottish Widows shouldve written to 
members of the existing AVC scheme and explained the new arrangements, including that 
their AVC funds would be transferred to the new AVC scheme. I think thats a fair point. As a 
policyholder Mr P would expect to be notified of any changes to his policy even if he had no option but to accept them. But the changes were some 20 years ago and not all the records 
may have survived. And, even if there was some failing many years ago, I dont think that 
would change the outcome of the complaint and my view as to how many active AVC 
policies Mr P has with Scottish Widows.  
  
I think the information which Scottish Widows has provided, albeit somewhat belatedly, 
makes sense and explained whats gone on with Mr Ps AVC policy  essentially that the 
original AVC arrangement was replaced in 2003 with a new one and Mr Ps policy 
transferred across. Scottish Widows has also provided a screenshot showing Mr Ps policy 
number *****73 labelled as an AVC plan with an inception date of 1 April 2003 with an 
Inforce status. 
The upshot is that Im satisfied that what Mr P saw online in August 2022 was wrong, as was 
any other information he received which mightve suggested he had two active AVC policies. 
I think Scottish Widows has now amended Mr Ps online details so that only one AVC policy 
is shown. Thats assuming Mr P can see his policy online  as Ive noted above, he says 
hes been told AVC policies now cant be viewed. I dont know if that was temporary or 
permanent but, in any event and as Ive said, I cant tell Scottish Widows what information it 
makes available to policyholders online. 
As to how Scottish Widows dealt with things after Mr P had raised a query, I think the 
information provided before 18 July 2023 couldve been clearer. I think Scottish Widows 
accepts that and that there was a failure to address Mr Ps queries. Scottish Widows also 
acknowledges that its final response letter dated 16 February 2023 couldve been clearer 
and that the reference to P*******14 as a policy number when its in fact the scheme number 
wouldve been unhelpful and confusing. 
Further I think it was potentially confusing that the letter referred, several times, to Mr Ps 
second policy when the whole issue was whether he did in fact have two policies and when 
the letter didnt deal with that  just the service Mr P had received. The letter also said 
Scottish Widows had written to Mr P on 20 January 2023 and set out what that letter had 
said. I think Scottish Widows may have been referring to its letter of 31 January 2023. I dont 
think weve seen a letter dated 20 January 2023 and the text of the letter of 31 January 2023 
was as set out in the final response letter. All in all, I think Scottish Widows final response 
letter was deficient in several respects.   
I think there were also some issues with Scottish Widows letter of 31 January 2023. It 
quoted the correct plan and scheme numbers (*****73 and P*******14 respectively) but it 
referred to the Civil Service AVC scheme (which was the name of the former AVC 
arrangement) and said it had commenced on 30 October 2000 rather than 1 April 2003. I 
think these were further errors. But the letter was superseded by Scottish Widows letter of 
18 July 2023 which, in my view, did set out the position correctly.  
Ive already referred to Scottish Widows delays and failure to deal with Mr Ps queries. To a 
certain extent Scottish Widows recognised that its service had been poor and sent a cheque 
for £100 to Mr P. Like the investigator I dont think that was sufficient compensation, taking 
into account the length of the delays and the number of times Mr P had to chase for replies. I 
can understand that will have caused Mr P distress and inconvenience. Its very frustrating 
and time consuming for a customer to have to keep chasing for responses which, when 
eventually received, dont really deal with the queries raised. I also recognise that Mr Ps 
health conditions make it difficult for him to read and reply to emails and doing so is a 
lengthy and tiring process for him. But, taking all that into consideration, I still think the £200 
suggested by the investigator, and which Scottish Widows has agreed to pay, is fair and 
reasonable. I assume the cheque for £100 which Scottish Widows sent and which Mr P 
didnt cash is now out of date so the full £200 is payable.My final decision
I uphold the complaint in part. Scottish Widows Limited must pay £200 as compensation for 
the distress and inconvenience Mr P has suffered in consequence of Scottish Widows 
Limiteds poor customer service. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2023.
