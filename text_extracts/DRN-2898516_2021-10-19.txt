The complaint
Mr P has complained that after National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) upheld a 
complaint he had made about mis-selling him a packaged bank account, called an 
Advantage Gold account, it kept the account open for around six years and continued to 
charge him a monthly fee for it. He thinks it should have switched him to fee-free account 
and stopped the monthly fees. He wants NatWest to refund these fees to him and add 
interest. 
What happened
Mr P has banked with NatWest for quite a long time. NatWest has told us that its records 
show that his account history is as follows:
in 1997,  he opened  a fee-free  account,  initially  as a student,  
 
in August  2006,  it sold him an Advantage  Gold  account,  which  replaced  his fee-
free account  and for which  it charged  a monthly  fee, 
in September  2007,  Mr P went  back  to a fee-free  account,
in January  2011,  NatWest  sold Mr P a second  Advantage  Gold  account,  which  
again  replaced  his fee-free  account  and for which  it again  charged  a monthly  
fee,
in June 2015, NatWest switched Mr P to another packaged account, called a Select 
Platinum account.
(The switch to the Select Platinum account in 2015 was the result of a commercial 
decision NatWest made to change the range of accounts it offered to its customers. 
For simplicity, I have used the single name Advantage Gold in the rest of this 
decision).
I believe that NatWests records of Mr Ps account history are probably reliable, and I have 
taken them to be accurate. 
During 2015, Mr P complained directly to NatWest that it had mis-sold him both Advantage 
Gold accounts. I have seen a copy of the reply NatWest sent to Mr P in July of that year and 
it appears that NatWest disagreed about the first occasion, but accepted it had mis-sold him 
the second Advantage Gold account. It refunded him the fees he had paid for the second 
Advantage Gold account upto that time and added interest. There is no current dispute 
about this. 
However, NatWest did not close the Advantage Gold account in July 2015. It kept the 
account open and continued to charge Mr P the monthly fees. Mr P thinks this was wrong. 
NatWest thinks it behaved correctly. 
One of our adjudicators has already looked into Mr Ps complaint and thought that NatWest 
had behaved reasonably. The adjudicator didnt recommend that NatWest should give Mr P 
any money back. Mr P didnt agree with the adjudicators findings and asked for an 
ombudsman to review his case. So, it has come to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about packaged bank accounts on our website, 
and Ive used this approach to help me to decide what to do about this case. Ive looked into 
everything that Mr P and NatWest have told us or sent us about the complaint, and Ive 
decided not to uphold it. Ive explained why below.
Mr P has told us that NatWest should have known that he wanted to switch to a fee-free 
account in July 2015. Hes asked why (he) would want to continue paying for a bank 
account (he) didnt use and was mis-sold in the first place. Hes also said that he 
remembers a phone call with NatWest in 2015 during which he says it told him it had 
switched him to a fee-free account, and that he didnt find out it hadnt until 2021. 
Firstly, I would not expect a bank to automatically change a customers account without that 
customers instruction; or without the customers consent if the bank was proposing a 
change, even after it had upheld a mis-sale complaint. This is because customers 
circumstances can change and they can come to rely on some of the benefits, particularly 
some types of insurance, which some accounts provide. However, I would have expected 
NatWest to let Mr P know what was happening and to give him reasonable choices. 
The letter which NatWest sent to Mr P in July 2015 told him how much compensation it 
would pay him and said: 
Please be advised that your account is still a packaged account and packaged fees 
will continue to debit if you choose not to convert to a fee-free account. The next 
packaged fee is due to debit on 31 July 2015.
I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome you for a personal review of your 
account in one of our branches so that we can discuss our range of account options 
with you. If a branch visit is inconvenient, please be advised of our sales Team 
Number; 0800 xxx xxxx, (opening hours Monday - Friday 8-8, Saturday 9-6, Sunday 
Closed) which will also allow you to speak to one of our banking advisors over the 
telephone and they will be able to review and change your account 
I think this letter explained that NatWest would keep Mr Ps Advantage Gold account open 
and keep charging him the monthly fees, until he asked it to change, and also gave him fair 
options to switch accounts. 
Mr P has told us that he doesnt remember receiving the letter. However, it seems to have 
been correctly addressed and I think its likely that NatWest sent it. NatWest has told us that 
it has a record of a phone call from Mr P during which he asked for an update on progress 
with his complaint but has no record of it saying it had switched him to a fee-free account. 
After so long has passed, I cant tell for sure what phone calls took place and what may have 
been said or not said, but I doubt that NatWest would have told Mr P it had changed his 
account in the way he has described. This would not have been in line with its usual practice (as set out in its letter) and I havent seen convincing evidence to show me that it changed 
its normal practice for Mr P.
NatWest has also told us that it sent further emails and letters to Mr P about the Advantage 
Gold account which told him he was still paying fees and described how he could change his 
account if he so wished. Mr P has mentioned that the emails may have gone into his junk 
mailbox (hes sent us some examples) and told us that he didnt receive any written 
correspondence from NatWest after 2017. Hes referred to a return to branch block on his 
post. NatWest has accepted that there was a block during at least part of this period, but that 
some paper correspondence was delivered after 2017. It has also told us that it has now 
removed the block. 
Even if some of NatWest correspondence, paper or electronic, went astray after 2017, it 
seems to me that the crux of this part of Mr Ps complaint is whether it told him what was 
happening in July 2015 and gave him appropriate choices; and as Ive already found that it 
did this, I think it was reasonable for it to keep his Advantage Gold account open and 
continue to charge him the monthly fees. 
Mr P has also made two other separate points. Hes told us that when he made his current 
complaint in February 2021, he asked NatWest to switch him to a fee-free account, but it 
failed to do so; and that it took too long to send him a new debit card. 
With respect to the first point, NatWest has told us that after Mr Ps request, it waived any 
remaining fees and that he now has a fee-free account. With respect to the second, it has 
said that it accepted there was a delay with the debit card, sent Mr P a new one, and paid 
him Â£100 as an apology. I cant tell if what NatWest has said to us is correct, but if it is, then I 
dont think Mr P lost out and NatWest seems to have treated him fairly. If Mr P thinks that 
what NatWest has said is incorrect, then he is free to raise it further with NatWest if he so 
wishes. But I cant advise him about this. Nor will I speculate on how NatWest may respond, 
or if any subsequent case he may wish to bring to us will fall inside or outside the rules and 
time limits which govern the cases we can consider. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have set out above, I am not upholding Mr Ps complaint about National 
Westminster Bank Plc. I am not going to tell it to give him any money back. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2021.
