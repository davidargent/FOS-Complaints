Mr B complains that a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement with 
Moneybarn No. 1 Limited  wasnt  of satisfactory  quality.
background 
A used  car was supplied to Mr B under  a conditional  sale agreement with Moneybarn that he 
electronically signed in November 2017. He complained to Moneybarn  in January 2018  that 
the engine management warning light was on. It arranged for the car to be inspected by an 
independent expert  and said that he could reject the car. But Mr B said that he wanted  the 
car to be repaired by a manufacturer  approved garage.  That didnt happen so he complained 
to this service.
The investigator recommended  that this complaint should be upheld.  He felt that rejecting 
the car would still be the fairest outcome as hed not seen any evidence  that the faults were 
repaired and that the car had since developed new faults. And he said that Mr B had now 
bought another car. So he recommended that Moneybarn should collect the car, cancel the 
agreement, refund Mr Bs hire car costs of £288.64  and reimburse him for the £160  cost of 
the diagnostic  test.
Moneybarn has asked  for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. It says,  in 
summary, that Mr B told the dealer that hed paid for the car to be repaired and that it has no 
evidence to suggest that there remain any issues with the car so it doesnt consider a 
rejection to be an appropriate  resolution.  It says that Mr B was in possession  of the car from 
November 2017  to July 2019 - when he voluntarily terminated  the agreement  - but that the 
last payment received from him was in May 2018. It says that the car passed MOT tests in 
August 2018 and 2019 but that there was extensive  damage to the car when it was returned 
in July 2019 and its applied a charge  of £589.89 to his account for that damage.  And it says 
that the outstanding balance on his account is £4,668.24.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr B 
and to Moneybarn  on 22 November 2019. In my provisional decision I said as follows:
Moneybarn, as the supplier of the car, was responsible  for ensuring that the car was 
of satisfactory quality. That will depend on a number of factors,  including  the age, 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it. The car that was supplied to 
Mr B was about eight  years old, had been  driven for more  than 60,000 miles and had 
a price of £5,990. Satisfactory quality also covers durability which means  that the 
components within the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  
but exactly how long that time is will depend on a number of factors.  
Mr B complained about the cars engine management warning light being on soon 
after the car was supplied  to him. Moneybarn  arranged  for the car to be inspected by 
an independent expert in March 2018. The inspection report concluded:
After inspection and road test of the above vehicle we would confirm that the 
engine did misfire from cold, the handbrake has excess travel  and is 
inefficient and a noise was noted from the nearside front suspension,  all of 
Ref: DRN56340242which would warrant investigation.  The "door open" warning light also flashed 
on several occasions, which again  would  warrant investigation.
Moneybarn said that Mr B could return the car because of those  faults but he said 
that he wanted the car to be repaired by a manufacturer approved  garage. He says 
that the car broke-down in May 2018 and had to be recovered to a garage and that 
he paid £160 for diagnostic  testing.  Mr B says that he stopped  using the car then and 
Moneybarn says that its received no payments under the agreement from Mr B since 
then.
Mr B says that he arranged for the car to be repaired in October 2018 but said in 
November 2018  that the car was losing power constantly with traction control on. He 
says that he paid £240 for the repair but hes not been able to provide any receipts or 
other detailed evidence about the repairs that were  undertaken or about  the further 
faults with the car. And he says that hes incurred taxi and car hire costs of £640  
because he was unable  to use the car. Hes provided evidence to show  that he 
incurred some of those costs  but he hasnt provided enough  evidence  to persuade 
me that it would be fair or reasonable  in these circumstances for me to require  
Moneybarn to refund those repair  or car hire costs to him.
The car passed an MOT  test in August 2018 when its mileage was recorded  as being 
65,135 miles. Moneybarn  says that Mr B voluntarily terminated the agreement in 
July 2019 and returned the car when its mileage was 70,478  miles.  The car passed  
an MOT in August 2019 when its mileage was recorded as 70,538.  
Moneybarn says that there was extensive damage to the car when it was returned by 
Mr B in July 2019  and its applied a charge of £589.89 to his account for that 
damage. And it says that the outstanding balance on his account  is £4,668.24.
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show that Moneybarn has acted 
unfairly or unreasonably in these circumstances.  There  was a fault with the car and 
Moneybarn said that Mr B could return the car. But he said that he wanted it to be 
repaired. Mr B has had the car repaired and has used it to drive about  10,000  
miles(including more than 5,000  miles between August 2018 and July 2019) but 
hasnt made  any payments under  the agreement since May 2018. The car passed 
MOT tests in August 2018 and 2019 so mustve been in a roadworthy condition at 
those times   and the August 2018  MOT test was about five months after the date of 
the independent inspection. 
Mr B voluntarily terminated the conditional  sale agreement in July 2019 but the 
inspection report shows that there  was considerable damage to the car. So I consider 
that its fair and reasonable for Moneybarn to seek  repayment  from Mr B of the 
outstanding balance on his account  (to the extent that its legally entitled to do so). 
But I find that it would be fair and reasonable for it to reduce that balance by the £160 
that he paid for the diagnostic report. 
So subject to any further representations by Mr B or Moneybarn, my provisional decision 
was that I was minded to uphold this complaint  in part.
Moneybarn has accepted my provisional  decision and Mr B says that theres a lot of 
inaccurate information about the compliant  but hes not going to bother contesting  it. He 
says that he hasnt driven the car for over 10,000  miles and the mileage data when he got 
Ref: DRN56340243the car didnt  match  up with what was stamped in the service  book. He says that the cars 
faulty, its been out of his possession for weeks at a time and its not fair that he has to pay 
all that money and walk away with no car.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Mr B says that he hasnt  driven the car for over 10,000 miles. I said that hed used it to drive 
about 10,000 miles (including more than 5,000  miles  between  August 2018 and July 2019). 
The conditional sale agreement  shows that the cars mileage when it was supplied to Mr B in 
November 2017  was 60,883 miles (and he electronically signed the agreement to say that 
he wanted to be legally  bound by it). And Moneybarn says that the cars mileage when it was 
returned in July 2019 was 70,478  miles. Thats 9,595 miles more  than the mileage shown on 
the agreement  and I consider that its reasonable to round that up to about 10,000 miles. 
Mr B hasnt complained  to this service about  an issue with the cars mileage before now and 
the mileage shown on the agreement is consistent  with the mileage  shown on the MOT  test 
data for the car. 
I can understand Mr Bs frustration about  the faults with the car and that he has to pay a lot 
of money for a car that hes now returned. But he used the car to drive about  10,000  miles 
between November 2017 and July 2019 but he stopped making payments for the car in 
May 2018 and he returned the car to Moneybarn with extensive damage. So Im not 
persuaded that that I should  change my provisional decision. 
my decision
For the reasons  set out above, my decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint in part. And I 
order Moneybarn No. 1 Limited to reduce  the outstanding balance on Mr Bs account  by 
£160.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 January 2020.
