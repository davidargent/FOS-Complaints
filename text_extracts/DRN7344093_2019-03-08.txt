K820x#14complaint
Ms F complains of her treatment by her lender  Elderbridge  Limited, its lack of 
communication between  colleagues and the addition  to her debt of solicitors and court  fees 
which could have been avoided if Elderbridge had actually replied to an offer shed made.
background
Ms F has a secured loan agreement with Elderbridge. There  have been  payment arrears for 
some time and in January  2010 Elderbridge obtained  a county court  possession  order. If not 
enforced these  orders expire, and then the lender then has to get permission from the court 
to enforce them. Elderbridge applied for permission on 10 January 2018. The judge 
postponed the hearing to allow Ms F to put forward clear  proposals for clearing the arrears. 
The new hearing  date was 7 March 2018.
Ms F accordingly  wrote  to Elderbridge on 12 February. She said:
With reference to the outstanding amount on the account and the total now paid by return  
after my January payment of £600.00,  the amount repaid stands  at £49,750.00. I would like 
to request a new monthly payment schedule and have discussed  the arrears  with family 
members and this new payment is to come from increased rent. I would like to offer a new 
monthly payment  of £550 per month.  This would cover the full contractual monthly payment 
of £489.19 plus an extra £61.00 towards the arrears.  I still have a heritance  pending  and 
would like to request you consider withholding further interest  and charges and allow nine 
months to a year before this payment  schedule  is reviewed  again.
I request you contact me within ten days of the date on this letter and would hope we can 
arrive at an agreement without a further  court hearing.
Elderbridge didnt reply  so Ms F phoned  it on 6 March, the day before the hearing. 
Elderbridge said it hadnt received the letter.  But Ms F had proof of postage  and had tracked 
the letter. It had been received and signed  for on 17 February. 
The hearing on 7 March went ahead with both parties represented. The Judge  wasnt  
satisfied that permission to enforce should be given. He postponed the hearing and said he 
expected Elderbridge to provide information about a payment protection  premium and why it 
wasnt activated to protect  the loan repayments.  On 12 March Elderbridge wrote to Ms F 
accepting her offer to pay £550 per month  until 4 March 2019.
Ms F complained to Elderbridge. It replied on 19 April:
Our records show we received your letter on 17 February 2018 but it was not correctly  
attached to your account. As a result, the consideration of the payment  offer made had been 
delayed. Were pleased to see however that the increase in monthly payments offered has 
since been accepted and a payment  schedule agreed as requested  for 12 months.
Please accept our sincere apologies for any distress and inconvenience caused as this is 
not the level of service  we aim to provide. In recognition of the delay you experienced and 
the service you have received weve arranged for a cheque for £50.00  to be sent, which  will 
follow shortly.
Ref: DRN73440932You told us youd hoped to be able to reach an agreement  with us without having  to go to 
court and feel we shouldnt  have added legal fees whilst your complaint was being 
investigated. We can confirm that the proposal  to increase the monthly  instalments wouldnt 
have been sufficient to halt the planned  hearing,  as discussed on 6 March  2018. We 
explained during this conversation, that even if permission to enforce the possession order 
was granted, we'd allow 7 days to review  before deciding whether or not to set an eviction 
date. We are satisfied the legal fees have been  correctly applied, in line with the terms and 
conditions of your credit  agreement.
Elderbridge debited its solicitors fees to the loan account in accordance  with the terms and 
conditions which say: You shall indemnify us against all reasonable legal and other costs 
and expenses incurred  by us in attempting to obtain  repayment.  Elderbridge debited £400  
on 14 March and £240 on 22 May.
Ms F wasnt happy about this and made a further  complaint to Elderbridge by letter dated 
15 June. She felt that had a response  been made to her letter, the second court  hearing  
wouldnt have been necessary. Therefore she shouldnt be expected  to pay the costs. On 
the same  day she also initiated a complaint  to this service.
Elderbridge replied to her complaint on 18 July. It said:
We can see that the letter was not acted upon initially, and we apologise for this oversight. 
This generated the £240.00  legal fee as the hearing  went ahead  on 7 March  2018. This fee 
is broken down into two parts, £84.00 for the solicitors attendance to court  and £156.00 to 
oppose the hearing.
Under the circumstances  we are able to waive the £84.00 attendance fee, however, 
regardless of whether we had acted  upon the proposal in time, as no payment arrangement 
had been granted at that point, the £156.00 fee to oppose  the hearing  would  still have been  
payable.
After further investigation, we can also see that another legal fee of £156.00 has been  
applied to the account on 11 July 2018.  This is in relation to the court hearing being 
adjourned in March and rescheduled, as decided by the courts,  for 2 May 2018.
If the hearing on 7 March  had not taken  place, the hearing for 2 May would not have been 
scheduled by the courts and the £156.00 to oppose the May hearing would not have been  
charged. Therefore, we are also waiving this charge on the account.
To summarise, we are able to uphold your complaint  and the total to be waived  is £240.00. 
This amount will be removed from the balance of your loan.
On 7 September Elderbridge responded to Ms Fs complaint to this service:
a complaint was registered as Ms F was unhappy that we had not responded to her 
correspondence, as her proposed repayment was to prevent the court action the following 
day. She was disappointed to be advised  that we would need  a copy  of her bank to verify  the 
increased proposal repayment  of £550.00 was affordable to her. She was concerned  there 
was not sufficient time for her to obtain  this, and provide this to us before the hearing the 
following day. The executive put the call on hold to take advice, on returning to the call he 
advised the hearing for the following day was for permission to enforce on a repossession 
order that was previously granted that was 6 years  old. He explained  that by obtaining  this, it 
Ref: DRN73440933did not mean we would go ahead  with the repossession as we can still consider the 
proposed payment offered  by Ms F. The executive  advised a complaint had been recorded  
and that we would try and trace her letter. He reiterated even if he had located her letter,  the 
likelihood was that the court hearing would still go ahead, as we had not received  the 
documentation that we asked for in January 2018. We still required evidence  to confirm the 
proposed repayment  was affordable and that we needed to establish the right course of 
action.
.
Our final response letter dated  18 July 2018 informed Ms F that £240.00 legal fees were 
debited to the account on 22 May 2018 in respect  of the court hearing scheduled for 
7 March 2018. This payment broken down  represents  solicitor's attendance costs  of £84.00 
and court hearing costs of £156.00. This letter also advised a further charge of £156.00 had 
been incurred  in respect of the rescheduled hearing  on 2 May 2017. The case-handler 
agreed to reverse the charge of £84 in respect of the hearing  on 7 March  2018 together with 
the fee of £156 in respect of the hearing  on 2 May 2018.
.
The arrears  in February exceeded £40,000,  therefore the court  hearing scheduled for the 
7 March 2018 would have  gone ahead even if we had formally agreed a repayment  plan.
Our adjudicator recommended  Ms Fs complaint be upheld. He thought the £156 hearing fee 
should also be refunded. Ms Fs letter was sent in time, and sent securely to ensure  it was 
received in time, to enable her proposals to be considered  and accepted. He said accepted 
as this proposal was the proposal  that was accepted and she was paying until March 2019. 
If it hadnt been accepted  and wasnt sufficient he wouldnt be making this recommendation. 
But because it was he couldnt see any logic in saying the hearing was required.
Elderbridge had paid Ms F £50 compensation for the trouble and upset caused. The 
adjudicator thought £150 would be more appropriate, as she then had to attend the hearing 
taking time away from work  and have the stress of it all. So he thought she should  also be 
paid £100 more.
Elderbridge didnt agree. It said that at the time of receiving Ms F's letter of 12 February  it 
had still not received documentation requested in its letter of 19 January.  Ms F had made 
three payments totalling £600.00 in January  & February 2018, however  this proposal hadnt 
been formally agreed and there were no guarantees this payment could be sustained due to 
no supporting evidence being submitted. The arrears in February exceeded £40,000.00 
therefore the court hearing scheduled  for 7 March would have gone  ahead even if 
Elderbridge had formally  agreed a repayment  plan.
Ms F responded that her January/February 2018  payments had totalled £1,150 not £600.  
She had sent several letters in response to the letter of 19 January and received no reply.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Three debits were  made:
Ref: DRN7344093414 March £400
22 May £240
11 July £156
Elderbridge refunded £240 on 16 August. This comprised  £84 of the 22 May charge and the 
11 July charge of £156. The 14 March charge hasnt been disputed. So what  remains  in 
dispute is the other £156 of the 22 May charge.
Elderbridges reason  for not refunding this is explained in its letter  of 18 July and its 
submission to this service. The first says:
regardless of whether  we had acted upon  the proposal in time, as no payment arrangement 
had been granted at that point, the £156.00 fee to oppose  the hearing  would  still have been  
payable.
And the second  says:
This payment broken  down represents  solicitors attendance costs of £84.00  and court 
hearing costs of £156.00.
Even ignoring the fact that at the hearing on 7 March Elderbridge was making an application  
to the court  (for permission to enforce) not opposing  one, I dont see the logic of this. It 
seems to me that either it is fair and reasonable to debit  fees for the 7 March hearing or it 
isnt. Theres no logical  distinction between advocacy costs  and court  hearing costs.  
So the point remains  that if Elderbridge had accepted the offer of £550 before  7 March 
instead of on 12 March, the 7 March hearing  could have  been cancelled and the court  
hearing costs avoided. There was no longer any need (unless the arrangement  later failed)  
for permission to enforce the 2010  possession order.
It may be that on 6 March  Elderbridge still awaited  the documentation  requested  in its letter  
of 19 January, but theres no reason to suppose this wouldnt have been supplied,  and 
affordability dealt with, if Elderbridge had replied to Ms Fs letter  of 12 February.
Looking at the statement, Ms Fs January/February 2018 payments were  £1,100  with £50 
received on 1 March.  
For these reasons I agree with our adjudicator  that the additional £156 should also be 
refunded and that £150 (less the £50 paid) would be more  appropriate for the trouble  and 
upset caused.   
Ms F also complains of lack of communication between colleagues at Elderbridge. I think 
she means that when  she rang and spoke to an adviser, he or she wasnt familiar with the 
case despite previous  discussions. But Im afraid thats in the nature of call centres.  Notes  of 
previous calls will be available on screen but allocating a particular adviser  to each customer  
would be uneconomic and I dont consider Elderbridge  to have been at fault in this respect.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and order Elderbridge  Limited to pay Ms F £156 
and £100 compensation  for distress  and inconvenience.
Ref: DRN73440935Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 April 2019.
