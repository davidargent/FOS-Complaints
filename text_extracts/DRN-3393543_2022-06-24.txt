The complaint
A partnership, which Ill refer to as K, is unhappy with several aspects of the service it 
received from National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) surrounding the transferal of its 
business relationship by NatWest to NatWests Global Restructuring Group (GRG).
What happened
In 2007, K invested in a commercial property and obtained a loan and overdraft from 
NatWest to enable them to do so, with NatWest gaining security on the loan via a first 
charge interest in the commercial property.
Unfortunately, by 2009, K were struggling to service the borrowing, and although it was party 
restructured, NatWest called various events of default. K offered proposals to enable the 
project to continue, but in January 2013 NatWest appointed receivers to sell the property, 
with the property then being sold by the receivers in April 2014.
K made a number of complaints about how it was treated by NatWest; that the bank was 
unreasonable in refusing to continue its loan and forced the sale of the property at an 
undervalued price through the receivers; that the bank miscalculated the redemption figure 
and unfairly declined a settlement offer made by K; that the bank was unreasonable in 
transferring Ks business relationship to the GRG and failed to communicate the reason for 
the transfer to K.
NatWest looked at Ks complaint. But it didnt feel that it had acted unfairly towards K in how 
it had transferred Ks relationship to GRG or in how it had managed the ongoing situation 
following that transfer. So, it didnt uphold Ks complaint.
K wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so it appealed its complaint to an Independent 
Third Party (ITP). The ITP looked at Ks complaint. But it didnt feel that NatWest had acted 
unfairly towards K, and so it also didnt uphold K complaint.
K wasnt happy with the ITPs findings, so it referred its complaint to this service. One of our 
investigators looked at this complaint. But they also didnt feel that NatWest had acted 
unreasonably in how it had managed the situation surrounding Ks borrowing, so they also 
didnt uphold Ks complaint.
K remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so its notable that K and its representative have made several detailed 
submissions to this service. Id like to thank K for these submissions, and I hope it doesnt 
consider it a discourtesy that I wont be responding in similar detail here. Instead, Ill be 
focussing on what I feel are the key elements of this complaint, in line with this services role 
as an informal dispute resolution service.
As such, if K notices that I havent responded to a specific point that its raised, it shouldnt 
be taken from this that I havent read and considered that specific point. Rather, it should be 
taken that I have read and considered that point, but that I dont feel it necessary to address 
that point directly here, in order to arrive at what I feel is a fair outcome to this complaint.
I can appreciate how K would be disappointed that the commercial property project that they 
engaged in wasnt able to be completed as they intended, and I note that following complaint 
points that K have raised.
NatWest was unreasonable in transferring Ks relationship to GRG and failed to 
communicate the reason for the transfer to K.
NatWest was unreasonable in refusing to continue the loan and forced the sale of the 
property at an undervalued rate through the receivers.
NatWest has overcharged and exaggerated the debts, which they since confirmed 
was a mistake and apologised for. If NatWest had accounted properly the total debt 
was less that £550,000.
NatWest refused an offer from K in June 2013 for £550,000 and went on to sell the 
property at the lower rate of £380,000. This was a breach of duty of care on 
NatWests behalf by not accepting the offer of £550,000.
The actions of NatWest construed Unlawful Collateral Advantage. NatWest 
unlawfully prevented K from its equitable right of redeeming its property due to 
obstacles that NatWest unjustly created that are void.
NatWest severed its relationship with K and refused to carry our any further business 
with K. This included NatWest failing to provide K with a full record of statements 
prior to January 2013.
K have also complained that NatWest allowed the purchasers of the property obtain a loan 
with them using a higher valuation on the property than they purchased it for from the 
receivers. However, the purchasers of the property arent a party to this complaint, and as 
such this complaint point sits outside the remit of what Im to consider.
I will now consider each of the eligible complaint points listed above in turn.
NatWest was unreasonable in transferring Ks relationship to GRG and failed to 
communicate the reason for the transfer to K.
This service isnt a regulatory body, and so it isnt within our remit to instruct a business on 
how it should administer and maintain a business relationship. Indeed, its the position of this 
service that such choices are commercial decisions which a business is generally entitled to 
make. However, this service can consider whether the choices made by a business in this 
regard have been applied reasonably and whether they can be considered to have led to 
unfair outcomes.
In this instance, NatWest transferred Ks business relationship to GRG in August 2009, and 
its evident that it made this decision because of concerns over the position of Ks facilities at 
that time. These concerns included the condition of Ks overdraft as well returned loan 
payments. Its also notable that NatWest felt that K were reluctant to provide financial 
information that NatWest had asked them for, and had grown concerned about Ks ability to repay the money that it owed.
This seems reasonable to me, and its notable that a letter from NatWest to K dated, 9 July 
2009, explained to K that NatWest had concerns with how K was maintaining its borrowing 
and asked K to arrange a meeting with NatWest which would be attended by representatives 
from GRG.
This meeting subsequently took place, and on 13 August 2009, NatWest wrote to K as 
follows:
I write further to our meeting on 4 August 2009. Thank you for taking the time to 
discuss the current situation regarding the above companies with [GRG]and myself
As explained, the Global Restructuring Group (GRG) manages relationships that no 
longer sit within the normal Bank lending criteria. The Banks concerns with the 
following issues comprise the primary reasons behind the transfer to GRG:
 Numerous excesses on [Ks] Account.
 Uncertainty of the cashflows of the overall business
This letter was acknowledged by K on 2 September 2009. As such, Im satisfied that 
NatWest did hold reasonable concerns over the ongoing position of K as described above, 
and that these concerns did provide fair cause for NatWest to consider transferring Ks 
business relationship to GRG, which it ultimately did.
Additionally, Im also satisfied that NatWest undertook a fair and informative process which 
engaged K and communicated the reasons for the transfer to GRG to K. And it follows from 
this that I wont be upholding this aspect of Ks complaint.
NatWest was unreasonable in refusing to continue the loan and forced the sale of the 
property at an undervalued rate through the receivers.
The borrowing facilities provided by NatWest to K in 2007 were a loan of £452,000 with a 25-
year term and an overdraft facility of £50,000.
In July 2009, K was having problems maintaining both the overdraft and loan facilities, with 
the overdraft having a hardcore balance and scheduled loan repayments being received late 
by NatWest.
In January 2011, with issues with the overdraft facility continuing, NatWest switched the 
hardcore overdraft into a two-year £50,000 loan. By this time, the loan was also in arrears, 
with K having missed two scheduled monthly repayments. By June 2011, K had missed five 
of the seven previous monthly loan repayments, putting the loan in a position of default. And 
by October 2011, K was also in default on the newly approved two-year loan.
On 3 October 2011, NatWest wrote to K as follows:
The Bank cannot allow the position to remain as it currently stands with regards to
the persistent failures to make the necessary capital and interest repayments in a 
timely manner  it is essential we agree to a deal on debt terms by 29th October 
2011
Noncompliance  would mean that I will need to consider passing your file on to our 
Recoveries department who will appoint the Banks lawyers to enforce the Banks 
security.NatWests position here doesnt seem unreasonable to me. K had missed a number of 
scheduled loan repayments having previously utilised the overdraft facility in a manner in 
which it wasnt intended to be used.
Subsequently, the position of Ks facilities remained in default throughout 2012. And while K 
did make promises to bring the facilities up to date and made several suggestions as to how 
this might be achieved, none of those suggestions were acceptable to NatWest, who 
ultimately appointed receivers to sell the property so as recover its security position.
Im aware that K feel that it made reasonable proposals to NatWest in the first half of 2013 
as to how it could bring its facilities back into an acceptable position such that the project 
could continue. However, none of these proposals were acceptable to NatWest, and its 
evident from communication within NatWest at that time that NatWest didnt feel that K 
would be able to honour the proposals that it was making at that time.
It's also notable that at the time that NatWest instructed the receivers to sell the property, 
they had already provided what I feel was a more than reasonable amount of forbearance to 
K. And I say this because at that time Ks facilities had been in a position of default for 
approximately a year and a half, despite K making a number of offers to bring the facilities 
back into line which hadnt subsequently taken place.
All of which means that, considering the circumstances that occurred here, Im satisfied that 
NatWest didnt act unfairly towards K in how it managed the situation around Ks facilities 
falling into positions of default, including in how NatWest ultimately instructed the sale of the 
property. And it follows from this that I wont be upholding this aspect of Ks complaint.
NatWest has overcharged and exaggerated the debts, which they since confirmed was a 
mistake and apologised for. If NatWest had accounted properly the total debt was less that 
£550,000.
And
NatWest refused an offer from K in June 2013 for £550,000 and went on to sell the property 
at the lower rate of £380,000. This was a breach of duty of care on NatWests behalf by not 
accepting the offer of £550,000.
Following the transfer of the relationship to GRG, K consistently disputed with NatWest what 
the correct redemption figure for its borrowing facilities should be. And NatWest have since 
accepted that it did make errors in regard to the total balance it deemed outstanding, and 
that it then compounded those errors with further mistakes.
For instance, NatWest accept that it overcharged an amount of £28,309.43 during 2012 and 
2013 and which it has since deducted from the balance owed by K. Additionally, NatWest 
also reimbursed an amount of £4,278.20 to K as part of the Automatic Refund of Complex 
Fees settlement, and also provided a Business PPI refund of £5,173.23 in 2019. These three 
reimbursements total £37,760.86.
In 2019, NatWest accepted after recalculation that Ks total outstanding debt as of January 
2013 had been £525,000  excluding receivers and other fees that NatWest had accrued up 
until the time the property was sold by the receivers. Additionally, if the £37,760.86 of 
various overcharged amounts described above is also taken from this balance, then the 
balance of Ks facilities at that time reduces further, to approximately £487,250.
K feels that this is significant, given that following the receipt in June 2013 of a formal demand letter from NatWest for (the now acknowledged to be incorrect) amount of 
£560,150.90, K made an offer to pay £550,000 to NatWest, having secured finance from a 
third-party lender, which K maintains NatWest declined.
This service hasnt been provided by K of a copy of the third-party refinance offer for 
£550,000 that K refer to here. Instead, this service has been provided by K a lower offer of 
refinance from the third-party amounting to £455,000. 
Additionally, NatWest also claim to have never received or seen the offer of refinancing for 
£550,000, which NatWest state wasnt included as an attachment in any of the 
correspondence that they received from K which referenced that offer. 
However, while its now acknowledged that the total amount the K owed was less than the 
£550,000 that they offered to NatWest, it remains that case that neither NatWest or this 
service have seen a corroborating offer of refinance that would have enabled K to have 
honoured the offer of £550,000 payment that it made. 
Additionally, the offer of refinancing that K have been able to provide, which was for 
£455,000, is less than the balance that K should correctly have had outstanding at that time - 
taking NatWests mistakes into account and in consideration of the recalculations and 
reimbursements as described above.
So, while it isnt in dispute that NatWest made errors in regard to the balance outstanding 
which they have since taken corrective action for, K havent been able to present any 
evidence to confirm that they would have been able to clear the lower, correct balance 
amount, even had the option been made available to them to do so.
Im aware that K feel that a further £29,112.06 of interest had been wrongly applied to the 
outstanding balance by NatWest, and that had this further sum been correctly removed that 
the total outstanding amount would have been below £455,000, and thus K would have been 
able to proceed with the refinancing from the third-party that they had arranged.
But it seems clear from NatWests explanation surrounding this amount, as per a letter dated 
6 November 2012, that this £29,112.06 is a legitimate interest charge. As per the following:
An interest rate of 1% was applied ... between 9 July 2009 and 11 October 2012. ... 
the correct interest rate applied should have been 3% and therefore the bank has 
undercharged you 2% during this period. 
We have now undertaken calculations showing the difference between the rate that 
should have been charged and the rate that has been charged ... and the difference 
is £29,112.06.
Im aware that K feel that NatWests rejection of its £550,000 is against the Court established 
equity of redemption rights, which K feel give borrowers such as themselves the right to 
recover ownership of a property used as security on full repayment of the secured debt.
But NatWest never received an offer that was supported by supporting documents, and such 
documents havent been provided by K to this service either. It also must be noted that this 
service isnt a Court of Law, and so it isnt within my remit to comment on whether NatWest 
have or havent acted lawfully. 
As explained previously, our remit is based on fairness of outcome, and in my view, for the 
reasons outlined above, NatWest wasnt acting unfairly or unreasonably in rejecting the offer 
from K and seeking to recover its security by other means.K have stated that because NatWest were receiving rent from the property through the 
receiver that the forced sale of the property wasnt needed. And K have also stated that the 
property was sold at a lower value that should reasonably have been the case. 
But the receivers have confirmed that they werent receiving any rent on the property during 
the time that they were instructed to sell it. And given that the sale of the property was 
undertaken by the receivers, and not by NatWest, the sale price obtained by the receivers 
isnt something that I would consider holding NatWest directly accountable for.
Finally, Im aware that K feels that NatWests mistakes in how much it charged K were 
directly responsible for K not being able to meet the payments that were required on the 
borrowings, and K have referred to statements for the lending accounts provided to this 
service by it to corroborate this point. 
However, the statements that K have provided dont cover the beginning of the period for 
which K wasnt making payments towards one or more of the borrowing facilities, and so I 
dont feel that they provide the corroboration of Ks point as K contends here. Additionally, 
given the length of time that K didnt make any payments towards one or more of the 
accounts, I dont feel that it can be reasonably hypothesised that K wouldnt have accrued 
any arrears on its accounts had the overcharging on the accounts not taken place.
All of which means that I dont feel that NatWest have done anything wrong here that it 
hasnt already taken corrective action for. And it follows that I wont be upholding these 
aspects of Ks complaint.
The action of NatWest was Unlawful Collateral Advantage. NatWest unlawfully prevented K 
from its equitable right of redeeming its property due to obstacles that NatWest unjustly 
created that are void.
K contend that NatWest unfairly attached the unsecured loan and overdraft to the secured 
loan. K further contend that this means that when NatWest used the proceeds from the sale 
of the property held as security for the secured loan to reduce the unsecured borrowing as 
well as the secured, that NatWest were acting unlawfully.
Again, I must note that this service isnt a Court of Law, and that our remit is based on that of 
fairness of outcome. But given that the proceeds from the sale of the property (£380,000) 
were less than the outstanding debt remaining on the secured loan at that time (£480,000) 
its difficult to see how any portion of those sale proceeds were used by NatWest to reduce 
the unsecured portion of Ks total outstanding debt.
Additionally, its also notable that the loan agreement for the £50,000 unsecured loan 
includes the following term:
The loan will be secured by any security held by the Bank for the Customers 
liabilities, except a charge on a residential property.
Finally, in regard to the obstacles that K contend NatWest brought forwards  which K refer 
to as clogs in their correspondence with this service  K appears to be referring here 
NatWests unwillingness to accept the offer from K to settle the borrowing in 2013, as 
discussed in the section immediately above.
However, as also discussed in the section above, I dont feel that NatWest were under any 
fair or reasonable compulsion to accept that offer, which would have involved the writing off 
of unpaid debt by NatWest which Im satisfied NatWest werent obliged to accept.Accordingly, I dont feel that NatWest have acted unfairly towards K as K maintain here, and 
it follows that I wont be upholding this aspect of Ks complaint.
NatWest severed its relationship with K and refused to carry our any further business with K. 
This included NatWest failing to provide K with a full record of statements prior to January 
2013.
In a letter to NatWest dated 5 August 2013, K said that NatWest hadnt produced historical 
itemised statements for the borrowing facilities and confirmed that until these statements 
were received, so that K could reconcile that amount that NatWest were demanding in 
regard to the debt, that K wasnt willing to accept the amount that NatWest said was owed.
I can appreciate Ks position here, especially given the later recalculations and 
reimbursements made by NatWest which confirmed Ks suspicions that NatWest were 
demanding an incorrect total amount.
It isnt in dispute that K owed a sizeable amount of money to NatWest  the dispute is rather 
how much money K owed. As such, its difficult to reasonably justify Ks position to not make 
any payment towards one or more of the facilities for an extended period of time. Indeed, 
had it been the case that K had made arrangements to repay what it felt it owed, and had 
provided clear explanatory evidence to NatWest as to why it felt it only owed that amount, 
then I may well have viewed Ks position here very differently.  
But K didnt take that course of action, at least not to the degree I feel NatWest were 
reasonably compelled to accept (as discussed in the preceding sections), and I dont feel a 
failure to provide full statements by NatWest does provide K with a fair reason to not make 
repayments or continue to seek to find a way forward that was agreeable to all parties. 
Additionally, while I can appreciate how K would be aggrieved that NatWest chose to sever 
its relationship with K, such a decision is at the discretion of NatWest to make. In this 
instance, its clear that NatWest felt that there had been a breakdown of trust between K and 
itself such that it was no longer willing to do business with K. This seems understandable to 
me, given the circumstances of this complaint, and I dont feel it was an unfair or 
unreasonable course of action for NatWest to have taken.
Additional Points Raised by K
Im aware that K feels that NatWest didnt respond in a timely manner to Ks giving notice to 
NatWest that it wished to complain. However, this service  the Financial Ombudsman 
Service  only has a remit to consider complaints about regulated financial activities. And 
complaints about how a business has handled a complaint (even a complaint about a 
regulated financial activity) isnt itself a complaint about a regulated financial activity, and so 
isnt a complaint that its within the remit of this service to consider. In short, this service cant 
consider a complaint about how a business has dealt with a complaint.
Finally, its my understanding that K believe that NatWest dont have legal grounds to pursue 
it for unpaid amounts. NatWest have confirmed that its satisfied that it continues to have 
legal grounds contrary to Ks belief, and explain that the relevant Act in this instance is 
s20(1) Limitation Act 1980, whereby limitation will expire twelve years after the date of 
demand. However, as explained previously, this service isnt a Court of Law, and so it isnt 
within the remit of this service for me to make any kind of determination on this point.
All of which means that, in consideration of all of Ks complaint points, while I can appreciate 
Ks position on a number of points, and while I acknowledge that NatWest did make historical errors in how it calculated the balance due on Ks accounts for which it has since 
taken corrective action, I dont feel that NatWest have acted unfairly or unreasonably 
towards K here in the context of Ks complaint as K believes is the case, for the reasons 
explained above.
I realise this wont be the outcome that K was wanting, but it follows that I wont be upholding 
this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action at this time.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask K to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2022.
