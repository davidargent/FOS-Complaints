The complaint
A company, which Ill refer to as B, are unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) forced them into unnecessary borrowing and forced them to sell some of their 
property assets. 
B also feels that they were charged unnecessary arrangement and exit fees, totalling 
approximately £18,000, and that they suffered consequential financial losses of around 
£200,000 as a result of the actions of NatWest
B are unhappy that NatWest changed their Relationship Manager on numerous occasions, 
and finally they feel that the health of one of their directors was directly affected by the 
events that took place and how they were managed.
What happened
In May 2005, B took out a land loan of £140,000 and a development loan of £160,000 from 
NatWest in order to fund a property purchase which entailed the development of five 
residential apartments (Development A). 
In June 2006, B took out a land loan for another development (Development B). This 
development also consisted of five apartments and was expected to be completed in March 
2008. Bs directors provided joint and several personal guarantees of £70,000 in relation to 
this land loan for Development B.
In November 2006, B notified NatWest that it had used £16,500 of the Development A loan 
to refurbish a property owned by one of the directors. B also informed NatWest that 
Development A had incurred unanticipated build costs and a short-term loan of £53,000 was 
agreed with NatWest to assist with finishing Development A.
Development A was finished in March 2007. However, further costs of £33,000 were 
incurred in bringing the development to completion. Bs overdraft limit was increased to 
£68,000, but this was reduced in September 2007, when B were able to sell two more of the 
apartments at Development A, which helped clear the excess overdraft and reduce the land 
loan for Development A. NatWest then provided the directors of B with a short-term overdraft 
of £42,750 to enable them to purchase the remaining two apartments at Development A on 
buy to let mortgages - at a cost lower than the apartment valuation amounts.
Following this, B signed a new interest only loan agreement to refinance all their existing 
indebtedness. This was due to be repaid by the end of March. By January 2008, the 
Development A loan facilities had been fully repaid and Development B was on track to be 
completed by March 2008. But cost overrun on Development B meant that NatWest had to 
increase the development funding for Development B and so renewed the existing loan 
facility and extended the repayment deadline until the end of July 2008. However, B couldnt 
meet this deadline and the loan was extended by NatWest until end of October 2008. 
B then approached NatWest and requested another loan to purchase and renovate a new 
property (Development C). NatWest provided a new loan for £305,000 in February 2008, 
with repayment scheduled for the end of March 2009. As per the previous agreements, the 
loan was interest only and was to be settled from the sale proceeds of the property.
Following the 2008 property market crash, B found themselves in a difficult position. In 2009, 
three of the apartments at Development B were being rented as they couldnt be sold. B 
found itself unable to make interest payments due on the loans. And the potential value of 
Development C had dropped. NatWest extended all of Bs facilities by 12 months and 
agreed a £4,000 overdraft to cover Bs September 2009 interest payment. Unfortunately, Bs 
bank account never returned to credit and the following due interest payment went unpaid.
B continued to struggle and in 2010 exceeded its £40,000 overdraft limit. B also needed 
another £40,000 to complete Development C to enable the property to go on the market as 
soon as possible  although subsequent further delays put back the time that Development 
C could be marketed for sale. 
Around this time, NatWest became concerned that B wasnt making any reduction to its 
existing debt. So, in January 2011, NatWest suggest to B to put the properties up for 
auction. Bs directors considered purchasing the three apartments at Development B, which 
remained unsold, on a buy to let basis. To facilitate this, NatWest extended the loan 
agreements on Development B and Development C for a further six months, with the 
renewal and exit fees for the loans being added to the existing accrued unpaid fees.
By October 2011, B sold two plots at Development C and reduced the balance of the loan. In 
February 2012, NatWest agreed to consolidate the loans for Development B and 
Development C into a new agreement for £377,000. This loan was due to be repaid by the 
end of September 2012 from the sale of assets or through external refinancing. However, 
when the loan because due in September 2012, B were unable to pay it.
Bs situation changed in 2013, with rental leases acquired on the three remaining apartments 
at Development B and the sale of Development C. NatWest offered B a new loan of 
£256,774, comprised of the existing debt of £216,769 as well as accrued fees of £40,004. At 
this point, B attempted to refinance the loan externally but were unable to find a suitable 
facility and so accepted NatWests offer. NatWest later agreed to a short-term extension of 
the loan facility until December 2014, allowing B another opportunity to look for alternative 
repayment options. But again, when the loan because due, B were unable to repay it.
In March 2015, B requested a deferment from NatWest until the end of April 2015 to allow 
more time to explore refinancing options or to place properties on the market for sale. 
NatWest agreed to the request. B then engaged the services of a broker who were able to 
secure finance from a third party which completed in December 2015. This enabled B to 
repay NatWests consolidation loan in full.
In December 2018, B raised a complaint with NatWest on the basis that they felt that 
NatWest had forced B into unnecessary borrowing and had also forced them to sell some of 
the properties. B also felt that NatWest had charged them unnecessary arrangement and 
exit fees on the loan facilities that theyd held, and that NatWests actions had caused B to 
suffer consequential financial losses of around £200,000. B also felt that NatWests actions 
had contributed to the deterioration of one of their directors health.
NatWest looked at Bs complaint, but they were satisfied that they hadnt forced B into 
unnecessary borrowing or forced them to sell any of the properties. NatWest also didnt 
accept that they should be held responsible for the health issues of one of Bs directors, or 
for the consequential financial losses that B claimed. So, they didnt uphold Bs complaint. B werent satisfied with NatWests response, so they referred their complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at Bs complaint, but they also felt that NatWest hadnt 
forced B into taking unnecessary loans or to sell properties, and they didnt feel that NatWest 
could fairly be considered as being responsible for the consequential financial loss or health 
issues of Bs director as B claimed. So, they also didnt uphold Bs complaint.
B remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I find that Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator here, and for 
essentially the same reasons. 
My review of this complaint has focussed on whether I feel that the actions of NatWest are 
fair and reasonable here, given the circumstances, and to assess whether B has been 
unfairly affected or disadvantaged by decisions and actions that NatWest chose to make.
Ultimately, having reviewed the circumstances of this complaint, I dont feel that I can 
reasonably conclude that NatWest have treated B unfairly in relation to any of the complaint 
points that B has raised.
B has stated that they feel that NatWest pressured them into taking unnecessary loans and 
into selling properties developed by B. But the information Ive reviewed doesnt support this 
claim. Indeed, its apparent that on several occasions B was unable to complete its projects 
within budget or on schedule and was unable to repay the loans it had taken from NatWest 
at the time that they became due.
Its also clear to me that NatWest repeatedly gave B loan extensions in order to provide B 
with the opportunity to recover its financial position, if possible, and these extensions totalled 
several years. This demonstrates a high degree of forbearance from NatWest towards B, 
and its difficult for me to censure NatWest for this, especially given that they would have 
been entitled on several occasions to call in Bs debts, as well as the personal guarantees 
provided by Bs directors, but chose not to do so.
Im also unable to find any evidence that NatWest bullied B and compelled them to take 
additional borrowing. Indeed, from what Ive seen it appears that Bs failure to meet the 
terms of previously agreed loans meant that further loans, including consolidation loans, 
were an obvious and legitimate option and helped facilitate B to continue operating as a 
business. I also note that there were instances where B attempted to source alternative 
refinancing options but were unable find alternative lenders willing to offer better terms.
Similarly, Im also unable to find evidence that NatWest bullied B and compelled them to sell 
properties. Im aware that there were instances where NatWest suggested to B that the best 
way forward may be to sell properties in order to reduce the amount outstanding on the 
loans and to pay off overdrafts. But such suggestions appear valid considering the historical 
performance of B and what appear to be valid concerns from NatWest that B might struggle 
to repay the loans it had taken, and I havent found anything in the information available to 
me that suggests that NatWest at anytime insisted that a property, or properties, be sold.
In their correspondence with this service, B have expressed that they feel that NatWest were 
only concerned with their own financial gain and didnt give due consideration to the 
continuing plight of B. But the information I have reviewed doesnt support this position. And while it is the case that NatWest were entitled to be concerned about what I can only 
consider as being the very real possibility of financial loss in this instance, given the 
continuing financial struggles of B as previously explained, its clear to me that NatWest 
didnt act to Bs detriment but instead gave B several loan extensions and refinancing 
without which B would most likely have been unable to continue as an ongoing concern.
B have also stated that they feel that NatWest accepted an unfavourable property valuation 
following the property market crash of 2008 and have questioned both the competency of 
the valuer and asked why NatWest didnt seek a second valuation. However, it appears that 
the property valuer in question was a chartered professional, and so I cant see any reason 
why NatWest shouldnt have had faith in the valuation provided. Additionally, if B were 
concerned with the valuation at that time, I consider that it would have been incumbent on 
them to source and provide an alternative valuation and I dont consider that NatWest had 
any cause or reason themselves to do so.
Ive also reviewed Bs claim that they were unfairly charged fees by NatWest totalling 
approximately £18,000. However, having done so, I can see that much of this amount was 
interest, rather than a fee, which was added to the loan when Bs current account had 
insufficient funds to pay it, and so I dont consider this amount to have been applied to Bs 
account unfairly by NatWest.
However, I have reviewed the fees paid by B in general. I can see that the fees that B did 
pay never totalled more than 2.5% of the total borrowing per year, which is within industry 
norms, so Im also satisfied that the fee structure that NatWest applied to Bs account wasnt 
unduly excessive. I also note that the majority of the fees charged to B (totalling 
approximately £40,000) were refunded to B by NatWest under its Automatic Fee Refund 
programme. Because of this I dont consider that B has been charged fees unfairly by 
NatWest and Im satisfied that the fees that B has paid are reasonable, especially 
considering the significant levels of administration that NatWest have historically had to 
undertake as a result of the several loan extensions and refinancing undertaken by B. 
Im also aware that B are unhappy with the number of Relationship Managers that they had 
to interact with during their business relationship with NatWest. I can understand Bs 
frustrations here, and its evident that a total of six Relationship Managers were assigned to 
them at various times. However, Bs business relationship with NatWest lasted over a 
decade, and it isnt unusual for Relationship Managers to change during such a long period. 
Importantly, I cant see anything in the information available to me which suggests that the 
changes of Relationship Manager were driven by anything other than legitimate reasons  
such as illness or staff attrition  and I also cant see anything to suggest that B were 
disadvantaged by the changes in Relationship Mangers in any meaningful way.
Finally, with regard the issue of the health of one of Bs directors - which B have stated 
deteriorated as a direct result of Bs poor and aggressive management of their account - 
while I certainly sympathise with Bs director in question, In light of what I have explained 
above, I dont feel that I can fairly or reasonably conclude that the health issues that the 
director has experienced can or should be attributed to the actions and conduct of NatWest, 
and I must also note that this issue is, in all likelihood, outside the remit of this review  given 
that the complaint here has been brought by B as a company, and not by Bs director. 
Ultimately, Ive been unable to find any evidence which I feel allows me to conclude that 
NatWest acted unfairly or unreasonably toward B in how NatWest managed Bs account 
during the time that B held a business relationship with them. Because of this, I cant 
conclude that NatWest should take any action regarding any of the complaint points that B 
has raised. And, because of this, I also dont consider that NatWest should be held liable for any form of consequential financial loss such as that which B are claiming against NatWest 
in this instance. 
I realise that this wont be the outcome that B was wanting here, but it follows that I wont be 
upholding this complaint or asking NatWest to take any further action at this time. I hope that 
B can understand, given everything Ive explained above, why I have made the final decision 
that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask B to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 August 2021.
