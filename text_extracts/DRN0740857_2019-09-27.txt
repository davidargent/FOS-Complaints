Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that Myjar shouldnt  have 
approved loans 4 to 10. Myjar disagreed with the adjudicators opinion  so the complaint has 
been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Myjar needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Myjar should fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN07408572the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.  Ive decided to uphold Mr Hs 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Mr H didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 3. Because of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So I wont  be making a decision 
about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing  relationship Mr H had with Myjar. So 
they are something  I will take into account  when considering the other loans  he took.
As our adjudicator explained, by loan 4, I think its reasonable to say that Mr H was, more  
likely than not, having longer term problems managing his money. And Myjar shouldve  been 
aware of this. He had taken out three short term loans in quick succession  with very small 
breaks in between. So a pattern  of dependency  was already emerging in respect of his 
lending. 
But for loan 4 Mr H took a much larger amount over a longer period.  By the end of the 
expected term of loan 4 he wouldve been making payments to Myjar for just under a year. 
So I dont  think it was reasonable  for Myjar to have  assumed that Mr H would be in a position  
to make these repayments without  it causing him problems. So I dont think it shouldve 
approved loan 4. So Im upholding Mr Hs complaint about it. 
And Ive looked  at the overall pattern of Myjars lending history with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Myjar should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Myjar  should have realised that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
5. I say this because:
up to loan 5 the amounts Mr H was borrowing had been generally increasing,  and 
going forward  Mr H was provided with a new loan within a very short time of settling 
a previous one. 
Ref: DRN07408573Myjar ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr H was having to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Myjar. Loan  10 was 
taken out over two and half years after Mr Hs first. And it was for a larger  amount. 
Mr H had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Myjar over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out because Myjar continued to provide borrowing from loan four 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Hs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5 to 10 and Myjar should put things right.
putting things right  what Myjar needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 4 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan 4 from Mr Hs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from 5 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  5 to 9 should be removed from Mr Hs 
credit file. Myjar should do this for loan 10 if it is able, but it may not be able to do this 
if the loan is still outstanding. 
If Mr H still owes  Myjar any of the principal balance he borrowed on his final loan Myjar 
should remove all the interest and charges applied to the outstanding balance. Myjar should  
then re-work the account as if all payments made by Mr H went  towards  the principal. But 
importantly, Myjar needs to make sure that Mr H doesnt repay more  than the principal 
amount borrowed.  
If after doing this Mr H hasnt repaid  the principal he borrowed Myjar can deduct  this from the 
remainder of the compensation. If, Mr H has already paid enough to repay the principal  then 
any overpayment should be refunded  to him with 8% simple* interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement
And if Myjar no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Mr H.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Myjar to take off tax from this interest. Myjar must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
Ref: DRN07408574For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Hs complaint.
MYJAR Limited should put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 October  2019
